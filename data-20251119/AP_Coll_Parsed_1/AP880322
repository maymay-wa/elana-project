opposition party leader in foiling a plot to overthrow the 
government and assassinate president samuel doe information 
minister emmanuel bowier said tuesday 
bowier told a news conference seven plotters were still at 
large including an army captain and two sergeants 
he said those arrested included gabriel kpolleh leader of the 
banned liberia unification party party lawyer cephar mbandi and 
four soldiers 
the minister said the plot was uncovered on march 16 he said it 
was a conspiracy to destabilize the government create internal 
strife and overthrow the government by assassinating the president 
of liberia 
bowier said arms ammunition and military uniforms were found in 
a building in the sinkor district of monrovia 
investigations continued but the situation was under control he 
said 
bowier read from a prepared statement and declined to answer 
questions journalists were warned not to run editorial comments or 
cartoons on the plot before the defendants go on trial the 
minister gave no court date 
the unification party on monday released a statement expressing 
concern over the arrests of kpolleh and mbandi it said several 
properties owned by kpolleh and his family were destroyed during 
investigations by security forces and that his wife narrowly 
escaped being raped it did not elaborate 
bowier advised reporters not to believe any press releases 
issued by the unification party saying it was banned and its 
statements had no credibility

the economy declined under the rule of the former army master 
sergeant major western creditors suspended aid to liberia pending 
payment of debts last year the united states sent 17 financial 
experts to monrovia to oversee operations of the finance ministry

president reagan sought tuesday to revive his 
stalled effort to aid the nicaraguan contras and said congressional 
democrats will be to blame if the supplystarved rebels fade from 
existence 
in an hourlong meeting on capitol hill reagan appealed to 
republican house members to unite behind a new effort to push 
through congress some kind of help for the contras whose last us 
aid ran out feb 29 
later speaking at a fundraising reception for the reelection 
campaign of sen chic hecht rnev the president as he has 
before linked last weeks incursion into honduras by troops of 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government to the defeat of his 
request for funds for the rebels 
the logistical preparation for the incursion began just after 
congress voted to reject our package of aid to the democratic 
resistance he said this was a precise and carefully planned 
operation that showed the influence of outside advisers and must 
have required several weeks to plan 
rebel supporters said their chances of prevailing on the 
divisive issue were improved by the incursion which was making 
some moderates nervous about leaving the rebels without aid 
some were quite pale in their appearance when they realized 
there was this incursion said rep trent lott rmiss the 
chief house gop vote counter we think there is some potential 
there to get a few more votes than we had in the past 
one member of the swing group rep buddy mackay dfla 
said he was preparing a compromise aid package and was seeking the 
support of other moderates all we are trying to say is that 
leaving the situation as it is is unacceptable mackay said 
we are determined to get continued assistance to the 
resistance and if we stick together this time well make it 
reagan told the closed meeting with lawmakers according to a text 
of his remarks provided by the white house he declined to offer 
details on what kind of package he was asking for 
alluding to democratic efforts to thwart any military aid for 
the contras reagan added those who led the fight against our 
package of assistance to the democratic resistance cannot escape 
responsibility if the rebel forces wither 
later in a session with localgovernment republican officials 
the president again pointed the finger of blame at house democrats 
the house leadership who played hardball to win the vote to 
cut off aid now says it wont accept responsibility for the 
destruction of the freedom fighters but if the freedom fighters 
are extinguished and communist rule is consolidated in nicaragua 
the american people will be the ones to decide who is 
responsible he contended 
democrats immediately tossed the blame back insisting that it 
was republicans who were responsible for the narrow house defeat of 
a package of strictly humanitarian aid food clothing 
medicine and shelter on march 3 
what were seeing is a public relations campaign here said 
rep tony coelho dcalif the republicans are very nervous about 
it because the fingers pointed right at them 
house speaker jim wright dtexas renewed his offer to vote 
quickly on a package of purely humanitarian aid if republicans will 
ask for discussions but he said any proposal containing military 
equipment would be subject to normal committee review 
the door is open the welcome mat is laid wright said 
the continued wrangling seemed to make the rebels themselves 
despair of any quick action to renew the money flow and they 
released a television advertisement to begin airing this week that 
makes a direct appeal to us viewers for contributions 
your congress abandoned us ernesto palazio a washington 
lobbyist for the rebels says somberly in the spot we have 
nowhere to turn but to individual americans like you 
the spot which asks for money for medicine blankets and food 
for our families and children was to begin running this week in 
washington charlotte nc and fort worth texas wrights home 
town 
a washington postabc news poll of 1007 americans found that 55 
percent of those surveyed opposed reagans dispatch of us troops 
last week to train in honduras and 62 percent thought the troops 
would become involved in the fighting the margin of error was plus 
or minus 4 percentage points 
the poll conducted by telephone interviews thursday through 
monday found that 40 percent of those surveyed favored aid to the 
contras and 56 percent opposed it it was the highest support 
figure since the 43 percent level recorded on july 15 1987 the 
day after former white house aide oliver north testified before 
congress 
the white house has encouraged a bipartisan group of contra 
supporters in the senate who are proposing a oneyear 48 million 
package of nonlethal aid that also would give the cia the right to 
deliver previously stockpiled weapons under that plan the 
president also would have the right to get a quick vote in congress 
on sending new military aid under certain conditions 
mackays version still being drafted would contain a 
compromise on reagans future ability to demand a quick vote in 
contrast with the senate bill mackays would let the president 
trigger an expedited vote but would not let him dictate the kind 
of aid package to be voted on that would be left to normal 
legislative procedures he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters after 
reagans capitol hill visit that the administration has not yet 
aligned itself with any specific bill but would like to have a 
package introduced soon and a vote before congress leaves next week 
on an easter recess 
wed like to have a vote before then fitzwater said 
but house republican leader robert michel of illinois said it 
would be difficult to bring the matter to a vote before the week of 
april 11 when congress returns to session

un mediator diego cordovez spoke tuesday of the 
slow pace of afghanistan peace talks in geneva but cautioned that 
lack of quick movement does not mean a stalemate 
negotiators at the unsponsored talks apparently were waiting 
for new signals from the washington meeting between soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze and secretary of state george p 
shultz 
cordovez met with the afghan delegation for less than 30 minutes 
tuesday and with the pakistani team which speaks for the afghan 
guerrillas for more than an hour he later spoke briefly to 
reporters admitting that there was very slow progress but that 
it should not be confused with a deadlock 
there was a shortlived rumor that the afghans led by foreign 
minister abdul wakil were preparing to leave geneva wednesday but 
a pakistani negotiator who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the talks would proceed on schedule 
wakil said earlier there was no reason for suspending the talks 
pakistans chief representative acting foreign minister zain 
noorani has said pakistan was prepared to stay in geneva as long 
as it takes to conclude a peace settlement 
the talks are stalling over the question of what afghan 
government should oversee implementation of the settlement and over 
future soviet military aid to kabul 
the united states demands that soviet assistance cease at the 
same time as us aid to the antimarxist guerrillas fighting the 
sovietbacked kabul government moscow has rejected this as 
interference in relations between two sovereign states 
attention now centers on the discussions in washington a 
pakistani source said 
noorani said last week that the superpowers may at least find 
it easier to settle among themselves the aid issue 
the soviet union intervened militarily in afghanistan at the end 
of 1979 to support the government in its fight against the islamic 
guerrillas approximately 115000 soviet troops are still there 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev says he wants to withdraw the 
soviet troops from afghanistan this year if agreement can be 
reached at geneva

a military prosecutor on tuesday jailed 
francisco herreros director of the leftist magazine cauce for 
purportedly defaming chiles armed forces in an editorial a 
magazine spokesman reported 
herreros was taken to santiagos main prison after being 
questioned by prosecutor luis acevedo according to alvaro briones 
a senior cauce editor 
under chiles military government the armed forces codes 
empower prosecutors to indict and jail civilians brought before 
military courts 
the editorial written by herreros and published by cauce in june 
1987 criticized the influence given to the military courts in 
recent years 
according to lawyers and human rights activists more than 90 
percent of those tried by military courts in the last five years 
were civilians including a number of journalists 
acevedo has five days to file formal charges against herreros or 
release him according to the military code 
the suit against herreros was started by the army 
chile has been ruled by the armed forces since a coup ousted the 
elected government of marxist president salvador allende in

the destruction of millions of acres of 
tropical jungles each year by peasant farmers and others is a 
problem for the developed nations as well as the third world and 
requires economic and educational solutions say scientists at a 
leading plant research institution 
the missouri botanical garden known for its manmade tropical 
atmosphere in the socalled climatron designed by buckminster 
fuller is working to halt the decimation of the worlds real 
tropical jungles 
the outlook is pretty grim said biologist peter h raven 
director of the garden although tropical forests once covered at 
least 12 percent of the globe an area about twice the size of 
europe they have already been reduced to about half that 
currently the forests are being cleared or degraded at the 
rate of about 60 million acres a year thats an area about half 
the size of california 
raven said roughly half of all known plant and animal species on 
earth are found in the tropical forests at the current rate of 
destruction as many as 60000 species of plants will be extinct by 
the year 2020 
the plantrich tropics supply man with a wealth of food crops 
medicines and other useful products said dr enrique forero 
director of research at the garden but they are being destroyed 
rapidly 
the chief culprits forero said are loggers and slashandburn 
peasant farmers the loggers obviously need the trees to stay in 
business and the farmers often have to destroy the forests to feed 
themselves and their families 
and the scientists say the situation can only get worse unless 
something is done to stop it 
at present over half the people in the world live in 
countries that are at least partly tropical excluding china 
forero said nearly a third of these people are already living in 
extreme poverty and with current rates of growth the human 
population of these countries will double in less than 30 years 
how can you tell these starving people that you are going to 
save the very things they have to destroy in order to sustain their 
already meager existence asked raven education and political 
and economic stability are obviously the keys that and 
understanding 
which is why raven said the garden has committed itself to an 
allout effort to explore document and save the forests 
with a staff of 70 researchers and technicians including many 
who live permanently in the tropics the garden makes up one of the 
worlds largest active field research programs in tropical botany 
the goals the scientists said are to collect the plant species 
before they become extinct and to teach the impoverished farmers 
how to live in the forest without destroying it 
with the growing knowledge of genetics they said it is 
important that the genes the biological blueprints of the 
endangered species be saved 
to lose this genetic capital through massive extinctions just 
as we are developing our capabilities to explore its potential 
would indeed be a tragedy raven said the developments in 
genetics make the specter of extinction even worse raven said 
for each species of plant or animal lost to extinction youre 
losing the potential for another 20000 to 30000 variants in the 
future 
many of the plants scientists say could almost certainly be 
developed into cheaper easytogrow sources of highly nutritious 
food others could be converted into abundant sources of new 
medicines 
another important part of the gardens program is to lend 
technical assistance to and train scientists from developing 
tropical countries through cooperative agreements 
unfortunately only 6 percent of the scientists working on the 
problem live in the countries involved raven said we must 
change that momentum to implement the innovative conservation and 
development strategies needed to deal with these urgent problems 
ultimately must come from the affected countries themselves 
raven said 
the backbone of the gardens research the scientists said is 
its herbarium or plant collection along with the new york 
botanical garden and the smithsonian institution the missouri 
herbarium is one of the three largest in the united states and 
among the 12 largest in the world 
started by garden founder henry shaw in the 1850s the missouri 
herbarium now contains samples of more than 35 million species and 
is expected to expand to 45 million within the next decade 
pointing to a large map showing the locations of the gardens 
researchers in central and south america and africa raven said of 
the encroachment on the forests it wont be stopped soon 
but there are encouraging signs what people have to learn is 
that conservation and development are really two sides of the same 
coin 
producers and consumers have to learn that they have a common 
problem it can all be done but it wont be easy

an old generation is remembering the vietnam war 
and a new generation is curious stirring a revival of the 
controversial era in books and movies now comes a new publication 
a slick magazine simply named vietnam whose premiere issue went on 
sale today 
our timing could not have been better because right now look 
at all the vietnam movies that have come out said publisher 
gregg r oehler in a telephone interview from leesburg va where 
the magazine is published by empire press look at all the major 
emphasis now on video on books its vietnam everyone now is 
talking about vietnam 
oehler said 150000 copies of the first issue were printed 
including 50000 for subscribers and 100000 for newsstand sales 
across the united states and in 16 other countries the magazine a 
quarterly sells for 295 a copy on newsstands and for 995 for 
the four issues by subscription 
oehler said the response has been so overwhelming from 
wholesalers subscribers and the media that the magazine will 
probably go to six issues a year in 1989 many of the subscribers 
are vietnam veterans a large number of them in prison 
ive gotten hundreds of letters from vietnam veterans in 
prison said oehler theyre so happy to hear that a magazine 
is coming out 
each issue will run 68 pages with a regular format of four 
feature stories and six departments including editorial fighting 
forces bases and installations arsenal and book reviews 
the initial issue includes an interview with gen fred c 
weyand americas last military commander in vietnam and a story 
on tan son nhut air base the command center for americas forces 
in vietnam which was called the pentagon east it also includes 
32 pages of color photographs and maps the cover shows two 
soldiers defending their post with a machine gun 
in the editorial in the premiere issue the editor retired col 
harry g summers jr explains the goal of the magazine 
thirtyeight years after american involvement in vietnam 
began 15 years after the withdrawal of all us military forces 
there and 13 years after the fall of saigon the war there truly 
remains an enigma the goal we here at vietnam magazine have set 
for ourselves is to find the key to unlock that enigma 
in an interview summers said that in visits to colleges he has 
found great interest in vietnam among young people who want to know 
what really happened there he said there seems to be a 
misunderstanding of the war especially among this generation many 
of whom were not even born when american soldiers were pouring into 
vietnam in 1965 
there is the perception that the united states was defeated by 
a guerrilla army he said thats not true the american 
military withdrew from vietnam 2 years before the fall of saigon 
the north vietnamese did not defeat the american military when they 
seized saigon for a very simple reason there was no american 
military there to defeat one of our objectives is to refute some 
of the myths 
summers 56 is widely known and respected as an authority on 
military affairs he served in both the korean and vietnam wars 
he is a columnist for the los angeles times syndicate a 
contributing editor for usnews amp world report and the author of 
two books including the widely acclaimed on strategy a critical 
analysis of the vietnam war 
the magazines editorial review board includes gen william c 
westmoreland former commander of us forces in vietnam and 
authors stanley karnow and al santoli both of whom have written 
books on vietnam 
asked if the presence of westmoreland and other former vietnam 
officers on the board will leave the impression that the magazine 
will give only the official view one that was often discredited 
during the war summers said 
weve tried to get the voices as diverse as possible i dont 
think stanley karnows an apologist for the war i dont think im 
an apologist for the war certainly my book was very critical of 
the war and so was al santoli

ben midgette bends and removes spikes from 
railroad ties and rod korthals blows smoke through a scalemodel 
hog house 
they are among 3000 scientists administrators and graduate 
assistants on staff at the university of illinois agricultural 
experiment station which celebrated its 100th anniversary monday 
but the center one of 66 in the country is about more than 
agriculture 
ive yet to see one person who didnt think there were 
exciting things going on here said station director donald holt 
one thing is clear research is crucial to the future of 
american agriculture and our society in general 
in one laboratory midgette compared the strength of railroad 
ties made from different woods looking for the longestlasting 
material an african oak was so hard that it caused a bolt to break 
in a machine that measures the force required to pull out a spike 
it snapped and went straight up said midgette who figures 
this african oak will outlast conventional ties weve got 
indentations in the ceiling 
korthals pumped smoke into the clear plastic model of a hog 
house to demonstrate how the air moves through the building with 
various ventilation systems he said it should help farmers select 
the most efficient design for their own swine buildings 
the 320 research projects funded by the station last year 
involved subjects such as agricultural economics veterinary 
medicine home economics and food science 
the center has a 25 million budget from state and federal

the murderous rampages that left five people dead 
at two belfast funerals last week have aroused fears that northern 
ireland is sliding into a new cycle of violence after several years 
of relative calm 
in the past month 15 people have died twice the 1987 monthly 
average the dead include three irish republican army guerrillas 
gunned down in gibraltar on march 6 in the incident that touched 
off the latest mayhem in belfast 
a firm grip will be required to halt the slide of the province 
toward still further bloodshed and anarchy the news letter a 
belfast newspaper warned monday 
there is no time to lose said the belfast telegraph if 
there is a political vacuum and there is the initiative will 
always seem to be with the paramilitaries 
there wont be anarchy and there wont even be a return to the 
level of violence in the early 1970s when 700 people died in a 
year paul bew a political science professor at queens 
university in belfast said in an interview 
but the graph is starting to go up up up he said 
with police talking of about 30 suspects in saturdays violence 
roman catholic areas of belfast are bracing for a wave of arrests 
that could provoke further clashes 
ever since the irish republican armys struggle to drive britain 
out of northern ireland climaxed with the death of 10 hunger 
striking prisoners in 1981 the province seemed to be lapsing into 
relative calm the death toll was dropping steadily and there even 
were signs of economic rejuvenation 
the ira having narrowly failed to assassinate prime minister 
margaret thatcher with a bomb in 1984 was suffering repeated 
military and political setbacks the angloirish agreement of 
november 1985 which gave dublin a say in the running of northern 
ireland was bolstering catholic moderates against ira radicals 
the killing of the three guerrillas allegedly as they were 
plotting a car bombing in gibraltar was portrayed by britain as a 
triumph for its antiterrorism strategy 
but the fact that the guerrillas were unarmed outraged many 
catholics as well as the irish government that reaction in turn 
angered many protestants who believed that the ira got what it 
deserved 
as the three were being buried protestant michael stone emerged 
from behind a tombstone lobbing grenades and firing into the 
mourners three died and 68 were wounded 
three days later at the funeral of one of the cemetery victims 
a car sped toward the cortege the mourners keyed up and fearful 
of another protestant attack pounced on it 
when they realized the occupants were two british soldiers they 
dragged them out beat them with iron bars and stripped them the 
two men were then hauled away and shot dead by ira gunmen 
the two episodes revealed the hatred that can still erupt from a 
protestant majority that regards itself as being under siege and 
from a catholic minority for whom gibraltar proves there is no 
british justice in northern ireland 
the incidents all but obscured four other deaths since 
gibraltar a policeman an ira man and two civilians a protestant 
woman and a catholic man 
in the context of a conflict that has claimed 2638 lives since 
1969 those four would be regarded as par for ulsters grisly 
course the funeral deaths however were graphically captured by 
tv cameras and they stunned and disgusted irish and british 
citizens alike 
scum of the earth stormed the sun a london daily in 
dublin the irish press lamented this was the shocking face of 
ireland 88 
many catholics reacted to saturdays killings with shock and 
disgust making no attempt to excuse them as a response to the 
previous cemetery bloodbath the irish news a catholic daily 
called it a satanic rejection of the christian faith 
the initial reaction is shock that something so barbarous 
could happen said dan keenan spokesman for the social 
democratic and labor party northern irelands moderate mainstream 
catholic party

don hewitt who marks his 40th anniversary with 
cbs news today recalls that he landed his first job at the network 
after a friend suggested his experience at a newsphoto service 
might come in handy 
i said what does cbs want with picture experience radio 
doesnt need any pictures he said no television i said 
whatavision 
today the 65yearold outspoken creator and executive producer 
of 60 minutes is looking beyond current television technology 
foreseeing a time when networks are superfluous and television news 
is beamed directly into subscribers homes 
hewitt began his career as associate director and later producer 
of the networks first television newscast douglas edwards with 
the news and later the cbs evening news with walter cronkite 
he remembers covering the coronation of queen elizabeth ii with 
edward r murrow and flying back to the united states aboard a 
chartered airliner editing the kinescope that viewers would see on 
the news no videotapes no satellite transmissions 
i didnt think there was ever going to be satellites bounce 
signals off a star are you crazy he said laughing but 
hewitt who considered buying cbs news a few years ago thinks its 
feasible to one day broadcast news directly to homes news services 
already are beaming footage to local television stations so 
hewitts idea is not so farfetched 
i think that the network news departments they might not even 
work for a network 10 years from now he said there might not 
be any networks because it may be an outmoded delivery system 
im not sure you dont have a large newsroom somewhere and you 
just have direct broadcast feeding news into peoples homes 
for a price same way they pay for a newspaper 
he also foresees delivering newspapers into home printers by 
satellite 
i think about it more than most people as you can see and i 
wonder how long the networks in their present form will be 
around he said 
some other samples of hewitts opinions 
60 minutes ive always said all we do in this broadcast 
is shine lights on people in dark corners and if people in dark 
corners are doing things they shouldnt be doing all we did was 
turn the light on 
the importance of pictures on television the accepted wisdom 
in television was always you put words to pictures i dont believe 
that you put pictures to words you start with the words the 
audio is always more important to me than the video 
televised presidential debates hewitt produced the famous 1960 
meeting of richard nixon and john f kennedy its still a 
terrible format and we shouldnt be doing them they should have 
real debates the republican candidate and democratic candidate 
should head up a team of two or three debaters who are really good 
and can really crossexamine the other side and give them a hard 
time and they ought to do it in front of a joint session of 
congress and it will produce something other than this sterile 
show where what it is is a joint press conference not really a 
debate 
this years election i dont think theres enough caffeine 
in america to keep the electorate awake during a dukakisbush 
campaign 
politicians i dont put politicians on the air if i can help 
it because i instinctively dont believe them i believe theyre 
only interested in getting themselves elected and they only say 
what they think will get themselves elected 
ratings no matter what i think about ratings and whether 
theyre accurate and everything i dont say anything because 
theyve been awfully good to me 
the future i know where ill be in nine years im going to 
be here my contract isnt up until im 74 ironclad nobody gets 
out now the question is will there be a cbs i think so some 
form maybe not this form

the supreme court is considering whether 
abused children should have the right to sue public officials for 
failing to protect them from their parents 
but the justices have decided to avoid another childrens rights 
issue whether public school students enjoy any constitutional 
protection against paddling or other corporal punishment by 
teachers and administrators 
the court announced monday that it will tackle the parental 
abuse issue in the case of a wisconsin boy joshua deshaney who 
suffered serious and permanent brain damage from beatings by his 
father 
the boys suit accuses social workers and officials of gross 
negligence in ignoring evidence that he was being brutally 
victimized a lower court threw out the suit 
a high court ruling is not expected until 1989 on whether to 
revive the suit against the winnebago county wis department of 
social services and two of its employees 
the agency was accused of violating the rights of joshua by 
failing to rescue him from his fathers beatings even though it 
allegedly had known about the abuse since 1983 when the child was 
4 years old 
joshua has been institutionalized since 1984 suffering from 
injuries that destroyed half his brain and left him profoundly 
retarded 
the boys father randy deshaney since has been convicted of 
child abuse and sentenced to two to four years in prison 
deshaneys exwife melody sued the social services officials 
on grounds they violated the childs constitutional right not to be 
deprived of liberty without due process 
mrs deshaney was divorced from her husband and living in 
cheyenne wyo when she was informed her son had suffered serious 
brain damage deshaney had custody of his son 
the 7th us circuit court of appeals in throwing out mrs 
deshaneys suit said the social welfare agency and its employees 
though blameworthy did not cause joshuas injuries but 
merely failed to protect him from his bestial father 
the appeals court also said welfare agencies should not be 
placed in the predicament of removing a child from home and facing 
suit by the parent or leaving the child there and risk being sued 
by the child 
putting officials in that position is unlikely to improve the 
welfare of american families and is not grounded in constitutional 
text or principle the appeals court said 
in the paddling case the court without comment let stand a 
federal appeals court ruling in a new mexico case that at some 
degree of excessiveness or cruelty such punishment violates 
constitutional rights 
another appeals court has rejected that view clouding the 
picture 
the high court in 1977 ruled that such disciplinary measures 
never can amount to the cruel and unusual punishment banned by 
the constitutions eighth amendment 
the decision barred students from suing teachers and school 
administrators in federal court over alleged eighth amendment 
violations but left them free to sue in state courts under state 
laws 
in the 1977 decision however the court said it had not 
considered whether corporal punishment can violate substantive 
rights under the 14th amendments due process clause 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals last april cleared the 
way for a trial in teresa garcias federal lawsuit against penasco 
nm school officials over two paddlings she received in 
elementary school 
the appeals court said the kind of punishment alleged in the 
lawsuit can sustain a federal lawsuit even if a lawsuit could have 
been filed in state court 
in other developments the court 
agreed to consider killing a key provision of a law designed to 
promote competitive bidding on government contracts at issue is 
the proper boundary between presidential and congressional power 
agreed to decide in a case from texas whether states may impose 
sales taxes on most books newspapers and magazines while exempting 
religious publications

as a capital institution leaking confidential 
information to the press has a rich heritage and long roots 
those roots may be longer than one might think 
the news leak in fact may stretch back to thomas jefferson or 
at least his political allies 
that possibility was made clear last week as the senate was 
reminded that the day marked the 188th anniversary march 18 1800 
of the issuing of the very first contempt of congress citation 
thomas duane editor of the philadelphia aurora was cited for 
contempt for having failed to appear as ordered to explain how he 
had obtained the text of a controversial but secret senate bill and 
caused it to be published 
the senate in that era still met in secret and all of its 
deliberations were held to be private not public matters 
according to senate republican leader bob dole of kansas and 
senate historians the secret bill was the product of the senates 
federalist majority and concerned a bid to change the method of 
settling disputes over presidential electors 
jefferson was vice president and leader of the 
democraticrepublican party his supporters feared a plot to deny 
him the presidency in the upcoming elections 
so dole said jeffersons allies in the senate leaked a copy 
of the bill to william duane 
offended federalists demanded an investigation of duane and 
his illicit sources dole said 
vice president jefferson as the senates presiding officer was 
directed to read duane a list of prepared questions about who had 
given him the bill he said 
duane asked for additional time to seek counsel a request 
jefferson quickly granted 
that was the last the senate saw of william duane dole 
recounted when he failed to reappear the senate issued a 
contempt citation in his name duane hid out through the remainder 
of the congressional session 
when the new congress convened the situation had changed 
jefferson had won the white house and his party had captured 
majorities in both the senate and house 
needless to say said dole the new senate majority had no 
intention of pursuing charges of contempt against william duane 
the first congressional investigation of a news leak was quietly 
shelved

rep peter rodino dnj sifted through 40 years of memories 
last week after announcing he will end his congressional career at 
the end of the year 
rodino the chairman of the house judiciary committee presided 
over the hearings which on july 24 1974 resulted in a vote to 
impeach president richard m nixon 
within days nixon resigned his office 
a decade later on may 30 1984 rodino was en route from the 
capital to his home in newark nj 
rodino is such a frequent flier on that route that the airlines 
as a matter of courtesy customarily assigned him a seat in the 
second row of the aircraft so that he could board and depart easily 
and quickly 
but on the day in question chairman rodino got bumped to the 
rear of the plane 
who had the clout to oust rodino from his accustomed seat 
former president richard nixons the one 
nixon also had a home in new jersey and was traveling with his 
secret service bodyguards the entire group got the 
frontoftheplane seats 
the two men didnt talk 
i didnt even see his face rodino recalled i saw the

as struggling democratic presidential 
hopeful richard gephardt was wooing workers at a giant steel mill 
here with his tradeandpopulism message one of them handed him a 
button that read survival 
the button referred to saving mclouth steel through employee 
ownership but it also aptly summed up gephardts political goal in 
michigan 
without a win here it could be all over for the missouri 
congressman but he hopes workers like the ones he campaigned among 
monday will keep his bid alive 
if we dont do well here obviously we arent going to be able 
to continue the race gephardt said in lansing on march 10 
brushing aside questions about his future if he loses gephardt 
said over and over again monday im going to do well in 
michigan asked if he would run for reelection to his house seat 
if he loses saturday he declared im going to win 
i imagine he does have to win said frank kelley michigan 
attorney general and chairman of gephardts effort in the state 
but he was quick to say winning might not mean coming in first 
kelley said jesse jackson who has strong black support in detroit 
and its suburbs could be first he said gephardt must beat 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis the frontrunner in delegates 
if gephardt beats dukakis his campaign is revived kelley 
said 
but the polls do not support that prospect 
a survey conducted march 1517 for the detroit news gave dukakis 
and jackson the lead with gephardt far behind dukakis had 33 
percent and jackson 31 percent gephardt had 10 percent with the 
rest of the field trailing 
gephardt said the polls do not tap the caucusgoers accurately 
as the campaign expects only 100000 to 150000 democrats to 
attend a small fraction of the party faithful 
i think a lot of people will be surprised by how well he does 
here said chick mahoney owner of chicks rooster lounge south 
of detroit where gephardt campaigned monday but its going to 
be tough 
to turn the poll findings on their head gephardt has a message 
with a great deal of appeal in this state still shuddering from the 
massive changes in the auto and steel industries facing foreign 
competition 
he denunciation of foreign trade practices epitomized by his 
rhetoric and ad saying a 10000 chrysler kcar costs 48000 in 
south korea draws big applause from blue collar crowds at the 
mclouth mill and at chicks on monday that line drew big cheers 
hes the only one to take a stand on trade a strong one 
said jim hindman outside the mclouth mill south of detroit 
some of the people here were out of work for 4 years 
added ray ridings thats why we like gephardt 
gephardt is short of time and money to get his message out 
kelley said the campaign has promised to spend between 300000 and 
500000 on ads in the state one campaign aide who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said as fast the money comes in we spend 
it 
a key to gephardts victory is what the union leadership does in 
the state 
the united auto workers have not endorsed anyone nationally 
although their state affiliate in iowa played a major role in his 
victory in iowa 
that means gephardt is trying to pick up support local by local 
and district by district at the mclouth plant he won the backing 
of district director harry lester and frank baker a united steel 
workers local 2659 official said many members will follow the 
district leaders suggestion 
that backing must be repeated over and over again across the 
state for gephardt to win for this caucus is not a simple process 
the voting does not take place in the usual precincts across the 
state but in 567 locations that may not be familiar to the voters 
that puts a premium on organization which has been the trademark 
of dukakis effort this far 
gephardts hyundai ad which worked so well in iowa and south 
dakota has come in for criticism in this state where autos are the 
economy 
gephardt brushed aside suggestions the ad is inaccurate in its 
claim that the 10000 chrysler car would cost 48000 in south 
korea and he got some help in that from chrysler corp chairman 
lee iacocca with whom he met on monday in highland park 
asked if the gephardt ads figure was correct iacocca said 
gephardt has the point correct whatever the details 
damn close to it maybe its only 3540000 but dont lose 
sight of it its still a big difference between 7000 here for a 
comparable car iacocca said to reporters outside the chrysler 
corp headquarters 
gephardt said he was responding to a story in mondays editions 
of the detroit free press saying a kcar would cost about 33000 
in korea and that none is sold there and gephardt in an interview 
with the detroit news conceded that many of those taxes are levied 
in korea on domestic consumption

banning reporters and photographers from the 
west bank and the gaza strip could prove to be a public relations 
blunder for israel and might not be effective anyway several media 
observers say 
larry gross a professor at the annenberg school of 
communications at the university of pennsylvania said it would be 
bad policy for israel to impose more restrictions on reporters 
covering unrest in the occupied territories 
it would be a public relations risk one i hope they dont 
take gross said he said israel could jeopardize its reputation 
as the only true democracy in the middle east which us officials 
cite in providing millions of dollars to the country each year 
but the israelis are obviously watching the situation in south 
africa to determine if the advantages of restricting the press 
outweigh the disadvantages he said 
south africas widely condemned white government has succeeded 
in dampening outside interest in that countrys racial problems by 
banning coverage of any security activities experts agree the 
order went into effect in june 1986 
but gross doubted israel would be able to keep the lid on 
coverage of the occupied territories in a way the south africans 
have virtually halted reporting in black areas 
israels domestic political opposition and a thriving domestic 
press could prevent a blackout on coverage of the territories he 
said 
local israeli army commanders already have authority to close 
areas in the occupied territories at random and they have been 
doing so with increasing frequency a parliamentary committee in 
jerusalem is studying whether to ban the media formally from the 
territories 
yael dayan a wellknown israeli peace activist said during a 
recent us visit that tough restrictions on the press would likely 
fail because israelis demand news and have an aggressive press 
corps 
eric goldstein of the committee to protect journalists a new 
yorkbased group that monitors conditions for journalists 
worldwide said israel might be able to stave off intense scrutiny 
by banning cameras 
but in the long run the greater public interest is served by 
allowing the press access he said the committee opposes 
restrictions on reporters 
some americans have joined israeli government officials in 
complaining that reporters particularly those working for foreign 
television networks have helped incite rockthrowing palestinians 
in the territories 
new york mayor edward koch has said a television ban would be 
justified and former secretary of state henry a kissinger 
reportedly told prominent american jews during a meeting that 
banning television cameras would be a good idea kissinger says his 
remarks were distorted 
jeff cohen of fairness and accuracy in reporting criticized a 
censorship lobby for supporting restrictions that in the 
united states would be considered an unacceptable violation of 
freedom of the press 
it would be one more comparison with south africa and it 
would hurt israel he said fair is a liberal new york group that 
examines the media 
fred w friendly former president of cbs news and a professor 
at columbia universitys school of journalism said it would be 
wrong to ban reporters from the occupied territories 
that cant be right thats what south africa did he said 
but friendly said television coverage with its time constraints 
and powerful pictures can fail to portray a story accurately 
what is also wrong is letting the picture run away with the 
story he told the new york times 
mortimer zuckerman editorinchief of us news amp world report 
had the same complaint television has polluted the public debate 
because it is inherently difficult for pictures to give context 
history and meaning to events he recently wrote

because senators like to see farmers smile 
your next mercedes benz could cost an extra 1800 
if you dont get the connection thats just the way congress 
works sometimes 
the senate finance committee voted monday to grant farmers and 
some other taxpayers relief from the 151centagallon tax on 
diesel fuel used for logging farming oil drilling mining 
fishing and other offtheroad business purposes 
but since budget constraints require that every dollar of tax 
relief be offset by a dollar of tax increase on somebody else the 
committees bill would double the tax on fuelguzzling cars 
mostly expensive imports whose milespergallon dont meet federal 
standards 
other sources of revenue for the diesel relief and a new 
taxpayer bill of rights include a few distilleries that dodge 
some of the 1250agallon tax on liquor by watering down products 
with a grapebased alcohol and any number of people whose tax 
refunds could be grabbed to pay an overdue government loan 
after all that farmers may have to wait six months for their 
tax relief there is some doubt congress can complete action on 
legislation before april 1 when offtheroad diesel users are to 
begin paying the tax they would have to wait for a refund until 
they file their incometax returns next year 
i just dont want to go back home and explain to my farmers 
why weve set up this ridiculous bureaucratic nightmare moaned 
sen david boren dokla 
sen david pryor dark noted the senate is due to recess 
easter week to go back home with no settlement of the farmers 
problem he said would be like us walking through a field of 
scorpions barefooted 
sen john danforth rmo said the committee should in effect 
ask the senate to ignore the budget problem so farmers can be 
relieved 
farmers and other offroad diesel users were caught up in 
congress efforts last year to reduce cheating on the fuel tax the 
solution was to change the point of tax collection to the producer 
or wholesaler and to require that those legally entitled to an 
exemption pay the tax and then apply for a refund when they file 
their incometax returns the following year 
the typical farmer would thus allow the government interestfree 
use of 320 of his money some of it for up to a year 
the panels bill does nothing for another big group with a 
complaint about 82000 state county and city government units 
that starting jan 1 are now having to pay the 91cent gasoline 
tax and apply for a refund later 
the finance committee package still subject to action by the 
senate and house would 
allow diesel bought for offroad business use from wholesalers 
to escape the tax altogether taxexempt buyers from retailers 
would have to pay the tax and get a refund next year this would 
cost the government 543 million through 1993 
create a taxpayer bill of rights clamping down on 
perceived abuses by the internal revenue service this would lose 
517 million over five years 
extend through june 30 1989 the expiring authority for the 
irs to withhold tax refunds from people who owe student loans farm 
loans and other federal debts this would raise about 400 million 
double the tax on new cars whose fuel efficiency does not meet 
federal standards raising 375 million through 1993 in the 
current model year the tax hits only expensive foreign cars such 
as the 38000 volvo 780 which gets 212 miles per gallon and the 
61130 mercedes 560sl their guzzler taxes would rise to 1300 
and 3600 respectively 
limit use of a wine flavors credit under which some 
manufacturers of distilled spirits avoid a significant share of the 
1250agallon liquor tax by mixing some products with a 
grapebased alcohol this is expected to raise 360 million over 
five years

republican presidential candidate pat 
robertson faced with bumping up against the federallyimposed 
campaign spending limit revised some of his state spending figures 
downward in his newly filed campaign financial statement 
the spending allocations for nine states showed lower cumulative 
expenditures in the report filed monday than the figures robertson 
reported a month earlier 
robertsons staff did not return a phone call monday to answer 
questions about the revisions 
in his report filed monday with the federal election commission 
the former tv evangelist reported he had spent 19 million through 
feb 29 against the spending cap of 23 million that applies to 
expenditures for the entire primary season 
even with the downward revisions in some state spending figures 
the total was still more than the 176 million in spending against 
the cap that he reported through the end of january 
candidates who receive federal matching funds must agree to stay 
within the spending limit the reports candidates filed monday show 
new financial activity for the month of february as well as 
cumulative totals 
robertsons revisions were in figures reported for califonria 
district of columbia louisiana michigan north carolina 
oklahoma tennessee texas and virginia 
the biggest was in texas where his previous report showed an 
allocation of 11 million but the new report shows an allocation 
of 746514 through february 
robertson who has spent more overall than any other candidate 
also reported he borrowed another 19 million in february 
he has taken out more than 9 million in loans since he began 
his campaign last year and ended february with 84 million in 
debts and 74 million in cash on hand 
financial reports filed by his rivals show that sen bob dole 
also has narrowly outspent vice president george bush as bush has 
built a huge lead over both robertson and dole in the gop race 
democratic contender michael dukakis the governor of 
massachussetts continues to raise more money than his rivals all 
of whom have resorted to borrowing 
dukakis raised 29 million in february including federal 
matching funds compared with less than 2 million each by rep 
richard gephardt of missouri sen paul simon of illinois sen 
albert gore jr of tennessee and jesse jackson 
gephardt borrowed and repaid 149000 during february simon 
borrowed 292352 and jackson borrowed 500000 gore did not take 
out loans in february which is the month covered by the new 
financial statements but his aides have said he borrowed 1 
million before the march 8 super tuesday contests in 20 states and 
300000 before the illinois primary march 15 
doles receipts for february were 2 million giving him 88 
million for the year including federal matching funds based on 
contributions raised privately bush raised 15 million during 
february 87 for the year his report shows 
but despite raising and spending more money through february 
dole failed to interrupt the bush push toward the august nominating 
convention in new orleans bush has won 788 delegates so far to 
doles 178 according to the associated press delegate count 
robertson raised 5 million for the month including his 19 
million loan which brought his total receipts this year to 183 
million 
for the month he spent 31 million to doles 53 million and 
bushs 4 million 
dole has spent 18 million against the spending camp and bush 
141 million 
dole ended february with 836445 in the bank and 716107 in 
bills bush had 67 million in cash on hand more than any other 
candidate in the race and had 251225 in debts 
among democrats gephardt ended february with 1 million in 
debts and only about half that in available cash 
simon was 825199 in debt and had 760755 in cash on hand 
the reports showed 
jackson owed 845857 and had 428420 on hand 
gore had 342964 in the bank and 91858 in debts but that was 
before gore took out 13 million in loans during march according 
to capaign aides figures detailing those transactions will appear 
in the financial reports due next month 
candidates who run up debts generally do so in the knowledge 
they will be receiving federal matching funds to help pay off the 
loans 
dukakis had 29 million in cash on hand at the end of the 
month and 569344 in debts 
dukakis was the democrat closest to the spending cap at 114 
million

the operator of the three mile island nuclear 
plant has taken the first step in a plan to dispose of 23 million 
gallons of contaminated water that is a legacy of the 1979 accident 
at the plant 
gpu nuclear operator of the plant near harrisburg pa said 
monday it is spending 800000 for a system to boil away the water 
even though that method has yet to be approved by the nuclear 
regulatory commission and public hearings are months away 
we expect the nrc to approve the evaporation eventually but 
its possible that that wouldnt happen gpu nuclear spokesman 
gordon tomb said monday in a telephone interview 
tomb identified the contractor as pacific nuclear systems inc 
of federal way wash 
nrc spokeswoman sue gagner said utilities commonly make major 
expenditures for equipment before the commission grants permission 
for its use 
gpu nuclear said the nrc might not consider the plan until 
december and the utility wants to be ready when approval comes 
but kay pickering spokeswoman for three mile island alert a 
citizens group said she was alarmed when gpu nuclear told the nrc 
at a meeting last week that the company had authorized the 
contractor to design install and begin testing the evaporation 
system 
this is very distressing to the individuals and organizations 
involved here she said 
most of the water is left over from the 1979 accident while 
some has been used to decontaminate the plant gpu nuclear said the 
average additional radiation exposure from the evaporation would be 
about the same as the exposure from one to two hours of natural 
background radiation in the harrisburg area 
the 7 million process involves boiling the water into steam 
released from a 100foothigh stack and packaging impurities for 
shipment to a lowlevel radioactive waste dump tomb said testing 
at the plant would not use radioactive water 
thomas gerusky a member of a citizens advisory panel on the 
tmi cleanup and director of pennsylvanias bureau of radiation 
protection said some area residents were concerned about any 
releases from tmi and favored leaving the water in storage tanks 
he said the nrc has given its blessing to the evaporation plan 
but the commissioners have withheld formal approval pending public 
hearings 
disposal of the water is part of the 1 billion cleanup of three 
mile island 2 during the accident uranium fuel was allowed to 
lose the vital coolant that covers it causing material in the core 
to begin melting 
gpu nuclear announced plans in december 1986 to place unit 2 in 
storage indefinitely the nrc is expected to issue a report next 
month on whether the monitored storage plan poses any threat to 
the environment michael masnik of the commission said monday 
while there are no plans to restart tmi2 its twin reactor was 
not harmed in the accident and resumed operating in october 1985

widespread publicity about a handful of sexual 
abuse cases involving day care centers may have caused parents to 
be more worried than necessary about the safety of their children 
researchers say 
a study released monday by the family research laboratory of the 
university of new hampshire estimated that substantially more 
children are abused at home than in day care settings 89 per 
10000 children at home compared with 55 per 10000 at day care 
david finkelhor who directed the study said the results are 
a far cry from the impression many people have gotten because 
of news accounts about a few incidents of child abuse at day care 
centers 
we do not think day care centers in general are high risk 
areas said finkelhor 
however he emphasized that child abuse does occur at some day 
care centers and is particularly hard to ferret out because the 
perpetrators do not fit stereotypes 
only 8 percent had prior arrest records 50 percent were college 
graduates and 40 percent were women he said 
we just cant say there is a nice shortcut a couple of easy 
rules to spot places that might be dangerous he said 
for example finkelhor noted the study found no signficant 
differences between the incidence of child abuse in centers with a 
high teachertopupil ratio and in less adequately staffed centers 
however finkelhor and two other participants at a news 
conference underscored the importance of parents having ready 
access to day care center activity and making surprise visits to 
see what is going on 
parents need to go the extra mile to become familiar with the 
day care center they choose said david s liederman executive 
director of the child welfare league of america they should drop 
in unannounced and if the center doesnt like it they should 
consider whether that is the kind of place they want their children 
to be 
liederman said he agreed with the studys findings and said day 
care centers generally are safe places for children 
sue bredekamp director of the national academy of early 
childhood programs for the national association for the education 
of young children said the report was the most comprehensive 
national study of child sexual abuse in day care to date 
it is our hope that dr finkelhors findings will be as 
widely disseminated and as influential to policy makers as were 
reports of several infamous cases of abuse in the past she said 
the survey examined 270 cases of sexual abuse involving 1639 
children from 1983 to 1985 and made an indepth study of a random 
sample of 43 cases an estimated 15 million children were cared 
for in day care centers during that time 
finkelhor said there is no evidence the incidence of child abuse 
in day care settings was higher during the past two years than 
during the 198385 period surveyed 
the study was commissioned by the national center on child abuse 
and neglect an agency of the department of health and human 
services and released in conjunction with the childrens hospital 
national medical center

supporters of former television evangelist 
pat robertson will apparently control the state gop convention in 
reno next month as a result of weekend county conventions party 
officials said 
nevada republicans use a threestep system of caucuses and 
conventions to pick their national convention delegates the 
process began with precinct caucuses last month at which a straw 
poll was conducted 
in the straw poll vice president george bush led with 27 
percent followed by bob dole with 22 percent and robertson with 15 
percent but robertson supporters claimed victory by saying most of 
the 23 percent undecided voters in the poll actually were robertson 
supporters 
the straw poll participants were not bound to presidential 
candidates however 
at the county conventions held over this past weekend 
delegates were elected to the state convention april 2123 where 
in turn national convention delegates will be elected 
the delegate breakdown for the state convention wont be known 
for several days but the robertson forces dominated republican 
conventions in nevadas two biggest counties clark and washoe 
party leaders said it appeared robertson got more than half the 800 
state delegates in those two counties alone 
robertson also picked up some delegates at the gops county 
conventions elsewhere in nevada although his supporters showed 
less strength in the outlying areas party officials said 
state gop chairwoman sally vitkusmckinney said monday that 
party newcomers which most robertson backers are are welcome 
but she added there is frustration because nevada probably will 
wind up with its 20member delegation to the national convention 
committed to somone who wont be the presidential nominee 
robertsons state director steve wark said theres no way he 
would encourage the robertson delegates to switch to bush at the 
state convention level even though their candidate is clearly far 
behind 
robertson supporters are not about to roll over theyre 
making a statement and sticking to their commitment he said 
however he said robertson supporters would be prepared to support 
bush at the national republican convention 
robertson after big losses on super tuesday indicated he 
intends to remain in the race but has virtually given up hope of 
getting the nomination he has talked more at recent appearances 
about his role at the convention his longterm influence on the 
party and a possible bid in 1992

the federal government ran up a 239 billion 
budget deficit in february but the red ink is still running 
slightly behind last years total the treasury department reports 
the deficit in february came after a rare surplus of 161 
billion in january which had occurred because the social security 
benefits for that month were mailed early and counted in the 
december spending figures 
for the first five months of the budget year the government has 
run up a deficit of 897 billion 49 percent lower than the red 
ink incurred in the same period a year ago 
the reagan administration is projecting a deficit of 1467 
billion for the entire fiscal year a drop of 24 percent from the 
1504 billion deficit in the 1987 budget year 
but this projection is lower than estimates by the congressional 
budget office and many private forecasters who contend the 
administration is being too optimistic about the economic outlook 
cbo is forecasting a 157 billion deficit and some private 
economists are estimating an even higher 170 billion deficit for 
the budget year that ends on sept 30 
the deficit in 1987 dipped from a record 2212 billion 
shortfall in 1986 because of an unexpected windfall in tax revenues 
caused by changes in the new tax law 
some analysts think there could be a second smaller windfall 
this year if people end up owing more on their taxes under the new 
tax law than they did under the old law something which will not 
be known until after the april 15 tax filing deadline is passed 
we may have another april surprise which could add an 
additional 10 billion to revenue for the year said michael 
evans head of a washington forecasting firm 
evans said if the windfall does materialize the deficit could 
decline to around 160 billion but that would still be above the 
reagan administrations estimate 
in february government revenue totaled 604 billion while 
government spending totaled 843 billion for the first five 
months of the year revenues total 347 billion while the 
government spent 4367 billion 
the largest spending categories in february as usual were the 
military followed by social security and interest on the national 
debt 
military spending totaled 231 billion last month and 1166 
billion for the fiscal year so far up 53 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
spending for social security totaled 179 billion last month 
and 866 billion for the past five months up 51 percent from the 
same period in the 1987 fiscal year 
the other programs in the department of health and human 
services including medicare and medicaid spent 129 billion in 
february and 634 billion so far this budget year a 23 percent 
increase over 1987 
interest on the 25 trillion national debt totaled 15 billion 
last month and 908 billion so far this fiscal year an increase 
of 98 percent over the same period last year the fastest increase 
of any of the major categories 
for the entire 1988 budget year interest on the national debt 
is projected to total 210 billion amounting to onefifth of total 
government spending

hay prices nationally have been averaging 
around 12 percent higher than a year ago reflecting a smaller 1987 
crop and some increase in demand 
the agriculture department in january revised 1987 hay output 
downward to 1491 million tons from last octobers preliminary 
forecast of 1537 million tons 
a new report by the departments economic research service says 
that the us hay area turned out to be about 500000 acres larger 
than estimated in october but that the yield was reduced by 4 
percent to 246 tons per acre 
the 1987 hay crop was 64 million tons smaller than the record 
of 1555 million tons produced in 1986 
alfalfa and alfalfa mixture hay production turned out to be 
846 million tons down 7 million tons from 1986 and all other hay 
production of 646 million tons was 600000 tons above the previous 
years 64 million the report said 
acording to usda production figures for 1987 california was the 
leading allhay state with more than 9 million tons followed by 
wisconsin 888 million minnesota 78 million south dakota 709 
million and iowa 693 million 
last may 1 at the start of the 198788 hay crop season the 
inventory on hand was estimated at 324 million tons the most 
since 1980 adding the 1987 crop that made a total hay supply of 
1815 million tons for the marketing year that runs through april 
30 slightly less than the 198687 suppply of 1822 million tons 
the hay stockpile on dec 1 was reported at 1197 million tons 
meaning that 618 million tons had been consumed during the seven 
months since may 1 in the same period a year earlier hay 
consumption was 605 million tons the report said 
hay prices paid by farmers and ranchers averaged 6460 per ton 
during the maynovember period up 474 per ton from a year 
earlier in december and january of this year prices averaged 
6375 per ton up 765 from a year earlier 
according to usda estimates the value of hay production in 
1987 based on market prices was more than 91 billion ranking 
the crop third among all us farm commodities only corn at 122 
billion and soybeans 104 billion were valued higher 
those value estimates incidentally are not sales receipts or 
marketings the usda estimates are based upon total farm values 
whether a commodity is sold or used by the producer

the agriculture department has sold mexico 
30000 metric tons of surplus nonfat dry milk for 1260 per ton 
about a third less than it cost american taxpayers 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg said monday the 
surplus powdered milk was sold by the departments commodity credit 
corp to conasupo the mexican governments food purchasing 
authority 
goldberg said the sale reflects the world market price for 
nonfat dry milk at the time the sale was negotiated with mexico 
deliveries are scheduled through march 1989 in addition the ccc 
provided mexico with a threeyear credit arrangement at commercial 
rates of interest he said 
according to a recent ccc report about 454 million pounds of 
nonfat dry milk were held in storage with a value of more than 
385 million or about 85 cents per pound there are approximately 
2205 pounds in a metric ton which translates to a us value of 
1874 per ton 
the surplus was acquired by ccc through purchases of cheese 
butter and nonfat dry milk to support the price of milk paid to 
dairy farmers 
congress in 1985 farm law mandated the export sale of 150000 
tons of dairy products annually for the three fiscal years ending 
sept 30 1988 the latest deal with mexico boosted sales this year 
to 77520 tons goldberg said

the senate has removed a roadblock to a 
30year nuclear cooperation pact with japan rejecting claims by 
opponents that the new agreement could add to the proliferation of 
nuclear weapons 
the senate voted 5350 monday evening to reject a resolution to 
disapprove the agreement which provides for the sale of us 
uranium and uranium enrichment equipment to japan over the next 30 
years 
it replaces a more restrictive cooperation arrangement which was 
to expire at the end of the century 
as the matter stands the agreement will take effect at the end 
of april 90 legislative days after it was submitted to congress 
under the rules governing consideration of the agreement it 
could be rejected only if both the house and senate passed 
resolutions of disapproval and the president signed them 
the most controversial element of the new agreement is a 
provision giving japan advance consent for 30 years to reprocess 
uscontrolled spent nuclear fuel and to use plutonium separated 
from that fuel without the casebycase approval required by the 
present agreement 
plutonium is the key ingredient in the production of nuclear 
weapons 
since the process involves shipment of the nuclear material to 
reprocessing plants in france opponents of the agreement contended 
it will loosen us control on the movement of plutonium open 
opportunities for terrorists and potentially lead to the 
proliferation of nuclear weapons 
responding to these and other concerns the senate foreign 
relations committee voted 153 at the end of last year to recommend 
that the agreement be renegotiated 
the reagan administration and supporters of the agreement on the 
senate floor said that permitting it to take effect would continue 
us influence over the japanese nuclear program while providing 
the united states with a major longterm sales market 
but sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign 
relations panel echoed many other senators in contending the 
agreement does not meet the nonproliferation standards of the 
atomic energy act 
sen john glenn dohio said the agreement does not meet legal 
requirements and gives no assurance of effective nonproliferation 
safeguards 
glenn said the present law works well and that its casebycase 
approval arrangements should not be scrapped 
but some supporters of the agreement said opponents were 
motivated less by a genuine concern over nuclear proliferation than 
by anger at japanese trading practices 
there is a certain amount of emotional japan bashing going on 
around here said sen james a mcclure ridaho 
contending that rejecting the agreement would hurt the united 
states which would lose hundreds of millions of dollars in 
uranium sales and not japan mcclure added actually its us 
bashing were engaged in here rejecting this agreement will hurt 
us and not the japanese

old loves and old photographs gave a sentimental 
air to the deportation hearing of a welshman who says he should be 
allowed to stay in this country because he is the illegitimate son 
of an american soldier 
the claims of roger hobbs 43 were supported monday in federal 
immigration court by the kin of the late floyd alexander of cundys 
harbor maine 
alexander who died in 1970 was an american soldier stationed 
in england during world war ii 
hobbs a janitor insists he is the product of a union between 
alexander and sara hobbs of cardiff wales 
no one has found any legal documents to prove the relationship 
but alexanders kin say that for many years he talked openly about 
his son buddy overseas 
the immigration and naturalization service contends hobbs hasnt 
proved alexander was his father it has also said hobbs has a 
criminal record including attempting to steal a radiator from an 
abandoned railway car 
after alexander returned from the war he fathered seven 
children in this country and married three different women about a 
dozen members of the alexander clan came from maine to stand by the 
man they believe is one of them 
hobbs also was accompanied by his wife anne 37 and sons 
richard 17 ian 15 and wayne 12 as british citizens they can 
apply for us citizenship if hobbs wins his case which is built 
on memories family photos birth and death certificates and 
letters 
alexanders first wife elsie van buren 60 of lisbon falls 
maine told immigration judge billino dambrosio that alexander 
wished he could bring sara hobbs and her son to this country but 
never had the money 
as soon as he met me he told me all about it said mrs van 
buren he told me he lived with her and i know he was in love 
with her and he had a son by her 
she said alexanders mother allegra often wrote to mrs hobbs 
and sent clothing and gifts 
during the hearing hobbs sat with head bent at the back of the 
small courtroom he wiped an occasional tear from his eyes his 
burgundy corduroy jacket was emblazoned with the name of his 
adopted hometome richmond maine and a large american flag patch 
was sewn over his heart 
mrs van buren said her first husband once told her he signed a 
sworn statement that roger hobbs was his son the document hasnt 
been found but she said the documentation of alexanders blood is 
in the face of roger hobbs 
i swear by my life on it roger looked more like my husband 
than my children mrs van buren said 
hobbs said he first learned of his relationship with alexander 
in 1968 from his mother who died 11 years later 
in october 1984 hobbs came to this country on a tourist visa 
with his family their visas expired in 1985 and hobbs has asserted 
his right to citizenship since 
in 1986 federal rules were changed to give citizenship rights 
to foreign children fathered by american men outside marriage 
hobbs family can stay here until the case is settled a hearing 
was continued to july 7

married virgins celebrity children and american 
women who marry saudis arent listed in the yellow pages so where 
do tv talk show hosts phil donahue oprah winfrey and geraldo 
rivera find those people anyway 
viewer mail is one way we get ideas for guests lorri antosz 
benson chief producer for donahue said monday 
to get the offbeat people that you want you have to rely on 
the mails because there are people out there who write in willing 
to tell you all about themselves ms benson said in a telephone 
interview from new york 
the oprah winfrey show looks for entire audiences that fit a 
theme of the chicagobased show 
its ad on daytime television last week asked if you live with 
a slob have ever lived with a slob or your parents were slobs 
please contact the oprah winfrey show 
we get 200 names and call back those with the best stories 
said alice mcgee winfreys publicist we did a show on twins and 
we had an audience full of twins 
the geraldo show syndicated from new york since september 
recently asked for ideas from various sources 
i sent him 10 ideas on who id like to see on the show and 
topics i wanted to see done said joanie stat chicago publicist 
for riveras syndicated specials 
talk shows also use many other methods usually producers spot 
something in a newspaper or on television then spend hours 
tracking down the right guests 
we have extensive files every magazine published newspapers 
from the top 15 or 20 markets were always clipping things miss 
mcgee said sometimes the author or guest themselves suggest 
other people to have on the show 
with donahue ms benson said mostly its word of mouth you 
talk to people who give you names of other people or you ask the 
audience if they know of anybody 
finding the right guests for a show often has been tough 
detective work 
we did a show on women who marry saudis and go over there and 
find life is not so good ms benson said 
we got that from the mails but then it gets more difficult 
we started talking to people calling embassies then i ran across 
a book about this subject and the author had names of people and 
they knew people

a new air force report says an oftencited 
1984 government study that was supposed to be reassuring for 
vietnam veterans exposed to agent orange was flawed 
the revised study said while the chemical defoliant could not be 
confidently identified as the reason for a series of health 
problems among veterans who handled the chemical it could not be 
exonerated either 
the report released monday by sens john f kerry dmass and 
tom daschle dsd was hailed by veteran activists as a major 
breakthrough 
for the first time the air force is saying in a major way that 
they cannot rule out dioxin as the cause of illhealth effects 
said barry kasinitz spokesman for vietnam veterans of america 
air force officials said they have never categorically ruled out 
a link between agent orange and health problems 
but critics say the 1984 study gave that impression when it 
said in the full context the baseline study results should be 
viewed as reassuring to the ranch handers and their families at 
this time 
what theyre doing is trying to reverse themselves without 
really saying so said eric hamburg an aide to kerry 
laura petrou a daschle aide said we have gotten a clear 
sense that the air force wants to work with us to get the truth 
out 
the air force rejected the senators contention that the 1984 
ranch hand study was seriously flawed 
i think thats an overstatement said dr william wolfe 
chief of epidemiology at the us air force school of aerospace 
medicine at brooks air force base in texas and the senior 
investigator in the agent orange probe 
there are areas of that report that we have less confidence in 
the conclusions wolfe said but he said the bulk of the 1984 
findings were upheld by the review 
the key problem with the original study wolfe said was 
assumptions about exposure that failed to take work habits into 
consideration government scientists now realize that certain 
workers were sloppier than others in handling agent orange and 
therefore had a greater exposure that was not taken into account 
he said 
the studies are part of the governments 20year investigation 
of agent orange and its impact on soldiers who handled the 
defoliant operation ranch hand was the air forces code name for 
the aerial spraying 
last year a veterans administration study found increased 
deaths due to lung cancer and certain lymph cancers among vietnam 
veteran marines providing what veterans groups called the first 
clear scientific data implicating agent orange 
kerry and daschle also said the 1984 study incorrectly concluded 
that all birth defects were limited to the skin 
and the senators said the revised study indicated that the 1984 
study erred by saying the only type of cancer found among the agent 
orange veterans was skin cancer 
wolfe defended the original conclusion saying there is an 
increase in the skin cancer in the exposed group but not in more 
serious forms of cancers 
since the 1984 study scientists have discovered a way to detect 
dioxin levels in blood even years after exposure blood samples 
have been taken from 2010 veterans who worked with agent orange 
and that analysis should be ready within two years wolfe said 
kerry and daschle both vietnam war veterans are pushing 
legislation to compensate veterans who suffer from certain 
conditions that may be tied to agent orange exposure

the american civil liberties union is hailing 
a federal appeals courts decision to rehear the case of a 
terminally ill woman who underwent a courtordered caesarean 
section against her wishes and those of her doctors 
aclu attorney lynn paltrow said monday the decision by the court 
of appeals for the district of columbia to grant a rehearing is 
significant because it vacates a ruling that allowed the 
sacrifice of a pregnant womans life in the name of socalled 
fetal life 
the eightmember court acting on a petition from the aclu 
agreed that the full court would rule on a case previously decided 
upon by a threejudge panel of the appeals court 
the three appellate judges had refused to block a superior court 
order that the woman undergo a caesarean section the order was 
issued after george washington university hospital sought a 
superior court ruling as to what it should do in terms of the 
fetus whether to intervene by caesarean section and save its 
life 
the threejudge appeals panel based its decision not to block 
the lower courts ruling on the belief that the womans death was 
imminent and that the child had a better chance of surviving if 
delivered before her death 
the 27yearold woman a leukemia patient identified as angela 
c gave birth in june to a baby girl who died shortly after the 
ceasarean operation at the university hospital the mother died two 
days later 
the full appeals court in a ruling issued thursday and made 
public monday agreed to rehear the case and ordered the submission 
of briefs by march 28 
the aclu said the threejudge panels ruling needed rehearing 
because the panel made a number of grave mistakes and raised 
the question of may a court order a person to submit to 
potentially lifeextinguishing surgery for the benefit of another 
person much less for a fetus whose chances of survival are slim

a former state trooper was found guilty 
monday of murder in the slaying of his trooper girlfriend who was 
shot three times in the head after he took out a 350000 life 
insurance policy on her 
the dallas county jury deliberated more than three hours before 
finding joe duncan jr guilty on the charges of capital murder for 
financial gain and capital murder of a law officer 
elizabeth cobb 31 had been a trooper less than seven months 
when she failed to respond to radio calls while on night patrol 
oct 11 1987 the next day investigators found her body in her 
patrol car behind a rural church 
duncan who had said that he and miss cobb had discussed 
marriage held his chin with both hands as the verdict was 
announced while his family seated two rows behind him began to 
cry 
circuit judge jc norton denied a defense motion to delay the 
sentencing phase of the trial which will begin tuesday the jury 
can recommend either life in prison without parole for duncan 33 
or death in the states electric chair the final decision between 
those two options will be up to the judge 
duncan initially told investigators that he did not know miss 
cobbs whereabouts the night of her disappearance 
several days later he changed his story saying that he was 
scheduled to meet her at the church the night she was killed but 
that when he arrived she was dead he was then arrested and charged 
with murder 
during closing arguments earlier monday defense attorney henry 
pitts said duncan was guilty only of poor judgment for failing to 
report her death and not telling investigators that he had seen her 
body the night she died duncan had told authorities he had been 
afraid to report her death after finding the body 
insurance agents testified that duncan and miss cobb each 
purchased 350000 life insurance policies that named each other as 
beneficiaries 
dallas county district attorney jim sullivan told the jurors 
that duncan was deeply in debt and plotted to collect from miss 
cobbs insurance policy 
but pitts said investigators failed to fully examine possible 
links between the slaying and the arrest in florida of a man 
driving a vehicle similar to a car spotted in the area where miss 
cobbs body was found

reaction monday night to panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noriegas offer to resign before that countrys 1989 presidential 
elections 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
we believe the offer is little more than one a ploy to attempt 
to legitimize the illegal solis palma regime by calling for 
negotiations between it and opposition groups and two an effort on 
the part of noriega to maintain direct or indirect control of the 
panamanian defense forces 
noriega is the problem and his preoccupation with remaining on 
the scene despite overwhelming domestic opposition will only ensure 
continued economic and political instability there we stand by our 
previous view that noriega should go and the sooner the better for

the first reactor at the south texas nuclear 
project will be allowed to operate at full power despite 
lastminute efforts by opponents to halt it because of alleged 
dangerous flaws 
the nuclear regulatory commission voted 50 monday to approve a 
fullpower operating license for the reactor part of a 55 
billion twinreactor 2500megawatt generating station 10 miles 
from the gulf coast near bay city texas 
a group headed by citizens concerned about nuclear power of san 
antonio sued in the 5th us circuit court of appeals in new 
orleans on friday to stop the license and was rebuffed by the 
judges without comment on monday 
the government accountability project based in washington had 
petitioned the nrc staff to delay mondays vote pending a fuller 
investigation of 700 allegations of intimidation other wrongdoing 
or shoddy construction but that was rejected late friday 
billie garde a lawyer for the gap said after mondays vote 
to handle it this way was very insulting to several dozen people 
who have come to the commission theyre not antinuclear 
activists 
the commission acted after a staff briefing on an investigation 
of some of the concerns brought to the commissions attention by 
the gap which tries to encourage and protect people who disclose 
wrongdoing 
it is the staffs judgment that south texas can be operated 
without undue risk to the health and safety of the public jose 
calvo director of an nrc special team that investigated the 
allegations told the commission in repeating the conclusions of 
the team report issued a week ago on the 213 allegations judged to 
be safetyrelated 
gap presented two previously unidentified whistleblowers at a 
morning news conference criticizing last weeks special team report 
one of them engineer ashok garg who left the project in 
september 1986 said he provided the team a reference to a plant 
document from april 1986 which said among other things that 20 
percent of valves for plant instruments had been installed 
backwards 
calvo however said in an interview after the commission 
meeting we reviewed that document and we interviewed him but 
he couldnt remember details with those instrument valves it 
doesnt make any difference if they are installed frontwards or 
backwards 
houston lighting amp power co the project manager has about a 
48 percent share central power and light co of corpus christi has 
slightly more than 25 percent the city of austin has about 16 
percent and the city of san antonio has about 10 percent austin at 
one point sued houston lighting charging mismanagement but those 
two parties are close to an agreement under which houston lighting 
would take over austins ownership 
a construction permit was issued in 1975 the total cost to the 
four owners will be some 500 percent above initial estimates the 
second unit is more than 80 percent complete

strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
has offered to resign before next years presidential elections if 
opponents agree to talks with his regime panamas chief of state 
told his countrymen monday 
the opposition whose general strike monday paralyzed the 
nation and the united states which has kept up steady pressure to 
force a noriega resignation immediately rejected the generals 
offer 
elections are scheduled for may 1989 
there will be no dialogue said aurelio barria the main 
leader of the national civic crusade an antinoriega coalition of 
200 business professional labor and political groups that called 
the indefinite work stoppage 
he added the general has to go immediately not eventually 
the strike will continue 
manuel solis palma installed last month as the minister in 
charge of the presidency made the announcement of noriegas offer 
in a nationally broadcast speech 
he said noriega had given his word as an officer and a 
gentleman to step down if his conditions are met 
in washington state department spokesman anita stockman said 
we believe the offer is little more than one a ploy to 
attempt to legitimize the illegal solis palma regime by calling for 
negotiations between it and opposition groups and two an effort on 
the part of noriega to maintain direct or indirect control of the 
panamanian defense forces 
we stand by our previous view that noriega should go and the 
sooner the better for panama 
noriega is under indictment on federal drug charges in florida 
the united states has dried up the flow of money to panama which 
uses the us dollar as its currency in the effort to force him 
out and the economy is near collapse 
the general put down a coup attempt by dissident officers last 
week and rejected a us plan for him to leave panama and live in 
spain 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
earlier monday that there were no plans for further talks with 
noriega after the return of two administration officials from 
panama city 
i think they have a pretty good reading of the generals 
attitude fitzwater said it didnt seem to include further 
conversations at least at this point 
the strike included panama citys central commercial district 
where the small shops that cater to the lower and middle classes 
had not joined previous shutdowns by wealthier businesmen and 
industrialists 
were sending noriega a message said the owner of a shoe 
store who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals we 
hope hes listening 
noriega commands the military and police as head of the 
15000member defense forces and is the power behind the civilian 
government 
the secretary of the panamanian human rights foundation said a 
man died monday of wounds suffered when he was hit in the face and 
chest by birdshot fired by police during disturbances in panama 
city last wednesday it was the fourth protestrelated death since 
antigovernment demonstrations began last summer 
noriegas opponents hailed the strike as their greatest triumph 
so far 
its completely successful said guillermo cochez vice 
president of the christian democratic party today has been a 
very special day in the capital as well as the provinces we 
hope noriegas advisers and the people surrounding him will help 
him to see the reality 
the paralyzation is total in industry finance and commerce 
said carlos gonzalez de la lastra a business leader 
gonzalez and cochez are directors along with barria of the 
national civic crusade 
noriega made another move monday to strengthen his control of 
the defense forces by announcing the promotions of 98 officers to 
ranks ranging from colonel to lieutenant 
among those promoted to colonel was eros ramiro cal who was 
named last week to replace col leonidas macias the leader of the 
foiled coup as the nations police chief 
the defense forces also said administrative discipline would be 
taken against 17 officers implicated in last wednesdays attempted 
coup but did not give details it previously acknowledged eight or 
nine officers had joined in the attempt and said only five were 
being detained 
gustavo gonzalez of the striking dockworkers said leaders of all 
major unions were summoned to a meeting sunday night with solis 
palma and told the military would not interfere if the strike 
remained peaceful 
he said union leaders were told the government which could not 
meet its payroll two weeks ago also would be unable to cover 
semimonthly paychecks due next week 
solis palma replaced eric arturo delvalle who was dismissed by 
the legislature after he tried to fire noriega and still is 
recognized by the united states as panamas president delvalle is 
in hiding in panama 
because the government has silenced opposition newspapers and 
broadcast stations thousands of people went to work without 
knowing a strike had been called most went home when they found 
stores and offices closed 
by midday the city was a ghost town patrolled by helmeted 
soldiers in combat gear the government said they were providing 
security for businesses that chose to open 
panamas ailing economy came apart after feb 25 when delvalle 
tried to fire noriega and the legislature fired delvalle 
banks closed the following week and the government could not 
meet a 33 million payroll for 130000 public employees 
washington has cut off economic and military aid and millions of 
dollars in panamanian funds have been frozen in us banks by legal 
actions

horrifying television film of ira funeral mourners 
beating up two british soldiers who were then killed has brought 
demands to restrict coverage of such scenes 
some lawmakers urged restrictions on funeral coverage or 
interviews with leaders of sinn fein the legal political wing of 
the outlawed irish republican army they argue that the cameras 
presence encourages rioting and boosts terrorist organizations 
were fighting what is in the nature of a war here said 
ivor stanbrook senior legislator of the governing conservative 
party in urging a ban on interviews with sinn fein leaders 
we wouldnt have dreamed during the war of giving currency to 
nazis so i dont see why we should give any credence to people 
acting as the iras propagandists 
prime minister margaret thatcher has criticized british tv 
networks for giving the ira what she calls the oxygen of 
publicity 
but the home office said monday there were no plans to impose 
bans on covering irarelated news events 
when it comes to covering a demonstration in britain or a riot 
or anything we cant start saying you go there or you dont go 
there or we wouldnt have a free press said spokesman ian scott 
conservative lawmaker michael mates said the publicly funded 
british broadcasting corp and commercial independent television 
news should exercise selfrestraint 
i think you have to look very carefully at the question of 
whether you would be getting 10000 people coming to these funerals 
if it wasnt for the fact that they are whipped up out there 
mates said in a radio interview 
they are paraded by the ira and sinn fein for the tv cameras 
so that the world can see that their heroes are being buried with 
the total support of the whole population theyre made to go 
along because its got to be a spectacle 
cameras filmed the initial attack saturday on the soldiers car 
in belfast but were chased off by mourners before the beating 
began in earnest and they did not film the shooting of the men a 
few minutes later 
british newspapers however published pictures of the 
nearnaked bodies the next day 
it was a shocking brutal event and i was as horrified as 
anyone to see things like that on my television screen said 
michael grade head of commercial channel 4 
but you cannot sanitize a story the bbc and itn made 
people understand the horror of the situation he told today 
newspaper 
we take great care in what we show said itn spokeswoman 
geraldine sharpnewton but by not showing it well not make it 
go away 
still there are inconsistencies british networks often preface 
violent scenes with a warning to viewers but none preceded the 
belfast footage 
in the irish republic the state media cannot broadcast 
interviews with officials of sinn fein on the grounds that they 
speak for an outlawed organization the ira 
south africa has imposed stringent curbs on reporting in what 
are defined as unrest areas offenders face prison fines or 
expulsion 
the south africans say violent incidents dropped by 35 percent 
immediately after the restrictions were decreed in june 1986 
international criticism of israels handling of palestinian 
unrest has prompted charges that foreign networks distort the 
countrys image and inflame unrest 
president chaim herzog asked this month whether israeli 
democracy should allow this weapon to be turned against my 
children and my country 
henry kissinger the former us secretary of state and mayor 
ed koch of new york have suggested that israel ban tv crews 
outright from the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
israel has not gone that far but on march 4 the military for 
the first time banned reporters and tv crews from extensive areas 
of the occupied lands they have since renewed the ban repeatedly 
generally on a smaller scale

when pope john paul ii arrived here last 
fall homosexuals took to the streets to protest the vaticans 
condemnation of their way of life 
roman catholic officials believe the visit helped heal relations 
between homosexuals and the church but gay activists still recoil 
in anger when speaking of john paul 
the pope encountered the largest and angriest demonstrations of 
his ninecity tour during his 21hour visit to san francisco 
outside mission dolores where the pope met with aids victims 
2000 protesters shouted pope go home and shame shame 
the rev miles riley chief publicist for the archdiocese of san 
francisco contends protests were even smaller than reported and 
reflected well upon the churchs conciliation efforts 
i think there was tremendous healing with the whole gay 
community and with aids patients riley said i think much of 
the healing took place before he came 
the archdiocese and a coalition of gay groups met before the 
popes visit and drafted a joint statement of nonviolence 
recently the archdiocese announced the opening of a 40bed 
hospice for homeless aids patients 
before the popes visit the vatican published a theological 
letter that called homosexualtiy an intrinsic moral evil while 
declaring gods love for homosexuals the church is opposed to 
homosexual relationships 
we are going to be ourselves said john wahl an attorney 
who coordinated an umbrella group of homosexuals and bisexuals to 
oppose the sept 1718 visit we are going to relate to members 
of our own sex just as heterosexual people relate to people of the 
opposite sex 
basically so long as they insist that samesex is sinful 
they are our adversaries wahl said 
however confrontations between church and homosexuals have 
moved elsewhere members of dignity made up of catholic sexually 
active gays were arrested during demonstrations in march and 
february at st patricks cathedral in new york 
at one of those services cardinal john oconnor said the 
churchs teaching against homosexual behavior would not be changed 
we cannot alter the gospel he said 
in january about 250 dignity members and supporters held a 
candlelight vigil outside st josephs cathedral in hartford conn 
during his visit to mission dolores john paul blessed 62 aids 
patients 
one of them 4yearold brendan orourke suddenly reached out 
and touched the pontiffs ear the startled but pleased pope hugged 
the boy whos believed to have contracted aids through a blood 
transfusion 
riley said the boy is doing well he said he celebrated mass at 
the boys home recently when brendan blurted out i hugged the 
pope i hugged the pope

he has demonstrated that the opendoor policy works his 
success is an inspiration of what we can accomplish nationally

the disclosure that a former federal 
prosecutor may have fabricated death threats against herself and a 
magistrate during an extradition case has shocked her former 
colleagues 
on monday us attorney samuel a alito jr said that judy 
russell allegedly cut out words from newspapers to form threatening 
messages that she received in the mail during the case she was 
handling against two sikhs accused of terrorism in india 
a search of her house turned up similar threatening messages in 
a travel bag and scissors apparently used to clip newspapers and 
magazines alito said 
no charges were filed but an investigation was continuing he 
said 
few lawyers in the us attorneys office and in private 
practice would speak publicly but almost all interviewed monday 
said ms russell had been a highly intelligent and harddriven 
assistant us attorney 
ive been sick over this thing ever since i found out about a 
week and a half ago said thomas g roth one of ms russells 
three partners who left the us attorneys office with her last 
summer to form their own firm 
after leaving ms russell was appointed a special assistant 
us attorney to enable her to continue with the case against the 
sikhs ranjit singh gill 25 and sukhminder singh 26 
singhs attorney ronald kuby called mondays disclosures 
clearly the most astounding thing ive heard and said he would 
seek to have all extradition proceedings against the men dropped 
during the case kuby had strongly denied that any supporters of 
the sikhs were behind the threats and had suggested the indian 
government may be involved 
alito said ms russells alleged responsibility for the threats 
had no affect on the outcome of the extradition hearings in 
february when us magistrate ronald j hedges approved 
extradition but alito said he would seek a new hearing to avoid 
any appearance of impropriety 
during the hearings ms russell did not specifically accuse the 
two men of having sent the notes but cited the death threats in 
requesting added security 
sharpshooters lined nearby rooftops observers passed through 
two metal detectors dozens of us marshals attended and nearby 
streets were closed 
the justice departments department of public integrity is 
handling the investigation of the 36yearold ms russell the 
former deputy chief of the us attorneys criminal division alito 
said 
robert j fettweis ms russells attorney and former colleague 
in the us attorneys office said she was in a private hospital 
he would not comment on any aspect of the case or the nature of her 
hospitalization 
the disclosure of the investigation came during a court session 
requested by alito to correct and supplement the record 
regarding the threats 
suspicions about the threats were raised when ms russell told 
fbi agents on feb 5 that a letter saying no more warning federal 
court death for you was handdelivered to the hotel where she was 
under 24hour guard 
an fbi agents affidavit unsealed monday said none of the deputy 
us marshals guarding her saw anyone enter or leave the area 
around her room 
the 24hour guard was ordered after ms russell submitted to 
hedges during the extradition hearings sealed information about 
previous alleged threats 
one letter addressed to ms russell said dont get dead 
dont go to court 
the magistrate received a threatening letter two weeks before 
the extradition hearings alito said 
an fbi laboratory analysis showed that typewritten characters on 
envelopes containing the threats matched those on ms russells 
1983 application to the us attorneys office he said the 
typewriter matching the print also was found in her home 
the indian government charges that singh plotted the revenge 
assassination of a retired indian general who led the bloody 1984 
assault against sikh militants occupying the sikhs holiest shrine 
the golden temple in amritsar 
gill was charged in the killing of a parliament member

the senate is urging the reagan administration 
to open negotiations with the soviet union aimed at curbing 
uncontrolled bandit fishing from international waters in the 
bering sea 
a 790 vote on monday approved a nonbinding 
senseofthesenate resolution which declares that foreign fishing 
fleets are using a zone located between the 200mile fishing limits 
established by the united states and the soviet union as a 
staging ground for raids into one of the richest fishing grounds 
in the world 
according to the resolution immediate action to protect bering 
sea fishery resources is needed because of lack of cooperation by 
other highseas fishing nations under existing agreements 
the resolution calls for the convening of ussoviet 
negotiations to impose a moratorium on all fishing in the zone a 
ban which would stay in effect until an international fishery 
management agreement is negotiated 
because of its location completely surrounded by us and 
soviet territorial waters the 4500 square mile area is known 
variously as the hole in the doughnut or the doughnut

an elderly couple that gave a job and 
shelter to a homeless chicago man have learned that you can take 
harold thomas out of the city but you cant take the city out of 
harold 
i think hes going to be happier with his people ethel 
gilman said monday he seemed very happy here it seemed like he 
thought a lot of us we thought a lot of him it started out nice 
and ended nice 
thomas spent three months working at the junkyard owned by mrs 
gilman 68 and her husband roy 75 
thomas withdrew 300 from a portales bank monday and boarded an 
eastbound bus 
thomas had planned to work at the junkyard through the summer 
but said he couldnt do it without any wages 
a man cant live with just room and board he said after 
three months with room and board you know i want to have a family 
and stuff room and board just doesnt make it 
im thinking about getting married pretty soon thomas said 
i just want to get somewhere where i can get established and have 
an income 
thomas much of last year living in a rotting wood and canvas 
shack on the banks of the chicago river the gilmans read of his 
plight in a story about the homeless in chicago and how they were 
enduring the subzero temperatures the couple called the associated 
press bureau in chicago and said if thomas were willing to work 
theyd give him a job and a roof over his head 
thomas 35 arrived jan 17 in portales an eastern new mexico 
farming and ranching community of about 11000 people 
his home here was an 8footby30foot trailer in the junkyard 
where he worked eight hours a day six days a week tearing apart 
old cars and rebuilding the engines the other day he said was 
spent working in the fields at a churchrun orphanage where his 
benefactors volunteered his service 
thomas had not been paid after a month on the job and the 
gilmans said his room and board were his remuneration 
thomas boss the gilmans son ralph said thomas didnt give 
any notice he was quitting he said thomas told him monday morning 
he was homesick and was ready to go 
the girl i was going with in chicago wants to get married 
thomas said 
he also said he was going to try to find a place to stay and 
see if his brother might help him 
but he said the gilmans were nice people and had placed 300 in 
the bank for him 
it seems like its better for both of us because they say 
theyre going in the hole thomas said they say theyre going 
into the hole on account of me staying there i dont want to put a 
lot of pressure on those people 
before gaining national attention thomas wore illfitting 
clothes and ate in soup kitchens he and another man endured the 
harsh winter in a leanto shack rather than try to find refuge in 
cityrun shelters 
by the time thomas boarded a bus for the 1478mile 27hour 
journey to new mexico people had donated new clothes new luggage 
and spending money 
thomas said monday he was leaving rather than trying to find 
work in portales because he didnt want to put pressure on people 
in the community he also said he had had offers to live in nearby 
clovis 
although thomas apparently had no job waiting for him in 
chicago he has said his days among the homeless are over 
i never knew id end up like i did thomas told the ap in an 
interview in february i hope i dont end up in a slump like that 
again that aint no kind of life for a man

mayor edward i koch has accused a group of 
spanish harlem residents of meting out frontier justice for 
chasing down and fatally beating a man accused of stealing 20 
but four suspects charged with first and seconddegree 
manslaughter in the attack said they said they thought they had 
done the right thing chasing and capturing this guy said police 
capt william j quigley 
police said at least four others may have been part of the group 
that beat 41yearold raymondo carabello on sunday after he 
allegedly snatched the money from a woman at a bakery 
koch denounced the attackers monday saying they executed the 
death penalty without a trial 
here is a guy who at worst may have stolen 20 he said 
no one would suggest that anybody be executed for stealing 20 
they were meting out justice as they saw it frontier justice 
thats not permissible in civilized society 
but some who live in the neighborhood expressed mixed feelings 
about the attack 
its not right that he got killed felix olmos 23 said as 
he stood at the counter of a grocery store not far from the bakery 
but i understand that stuffs got to stop people will 
think twice about stealing around here its kind of dangerous 
around here 
the beating death occurred in front of the jefferson houses 
public housing project in an area of east harlem that has been 
plagued by crack dealers and violence 
after being robbed in the bakery the woman asked a crowd on the 
corner if they had seen the man who had just robbed her caraballo 
came out of the houses and the group chased him down the block 
they started to beat him with fists and feet quigley 
said 
he was getting beaten all over the legs the ribs said al 
rivera 27 who was in the area visiting a friend 
he was yelling please stop no more no more rivera said 
they said were going to kill you said riveras friend 
jose augostini the man staggered across the street and collapsed 
in front of augostinis building 
police broke up the fight and caraballo stood up and was 
handcuffed quigley said the officers radioed for an ambulance as 
they took him to their office 
he was taken to mount sinai hospital where he died sunday 
evening 
four hours later jesus negron 23 was arrested police 
saidthree others surrendered monday david andino 22 and charles 
mimms 20 and isidore cuadrado 14 police said 
neither the suspects nor caraballo who lived nearby have 
previous criminal records police said needle marks on his arm 
suggested he was a drug addict police said 
quigley said the suspects apparently did not know each other and 
none of them knew caraballo 
the 14yearold is being treated as an adult because of the 
seriousness of the crime 
the 20 was not recovered

sen bob dole struggling on against vice

a federal judge says he wont upset new york 
election law to place delegate slates supporting pat robertson or 
sen bob dole on all ballots in next months state republican 
primary 
but supporters of the two gop presidential hopefuls said they 
would appeal mondays ruling by us district judge leonard b sand 
before the april 19 primary 
the robertson and dole supporters are challenging state law 
which they claim made it unfairly difficult to get delegate slates 
favoring their candidates on the ballot in new york 
candidates were required to get the signatures of 1250 
registered republicans or 5 percent whichever was less in each 
of the states 34 congressional districts in order to get their 
slates on the ballot the signatures had to be obtained between 
jan 5 and feb 11 
but only vice president george bushs campaign was able to get 
the necessary signatures in a majority of the 34 districts 
we feel the judge has made several errors in his ruling we 
will be appealing said henry hews of americans for robertson

vice president george bush is the 
overwhelming favorite going into new yorks april 19 primary among 
likely republican voters questioned for a recent statewide poll 
the marist college institute for public opinion also reported in 
its study released monday that in theoretical matchups pitting 
bush against the major democratic candidates the vice president is 
the choice of new yorkers except when it comes to massachusetts 
gov michael dukakis in that possible contest dukakis appeared to 
have a slight edge over bush in new york 
of the 292 likely republican primary voters sampled 68 percent 
said they favored bush while 22 percent opted for kansas sen bob 
dole and 3 percent went for pat robertson less than 1 percent 
picked another candidate and 6 percent said they were undecided 
bushs support is solid across the board outpolling his 
rivals among upstate new york city and suburban republicans 
noted marist pollster lee miringoff 
the margin of error for the republican portion of the poll is 
plus or minus 6 percent the poll was based on interviews conducted 
for the first four days of last week

a group attempting to place mario 
cuomos name on californias presidential primary ballot despite 
the new york governors objections faces still another legal 
obstacle 
gerald hill one of two coordinators of the draft cuomo 
committee said monday that while his group believes it has more 
than the 22500 signatures required statewide on its petitions it 
hasnt met the requirement of filing a minimum of 500 verified 
signatures from each of californias 45 congressional districts 
we have to admit we dont have all 45 there are four or five 
districts where we didnt make the 500 no question of it hill 
said in a telephone interview 
thats another hurdle no question of it but matters like 
this have come up numerous times in numerous states and courts 
have overturned overly stringent requirements if its too 
burdensome 
under the law the group is using in its attempt to place cuomos 
name on californias ballot the group also must have the consent 
of the candidate something hill concedes cuomo has not given

ohios urban problems and those of some 
other northeast states are being left behind in the presidential 
primary shuffle because their primaries are held too late an 
elections researcher said 
linda lm bennett a political science professor at wittenberg 
university also said ohio should consider holding caucuses 
instead of a popular vote 
caucuses allow elected officials and party leaders more say and 
theyre better informed on the issues and they know what it takes 
to get elected she said 
ohio last year considered moving the may 3 primary to midmarch 
but lawmakers dropped the idea when gov richard celeste failed to 
include it in his budget 
ms bennett doesnt expect ohios democratic and republican 
leaders to institute major reforms partly because they like the 
long primary season for state and local candidates she said they 
more easily can influence those primaries

the rightist republican 
nationalist alliance handily defeated the governing christian 
democrats in legislative and municipal elections this week 
election officials announced 
the defeat presented president jose napoleon duarte the 
staunchest us ally in central america with the prospect of an 
uphill climb in his final year in office presidential elections 
are set for march 1989 
mario samayoa the president of the central elections council 
told journalists more than 50 percent of the votes cast on 
sunday went to the alliance known by its spanish acronym of arena 
he declined to be more specific saying complete returns would be 
ready shortly 
the announcement monday of a majority for arena signaled a 
triumph even greater than the rightists had predicted 
they had 13 deputies in the outgoing 60seat national assembly 
which the centrist christian democrats controlled with 33 seats 
arena appeared assured of at least 31 seats in the new chamber 
the party predicted it would have 35 local media projected 3335 
seats for the rightists the christian democrats were expected to 
get about 22 seats 
voters ignored a leftist guerrilla boycott call and threats of 
violence to cast ballots the guerrillas said the elections were 
illegitimate contending that free and fair elections could not be 
held in wartime 
washington sent el salvador almost 600 million in military and 
economic aid last year more than the amount given to any country 
in the hemisphere 
arena candidate armado calderon sol a 39yearold lawyer won 
the mayors race in san salvador the capital and home to 15 
million of the countrys 5 million people calderon sol defeated 
christian democratic candidate alejandro duarte the presidents 
son 
samayoa said arena won most of the rest of the countrys 
municipalities 
arena benefited from a groundswell of popular discontent with 
the christian democrats duarte won the presidency in 1984 on a 
platform of ending the war and improving the salvadoran economy 
the 8yearold war continues unemployment is estimated at 40 
percent and annual inflation is estimated at nearly 40 percent 
arenas campaign slogan was change for the better 
arena president alfredo cristiani who kept his assembly seat 
told the associated press his party would try to reach agreement on 
fundamental points with all parties represented in the legislature 
including how to wage the war 
if the guerrillas do not accept the proposal we will make 
them which will be the result of a national consensus they do not 
leave any other way out but a military solution he said 
he indicated that arena which has considerable support and good 
connections with military officers would work to step up 
offensives against the rebels 
this low intensity conflict idea should be erased he said 
referring to smallerscale usbacked counterinsurgency tactics 
that have been adopted by the salvadoran army 
in washington the state department hailed el salvadors 
national elections and called them a strong victory for the 
democratic process 
sen richard lugar rind who led an observer team named by 
president reagan called the election honest and important 
because power transferred peacefully and the rebels didnt 
win 
state department spokesman charles redman asked whether the 
reagan administration had any reservations about a rightist 
victory said that we dont choose sides in these kinds of 
elections 
the fiercely nationalistic arena was formed in 1981 with 
retired army maj roberto daubuisson its founder daubuisson has 
strongly criticized the united states and is considered the driving 
force behind early 1980s deathsquads

a quasigovernmental panel has recommended that 
woodburning fireplaces be banned by 1994 to cut air pollution but 
the proposal was attacked by home builders 
you can ban woodburning but you cant ban bricks and 
mortar said arlene quenan of the colorado association of home 
builders youre going to have real trouble when people say i 
want a fireplace in my new home 
in its proposal monday the metropolitan air quality council 
subcommittee said that within five years all newly installed 
fireplaces should be fueled by natural gas and all existing 
woodburning fireplaces be put out of service or converted to gas 
the council will consider the ban on april 4 
colorado last year became the first state to require new

scientists have redesigned a potent 
natural poison so that it seeks out and kills cancer cells in the 
test tube signaling a possible new route for fighting some tumors 
a scientist says 
the poison so strong that a dose the size of a salt grain can 
kill a person may be harnessed for fighting breast cancers that 
have spread elsewhere in the body and some lung and brain tumors 
according to ira pastan of the national cancer institute 
the strategy takes advantage of the fact that some cancer cells 
display on their surface certain kinds of protein structures called 
receptors specific substances bind to each kind of receptor before 
they enter the cell 
normal cells have receptors too but the new work focuses on 
receptors that are far more numerous on cancer cells pastan told 
science writers at a seminar sponsored by the american cancer 
society 
using genetic engineering scientists essentially redesigned the 
gene that a common bacterium called pseudomonas aeruginosa uses to 
produce its potent poison called an endotoxin the bacteria can 
cause pink eye bacterial meningitis and pneumonia 
one portion of the endotoxin molecule seeks out normal cells and 
binds to them scientists deleted the portion of the gene 
responsible for creating that portion and substituted another so 
that the endotoxin produced by the gene would seek out cancer cells 
instead 
then they put the altered gene into a second kind of bacterium 
and put it to work the bacterium churned out multiple copies of 
the cancerseeking version of the poison 
pastan said monday that scientists have experimented with two 
types of redesigned poison each geared to a different receptor on 
cancer cells 
one the receptor for a hormone called interleukin2 is found 
in high concentrations on white blood cells in a disease called 
adult tcell leukemia which is found chiefly in the caribbean area 
and japan pastan said 
the other receptor binds either of two growthstimulating 
substances called epidermal growth factor or transforming growth 
factor alpha it is found in abundance in some lung cancer cells 
breast cancer cells and brain tumors called glioblastomas he said 
glioblastomas are untreatable now pastan said 
in test tube experiments the redesigned poisons sought out and 
killed cancer cells while largely ignoring normal cells he said 
the poison works by entering a cell and sabotaging the cells 
proteinmaking machinery 
pastan said such oncotoxins represent a step beyond a 
similar approach which is attaching a poison to a protein called 
an antibody that seeks out cancer cells that has been studied for 
some years and pastan said the antibody approach is now being 
studied in four ovarian cancer patients at the cancer institute 
their doses are aimed at looking for side effects and are too 
low to expect any effect against their tumors he said 
dick rauscher cancer society senior vice president for 
research called pastans new approach very promising 
it may one day be able to circumvent a problem with the antibody 
system that the bodys immune system quickly recognizes the 
antibodypoison combination as foreign and tries to destroy it he 
said

gil evans considered one of the most 
influential postwar jazz orchestrators and composers was

evans died sunday at age 75 
whatever new thing new ideas come up gil evans was right on

davis composed a tune he titled gil evans two or three days 
before evans death 
he called me up once in the middle of the night davis 
recalled monday and he said if you ever feel bad and low just 
listen to yourself on miles ahead and he hung up 
miles ahead birth of the cool porgy and bess and 
sketches of spain were albums evans orchestrated for davis who 
then was playing in his cool style 
evans earlier had been an arranger for his own band skinnay 
ennis and claude thornhill but became famous with davis he was 
considered one of jazzs greatest orchestrators along with duke 
ellington and todd dameron 
evans also arranged a collection of jazz classics for cannonball 
adderley and his own bands out of the cool which were marvels 
of harmonic subtlety and originality always openminded evans was 
planning to arrange a jimi hendrix album when the rock guitarist 
died in 1970 evans wrote his first film score for absolute 
beginners at age 74 
evans died sunday of peritonitis in cuernavaca mexico where he 
had gone with sons noah and miles to recuperate from a prostate 
operation 
evans widow anita said monday the gil evans orchestra will 
play a planned tour of northern europe and london and appearances 
at jazz festivals in umbria italy and new york conducted by her

tamil rebels armed with knives swords 
and axes attacked two villages in northern sri lanka early today 
and slashed 13 sinhalese civilians to death sri lankan military 
officials said 
three people including a woman and two children were reported 
hospitalized with serious injuries 
the latest deaths raised to at least 125 the number of civilians 
slain in their villages since march 2 most of the victims have 
been members of the sinhalese majority community on the island but 
22 of the victims were minority tamils killed in a reprisal raid on 
their community march 11 
the military officials said todays attacks occurred shortly 
after midnight in the villages of pudukulam and madavuvaithakulam 
they lie just south of vavuniya a town 130 miles northeast of 
colombo 
the officials who briefed reporters on condition their names 
not be used said at least six children and two women were among 
the victims 
they quoted police as blaming the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam for the attack the tigers militia the largest of the tamil 
rebel groups has rejected an indianbacked peace accord aimed at 
ending their nearly fiveyear separatist rebellion 
government officials have said the attacks on villages are aimed 
at disrupting a longrunning government resettlement program for 
poor sinhalese most of the slayings have occurred in the eastern 
district where the resettlement program has been having the 
greatest impact 
tamils who are mostly hindus make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million population they claim they are discriminated against by 
the majority sinhalese buddhists who control the government and 
military 
moderate tamils want more autonomy for their communites in the 
north and east of sri lanka where they predominate while 
militants are fighting for a separate nation 
sinhalese make up about 75 percent of the islands population 
the rest are moslems and descendants of early european colonizers 
after the peace accord was signed last july india sent more 
than 50000 troops to the island to try to stop the tigers 
continuing campaign 
india has become involved because it has more than 60 million 
ethnic tamils in its own southern states who are sympathetic to 
their sri lankan brethren

prosecutors today began questioning 
top officials about allegations of fraud and influence peddling 
and an opposition party charged that president roh taewoo aided 
massive corruption 
the central investigation department of the prosecutor generals 
office questioned six senior officials of the saemaul undong rural 
and urban development group and banned 26 people implicated in the 
investigation from leaving the country 
prosecutor kang wonil said officials of the home agriculture 
and fisheries education and sports ministries along with seoul 
city government officials were being investigated to see if they 
assisted fraud and corruption 
a major scandal arose after the government began a probe into 
allegations that saemaul and government officials embezzled 
millions of dollars sold government patronage and forced 
businesses to make illegal donations over the past six years 
an initial investigation revealed evidence of fraud and other 
crimes including diversion of government and private subsidies and 
concealment by government officials to protect saemaul prosecution 
officials said 
interpol the international police agency had been asked to 
help track down and return top saemaul official kim chintaek who 
fled the country last month kang said 
my investigation team will unearth all malpractices and make 
public the results of the probe kang told reporters 
chun kyunghwan the younger brother of former president chun 
doohwan and former head of saemaul is one of the suspects under 
investigation the younger chun returned to south korea on sunday 
after fleeing to japan last week when knowledge of the probe became 
public 
prosecutors said they are investigating charges saemaul 
officials used ties with the government to enrich themselves and 
government officials participated or covered up the corruption to 
protect the administration 
while he was president chun named his brother to head saemaul 
but chun is not being investigated in the scandal 
the party for peace and democracy the countrys secondlargest 
opposition party today charged that president roh aided saemaul 
officials involved in corruption when he was home minister in 1982 
the party demanded that roh be investigated by prosecutors and said 
it would conduct its own probe 
the blue house presidential office and prosecutors had no 
immediate response to the partys allegations 
former president chun who left office feb 25 at the end of a 
sevenyear term left monday on a private visit to the united 
states during which he is to meet president reagan and other top 
us officials 
the younger chun a powerful figure while his brother was in 
office resigned last year after being linked to gangsters who 
staged a bloody underworld struggle for power he indicated monday 
there had been irregularities within saemaul but gave no details 
saemaul a semiprivate organization that worked closely with 
government agencies was formed in 1971 to improve urban and rural 
living standards projects ranged from building model communities 
to organizing city dwellers to keep streets clean 
critics contend saemaul which has offices across the country 
worked over the years with successive authoritarian governments by 
promoting government interests and organizing support 
roh a former general who help put president chun in power with 
military backing in 1980 promised during election campaigns late 
last year to probe any official corruption under chun roh was 
elected on dec 16 
political sources who spoke on condition of anonymity say the 
roh government started the saemaul probe to discredit the former 
president who has tried to retain influence within the government 
several top chun supporters were quietly dropped from the governing 
democratic justice party last week 
but some government officials and leaders of the democratic 
justice party are concerned the saemaul probe could blacken the 
reputation of the roh government because of its close ties to chun 
the party also is worried the investigation could hurt its 
chances in national assembly elections next month

valentinos readytowear show featured such 
splendid finesse in details and fabrics that it should be called 
haute couture 
famous for his tailoring valentino outdid himself in mondays 
show suits and dresses with jackets hugged the body and lean 
skirts were just above the knee waists were always small and 
shoulders had enough padding for outline 
jackets included diagonallystriped suede numbers in russet 
ochre and purple with pompons at wrists and bodices a handsome 
raft of grey suits in plaids stripes and checks had turnedup and 
buttoned jacket hems 
boxy or fitted short alpaca coats in beige or bright colors or 
pastel plaid capes were the only coverups to the fancy suit 
display 
the wrapped checked or black leather suits were crisscrossed 
with black bands and bows which also appeared on evening wear 
valentino also fooled around with wool ropes for piping on black 
and white suits 
for evening wear valentino included satin rosettes and flowers 
intricate lace patterns on blouses brocade galore in both trousers 
and skirts 
at balmain erik mortensen also showed sophisticated short looks 
with the couture attention to detail though the whole line was 
simpler than valentinos 
there were new bolerotopped trouser suits in bright houndstooth 
checks with fullish tops on the pants 
in jewel tones the slim knit sheaths with their triplepleated 
bands at the hip were pareddown elegance while other outfits 
showed the couture touch with diagonal rays of heavy welt seaming 
the long pleated knit dinner skirts were applauded for their 
easy wearability 
like mortensen and valentino marc bohan at dior aimed for 
ladylike lines and fabrics with not much except color to rock the 
boat 
bohan kept to a basic daytime theme of blouson jackets with 
raglan sleeves over a narrow kneebaring skirt 
dazzling coats topped some of the short bright suits as other 
suits were paired with brightlystriped puffy marabou jackets a 
big trend for the paris touch next winter 
flowered and satintrimmed cocktail sheaths and suits also came 
out in black velvet 
though bohans lateday wear was usually dressedup and 
sophisticated he also showed flowered long or short sweaters over 
fuchsia or emerald flowing satin culottes for an informal athome 
evening

more than 9000 murders were committed in the 
soviet union last year but some types of major crimes declined due 
to the kremlins campaign against drinking and drugs radio moscow 
reported 
the staterun radios report in news bulletins on its 
international englishlanguage service was believed to be the 
first time the soviets have made public a comprehensive annual 
statistic for murders nationwide 
for years the soviets used to contend that their society had 
less crime than western countries but issued sparse statistics 
mondays radio moscow report was clearly linked to soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for glasnost or more openness 
on some issues that has brought franker reporting on the countrys 
social problems 
last year slightly over 9000 murders were registered in the 
ussr which is one third less than in the united states 
radio moscow said citing preliminary statistics 
it did not say where the figures for us homicides were 
obtained official statistics for last year have not yet been 
issued 
in 1986 according to the fbi there were 20613 murders in the 
united states up 86 percent from 18976 in 1985 
radio moscow said there was a drop last year in the incidence of 
some types of major crime in the soviet union but gave no details 
it quoted a soviet legal expert dr igor karpets as crediting 
the positive role of the antidrinking and antidrug drive 
launched under gorbachev for the decline in some crimes 
however there was no decrease last year in crimes against 
property such as burglaries radio moscow said without providing 
data 
this year police in moscow have begun issuing weekly reports 
through the official tass news agency on the number of murders 
rapes and other crimes committed in the capital 
soviet officials are also working on a revision of the countrys 
criminal code

the government today shut down 
a militant antiapartheid newspaper for 12 weeks contending the 
churchbacked new nation threatened public safety 
a special decree issued by home affairs minister stoffel botha 
said further issues of the blackoriented weekly newspaper are 
totally prohibited through june 10 
he acted a day after the newspaper published by the southern 
african catholic bishops conference lost a court appeal seeking to 
forestall government action while it challenged stateofemergency 
censorship regulations 
technically the new nation could resume publication after three 
months but botha could close it again if its contents dissatisfied 
him the papers senior staff has not announced whether operations 
will be resumed after the suspension 
with a circulation of 50000 to 60000 the 2yearold newspaper 
is the largest in south africa to devote virtually its entire 
content including sports and entertainment sections to 
politicallyrelated developments 
the newspaper had a fulltime staff of 22 and employed 32 
correspondents who covered antiapartheid activity in the rural 
areas where the majority of blacks live several employees already 
had resigned in anticipation of closure by botha who disclosed his 
intentions in january 
the newspapers editor zwelakhe sisulu has been detained 
without charge for 16 months he joined the new nation after a year 
as a niemann fellow at harvard university 
authorities have banned four of the papers editions and seized 
two police have raided the papers offices and it was the first 
of six publications warned by botha that they could be closed for 
threemonth periods or censored for publishing material he found 
objectionable 
stateofemergency regulations give botha nearly unlimited 
powers to deal with newspapers he feels might contribute to unrest 
he does not have to give reasons for his actions 
the new nation lost an initial court challenge of the 
regulations and intends to pursue its case in an appellate court 
but on monday a supreme court rejected the newspapers bid to 
prevent closure during the appeal process 
the new nations acting editor gabu tugwana said closure of 
his paper would be an action against the whole media 
there are many more axes hanging in the air that will fall on 
many others he said referring to warnings issued by botha to 
other publications 
in a warning letter to the new nation botha cited several items 
which he said threatened public safety promoted revolution 
enhanced the image of outlawed organizations or fomented hostility 
toward the security forces 
the items he listed included 
a picture of oliver tambo president of the outlawed african 
national congress opening a new office in nairobi kenya 
a story about an arson attack on the offices of the united 
democratic front the nations largest antiapartheid coalition 
a picture of relatives of condemned blacks at a news conference 
in which they appealed for clemency for 32 men and women sentenced 
to hang 
an advertisement quoting a psalm and urging the government to 
abolish torture

an unprecedented number of dissidents and 
intellectuals from six east european nations have signed an appeal 
for recognition of the right to object to military service 
the appeal published monday in vienna was signed by 77 
soviets including andrei sakharov nuclear physicist and 1975 
nobel peace laureate 
the signatories from hungary czechoslovakia the soviet union 
east germany poland and yugoslavia called for recognition of 
citizens right to conscientious objection and alternative 
service 
the appeal was addressed to the 35nation conference on security 
and cooperation in europe which has been meeting in vienna since 
november 1986 to review compliance with the 1975 helsinki accords 
on military security economic coopertion and humanitarian issues 
the appeal asked the delegations to work toward an agreement on 
the right not to serve in the military 
hungarian dissident writer miklos haraszti who signed the 
appeal and helped initiate it told a news conference monday that 
conscientious objection was one of the main reasons for political 
imprisonment in eastern europe 
hundreds of our east european compatriots are sent to prison 
because of their nonviolent conscientious stands the appeal 
said these young men would like to serve the community by caring 
for the old and sick instead of performing military service 
haraszti said no country in the warsaw pact allows its citizens 
the right to object to military service while nato countries do 
eastern europe punishes people for not wanting to look at 
other countries as enemies he said 
haraszti said 438 people and groups have signed the appeal so 
far 
the londonbased east european cultural foundation which helped 
coordinate collecting signatures said in a news release it was the 
first time a large number of soviet citizens joined a joint east 
bloc initiative 
haraszti said the appeal the fourth such joint effort of east 
european dissidents carried the largest number of signatures so 
far 
peter uhl a member of the czechoslovak human rights group 
charter 77 was invited to come to vienna for presentation of the 
appeal 
however in a letter read in part at the news conference and 
then distributed uhl complained that no czechoslovak citizens 
including those who have passports could go to vienna in response 
to your invitation 
his letter said internationalization of our demands is 
also very important because it provides a comparison between the 
legal and factual state of affairs prevailing in the individual 
east european countries 
dissidents in east bloc countries estimated the total number of 
people in prison for objecting to military service at about 300 to 
400

three former du pont co employees who 
won a 75 million personal injury award say they hope to give 675 
million to six institutions to help others who suffer from exposure 
to asbestos 
we are making these donations as our best effort to try to 
help our fellow asbestos victims as well as to help assure that 
this kind of abuse of public trust will never happen again 
william kapp jr 55 one of the victims and spokesman for the 
group said monday 
kapp of elkton md james webb 74 of newport and joseph 
kaster 71 of the newport area said the money would be donated if 
the damage award is upheld on appeal 
in november a superior court jury ordered raymark industries 
inc of trumbull conn to pay the men and their wives punitive 
damages for conspiring to hide the health hazards of asbestos 
judge clarence w taylor has yet to decide whether to uphold the 
award if it is upheld raymark plans to appeal according to 
legrande l young raymark general counsel 
even if it is upheld kapp said he realizes the award may never 
be paid for several reasons including the fact there are still 350 
asbestosrelated cases pending against raymark in delaware and 
last week a mistrial was declared in a trial in which raymark was 
ordered to pay 22 million to two other former du pont employees 
if taylor upholds the 75 million kapp said it could force 
raymark into bankruptcy 
this way someone will get something were not trying to hog 
it all if we force them into bankruptcy it will at least go to 
charity kapp said 
on the question of bankruptcy thats a possibility young 
said 
raymark does not have 75 million but does have more than that 
in insurance he said 
the national campaign against toxic hazards a toxic victims 
advocacy group based in boston was earmarked for 13 million of 
the award 
other institutions to receive 13 million each would be the 
mount sinai school of environmental medicine in new york the 
university of delaware school of business the medical center of 
delawares carpenter clinic for cancer research and the 
baltimorebased white lung association for asbestos victims 
the emily p bissell hospital for the critically ill in newport 
was earmarked for 25 million

actors in television and radio commercials 
set aside script lines for picket lines launching the second day 
of the second strike to hit the entertainment industry this month 
we are now officially on strike against the producers of 
television and radio commericals no new negotiations are 
scheduled said a spokesman on a taped hotline recording today at 
the screen actors guild 
the 100000 joint members of the screen actors guild and the 
american federation of radio and television artists called their 
strike monday against the joint policy committee of the american 
association of advertising agencies and the association of national 
advertisers 
the union rejected a management offer of immediate fee increases 
in exchange for dropping a costofliving adjustment and 
advertisers refused to accept a proposed tiered pay system for 
cable tv commercials based on the number of cable subscribers 
the strike which affects only radio and television commercials 
is the second by hollywood talent unions in less than a month the 
writers guild of america has entered the third week of its walkout 
against motion picture and television producers 
john a mcguinn the chief management negotiator urged 
advertising companies to hire nonunion talent but some companies 
said they would wait out the strike before beginning new ad 
campaigns 
the ads with nonunion actors just wont look as good it will 
be a lot like the replacement players who filled in during the 
football strike said one advertising executive who asked not to 
be named 
the los angeles office of the new york advertising firm della 
femina travisano amp partners said it probably will hold off on new 
ads for one of its major clients isuzu actor david leisure who 
plays the part of outrageous liar joe isuzu is a guild member 
the striking actors on monday picketed offices of the ogilvy and 
mather agency in los angeles and honolulu in new york city 
strikers set up picket lines at general motors plaza during a gm 
board meeting pickets also walked in chicago and miami 
ken orsatti sags national executive secretary sent telegrams 
to the major candidates asking them to use only ads with union 
actors by signing interim agreements with the unions 
mcguinn however said the advertising companies dont see any 
problem during a strike 
were producing commercials today were producing commercials 
tomorrow he said we have nonunion talent thats willing to 
work our doors are open 
meanwhile there were no talks scheduled between the 
9000member writers guild of america and the producers alliance 
to end that strike however a guild spokesman said scriptwriters 
are ready to return to the bargaining table 
scriptwriters have demanded higher fees from foreign 
distribution more creative control and a management proposal to 
restructure fees for onehour television shows sold into 
syndication

a girl who became the first cancer patient to 
receive a bonemarrow transplant through a computerized national 
registry apparently is free of leukemia hospital officials say 
brooke ward 7 will return home saturday to raleigh nc 
recent tests have found no cancer and at 100 days her operation 
at fred hutchinson cancer research institute is considered a 
success 
one thing brooke apparently wont miss is the attention that 
accompanied publicity for the national bone marrow donor registry 
based in minneapolisst paul 
mommy brooke complained holding out her arms to mother 
margurite ward as a reporter and photographer approached not 
this again 
the reason we agreed to the media coverage is that we wanted 
people to know about the registry mrs ward said we wanted 
people to know a bone marrow transplant could be done with a 
nonrelated donor 
the registry located diane walters 49 of milwaukee whose 
tissue type matched brookes the transplant was performed dec 16 
shes doing fine mrs ward said i just feel brooke is 
going to make it shes already beaten the odds 
another piece of the story is fundraising a tough job without 
news coverage 
bonemarrow transplants like brookes cost an average of 
100000 and fundraising for her treatment began even before the 
registry match 
the family is covered by private insurance for 80 percent of the 
transplant costs fundraising was still necessary to cover the 
expenses of moving to seattle loss of income or any further 
medical costs 
without the media coverage it would have been real hard to 
raise the money mrs ward said 
there are a lot of people who cant get a transplant because 
they cant get funds said susan edmonds a spokeswoman for fred 
hutchinson the nonprofit cancer center is prohibited from doing 
fundraising for individuals

serious legal problems have blocked the 
extradition of a former argentine general accused of overseeing 
mass kidnappings and murder during his countrys military rule in 
the 1970s 
assistant us attorney mark zanides on monday acknowledged that 
the fiveyear deadline under us law for charging carlos suarez 
mason with the 23 kidnappings already has expired 
zanides blames carlos suarez mason for a systematic pattern of 
abduction torture and murder by his troops in argentina during 
the military rule of the late 1970s 
zanides urged us district judge d lowell jensen to apply 
california law in the extradition hearings under which the 
kidnappings could still be prosecuted but under questioning from 
jensen zanides conceded that there was no precedent for such a 
ruling 
suarez mason 63 commander of the first army corps in buenos 
aires from 1976 to 1978 is charged separately with the murders of 
43 people mostly prisoners by his troops during the socalled 
dirty war against suspected leftists 
after serving as head of the joint chiefs of staff and the 
staterun oil monopoly he fled when a civilian government came to 
power in 1983 he was arrested in january 1986 at his home in 
foster city south of san francisco and is being held without bail 
jensen is expected to rule on the extradition later after a 
hearing that lasted nearly all day he called a recess until april 
6 and indicated he may rule then 
the judge ruled favorably for the prosecution on one issue 
refusing to admit testimony aimed at showing that the charges and 
extradition were politically motivated because president raul 
alfonsin an opponent of the former military government promised 
to prosecute generals during his campaign in 1983 
suarez masons lawyers argue he was not responsible for his 
soldiers actions and that the actions were political and 
therefore exempt from extradition under the treaty between the 
united states and argentina

a pair of bachelor brothers who quietly 
amassed a small fortune left more than 15 million to the high 
school they attended more than 70 years ago 
for most of this century arthur and edgar simionescu lived 
quietly together in a modest way but the brothers who lived into 
their 90s amassed a fortune through shrewd investments in stocks 
and bonds 
they left all their money estimated at more than 15 million 
after taxes to hackensack high school for a collegescholarship 
endowment 
this was really a drop out of the blue said principal 
harold bloom who like his colleagues never heard of the 
simionescus until after they died in 1986 three months apart 
it totally surprised us what should i say its like manna 
neither edgar a machinist nor arthur a stamp collector who 
was confined to a wheelchair because of a teenage bout with polio 
ever went to college 
edgar entered hackensack high in 1904 and arthur followed five 
years later but they were never big boosters after graduating 
they wanted to do something that would have some longevity to 
it i think they wanted to help young people said their lawyer 
eugene gilmartin 
the brothers had investments some dating back to the 1920s 
in dozens of companies ranging from atlantic richfield to united 
jersey bank 
when arthur died in 1986 of heart failure edgars health was 
failing and he was never told his brother was dead but he kept 
asking for arthur edgar died three months later also of heart 
failure 
their bequest should provide more than 100000 in scholarships

israeli troops shot and killed a palestinian 
man in the occupied west bank during a clash with protesters 
hurling rocks metal bars and bottles an army spokeswoman said 
today 
in the occupied gaza strip the body of another palestinian was 
found in an orchard in the village of beit hanoun israel radio 
said 
the army denied involvement in the gaza death but a resident of 
the village said the mans family believed he had been beaten by 
soldiers his skull was crushed 
in the west bank the army spokeswoman said an arabs body was 
found this morning after a monday night clash in tubas a village 
50 miles north of jerusalem 
the arabowned palestine press service identified the man as 
26yearold hikmet drajmeh the agency said troops shot and wounded 
two more protesters one of them seriously but the army denied the 
report 
the spokeswoman who could not be identified under army 
regulations said the clash erupted when hundreds of palestinians 
attacked an army patrol with rocks metal bars and bottles 
the soldiers shot to extricate themselves from a 
lifethreatening situation she said 
the killing brought the palestinian death toll to 107 in almost 
four months of unrest according to unofficial un figures one 
israeli soldier has been killed by arab gunfire 
in the gaza strip a military spokesman said no troops had been 
in beit hanoun monday and so the army could not have been involved 
a resident said the victims family suspected the army was 
responsible because the body was found in an isolated area off 
limits to villagers 
a third palestinian died today when he was shot from a passing 
car in the southern gaza strip by assailants assumed to be arabs 
israel army radio said an army spokesman said the motive was 
apparently criminal 
both gaza killings were turned over to the police the army 
said but gaza police officials were quoted by israel radio as 
saying they were unable to investigate many crimes due to the mass 
resignations last week of 380 arab officers 
the officers resigned along with most of their arab colleagues 
in the west bank in accordance with orders issued by underground 
leaders of what palestinians call the uprising 
in other casualties today officials at the ahli arab hospital 
in gaza city said two men were admitted with injuries inflicted by 
israeli troops 
in other west bank unrest an israeli driver fired shots near 
the balata refugee camp near nablus after his car was stoned 
israel radio reported there were no injuries 
in the west bank members of two arab councils resigned today a 
day after an underground leaflet called for israeliappointed 
municipal officials to leave their jobs 
palestinian leaders also called for increased attacks with 
stones firebombs and iron bars on israeli security forces and 
jewish settlers 
the call came as several centerleft israeli politicians and 
writers joined rightwing leaders in demanding tougher measures to 
quell the violence in the west bank and gaza strip 
also monday the army issued a new regulation that will allow 
the detention of any security prisoner for up to six months with 
less judicial review the previous edict required a military judge 
to review each case within 96 hours 
officials said the new regulation would ease the overload on the 
military court system that has handled nearly 3000 cases since the 
violent demonstrations began in the occupied lands on dec 8 
and israeli troops on monday expanded their search for weapons 
in the occupied lands following the fatal shooting sunday of 
israeli sgt moshe katz in bethlehem 
defense minister yitzhak rabin lifted restrictions barring 
soldiers from shooting at rioters throwing firebombs and for the 
first time the army destroyed the homes of three arabs suspected of 
throwing such missiles 
the increasing violence in the occupied lands drew demands for 
action from israelis usually opposed to the measures of the 
rightist likud coalition led by prime minister yitzhak shamir 
amnon lynn a legislator from the opposition labor party told 
itim on monday the political echelon must understand we cannot 
continue with the policy of restraint there is a time to hold back 
and a time to attack the time has come for israel to respond with 
force

scientists have doubled the fiveyear 
survival rate of earlystage lung cancer patients by activating 
their immune systems to attack cancerous cells a researcher 
reports 
patients who received the experimental therapy showed a 63 
percent survival rate five years after cancer surgery compared 
with 33 percent for patients who received no treatment after 
surgery said ariel hollinshead of the george washington university 
medical center 
its come off very well hollinshead said monday after 
describing results to science writers at an american cancer society 
symposium 
surgery to remove lung cancer tumors often leaves cancer cells 
behind in the new treatment patients were injected after surgery 
with proteins drawn from other lung cancer tumors those antigens 
helped the body defend against cancer cells left behind by surgery 
hollinshead said 
other cancer experts said they were impressed but added that 
more work was needed 
for earlystage cancer it looks like its going to give 
people at least a 50 percent chance of being around five years 
later while other postsurgical treatment does little good said 
john minton professor of surgical oncology at the ohio state 
university college of medicine in columbus ohio 
the problem is its small numbers he said of the trial 
which included 81 patients it looks good but we need more 
numbers 
any time such a jump in survival rates can be demonstrated 
youve got to be impressed said dick rauscher senior cancer 
society vice president for research 
but he said that as with any such finding he wants to see 
another group of researchers achieve the same success to confirm 
the effectiveness of the therapy 
hollinshead said the results are part of a 234patient study 
that recently reported fiveyear survival rates of 69 percent in 
the treated group and 49 percent in the untreated group 
lung cancer is the nations leading cancer killer every year 
striking 152000 americans and killing 139000 
only about 30 percent of lung cancer cases at most are diagnosed 
as early in their progression as the cases in the study rauscher 
said 
the cancers in the 81 patients were confined to the lung tissue 
or spread only to nearby lymph nodes representing socalled stages 
1 and 2 in later stages cancer spreads elsewhere in the body 
all the patients went through surgery to remove cancerous 
tissue the experimental therapy began about two weeks later 
hollinshead said 
once a month for three months they were injected with doses of 
proteins called antigens that had been purified from other lung 
cancer tumors 
the injections spurred the immune system into raising defenses 
aimed at cells bearing the same kinds of antigens so the body was 
primed to mop up cancer cells missed by the surgery 
hollinshead said 
fiftythree patients received the experimental therapy with 
injections in one or both arms while the untreated 28 patients 
were simply followed for comparison purposes 
side effects were limited to a slight fever overnight and skin 
irritation at the injection sites hollinshead said 
standard treatment after surgery often involves just waiting to 
see if any further cancer crops up said minton radiation is 
sometimes used but the fiveyear results are terrible theyre 
like you didnt get much treatment at all 
chemotherapeutic drugs do not help either said rauscher 
james bd mark head of the division of thoracic surgery at the 
stanford university school of medicine said previous attempts at 
immune systembased therapy had not met with such success 
but he said a potential weak point in the study was the mixing 
of stage 1 and stage 2 patients because they have such different 
natural fiveyear survival rates respectively of more than 60 
percent and about 30 percent or less 
hollinshead replied that patients were assigned randomly to 
treatment or the nontreatment groups so that those two groups 
remained comparable

mayor frank fasi has proposed legislation to 
stop foreign investors from purchasing some kinds of property in 
hawaii saying the measure would put an end to skyrocketing housing 
and real estate costs 
the mayor on monday sent a bill to the state legislature that 
would ban the sale of residential agricultural or preservation 
land to nonamericans the bill does not cover commercial resort 
and industrial properties 
the mayors move comes as the state attempts to deal with a 
recent wave of foreign investment that has caused property values 
to jump in some areas the investment has been spurred by the fall 
of the dollars value against the japanese yen 
what has triggered my action is the japanese buyer with his 
cheap dollars fasi told the professional womens network on 
monday they have been buying homes in several areas of oahu 
forcing values to unprecedented levels 
fasi said he does not consider his move protectionist 
i believe in free and open trade between most countries 
fasi said but i also believe in fairness and what i see 
happening here is not fair to americans 
a spokesman for state senate president richard wong said fasis 
bill was under review and may be included in the legislative agenda 
the city council is considering a number of bills to curb 
japanese investment and ease the property tax burden on oahu 
homeowners

injured and 39 arrested during a nationwide protest strike that 
brought the most extensive violence this year police reported 
today 
dozens of buses delivery vans and private cars were stoned or 
firebombed on monday the 28th anniversary of the sharpeville 
massacre and in many cases security forces used tear gas rubber 
bullets birdshot and dogs to disperse rioters police headquarters 
said 
police said the two deaths and five of the injuries resulted 
from attacks by blacks on blacks two blacks were injured by police 
several of those arrested were trying to prevent children from 
going to school and workers from going to work police said 
the protest strike was organized by antiapartheid activists in 
defiance of emergency regulations barring calls for such actions 
hundreds of thousands of black workers and students stayed away 
from jobs and classes both to mark the anniversary of the 1960 
police shootings of 69 blacks in sharpeville and to protest the 
recent bannings of black opposition groups 
the department of education and training said class boycotts 
were reported at 694 of the black schools under its control 9 
percent of the total 
the star of johannesburg the countrys largest daily newspaper 
said protest strikes would continue as long as grievances are not 
directly addressed 
instead of tension being relieved through the extension of 
rights and the removal of restrictions each new round of protests 
is met with further clamps which inevitably lead to fresh 
protests 
five students from johannesburgs university of the 
witwatersrand went to local police headquarters today with a bunch 
of roses for rosemary hunter the president of the student council 
who was detained under stateofemergency regulations monday 
the students said a police lieutenant refused to accept the 
bouquet and told them this is a police station not a hospital 
ms hunter a law student was taken from her parents home at 
dawn monday 
police have not commented on the detention 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national

dr patrick steptoe the gynecologist who 
pioneered the test tube baby technique that made parenthood 
possible for thousands of otherwise infertile couples has died at 
age 74 
a family announcement today said steptoe had been suffering from 
cancer he died monday night in the chaucer hospital in canterbury 
62 miles southeast of london 
steptoe continued working until recently despite deteriorating 
health his longtime partner physiologist robert edwards said 
it is a very great loss to bourn hall their clinic and to me 
personally said edwards in the last three years he was 
working under considerable difficulties but carried on 
together steptoe and edwards were responsible for the worlds 
first test tube baby louise joy brown born at oldham in northern 
england on july 25 1978 
the announcement of the birth of the healthy baby from an embryo 
fertilized outside her mothers womb caused shock waves at the 
time the testtube baby technique known as in vitro 
fertilization has since been used in clinics around the world 
louise browns birth was hailed as a miracle by some and 
criticized as a wrong use of scientific techniques by others 
including the roman catholic church 
but steptoe avoided the controversy 
i am not a wizard or a frankenstein he said all i want 
to do is to help women whose childproducing mechanism is slightly 
faulty 
louise now a schoolgirl was conceived after an egg was removed 
from her mother lesley brown and fertilized outside the womb with 
the sperm of her husband truck driver john brown returned to the 
womb the embryo developed a normal pregnancy 
in their early years of research in the late 1960s and early 
1970s steptoe and edwards were ostracized by much of the medical 
establishment and once turned down for a medical research council 
grant but that changed after louises birth last year steptoe 
and edwards were made commanders of the british empire and steptoe 
also received one of britains highest academic honors and was made 
a fellow of the royal society 
in vitro fertilization was devised mainly to relieve infertility 
in women with blocked or damaged fallopian tubes the normal site 
of conception 
under the procedure ova are removed from the woman and 
fertilized with the prospective fathers sperm in a laboratory 
dish resulting embryos often more than one then are implanted 
in the womb 
some embryos are now frozen for later use there have been 
thousands of babies born worldwide to otherwise infertile couples 
as a result of in vitro fertilization 
steptoe who was born june 9 1913 qualified as a doctor in 
1939 and immediately went into world war ii service as a royal navy 
surgeon he was a prisoner of war in italy from 1941 to 1943 and 
was demobilized with the rank of surgeon lieutenant commander in 
1946 
he worked as an obstetrician in state hospitals moving in 1951 
to oldham a grimy northern england city where in the fall of 1967 
he teamed up with edwards a cambridge university physiologist 
they formed a trusted friendship and set up a research 
laboratory at oldham 
steptoe silverhaird bespectacled and always impeccably 
dressed had a formidable reputation for hard work 
louise brown was conceived and born at no cost to her parents 
under britains statefunded national health service but after an 
argument with the government health department about the high cost 
of his work steptoe quit the service in 1978 
he and edwards set up their clinic at bourn hall an 11th 
century castle near cambridge in 1980 
steptoe is survived by his wife sheena whom he married in 
1943 and a son and daughter

astronomers say a vague prediction by the 
16thcentury astrologer nostradamus has caused unfounded fear that 
an alignment of planets will trigger an earthquake that will 
destroy los angeles in may 
there is no alignment of planets in may and even if there 
were it wouldnt have anything to do with earthquakes edwin 
krupp director of griffith observatory said monday 
but rumors of an impending earthquake spurred by writings of 
the french astrologer and the movie the man who saw tomorrow 
which is being sold on videocassette prompted more than 100 
fearful people to call the observatory in recent weeks krupp said 
we an tell by the phone calls that many people are getting 
needlessly afraid of the possibility of an earthquake he said 
calling the quake predictions bunk 
astronomer john mosley the observatorys program supervisor 
wrote recently there are 11000 earthquakes each year in the los 
angeles area strong enough to be recorded there may be a 
significant earthquake in may 1988 here or elsewhere but if 
there is it will have nothing to do with the planets positions 
mosley said followers of nostradamus who lived from 1503 to 
1566 have claimed he predicted such events as the russian 
revolution the assassinations of john and robert kennedy and the 
japanese attack on pearl harbor 
but nostradamus predictions written in rhyme are 
exceptionally vague and in general it is only after the fact that 
a link can be made between his rhymed prediction and an historical 
event mosley said 
he said the man who saw tomorrow claimed nostradamus wrote 
that an alignment of saturn jupiter mercury venus and mars will 
cause a major earthquake in may in los angeles 
the prophecy is quoted incorrectly in the movie mosley 
said nostradamus predicts a severe hailstorm not an earthquake 
there is no clue that tells us where this hailstorm will 
occur 
mosley said the last time the planets were supposed to align 
and trigger mass destruction in los angeles was in 1982 the year 
of the jupiter effect a book that claims the planets tidal 
influence causes quakes 
untold millions did not die in 1982 and theres no reason to 
think that anything will happen in 1988 he said even if the 
planets were aligned their gravitational effect would be 
completely negligible and they would have no effect on our 
planets weather tides or earthquakes mosley added

strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
offered to resign before the may 1989 presidential election if 
opponents agree to talks with his regime but the opposition and 
the united states rejected the offer 
the general has to go immediately not eventually said 
aurelio barria head of the national civic crusade an opposition 
umbrella group there will be no dialogue with him 
barria said the general strike which shut down over 90 percent 
of this nations commerce on monday would be even more complete 
today 
indeed most stores in the downtown area remained shuttered 
today 
i say this to noriega phooey said one downtown panama city 
merchant guarding his closed dry goods shop 
in washington the state department also dismissed noriegas 
resignation offer as little more than a ploy to keep 
noriegas cronies in power and the general in control of the armed 
forces 
noreiga should go and the sooner the better for panama 
said state department spokeswoman anita stockman 
after noriega was indicted on us drug charges the reagan 
administration dried up the flow of money to panama which uses the 
us dollar as its currency in an effort to force him out and the 
economy is near collapse 
noriegas offer to resign announced monday night in a national 
broadcast by civilian chief of state manuel solis palma was 
conditioned on a national dialogue with the opposition but 
opposition leader guillermo cochez of the christian democratic 
party said the proposed dialogue involved a handpicked 33member 
panel that would have 22 pronoriega members 
this is not a dialogue said cochez its just cynicism 
noriega the chief of panamas 15000member defense forces and 
the power behind the civilian government left the presidential 
palace after solis palmas speech and hailed his proposal as a 
panamanian solution rather than one imposed by the united states 
i have no reason to talk to the united states noriega told 
reporters i talk to panamanians 
in his speech solis palma said noriega had given his word as 
an officer and a gentleman to step down before elections 
scheduled for may 1989 
solis palma elevated to chief of state when noriega ousted 
president eric arturo delvalle on feb 26 said he would accept the 
generals resignation only after the dialogue 
opposition leaders derided the proposal 
he said here i have a little piece of candy and if you all 
behave ill give it to you okay said businessman pierre 
leignadier a crusade member leignadier called the idea an insult 
to the panamanian people 
crusade leaders said they expected even stronger support today 
for the general strike despite noriegas offer 
on monday the strike almost totally shut down the capital of 
this nation of 25 million and according to the crusade outlying 
cities and towns as well 
the paralyzation is total in industry finance and commerce 
said business leader carlos gonzalez de la lastra 
about half of government employees who were warned they would 
be suspended if they went on strike failed to show up for work 
he said 
the strike was called after the government decreed a state of 
emergency last week allowing authorities to suspend constitutional 
rights 
solis palma said on monday the reagan administration says they 
want a country without drug traffickers but that continued us 
control of the panama canal was the real motive behind the attack 
on noriega 
delvalle tried to fire noriega on feb 25 after two us drug 
trafficking indictments against noriega were handed up in florida 
after noriega orchestrated delvalles ouster on feb 26 the 
united states froze panamas international bank accounts leaving 
the government and many private businesses without cash to pay 
employees 
retirees were told monday they will not be paid this week the 
dockworkers union official gustavo gonzalez said solis palma told 
union leaders in a meeting at the presidential palace sunday the 
country had no more money 
after the government was unable to give full paychecks to 
employees last week several national police members tried and 
failed to stage a military coup and thousands of antinoriega 
rioters took the streets 
one man hit by an army shotgun blast during last weeks violence 
died monday of his wounds becoming the first death in the latest 
wave of unrest 
also monday the panamanian defense forces announced a shakeup 
kicking out 17 officers connected with the coup attempt and 
promoting 98 loyal officers

liquid carbonics industries inc a chicagobased gas 
distributor is recalling cylinders containing the gas silane 
following the blast at the gollob analytical services plant here 
thursday said richard fulton a spokesman for the state department 
of environmental protection 
a spokeswoman for the company in chicago said it was 
investigating the origin of the cylinder that exploded but declined 
to confirm the recall or comment further 
the explosion was triggered by a silane cylinder that was 
contaminated with nitrous oxide a highly unstable mixture fulton 
said 
the blast killed three people seriously injured a liquid 
carbonics employee and forced the evacuation of 1500 people living 
near the plant 
fulton said liquid carbonics on monday removed cylinders of 
silane from its harrison nj storage facility phone calls to 
liquid carbonics in harrison were unanswered 
elsewhere about 1000 workers were kept from their jobs monday 
in california after canisters containing potentially explosive 
chemicals were discovered at semiconductor facilities there 
chemical inspectors eventually concluded that four canisters at 
advanced micro devices inc in santa clara and teledyne 
semiconductor in mountain view were harmless and work was 
scheduled to resume today 
another 150 cylinders stored at a liquid carbonics plant in san 
carlos where they are manufactured were expected to be examined 
tuesday officials said company officials feared the canisters 
might have come from the same batch as the one that blew up 
at a gould inc semiconductor plant in pocatello idaho another 
possibly contaminated silane cylinder bought from liquid carbonics 
was emptied sunday after employees and residents of a nearby 
nursing home were evacuated said a spokesman at goulds 
headquarters in chicago 
new jersey officials said monday another potentially dangerous 
cylinder of silane that prompted officials to evacuate residents 
friday night continued to burn at the gollob plant 
two other potentially hazardous canisters at the site were 
removed sunday fulton said about 200 nonhazardous cylinders of 
gas remained at the site 
state officials have not conducted an inventory of the gutted 
gollob building and were trying to decide whether to let the 
flaming cylinder burn itself out fulton said 
evacuees were allowed to return to their homes sunday and 
businesses near the gollob plant were allowed to reopen monday

a group of residents in this western pacific 
island chain have started a drive to have palau declared a 
commonwealth of the united states citing a need for us law 
enforcement agencies 
the palau america association wrote to president reagan and 
lawmakers monday informing them of a petition drive aimed at 
placing a constitutional amendment on palaus november election 
ballot 
palau the last pacific territory still under us trusteeship 
since world war ii has entered into a compact of free association 
with the united states that measure is still awaiting 
implementation in congress 
this movement is born out of a belated realization by many 
palauans that the future wellbeing of palau and a majority of its 
people will not be protected under a compact of free association 
without the presence of us federal law enforcement agencies 
said a letter from francisco t uludong who is working on the 
petition drive 
volunteers need signatures of 25 percent of the electorate 
about 2000 people

soviet soldiers have been taken prisoner by eritrean separatists 
and another is missing in ethiopia 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told reporters 
at a news briefing that 13 soviet military advisers were captured 
in ethiopia last week by forces fighting to establish an eritrean 
state separate from the government of addis ababa 
recently the socalled peoples front for the liberation of 
eritrea has intensified combat operations gerasimov said 
he said nine of the soviets captured had returned to their 
command posts three had been identified by their captors as 
prisoners of war and one remained missing 
the spokesman said the soldiers were serving as military 
advisers in ethiopia which has strong political ties to the soviet 
union 
gerasimov had no other details of the incident or the conditions 
in which the soviet captives are being held

the united states can have great certainty 
that it will spot any soviet attempts to cheat on the treaty 
eliminating mediumrange atomic missiles from europe the senate 
intelligence committee unanimously concluded today 
the testimony came as the senate foreign relations committee 
began working on the final details of the pact after two months of 
testimony on the treaty signed dec 8 by president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the foreign relations committee is reviewing the pact senate 
democratic leaders say they expect the treaty will be approved by 
the full chamber next month 
leaders of both parties have predicted the final tally will show 
88 to 90 votes for the treaty far more than the 67 needed for 
ratification 
as part of the senate review the intelligence committee looked 
at american ability to monitor soviet compliance through a variety 
of means including onsite ground inspection and satellites 
the intelligence community will be able to monitor the 
drawdown and elimination of declared soviet missile launchers and 
associated equipment with great certainty said the report which 
was unanimously approved by the committee 
but sen david boren dokla chairman of the intelligence 
committee told the foreign relations committee that more money 
needs to be spent to be sure of finding soviet attempts to cheat on 
a separate treaty making deep cuts in longrange atomic weapons 
that prospective treaty is now being worked on by american and 
soviet negotiators 
the interests of the united states are served by effective 
verifiable limitations on nuclear weapons said boren indeed 
such limitations must continue to be pursued vigorously long after 
the issue of ratification of the mediumrange missile treaty has 
been been resolved 
sen william cohen rmaine vice chairman of the intelligence 
committee warned the foreign relations panel that no 
verification and monitoring regime can be absolutely perfect 
despite the expected outcome the pact has come under fire from 
both democrats and conservative republicans 
democrats led by sen joseph biden ddel are considering 
attaching a legal condition to the treaty which provides that the 
interpretation given by administration officials during treaty 
hearings is binding on future administrations 
democratic officials were working late monday to agree on some 
type of language but no final proposal had been approved 
according to congressional sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the proposal arises from the ongoing dispute between the reagan 
administration and congressional democrats over reagans assertion 
that he has the legal right unilaterally to change the us 
interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
that change would allow some tests of reagans star wars 
antimissile defense system but congressional democrats have 
argued that any alteration in how a treaty is interpreted should 
first be approved by the senate 
the white house told congressional democrats last week it 
opposed the democraticbacked effort to attach a condition to the 
treaty because the condition would require the executive branch to 
adhere to every statement made by administration officials during 
the hearings no matter how trivial 
the conservative opposition is led by sen jesse helms rnc 
ranking republican on the foreign relations committee 
helms has claimed that the administration made 
misrepresentations about the effect of the treaty a charge 
that was flatly denied by secretary of state george p shultz 
shultz who was both the first and last administration witness 
to testify to the foreign relations panel said the treaty stands 
on its merits and should not be made a vehicle for statements 
on other issues 
shultz and other administration officials have consistently 
urged the senate to avoid socalled killer amendments that 
could force a reopening of negotiations with the soviet union 
administration officials have also argued that rejection of the 
treaty would be a deep blow to us prestige and power in the 
16member nato alliance 
one condition which will be opposed is being offered by sen 
dennis deconcini dariz 
the amendment will require reagan to reaffirm to the soviet 
union the importance americans place on human rights and 
fundamental freedoms in the achievement of lasting peace among 
nations

through the persian gulf at dawn today a greek supertanker later 
was reported set ablaze in another iranian raid

the 38534ton havglimt flying the singapore flag shipping 
executives reported 
iraq fired a missile at tehran today and mounted air raids on 
seven other cities the iraqi news agency reported the missile was 
the 45th aimed at the iranian capital since the iraniraq war of 
cities resumed march 13 
shipping executives said an unidentified us warship patrolling 
the gulf picked up 10 seamen who were floating in a raft after 
abandoning the greek supertanker the 357130ton stavros gl 
the executives said the other 19 greek crewmen stayed on board 
to fight the flames a salvage tugboat soon joined the effort 
there were no casualties aboard the greek vessel which was 
attacked about 1 pm only a few miles south of where the havglimt 
was hit in a dawn attack 
the attacks were the seventh and eighth by iran on neutral 
shipping since friday they came as 51 crewmen remained missing and 
were presumed dead after an iraqi raid on two tankers near irans 
kharg island oil terminal earlier reports had said 54 crewmen were 
missing 
the escalation of the tanker war came as iran and iraq were 
locked in a series of missile duels and air raids on each others 
major cities the two nations have been at war for 7 years 
todays missile attack on tehran was the 106th such attack since 
feb 29 
about 65 iranian missiles have slammed into baghdad in that 
time also monday iran launched an artillery and rocket attack on 
basra inflicting heavy casualties iraq said

the dead crewmen were identified as singapore nationals and the 
ships norwegian captain was among the wounded other members of

of ammonia vapors according to the executives four needed 
hospitalization 
the fire in the engine room of the stricken tanker was brought 
under control by salvage tugboats but the flames later reignited 
in the crews quarters the executives said 
the british destroyer hms exeter on patrol in the area

onto a salvage tugboat which took them to a hospital at the united 
arab emirates port of dubai the sources said 
the shipping executive said at least one gunboat raided the 
vessel with machinegun fire and rocketpropelled grenades forty

they went for the accommodation quarters there were plenty 
plenty of hits all over said associated press photographer greg

delegates to the american jewish congress 
convention voiced concern today about the role of religious groups 
in politics but tabled a resolution urging churches and synagogues 
to refrain from active roles in political campaigns 
the proposed resolution which will be redrafted had suggested 
it was inherently dangerous for religious groups to identify 
with one candidate or one political party it reaffirmed the right 
of all people including clergy to seek political office 
the resolution is expected to be taken up at a later national 
meeting of the group but leaders did not indicate whether it would 
be during the 1988 presidential campaign 
discussion centered on whether delegates should take a strong 
stand against practices by two religious leaders now running for 
president pat robertson and rev jesse jackson 
the tabled resolution said certain recent practices of both 
these candidates are troubling issues citing robertsons use of 
churchowned buses to bring supporters to caucuses and jacksons 
effort during the super tuesday primaries to collect contributions 
in churches 
in their nearly unanimous decision to redraft the resolution 
delegates said it could be counterproductive and also should not 
refer to any individual 
on monday night an ajc leader urged that a new world zionist 
meeting be convened in jerusalem in the 1990s to unify jews 
everywhere with israelis and to heal the division over how to 
achieve peace with the arabs 
we are indeed one people sharing one destiny no matter where 
we live executive director henry siegman told delegates at the 
70th anniversary convention 
siegman reiterated the ajcs support for a us plan calling for 
talks on palestinian autonomy in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip followed by an international peace conference including 
israel and its arab neighbors he also spoke out against israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs condemnation of jews who object to 
his opposition to the plan 
the jewish people everywhere and not only those who vote in 
support of a particular israeli party have a right to speak up 
when they believe certain policies profoundly violate a legacy that 
belongs to the jewish people collectively even if finally only the 
citizens of israel will vote and make those decisions on which 
their security depends siegman said

the head of the public health service said 
today he is pleased with new guidelines prohibiting discrimination 
against federal employees with the aids virus 
we worked very closely with the office of personnel managment 
in developing them said dr robert windom the no 2 official of 
the department of health and human services and head of the health 
service 
the regulations are reasonable and reflect phs concerns 
windom said 
he and other health service officials will brief personnel 
officers from about 30 federal agencies on the guidelines on 
thursday 
the rules which will allow federal supervisors to take 
disciplinary action against employees who refuse to work with 
colleagues carrying the virus were distributed to federal agencies 
this week 
the federal government as an enlightened and compassionate 
employer concerned with the health and welfare of its employees 
has an obligation to show the way in addressing the realities of 
the aids epidemic constance horner the director of the office 
of personnel management said in a memo accompanying the guidelines 
the guidelines instruct federal agencies to treat aidsinfected 
employees in the same manner as employees who suffer from other 
serious illnesses they also say there is no medical basis for 
employees refusing to work with such fellow employees or agency 
clients 
if an employees threat or refusal to work with an aidsinfected 
coworker disrupts office functions managers are told to 
consider appropriate corrective or disciplinary action against 
the threatening or disruptive employees 
horner said agencies should grant leave to aidsinfected 
employees in the same manner as they would for other emloyees 
with medical conditions aidsinfected employees may continue 
their life insurance but cannot increase their coverage after they 
become seriously ill the guidelines state 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections

a federal judge ruled today that gen manuel 
antonio noriegas attorney can formally protest the legality of 
racketeering and drug trafficking charges even though the 
panmanian strongman has not appeared in court to answer the 
indictment 
us district judge william m hoeveler granted permission for 
noriegas attorney neal sonnett to file a limited appearance 
on behalf of the embattled strongman 
this limited appearance would be solely for the purpose of 
attacking the legality and sufficiency of the indictment said 
sonnett among a battery of miami attorneys retained by noriega 
the decision came over vehement objections from assistant us 
attorney richard gregorie who said that noriegas attorney could 
not make any arguments until noriega responds legally to the us 
indictment by making an appearance 
gregorie noted that noriega had not surrendered nor made any 
court appearance to answer charges in the sealed indictment 
returned by a federal grand jury in miami feb 4 which named 
noriega and 15 other people 
gregorie and sonnett were involved in a heated exchange during 
the hearing in hoevelers courtroom 
i represent general noriega sonnett told the judge 
the government objects he has no client to represent 
responded gregorie 
i have a client and mr gregorie knows that i have a client 
sonnett shot back to which gregorie responded then bring him 
here 
hoeveler agreed to let sonnett file by friday a memorandum of 
law setting forth his position he gave gregorie until the 
following friday to respond 
you may file your motion then well decide whether you can 
argue it hoeveler told sonnett 
only one of the 16 defendants named in the indictment brian 
alden davidow was at todays hearing 
davidow 26 the only person to surrender in the case thus far 
and be arraigned has pleaded innocent to the racketeering 
conspiracy count and other charges in the indictment he is free on 
500000 bond after his family posted 10 percent of that amount 
with the court 
hoeveler delayed setting a trial date after davidow made a 
formal waiver of his right to a speedy trial 
most of the other defendants named in the indictment were in 
either panama or colombia gregorie said

anglican bishops including an 
envoy sent by the archbishop of canterbury today pledged support 
for archbishop desmond tutu in his confrontation with the 
government 
tutu the first black to lead the anglican church in southern 
africa has angered president pw botha by declaring that he and 
other church leaders will carry on the work of antiapartheid 
groups which last month were banned from operating 
nineteen bishops after an emergency meeting with tutu issued a 
statement warning that the government is driving this beloved 
country closer to civil war 
we offer archbishop tutu our loyalty and support the 
bishops said we shall not allow the government to isolate him 
tutu who declared that the government would bite the dust 
said it was important that botha and other white south africans 
know that i am not just spouting forth things that come into my 
head 
these are responsible people said tutu gesturing to the 
bishops they would have knocked me down if they believed that 
what i am saying is inconsistent with the gospel 
botha met with tutu the winner of the 1984 nobel peace prize 
last week and suggested that the archbishop had aligned himself 
with the outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement 
referring to this the bishops said they take grave offense at 
the cavalier way in which botha treated tutu 
among those attending todays meeting was bishop keith sutton of 
lichfield england who was sent as representative of the 
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie 
runcie is spiritual leader of the 70millionmember worldwide 
anglican communion 
he is a christian leader sutton said of tutu his 
objections to apartheid grow directly out of his pastoral work 
at a news conference monday tutu dared botha to take action 
against him 
if they try to restrict me or ban me they are just wasting 
their time because i will not obey their orders tutu said 
they will have to put me in jail 
i cant keep looking over my shoulder to see if god has got 
the approval or disapproval of the government he added 
three weeks ago tutu and 24 other church leaders were arrested 
and briefly detained after they tried to march to parliament in 
cape town with a petition protesting the latest crackdown on 
opposition 
last month the government banned 17 other organizations from 
participating in any activity not approved by the government 
since then tutu and other church representatives have taken up 
the struggle against apartheid which by law and custom establishes 
a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have 
no vote in national affairs 
south africas 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

president reagan said today he still hopes 
panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega will relinquish power 
and leave the country 
but reagan would not say whether he expects noriega to do that 
asked by reporters if he would be satisfied should noriega step 
down but not leave his central american country reagan said we 
feel noriega should leave panama 
reagan questioned as he arrived at the capitol for talks on the 
possibility of resuming us aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
was asked if he expected noriega to agree to leave his nation 
im not making any predictions the president replied 
at the state department spokesman charles redman said that the 
panamanian people clearly have not been deceived by noriegas 
conditional offer to step down by may 1989 
redman said panamanians regard the offer as a ploy to buy 
time a view shared by the united states 
the message from panamanians is clear for the good of panama 
noriega should leave redman said 
his presence is the root cause of continued political and 
economic instability redman added the ongoing general strike 
is only the most recent demonstration of the overwhelming 
opposition from all segments of panamanian society to noriegas 
continued rule 
on monday shortly after panamas chief of state manuel solis 
palma told panamanians of noriegas offer state department press 
officer anita stockman said we stand by our previous view that 
noriega should go and the sooner the better for panama 
solis palma said noriega had given his word as an officer and 
a gentleman to step down before panamanian elections scheduled 
for may 1989 if his conditions which include talks with 
opposition leaders are met 
william g walker deputy assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs said noriegas offer totally ignores the 
reality of the situation 
almost everyone in panama wants him out tomorrow and wants him 
out of the country said walker who was in panama last week to 
discusss terms under which noriega might step down 
a state department statement released by stockman said 
we believe the offer is little more than one a ploy to 
attempt to legitimize the illegal solis palma regime by calling for 
negotiations between it and opposition groups and two an effort on 
the part of noriega to maintain direct or indirect control of the 
panamanian defense forces 
noriega is under indictment on federal drug charges in florida 
the united states has dried up the flow of money to panama which 
uses the us dollar as its currency in the effort to force him 
out and the economy is near collapse 
noriega is the problem and his preoccupation with remaining 
on the scene despite overwhelming domestic opposition will only 
insure continued economic and political instability there the 
state department said 
noriega put down a coup attempt by dissident officers last week 
and rejected a us plan for him to leave panama and live in spain 
solis palma replaced eric arturo delvalle who was dismissed by 
the legislature after he tried to fire noriega delvalle who is 
hiding in panama is still recognized by the united states as 
panamas president

parliament on tuesday approved a 
government plan to raise the speed limit on the nations highways 
from 62 mph to 74 mph 
the vote ended several years of debate by environmentalists 
proauto lobbying groups and the government which conceded the old 
speed limit was widely ignored 
the decision scheduled to go into effect may 1 marked the 
demise of a measure that followed the 1973 arab oil embargo against 
the netherlands 
the new speed limit of 120 kilometers per hour had been 
vigorously opposed by vocal environmentalist groups which said it 
would further damage the fragile environment in this crowded nation 
of 146 million people the groups backed by leftwing political 
parties faced a powerful lobby of road builders garage owners and 
other carrelated interests 
the old speed limit of 100 kilometers per hour remains in force 
along the highway in the densely populated urban crescent 
stretching from rotterdam via the hague and amsterdam to utrecht in 
the central netherlands

the last two years have been the warmest in 
this country in more than three decades the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration reported tuesday 
both 1986 and 1987 recorded average temperatures for the year of 
540 degres fahrenheit over the 48 contiguous states the agency 
said 
these were the warmest years since 1953 which averaged 547 to 
tie with 1934 for the warmest year in this century 
by contrast records going back to 1895 show the normal annual 
average temperature for the 48 states is 525 degrees the coldest 
year was 1917 which averaged 507 
tom karl of the national climatic data center in asheville 
nc said the combination of the position of the jet stream upper 
air currents and the high pressure center located over bermuda were 
contributing factors in the recent warm years 
the more basic thing is why they were in those positions and 
thats more difficult to answer karl said 
the concern everyone has in the back of their mind is if its 
part of the greenhouse gas effect that has been reported on he 
said 
the greenhouse effect is a prediction of computer models which 
say increasing amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases in the 
atmosphere could act much like the glass in a greenhouse trapping 
heat and raising the temperature of the earth 
its not clear yet if that is a factor in the warmth of 
1986 and 1987 but it bears watching karl said 
until 1986 the average temperature of the united states had been 
running at or slightly below normal in the 1980s karl said even 
though worldwide temperatures seemed to be on the increase 
in 1986 he said the spring was particularly warm across the 
country the winter of 198687 and the spring of 1987 also were 
unusually warm particularly in the northcentral region

the offer of asylum to gen manuel antonio 
noriega of panama maintains a spanish tradition of opening its 
doors to latin americans seeking a place of exile 
the hospitality stems from historic and cultural ties with latin 
america that transcend spanish party politics but the spain that 
is prepared to offer asylum to noriega is far different from the 
country that took in ousted cuban dictator fulgencio batista in 
1959 
during the 36year rule of gen francisco franco spain became a 
haven for batista colombian ruler gustavo rojas pinilla ousted 
argentine leader juan d peron toppled dominican president juan 
bosch and venezuelan strongman marcos perez jimenez 
rojas pinilla arrived in 1957 after a stopover in bermuda 
batista spent time in madeira and lisbon before settling in madrid 
and peron wandered from paraguay to panama to venezuela after his 
1955 ouster before arriving in seville in 1960 
both perez jimenez ousted in 1958 and bosch a democratically 
elected president toppled in 1963 lived in the united states 
before coming to spain 
francos conditions for receiving all were simple maintain a 
low profile and dont meddle in spanish or foreign politics 
in the case of noriega prime minister felipe gonzalez says 
spanish policy is to accept requests when asylum could help 
maintain or restore democracy in a specific country 
as conditions for accepting noriega spain requires that he 
himself ask for asylum that the united states agree not to seek 
his extradition on drugtrafficking and moneylaundering charges 
filed against him in us federal courts and that washington honor 
the 1977 treaty under which control of the panama canal will revert 
to panama in 2000 
noriega has refused to leave panama but he has said he is 
willing to step down as military leader prior to the 1989 
presidential elections in panama 
santiago varela diaz a gonzalez spokesman said since spains 
transition to democratic government in 1977 the type of political 
exile in spain has changed considerably 
since then spain has taken in many chileans argentines and 
uruguayans fleeing from military dictatorships he said the 
case of panama and noriega is separate but it is a concrete 
example of our willingness to serve as a support for a democratic 
solution to a problem 
during the waning years of the franco regime in the early 1970s 
not all the latin american exiles in spain were rightist dictators 
former economics minister manuel ulloa of peru came to spain 
after the army ousted president fernando belaunde terry in 1968 
belaunde went to the united states 
christian democratic leader andres zaldivar of chile moved to 
madrid after gen agusto pinochet overthrew president salvador 
allende in 1973 
most of the latin american leaders exiled in spain have lived in 
the opulent suburbs north of madrid 
batista died in madrid of a heart attack in 1973 perez jimenez 
74 still lives in a palatial residence in la moraleja 
until his return to argentina after an 18year exile peron held 
court at his 17th of october estate in puerta de hierro 
franco laid down the law to peron four years after his arrival 
when the argentine general tried an unsuccessful return to buenos 
aires in 1964 and threatened him with explusion if he kept up his 
politicking 
but by 1970 peron was again receiving a steady stream of 
visitors and plotting his return to argentina where he was elected 
president in 1973 he died a year later 
his widow maria estela martinez de peron who succeeded her 
husband as the first woman head of state in the western hemisphere 
lives in quiet exile in madrid after her overthrow by the military 
in 1976 and five years of house arrest in southern argentina

two federal parole examiners recommended today that 
anticastro militant orlando bosch be released from prison may 16 
after completing a threemonth sentence for violating his parole 
bosch convicted in the united states of conspiring to bomb 
foreign freighters and firing a recoilless rifle in 1968 at a 
polish freighter docked in miami served four years of his 10year 
federal prison sentence 
he has acknowledged violating parole when he fled to south 
america in 1974 he served 11 years in venezuelan jails until his 
final acquittal on charges of bombing a cuban jetliner in which 73 
died in 1976 
the recommended sentence which includes time bosch has spent in 
jail since returning to the united states must be approved by the 
us parole commission the panel is expected to decide within 
three weeks 
but after serving his threemonth sentence the 61yearold 
bosch will likely be taken into custody by the us immigration and 
naturalization service said boschs attorney george yoss the ins 
has targeted bosch for exclusion hearings and possible deportation 
bosch entered the united states illegally last month after his 
release from a venezuelan prison since midfebruary he has been 
detained at the metropolitan correctional center in south dade 
bosch hugged his family after learning the examiners 
recommendation said his daughter myriam bosch were very 
satisfied with the recommendation she said we think its very 
fair 
yoss said bosch probably would not appeal the recommended 
sentence for his 1974 parole violation its something dr bosch 
the family and we can all live with yoss said 
several prominent cubanamericans including jorge mas canosa 
head of the cuban american national foundation testified today 
before the parole examiners in a hearing closed to the public 
because it is an administrative procedure federal officials said 
mas canosa said bosch should be released because he has learned 
his lesson and would now work peacefully for the overthrow of cuban 
president fidel castro

democrat albert gore jr stood in front of one 
of the most powerful computers ever built and for half an hour 
spoke with the kind of emotion not often seen in the 1988 
presidential race 
he complained of the reagan administrations starvation of 
supercomputing and described his vision a nationwide 
fiberoptic network connecting such machines for research and 
business a public works project as important as the building of 
interstate highways a generation ago 
when he was done a television reporters first question made 
gores face sag what the newsman wanted to know did the 
tennessee senator think of the latest polls that showed him 
trailing in the presidential race 
gore managed a chuckle and after a pause gave the answer he 
had repeated three times before in three other cities that day 
polls are sometimes wrong 
but gore had come to the campus of the university of illinois in 
champaign one day before illinois important democratic 
presidential primary last week to talk supercomputers the kind 
that perform millions of calculations in an instant and whose 
usefulness is more widely assumed than understood 
gores performance and the staging and timing of the event 
illustrate the incongruity that sometimes surfaces as he takes his 
campaign to the north 
he uses newly adopted slogans about working men and women 
and of bringing the democratic party back to the grass roots 
populism that proved successful in the south 
yet gore often seems more inspired when the discussion turns to 
deeply technical issues of the sort that may not evoke much 
response from those working men and women he seeks 
supercomputing will be the engine of the information age 
gore said 
he and his audience were crowded into an antiseptic 
whitefloored and glasswalled room with a cray supercomputer the 
size of two or three cocacola machines and about as red with him 
were his wife and his father 
what we have seen in the last several years is the emergence 
of an entirely new field of scientific inquiry computational 
science gore said its time we move forward to create a 
national infrastructure that enables us to take advantage of that 
computational science 
gore 39 was educated at harvard showing an intellectual 
curiosity that led him to enroll in both the divinity and law 
schools finishing neither 
in 12 years as a member of the house and senate he immersed 
himself in issues such as medical technology organ transplants and 
arms control 
he gained the reputation of an armscontrol specialist who 
enjoys detail on his campaign plane he talks with excitement of 
unmistakeable signs in warsaw pact troop placements of recent 
weeks that the soviets basic posture is undergoing 
reevaluation 
but his claimed expertise can be a twoedged sword rival 
michael dukakis charged gore got taken to the cleaners when he 
led democratic negotiations with the reagan administration over 
arms control and star wars 
theres also the possible problem of bogging down his audience 
in what is after all a political battle with detail on 
technical subjects 
for example there was his campaign statement last week reacting 
to reports that ozone a protective layer of atmosphere shielding 
out harmful rays was disappearing faster than thought 
gore called for an immediate ban on nonessential uses of 
chlorofluorocarbons cfcs as propellants in aerosol sprays 
beyond that he outlined five other steps including an immediate 
1 per pound assessment of the most harmful cfcs rising to 5 
and having the president personally call on the leaders of japan 
and europe to ratify the montreal protocol and to put the issue on 
the june summit no explanation of that protocol or much else 
was given 
still in person and in the campaign statement gore did take 
care to make broader points the computers are keys to increased 
competitiveness he said and ozone depletion raises the threat of 
skin cancer 
the candidate who loves to talk technical detail became in the 
campaign press release an environmental paul revere

president reagan today issued a plea to house 
republicans to help him revive his stalled policy of aid to the 
nicaraguan contra rebels but said democrats will be to blame if 
the rebels go out of existence 
the president in a onehour meeting with house republicans on 
capitol hill and later with a group of state and county gop 
officials called on gop members to unite behind a new effort to 
push some kind of help for the rebels through congress 
us aid to the rebels expired feb 29 
we are determined to get continued assistance to the 
resistance and if we stick together this time well make it 
the president told the closed meeting of lawmakers on capitol hill 
according to a text of his remarks provided by the white house 
alluding however to democratic efforts to thwart any military 
aid for the rebels reagan added those who led the fight against 
our package of assistance to the democratic resistance cannot 
escape responsibility if the rebel forces wither 
reagan in response to a reporters question declined to say 
precisely what kind of aid package he was supporting 
in a separate session with the local gop officials reagan again 
pointed the finger of blame at house democrats 
the house leadership who played hardball to win the vote to 
cut off aid now says it wont accept responsibility for the 
destruction of the freedom fighters but if the freedom fighters 
are extinguished and communist rule is consolidated in nicaragua 
the american people will be the ones to decide who is 
responsible reagan said 
the white house has encouraged a bipartisan group of contra 
supporters in the senate who are proposing a oneyear 48 million 
humanitarian aid package that also would give the cia the right 
to deliver previously stockpiled weapons and the president the 
right to get a quick vote in congress on sending new military aid 
under certain conditions 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters after 
reagans capitol hill visit that the administration has not yet 
aligned itself with any specific bill but would like to have a 
package introduced soon and a vote prior to congress departure 
next week for an easter recess 
wed like to have a vote before then fitzwater said 
on capitol hill house gop leader robert michel said the 
administration will surely be supporting or at least 
encouraging the kind of movement we are seeing in the senate 
michel rill said last weeks incursion across the honduran 
border by sandinista troops was creating political pressure on some 
of the moderate democrats whose votes have been crucial to the 
outcome of the closely divided issue in the past that doesnt do 
anything but help our side michel said 
adding to that pressure said rep trent lott rmiss is the 
instability in other areas of central america including panama and 
el salvador the whole region is still in an unstable 
condition he said some moderate democrats last week were 
quite pale in their appearance when they realized there was this 
incursion into honduras 
we think there is some potential there to get a few more votes 
than we have had in the past said lott the chief house gop vote 
counter 
before the meeting reagan told reporters he hopes the 
ceasefire talks between the sandinista government and the rebels 
will be successful but said he would not withhold pressure for new 
contra aid to await the outcome of the talks 
i hope they can achieve something there in the talks he 
said asked if he would hold up a new request for rebel aid while 
the talks are in progress reagan replied we havent given that 
any consideration 
before reagan arrived michel said an aid package should be 
developed during the ceasefire talks 
we want to be prepared in the event negotiations break down 
so theres always a fallback position michel said we ought to 
be very wary take a more worstcase scenario 
house democrats said any action on further aid should await the 
outcome of those negotiations 
what we need to watch very carefully is the peace talks 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said on monday i hope both 
sides will be very forthcoming 
the sandinista government and usbacked rebels on monday 
opened three days of talks at the border town of sapoa by 
exchanging ceasefire proposals and agreeing to a truce during the 
negotiations 
asked about prospects for a 48 million contra aid proposal 
being drawn up by senate backers of the rebels wright objected to 
provisions that allow the cia to continue delivering previously 
stockpiled weapons and that would guarantee a future vote in 
congress on new military aid 
if they would agree to humanitarian aid without military aid 
that could be done very swiftly wright said we would be ready 
to meet with republicans at any time 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva in a toughly worded 
senate floor speech said the administrations policies have 
produced few positive results 
the united states after all of this not to mention several 
hundred million dollars has achieved virtually nothing positive 
in central america byrd said we have no right to ask 
americans to risk their sons and daughters when there are other 
solutions we have not even tried

the soviet union has invited a vatican 
delegation to help celebrate the 1000th anniversary of 
christianity in the region but pope john paul ii wont be a member 
of it a vatican official said tuesday 
cardinal johannes willebrands made the disclosure at a news 
conference at which he presented the popes letter on the 
millennium of christianity in kievan rus the ancient name of the 
ukraine the celebrations are scheduled for june 
the letter stressed europes christian roots and said christian 
unity is essential to peace in europe and the world 
willebrands president of the vaticans secretariat for 
christian unity said a representative of the russian orthodox 
church patriarch made the invitation orally to two officials of his 
agency march 18 in moscow 
he said john paul as head of the roman catholic church was 
invited to send a delegation to celebrations in moscow being 
organized by the russian orthodox church 
when an official written invitation is received the pontiff 
will name the delegation for the trip to moscow which is expected 
to last about 10 days the dutchborn cardinal said 
john paul often has expressed interest in visiting the soviet 
union willebrands said the pope had not received a personal 
invitation to the celebration and had no plans to attend but that 
does not rule out a posssible future visit 
he said it would not be opportune for the pope to attend the 
observance because he cannot make his pastoral visit which is 
destined primarily for catholics during celebrations organized by 
another church 
the pope has said he would visit the soviet union if he was 
allowed to visit roman catholics throughout the country including 
the ukraine lithuania latvia byelorussia and kazakhstan 
three years ago he disclosed that soviet authorities had 
refused permission for him to visit lithuania a catholic 
stronghold 
in his 39page letter to bishops around the world john paul 
urged the faithful to join in prayer to mark the baptism in 988 of 
prince vladimir on the banks of the dnieper in kiev 
the whole catholic church turns its gaze to that event and 
shares spiritually in the joy of the heirs to that baptism he 
said 
john paul praised christians in the region who he said have 
sometimes experienced persecution and martyrdom in those 1000 
years 
in particular we join with all the heirs of this baptism 
whatever their religious confession nationality or dwelling place 
with all our orthodox and catholic brothers and sisters the 
letter said 
in a special way we join with all the beloved sons and 
daughters of the russian ukrainian and byelorussian nations to 
those who live in their homeland as also to those who dwell in 
america western europe and other parts of the world 
the millennium is in a special way the feast of the russian 
orthodox church which remains united to the catholic church with 
very close links the pope wrote 
at this solemn moment in history the catholic community 
sends to her 1000yearold sister church through the bishop of 
rome the kiss of peace as a manifestation of an ardent desire for 
that perfect communion 
in a plea for christian unity john paul said the christian 
roots of europe present a particularly pressing challenge to the 
unity of christians the desire for unity and peace the desire 
that barriers should be broken down and opposition removed is 
becoming an impelling sign of our times 
true peace can only exist on the basis of a process of 
unification in which each people is able to choose in freedom and 
truth the path of its own development

the american space program will be crippled 
and us leadership threatened if congress fails to approve the 
115 billion requested by nasa space agency officials said today 
james c fletcher nasa administrator said that fiscal 1989 
which begins in october is a crucial year for nasa it will make 
or break the civil space program 
he said the 115billion budget requested by the national 
aeronautics and space administration is a bare bones request 
with most of the money going to maintaining programs already 
underway 
the entire future of the us civil space program rides at 
risk in this budget said fletcher 
he said that the money would be applied to three basic elements 
building up the flight rate for the space shuttle once missions 
resume in august there are two space flights set for this year he 
said seven in 1989 and 10 in 1990 
building up hardware development for the space station which 
he said is essential for american leadership in space

a hanford nuclear reservation plutonium 
processing plant was shut down and two technicians were suspended 
in the wake of an incident involving the improper transfer of 
chemicals a westinghouse hanford spokesman said today 
operations at the plutoniumuranium extraction plant or purex 
were suspended over the weekend as a precautionary measure said 
spokesman rudy cortez 
the temporary suspension resulted from an incident friday in 
which a valve was left open and a batch of the wrong chemical 
solution was transferred to a tank cortez said 
as a consequence the certifications of two nuclear process 
operators were suspended for failing to follow operating 
procedures he said the event was declared to be an infraction of 
a criticality prevention specification 
a criticality is an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction 
resulting in a rapid buildup of radiation and heat it is caused by 
such factors as the amount shape density and enrichment of 
plutonium or uranium and the manner in which they are stored 
there was no danger of a criticality incident and no danger of a 
radioactiuve release to the environment cortez said it has not 
been determined how long operations will be suspended he said 
the purex plant was closed for a time in october 1986 because of 
safety concerns over plutonium handling and possible accidents 
westinghouse hanford officials who took over operation of the 
plants in july 1987 promised to make safety a top priority 
the chemical transfer incidents were the latest in a series of 
safetyrelated ones at the purex facility which dissolves fuel 
rods to remove plutonium and uranium for reprocessing 
the cause of contamination of two crane operators at the 
facility march 14 is still under investigation radioactive 
contamination was found in one crane operators home and another 
contamination was found on another operator as he prepared to leave 
the plant both men were decontaminated and returned to work the 
next day

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods fell 18 percent in february but analysts said the 
second consecutive monthly decline had not shaken their belief that 
manufacturing will be a bright spot in the economy this year 
the commerce department report tuesday said that orders for 
durable goods items expected to last three or more years 
totaled a seasonally adjusted 1114 billion in february following 
an identical 18 percent january decline 
it was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable 
goods orders have fallen for two consecutive months 
the february decline surprised economists but they maintained 
that manufacturing companies were still enjoying boom times because 
the weaker dollar has boosted export demand 
the fundamentals continue to look positive for 
manufacturing said allen sinai chief economist of the boston 
co what we have is a twomonth hesitation after some big 
increases 
manufacturing is expected to be a major source of strength this 
year as businesses step up production to meet rising export demand 
and american companies increase orders for capital equipment to 
expand their production capabilities 
the reagan administration is forecasting that almost half of all 
economic growth in 1988 will come from rising export demand 
still analysts said the backtoback declines did show that 
businesses were cutting back on orders in the early part of 1988 in 
an effort to get control of bulging inventories inventories 
swelled at the end of 1987 while consumer demand fell 
economists once had feared this combina4hn could be enough to 
topple the country into a recession but brighter statistics this 
year including continue declines in the unemployment rate in 
february have eased those concerns 
cynthiaxlatta an economist with data resources ik noted that 
while new orders fell in february the toas no immediate response from 
the rebels who have been 
supported by the united states since the start of their fight in 
late 1981 
negotiators for both sides were optimistic after the first day 
of ceasefire talks monday the first held since december 
also monday nicaragua withdrew its soldiers from the honduran 
border and declared an end to fighting with contra rebels while the 
talks are held in sapoa the honduran military reported sandinista 
soldiers had retreated 
the importance of today was that we listened for the first 
time at the highest level their contras proposal gen humberto 
ortega nicaraguas defense minister told journalists in sapoa on 
monday 
alfredo cesar a negotiator for the usbacked rebels called 
the first round a step ahead and said they discussed a wide 
range of issues 
neither side seeks a military victory over the other cesar 
said 
mondays session was held under tight security at the customs 
post in this town beside the border with costa rica along the bank 
of lake nicaragua 
at stake in the talks scheduled to resume today is an end to 
the bloodshed that has claimed an estimated 50000 dead and wounded 
and shattered the countrys economy 
the sandinista proposal to stop the fighting calls for an 
immediate and definitive ceasefire ortega said he did not 
elaborate 
the contra plan calls for a 30day truce political amnesty 
press freedom and continued talks to work out a lasting ceasefire 
cesar said 
frank arana a rebel spokesman said the talks went beyond the 
bounds earlier established by the sandinistas and included 
political issues and concepts of democracy 
we spoke about everything he said 
the goal of the sandinistas is to work out a viable ceasefire 
in accordance with the regional peace plan signed last august by 
the presidents of the five central american nations they had said 
the talks would cover only the mechanics of how the contras would 
lay down their arms 
the rebels said the talks should include discussion of 
democratic reforms also covered in the regional peace plan 
we came here with an open agenda adolfo calero a contra 
leader told journalists at the border post and that includes 
democratization including amnesty we insisted on speaking about 
all the problems facing nicaragua 
negotiations opened after ortega brother of president daniel 
ortega said the sandinistas were suspending military operations 
for the duration of the talks and called on the contras to do the 
same 
sandinista spokesman manuel espinoza told reporters the 
reciprocation of the contras in agreeing to suspend hostilities 
and the fact that this meeting is taking place are the first 
positive steps toward a permanent ceasefire 
president ortega on monday signed a document that dealt with a 
number of internal problems the statement called on all political 
parties to refrain from violence a position targeted at the 
government supporters who have attacked the opposition 
it also calls for the media to respect the government a 
reference to the opposition newspaper la prensa and the 
sandinistas promised to release more than a dozen recently jailed 
labor leaders and review cases of imprisoned opposition 
politiciaans 
the sandinistas willingness to comply with the peace plan was 
cited by us congressional members as a reason for rejecting 
president reagans calls for additional military and nonlethal aid 
to the rebels the peace plan also calls for internal dialogue with 
the political opposition

southern methodist university is considering a 
tougher sexual harassment policy that could result in the demotion 
or firing of faculty members found to be romantically involved with 
students 
under the proposal if a student files a complaint the faculty 
member would appear before a committee which would evaluate 
evidence and decide punishment 
the faculty have been the prime movers for this policy leon 
bennett vice president for legal affairs said monday were not 
trying to create a hostile environment were trying to prevent 
one 
civil libertarians say such a policy might infringe on a 
persons constitutional right of free association other critics 
question whether a university can or should regulate 
relationships between adults 
smu like most universities prohibits faculty and staff from 
making sexual advances and seeking sexual favors in exchange for 
favorable treatment 
officials at smu say they have received 10 sexual harassment 
complaints in the last five years everett winters director of 
smus office of affirmative action said although some professors 
have been reprimanded none have been dismissed demoted or taken 
to court 
lindley doran director of the human resources womens center 
said the harassment policy was proposed by the center and the 
universitiys commission on status of women the faculty senate 
approved it in the spring of 1987 
she said the proposal is now with the administration which is 
investigating what legal sanctions can be used the faculty senate 
would then review the proposal with its approval it will go to 
the trustees 
ms doran said she thinks the proposal will be university policy 
by the end of the semester

threeyearold ashley hopkins never 
heard a sound until the beep of a computer intruded on her silence 
she cried 
i shouldnt be happy to see ashs tears but i am said her 
mother janie hopkins who cried some herself that means its 
working 
the englewood girl is believed to be the youngest person to get 
a cochlear implant 
thomas j balkany implanted the 17000 electronic hearing aid 
during an operation at porter memorial hospital the 22channel 
device stimulates the hearing nerve the implant considered 
experimental in children bypasses damaged innerear cells by 
stimulating a tiny portion of the nerve fibers in the cochlea 
doctors say ashley eventually will be able to hear her own 
voice the device also will help her pick up intonation patterns of 
people she is talking to and should improve her lipreading 
without this she has no hope of talking properly hopkins 
said she wants to be in the hearing world with everyone else 
an implant patient must wear a nickelsize microphone on his 
ear the microphone is linked to a battery pack that modulates the 
microphones electrical signal which ultimately stimulates the 
hearing nerve 
bernice dinner ashleys audiologist said the noise transmitted 
to the cochlea is nothing like sounds in the hearing world it is a 
monotone like a bees buzzing 
shes going to learn that sensation is sound dinner said 
she doesnt know that yet she doesnt have a label for it 
the first time dinner activated the electronic device by 
computer the little girl shrugged a shoulder the second time she 
rolled her eyes 
the first two times were more like a brushing sensation a 
tickling in her inner ear dinner said 
the third time dinner calibrated the electronic signal higher 
so it was loud and painful ashley cried

a man who allegedly sought romance 
rather than religion has been barred by a judge from attending a 
church 
judge anne dranginis issued a temporary restraining order monday 
prohibiting john steinmann 78 of middlebury from attending the 
first congregational church of washington 
we believe his motives to worship are not consistent with 
promoting the worship of god but for the purpose of forming 
relationships particularly with women said the rev richard 
sears pastor of the chruch 
the judges order also prohibits steinmann from harassing or 
contacting church members without their permission 
according to court documents steinmann member of a middlebury 
church began attending services in rural washington in an attempt 
to maintain a relationship with his former wife 
the couple has since divorced the woman moved and steinmann 
used the church to meet other women church officials said 
church officials filed for the court orders monday a day after 
steinmann was arrested for the third time on charges of criminal 
trespassing at the church 
virginia steinway of morris testified steinmann once sidled up 
to her in a pew grabbed her arm and made lewd and revolting 
remarks to her during a hymn i was extremely panicked she 
said 
steinmann who represented himself in court maintained his 
actions were consistent with the churchs policy of christian

moslem nations were united tuesday behind 
the palestinian rebellion in israelioccupied lands but iran and 
iraq traded insults and there was no islamic accord on the 
7yearold persian gulf war 
foreign ministers of the 46member organization of the islamic 
conference issued a statement condemning oppressive and criminal 
measures by the israeli authorities against our brothers 
tariq aziz iraqs foreign minister claimed iran was aiding the 
emigration of iranian jews to israel according to a text of his 
remarks 
in the statement about the rebellion which began dec 8 in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip the ministers said all 
moslems in the world are proud of this uprising 
that echoed a speech by king hussein of jordan at the opening of 
the conference monday in which he said the blood of martyrs 
was being shed in the territories more than 100 arabs have been 
killed since the violence began 
the ministers declared members of the organization are 
concerned to support palestinians financially politically and 
morally and also to back their sole legitimate representative the 
plo 
no indication was given of what form aid would take or whether 
there would be financial assistance and the statement did not 
elaborate 
tajer masri jordans foreign minister told reporters we can 
only provide support in a political manner to pressure the worlds 
nations to get them to pressure israel and reveal the meaning of 
the uprising i dont remember seeing any request for financial 
support 
farouk kaddoumi the palestine liberation organizations 
equivalent of a foreign minister said the statement was valuable 
to the plo and especially for the people inside the territories 
about us plans to close the plos un observer mission in new 
york under terms of an antiterrorist law kaddoumi said 
we will keep the office open until american police come and 
seal it off then we will go to the united nations headquarters 
and live there 
aziz the iraqi foreign minister said the alleged help given 
iranian jews to move to israel was a violation of the rules of 
the organization of islamic conference 
how come iran which claims to support the palestinian issue 
and the uprising is helping jews to migrate to israel there was 
no elaboration in a text of his prepared remarks made available to 
the associated press 
he gave no figures on the number of alleged emigrants the 
iranian envoy mohammed ali taskhiri denied the claim and accused 
iraq of being zionist 
the point is sensitive in the arab and moslem world because many 
nations do not recognize israels right to exist and oppose the 
emigration of jews to the country

testimony ended today on the first of three 
impeachment charges against gov evan mecham but a move for a 
quick vote on whether to oust mecham from office was withdrawn in 
the face of vehement opposition 
it would be our everlasting disgrace if we do not consider all 
of the evidence from both sides in such a historic and important 
case said republican sen jon hays 
after testimony ended on the first impeachment count a charge 
that mecham tried to thwart an investigation into a death threat 
democratic state sen carolyn walker proposed that the senate 
consider voting on that charge alone 
the senate had earlier agreed to hear evidence on all three 
charges before voting on any one conviction on the first count 
alone would have ended the trial early with the first term 
republican removed from office 
i would think if governor mecham is exonerated he would be 
extremely happy to know he has one less article to face she 
said and if he is convicted we should not go on and spend 
untold dollars of taxpayers money 
in a heated debate the motion won support from democrats but 
was opposed by republicans and walker finally withdrew it a 
twothirds vote of the 30member senate would have been required to 
change the trial rules 
the prosecution then said it was ready to begin presenting 
evidence on the second charge against mecham alleged that he 
misused 80000 from a state fund by loaning it to his auto 
dealership 
the last witness on the obstruction of justice count was 
mechams lawyer fred craft who this morning seized the 
opportunity to give a lengthy speech in praise of mechams 
political philsophy he called mecham an uncommon politician 
who sought no personal aggrandizement and wanted only to improve 
the quality of life in arizona 
the speech brought an objection from prosecutor paul eckstein 
and craft was instructed to stick to answering questions 
craft in an abrupt role change became a witness monday and 
said mecham didnt know that he was obstructing anything when 
he told the states top lawman he would not cooperate with the 
attorney generals investigation of the alleged death threat 
craft was subpoenaed at the request of the democratic minority 
leader sen alan stephens craft was a mecham insider when the 
threat against a witness before a grand jury investigating mecham 
was reported to the governor on nov 13 
i never heard felony i never heard death threat and i 
certainly never heard tampering with a grand jury witness 
craft said monday i never heard those words which would have 
been an alarm to me 
later in his crossexamination eckstein asked craft whether he 
had ever advised the embattled governor to resign 
we had these meetings and no one could see a political escape 
route for the governor craft said no one was offering the 
governor any other political option than to go down with the ship 
thefirst charge alleged that mecham tried to thwart the 
investigation of the alleged death threat against former top mecham 
aide donna carlson by mecham confidant lee watkins at the time 
ms carlson was about to testify before the state grand jury about 
mechams failure to report a 350000 campaign loan 
the next article charges mecham with misusing 80000 from the 
governors protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership the 
third impeachment article accuses him of concealing the 350000 
campaign loan 
craft and codefense counsel jerris leonard said they opposed 
taking an early vote we ought to hear all the evidence on all 
three articles and then let them vote leonard said 
in his testimony craft echoed mecham in contending the governor 
was not fully informed that the situation involved a felony and the 
possible tampering of a grand jury witness 
nobody said the house is burning down weve got a crisis 
craft said i didnt know that a crime had been committed 
however sen john mawhinney a republican noted that 
thenchief of staff richard burke testified that he considered the 
matter to be serious and that he assumed the department of public 
safety was investigating 
what is mystifying is how two people can sit in the same 
meeting and come away with different impressions mawhinney said 
a twothirds vote of the senate is required to convict mecham 
the first us governor to be impeached in six decades and the 
first ever in arizona 
mecham also faces an april 21 criminal trial on charges of 
concealing the 350000 campaign loan and a may 17 recall election

the inimitable emanuel ungaro has toned down his 
sexy exaggerated look but he had enough opulent fabrics in his 
tuesday winter readytowear show to please the fans of his 
showoff styles 
laroche by contrast preferred the ultra simple lines in short 
skirts and tailored pants 
ungaro along with christian lacroix and some others remains in 
the femininefancy school of designing despite this seasons 
trend to somewhat simpler more practical styles 
in one variation on the tent dress he puts bright flowered and 
flowing silk or light wool tunics over narrow skirts but ungaro 
also sneaked in a print chemise dress from the 1950s knotted and 
draped baggily in back 
rose salmon and dusky shades of blue and green or brighter 
tones all turned up in ungaros vast color palette crazy over 
fabrics he mixed them with somewhat less abandon this time around 
paisley brown or camel colored short coats were often paired 
with outfits that had lean kneerevealing skirts in polished 
leather a flashy fascinating new look here 
ungaro still likes big bertha or flounced collars using them on 
lots of ensembles he cant forget leg omutton sleeves ruffles 
and bows either 
as usual velvet was used richly in ungaros suits as a 
singlelapelled collar a wide jackethem border or overall in 
dressy suits in shades of claret deep purple or black 
another success in opulence was to pair a velvetpiped paisley 
long and fitted jacket with a teeny draped black jersey cashmere 
skirt 
even pants looked dressy with their little velvet or 
irridescent taffeta vests and fitted jackets plus flowered 
blouses bows on derrieres or the hips of draped pants gilded the 
lily a bit 
ungaros bodyhugging draped cocktail numbers were less risque 
than last season nearly hitting the knee instead of grazing the 
upper thigh 
ungaros less expensive line called solo donna shown last 
week had much of the same allure but looked much more 
comfortable his ribbed spencers with flowered sheaths or his 
checked skirts with windowpane plaid reefers could even be worn to 
the office without raising eyebrows 
at guy laroche meanwhile the trend to short skirts continued 
but the collection looked more sane than sexy designed by guy 
douvier the clothes had a certain playeddown attraction 
soft wool coats were ample and short with caped and huge 
squaredoff collars these were worn over tailored trouser suits 
and dresses in browns tans or striking jewel colors 
bright belted tunics with dark skirts or straight tunics with 
elaborate wool embroidery in swirly ribbon patterns were also items 
for the safe dresser 
the diagonal plaid belted suits in frank yellow green or red 
make a peppy change 
lateday flocked velvet or cloque silk suits were easily fitted 
and dance dresses with shirred tops and puffy taffeta skirts also 
came down the runway the shocking pink or black flounced taffeta 
gowns short in front long in back are no shockers but are gala 
enough to wear without looking like a wallflower 
hermes usually known for expensive handfinished leather bags 
and scarves is making a bigger effort to steer customers to the 
readytowear racks 
designed by eric bergere the line remained firmly in the 
classic sportswear vein as the redingote sweeps paris hermes had 
the last word in its brown or red models topped with jumpers 
netted bowler hats 
but fitted suits with oval skirts and plaid spencers or aline 
jackets over slim gray flannel hats looked just as appealing for a 
country weekend or informal moments in town 
even if the clothes dont set trends they will never look out 
of place especially with those incomparable silk scarves

authorities have granted polish mormons 
permission to build their first chapel in this communist country a 
church missionary said tuesday 
the only other soviet bloc country in which there are mormon 
chapels is east germany where there are about 5000 members of the 
church of jesus christ of latterday saints 
although polish authorities registered the mormon church as an 
official religious organization in 1977 only recently were there 
enough polish mormons to warrant building a chapel said elder 
juliusz fussek 
fussek 66 a us citizen of polish descent was sent to poland 
to do missionary work by the church headquarters in salt lake city 
he is a retired printer 
there are only about 100 mormons in this overwhelmingly roman 
catholic country but fussek said he saw great prospects for 
the churchs development because people are interested in 
religion here 
you need members first before building a chapel because 
there is no point having a chapel and it standing empty said 
fussek 
we are very pleased with the cooperation and help we have 
received from the government he said 
at the end of last year polish mormons applied for permission 
to build a chapel and culturaleducational center in warsaws 
western wola district fussek said 
the local council for wola approved the project at a meeting 
last week and forwarded its decision to the warsaw city president 
for formal approval he said 
fussek said the chapel expected to open in 1989 or 1990 would 
be paid for by donations from polish mormons and the church 
headquarters in salt lake city he did not have any estimate of the 
cost 
fussek said there were about 300400 mormons mostly of german 
descent in the country before world war ii the mormon chapel did 
not reopen after the war because most of its members fled the 
country when the communists took power 
more than 35 religious denominations are active in poland today 
ninety percent of polands 37 million people are baptized catholics

tinoco told reporters there are 3300 prisoners the government 
considers eligible for release under the program 
the contra proposal calls for a 45day truce starting on good 
friday april 1 in which rebel fighters would move into cesaefire 
zones still to be determined 
it said the government should grant total and unconditional 
amnesty as soon as the truce takes effect allowing anyone who 
left nicaragua for political reasons to rejoin the political 
economic and social process without any conditions 
the rebels also want to join a national dialogue between the 
sandinistas and their internal political opponents while the 
ceasefire lasts the government also would allow rebel leaders to 
participate in national reconciliation talks 
at the moment in which a ceasefire is signed whether it be 
for 30 60 or 90 days according to what the counterrevolution 
wants at that moment the leadership of the nicaraguan resistance 
will be able to rejoin civic and political life and even 
participate in the national dialogue that seeks a reconciliation of 
all nicaraguans tinoco said 
both proposals call for international monitoring of the 
ceasefire 
the two sides agreed monday to a ceasefire during the three 
days of talks the first ever held on nicaraguan territory in more 
than 6 years of war and the first direct talks without a mediator 
rebel and government negotiators for both sides were optimistic 
after the first round of peace talks monday the first held since 
december 
also monday nicaragua withdrew its soldiers from the honduran 
border the honduran military reported sandinista soldiers had 
retreated 
the importance of today was that we listened for the first 
time at the highest level their contras proposal gen humberto 
ortega nicaraguas defense minister said monday 
alfredo cesar a negotiator for the usbacked rebels called 
the first round a step ahead and said the delegations discussed 
a wide range of issues neither side seeks a military victory 
over the other he said 
at stake in the talks is an end to the bloodshed that has 
claimed an estimated 50000 dead and wounded and shattered the 
countrys economy 
frank arana a rebel spokesman said the talks went beyond the 
bounds earlier established by the sandinistas and included 
political issues and concepts of democracy 
we spoke about everything he said 
the goal of the sandinistas is to work out a viable ceasefire 
in accordance with the regional peace plan signed last august by 
the presidents of the five central american nations they had said 
the talks would cover only the mechanics of how the contras would 
lay down their arms 
the rebels said the talks should include discussion of 
democratic reforms also covered in the regional peace plan 
we came here with an open agenda adolfo calero a contra 
leader told reporters and that includes democratization 
including amnesty we insisted on speaking about all the problems 
facing nicaragua 
president daniel ortega on monday signed a document that dealt 
with a number of internal problems the statement called on all 
political parties to refrain from violence a position targeted at 
the government supporters who have attacked the opposition 
it also calls for the media to respect the government a 
reference to the opposition newspaper la prensa and the 
sandinistas promised to release more than a dozen recently jailed 
labor leaders and review cases of imprisoned opposition 
politiciaans 
the sandinistas willingness to comply with the peace plan was 
cited by us congressional members as a reason for rejecting 
president reagans calls for additional military and nonlethal aid 
to the rebels the peace plan also calls for internal dialogue with 
the political opposition

richard gephardt said today fellow democrat michael dukakis has 
undergone a battlefield conversion on the trade issue to try to 
win votes in michigan vice president george bush lent his support 
to president reagans veto of a civil rights bill saying hes 
not going to start differing with the president now 
democratic contenders albert gore jr and paul simon flew back 
to washington to cast their votes for an override gore criticized 
bushs loyalty to reagan even when the proposals are dumb 
gephardt was angered by dukakis changeofmind on trade 
legislation and he accused the massachusetts governor of a 
flipflop to improve his chances in saturdays caucuses in 
michigan where 138 delegates are at stake 
now were getting some battlefield conversions on trade 
the acid test on trade is the gephardt amendment the missouri 
congressman told senior citizens in madison heights mich 
last night gephardt told reporters on the central issue in 
this campaign mike dukakis is trying to have it both ways 
dukakis on monday endorsed a trade bill put forward by michigan 
sen donald riegle which gephardt said was very similar to his 
measure the massachusetts governor has opposed gephardts bill 
riegle endorsed dukakis monday as did michigan congressmen dale 
kildee and bob traxler 
this is no change in my position dukakis responded at his 
own news conference 
michigan did not have the spotlight to itself as candidates from 
both parties are stumping in connecticut with its primary a week 
from today and wisconsin a week later 
dukakis was making a foray into neighboring connecticut today 
where he appeared wellpositioned to add to his string of wins on 
his new england home turf campaign sources said dukakis will 
receive a soughtafter endorsement on wednesday from new jersey 
sen bill bradley who has been mentioned as a possible darkhorse 
democratic nominee if the convention is deadlocked 
gore still searching for a northern breakthrough after 
establishing his candidacy in the south met today with 
pennsylvania gov robert casey who said afterward he still hasnt 
decided whether to endorse a candidate before the states april 26 
primary on monday the tennessee senator met with new york gov 
mario cuomo who said some nice things about him but didnt endorse 
him 
although connecticut is one of bushs home states his father 
represented it in the us senate and his mother and brother still 
live in the state the vice president said he was taking nothing 
for granted there 
i dont want to be beaten in this state he said as he 
campaigned in bloomfield on monday in connecticut reporters asked 
bush whether he backed president reagans veto of a sweeping civil 
rights bill 
im not going to start differing with the president now he 
replied 
later bush told black supporters in washington that he supports 
the idea that institutions receiving federal money should comply 
with civil rights laws but he said the civil rights measure 
passed overwhelmingly by both the house and the senate was flawed 
the legislation is imperfect and the imperfections should 
be corrected he said up until monday bush had not said 
directly whether he supported the veto 
im not going to start doing now what i havent been doing for 
seven years finding differences with the president for whom i 
have great respect he said 
the measure would forbid the distribution of federal funds to 
entire institutions state and local government agencies and many 
corporations if any part of them practices discrimination the 
administration supports a plan that would grant religious schools 
and organizations as well as corporations more exemptions from 
civil rights laws 
bush said he believed the president should have lineitem veto 
powers so he could take some of the extremes out of bills like 
the one in question 
earlier monday new jersey gov thomas kean endorsed bush and 
new jerseys 21 county gop chairmen followed suit new jerseys 
primary is june 7 
bushs republican opponent downbutnotout bob dole was in 
wisconsin where he again challenged the vice president to a 
debate but bush has rebuffed doles calls for a faceoff saying it 
is time to turn the attention to differences with the democrats 
gephardt was campaigning in the mustwin state of michigan 
wooing workers at a steel mill and making appearances with chrysler 
corp chief lee iacocca at his side iacocca says he likes 
gephardts trade stance but isnt formally supporting him 
gephardts says his trade views raising the threat of 
sanctions if foreign barriers dont come down are getting a good 
reception in the industrial state of michigan 
the people in michigan are interested in someone who is really 
going to stand up on the trade issue he said in highland park 
jesse jackson made a visit to colorado which holds democratic 
caucuses on april 4 and met monday with excandidate gary hart 
jackson said hart was going to advise his campaign on policy 
matters hart said however that he wasnt formally endorsing 
jackson that he said would be oldfashioned 
hart abandoned his democratic bid earlier this month 10 months 
after quitting the first time over reports about his relationship 
with a miami model 
jackson was campaigning in michigan today 
simons campaign on monday was talking up his plans for a big 
media buy in wisconsin simon won his homestate primary in

the senate voted 7324 today to override 
president reagans veto of a bill reversing a supreme court 
decision that narrowed the scope of laws to prevent federally 
funded discrimination against women minorities the elderly and 
the handicapped 
the civil rights restoration act went directly to the house 
where leaders also said they had the votes to override the veto 
majority leader thomas foley dwash said the house would vote 
tonight 
we expect a vote to override house speaker jim wright 
dtexas said monday the house passed the bill 31598 and 
republican headcounters said only a dozen members at most were 
expected to move into the presidents corner 
the senate vote was more than the twothirds majority needed to 
override a presidential veto the bill initially passed 7514 to 
become law over a presidents veto the legislation must be 
approved by a twothirds vote of both chambers 
the house and senate votes capped a fouryear struggle to 
overturn the 1984 supreme court decision 
the senate vote came after several senators including acting 
republican leader alan simpson of wyoming condemned what they 
called a misinformation campaign launched by conservative opponents 
of the bill simpson who voted to sustain the veto nonetheless 
said he was concerned about erroneous claims that it would create 
massive new rights 
some opponents have claimed the bill would require churches to 
hire active homosexual drug addicts with aids to counsel children 
proponents of the bill say it offers no protection for homosexuals 
or drug or alcohol addicts 
even as the senate prepared to vote reagan urged congress to 
sustain his veto 
i ask every senator and representative to rise above the 
pressures of an election year to make a stand for religious 
liberty by sustaining my veto of this dangerous bill reagan said 
in a speech to local republican officials from around the country 
the truth is this legislation isnt a civil rights bill 
the president said its a power grab by washington designed to 
take control away from states localities communities parents and 
the private sector and give it to federal bureaucrats and judges 
one dollar in federal aid direct or indirect would bring 
entire organizations under federal control from charitable social 
organizations to churches and synagogues 
house republican leader bob michel rill said reagan 
discussed the reasons for his veto today in a meeting with house 
republicans and outlined the alternative he proposed last week 
its rather too bad that that alternative did not get to us 
earlier on than the time it was presented michel said 
the reagan alternative would enable more institutions to escape 
regulation on religious grounds and limit most corporate compliance 
requirements to specific plants or facilities receiving federal aid 
the court ruled that an organization or governmental body 
getting federal support must comply with antidiscrimination rules 
only for the program receiving the federal aid not for the entire 
organization the bill would cut off aid for the whole organization 
if discrimination against minorities women the elderly or the 
disabled was practiced by any part of the organization 
obviously theres a very organized and promoted campaign 
against the bill said senate majority leader robert byrd said 
apparently the white house let the word out as we began getting 
hundreds of calls that all said the same thing 
i think a lot of misinformation has been spread byrd added 
theres a great deal of misinformation distortion of truth and 
fact 
the civil rights restoration act passed both chambers earlier 
this year by lopsided margins far greater than the twothirds 
majority needed to override a presidential veto 
vice president george bush on monday said he would support the 
reagan veto saying the legislation is imperfect and the 
imperfections should be corrected 
supporters of the legislation say it restores civil rights laws 
to the way they were interpreted before the court challenge mounted 
by tiny grove city pa college 
congress had tried since the supreme court decision to pass a 
corrective measure but became enmeshed in various controversies 
involving regulation and abortion the final bill had broad 
bipartisan support and many republicans asked the president not to 
veto it 
an eleventhhour push by the conservative moral majority group 
resulted in thousands of phone calls letters and telegrams urging 
lawmakers to uphold the veto 
the liberal people for the american way responded monday with 
newspaper ads saying the far right could defeat civil rights 
unless people call their representatives and tell them your tax 
money must not pay for discrimination 
the restoration act says entire institutions and government 
agencies must not discriminate if any program or activity within 
them receives federal aid entire corporations are covered if they 
provide a public service such as health care or if the aid goes to 
the business as a whole as in the chrysler bailout 
farmers receiving crop subsidies people using food stamps and 
other individuals receiving federal assistance would not be subject 
to regulation an institutions refusal to perform or pay for 
abortions would not be considered discriminatory 
the supreme court decision applied specifically to title ix of 
the 1972 education amendments barring sex discrimination in 
federally funded education programs it was interpreted also to 
cover the 1964 civil rights act barring racial discrimination in 
federallyassisted programs the 1973 rehabilitation act barring 
discrimination against the handicapped in any program or activity 
receiving federal aid and the 1975 age discrimination act barring 
employment discrimination against older people

area of about 20 square miles inside olancho province while chasing

denied sandinista soldiers crossed the border 
the contras maintain camps in an area called bocay which 
includes territory on both sides of the border nicaragua claims

the chairman of the us civil rights 
commission today gave an uncivil rights award to the mayor of 
newark nj for allegedly pressuring rep peter rodino into 
retirement 
yielding to minority constituents rodino who is white and a 
democrat announced march 14 he would not seek a 21st term in 
congress minorities who make up the bulk of rodinos district 
have clamored for several years for a minority representative 
at a news conference civil rights commission chairman clarence 
pendleton who is black said he was awarding an uncivil rights 
award to newark mayor sharpe james who is also black and who 
according to pendleton worked with several other newark 
politicians and pressured rodino to retire from congress 
the notion that peter rodino doesnt represent the people in 
the 10th district is absurd pendleton said they have elected 
him to congress 20 times and continue to support his leading role 
on civil rights issues no matter the newark power brokers have 
decided that he is not their representative hes just the wrong 
color 
pam goldstein a spokeswoman for james said the mayor had not 
been told of the award but ms goldstein said she doubted 
james would be bothered by criticism from pendleton whose own 
civil rights record she termed a joke 
i would say its an endorsement for what the mayors doing in 
this city ms goldstein said 
rodinos press secretary larry spinelli said he would have no 
immediate comment on the matter

the government tuesday shut 
down the new nation a combative churchbacked antiapartheid 
newspaper making it the first victim of a campaign to stifle 
militant publications 
the government has killed the messenger instead of listening 
to the message said peter soal a parliament member for the 
liberal progessive federal party 
home affairs minister stoffel botha who has stateofemergency 
powers to censor publications singlehandedly said in a special 
decree that further issues of the blackoriented weekly newspaper 
are totally prohibited through june 10 
another cabinet minister stoffel van der merwe said the new 
nation was closed because it advocated violent overthrow of the 
government and supported communism 
it is absolutely astonishing that a publication issued under 
the name of a christian organization should act in this way he 
said 
the closure came a day after the 2yearold newspaper published 
by the southern african catholic bishops conference lost a court 
appeal seeking to postpone government action while it challenged 
the censorship regulations 
the new nation technically could resume publication after three 
months but botha could close it again if its contents in the 
ensuing issues dissatisfied him 
bishop reginald orsmond chairman of the newspapers publishing 
board said the 22member staff would be retained during the 
suspension he declined to predict would would happen to the paper 
if the suspension was extended 
orsmond accused the government of suppressing the voice of the 
people 
authorities have banned four of the new nations editions and 
seized two police have raided the papers offices and it was the 
first of six publications warned by botha that they could be closed 
or forced to obey an inhouse censor if they continued to publish 
material he found objectionable 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu whose steppedup political 
activities in recent weeks have angered the government described 
the new nations closure as quite scandalous 
only a government that is scared or already totalitarian or 
very close to totalitarian behaves in the kind of way that ours 
does tutu said 
with a circulation of about 60000 the new nation is the 
largest newspaper in south africa to devote virtually its entire 
content including sports and entertainment pages to politically 
related developments 
one regular feature was a learning section to bridge the 
deficiencies of apartheid education in simple language it told 
readers about black activists not covered in school courses and 
explained how to apply for a job feed a baby nutritiously treat 
an injured riot victim or protect oneself from tear gas 
the newspapers editor zwelakhe sisulu has been detained 
without charge for 16 months he joined the new nation after a year 
as a neiman fellow at harvard university 
sisulus father walter former secretarygeneral of the 
nowoutlawed african national congress is serving a life prison 
term along with anc leader nelson mandela for treason and sabotage 
stateofemergency regulations give botha nearly unlimited 
powers to deal with newspapers he feels might contribute to unrest 
under the regulations he does not have to give reasons for his 
actions 
the new nation lost an initial court challenge of the 
regulations and intends to pursue its case in an appellate court 
but on monday a supreme court rejected the newspapers bid to 
prevent closure during the appeal process 
the last edition of the new nation on march 17 said the 
government was bent on destroying what little freedom of 
expression is left in a country where the majority are voteless 
because the new nation dared to act as their voice it has now 
been damned to silence the paper said 
the issue also carried a quotation from president pw botha on 
the front page i believe in a free press and in free news 
media

prosecutors on tuesday opened an 
investigation into fraud influence peddling and financial scandals 
allegedly involving the brother of former president chun doohwan 
the prosecutor generals office said at least 10 officials have 
been questioned in an investigation of whether chun kyunghwan a 
younger brother of the former president embezzled funds of the 
saemaul undong development group 
top saemaul officials are suspected of diverting private and 
government subsidies to profitoriented projects land speculation 
and other illegal activities 
the former president left office feb 25 at the end of a 
sevenyear term he left tuesday on a private visit to the united 
states where he will meet president reagan on wednesday 
president roh taewoo who succeeded chun has pledged to 
eradicate abuses of power and corruption under previous 
governments in a recent move to reduce the expresidents power 
roh removed some chun supporters from their posts 
some political observers say the roh government opened the 
investigation to disscredit the former president and improve the 
current governments image 
there have been allegations of corruption by the saemaul group 
since the former president seized power with military backing in 
1980 and installed his brother as saemaul head 
the younger chun resigned in 1987 after being linked to 
gangsters 
prosecutor kang wonil said government officials also were being 
investigated to see if they had assisted or protected corruption 
my investigation team will unearth all malpractices and make 
public the results of the probe kang told reporters 
donga ilbo an influential seoul newspaper said the younger 
chun was responsible for a sharp drop in cattle prices in 1983 when 
he forced government officials to import cattle from the united 
states 
saemaul was formed in 1971 to improve rural and urban living 
standards but critics contend the countrys authoritarian 
governments have used the movement to promote government influence 
the party for peace and democracy controlled by opposition 
leader kim daejung charged that roh also aided saemaul officials 
when he was a government minister in 1982 
the opposition party demanded that roh and other family members 
of the former president be investigated

individual pickets have a right to carry signs 
within 500 feet of foreign embassies in the nations capital but 
police may disperse groups of three or more protesters there the 
supreme court ruled tuesday 
by a vote of 80 the justices upheld the district of columbias 
ban on groups demonstrating within 500 feet of embassies if police 
have reason to believe the protesters pose a threat to the 
security or peace of the embassy 
but by a separate 53 vote the court said the citys 
antipicketing prohibition that prevents even one or two people 
from carrying signs within 500 feet of the embassies violates 
freespeech protections 
justice sandra day oconnor in her opinion for the court said 
a blanket ban on signs that might be offensive to foreign diplomats 
goes too far 
it may serve an interest in protecting the dignity of foreign 
missions but it is not narrowly tailored she said a less 
restrictive alternative is readily available 
for example she said it would be constitutional to ban 
picketing that is designed to intimidate coerce threaten or 
harass a foreign official 
that type of ban has been adopted by congress for all areas of 
the nation with the exception of the district of columbia 
officials of the district of columbia government have said they 
are considering adopting a law based on the congressional model 
tuesdays ruling allows district police to continue to enforce a 
ban on demonstrations near embassies when at least three people 
take part and police fear there will be disruptions 
oconnor said police must reasonably believe that a threat to 
the security or peace of the embassy is present 
banning such gatherings does not prohibit peaceful 
congregations she said the ban is limited to groups posing a 
security threat 
oconnor rejected arguments that such a ban gives police too 
much discretion to break up demonstrations 
she said the test for deciding whether a demonstration is 
illegal is whether normal embassy activities have been or are 
about to be disrupted 
the ruling partially overturned a 1986 decision by the us 
circuit court of appeals in washington upholding all aspects of the 
district of columbias ban on protests near embassies 
that ruling was written by former judge robert h bork who 
recently retired from the appeals court bork was president 
reagans first choice to fill a supreme court vacancy last year but 
was rejected by the senate in a bitter fight 
tuesdays decision is believed to be the first time the high 
court gave full review to an opinion written by bork his backers 
during the senate confirmation fight emphasized that he had never 
been reversed by the high court 
the appeals court ruling that bork wrote in the embassy case 
said freespeech interests of the demonstrators were outweighed by 
the need to protect foreign emissaries 
the 500foot restrictions were challenged by michael boos j 
michael waller and bridget brooker members of the young 
conservative alliance of america 
they wanted to carry signs in front of the soviet embassy saying 
release sakharov referring to soviet dissident andrei 
sakharov who was allowed in 1986 to return to moscow ending his 
internal exile in the city of gorky 
the demonstrators also planned to picket the nicaraguan embassy 
with placards saying stop the killing in opposition to the 
sandinista government there 
the conservatives also said they were not receiving equal 
treatment with opponents of the south african government who have 
demonsrated near that nations embassy in washington 
many of those protesting south african racial policy have been 
arrested and then freed without being prosecuted 
joining oconnor in both phases of tuesdays ruling were 
justices william j brennan thurgood marshall john paul stevens 
and antonin scalia 
dissenting and voting to uphold the ban on individual picketing 
were chief justice william h rehnquist and justices byron r white 
and harry a blackmun 
justice anthony m kennedy did not take part in the decision 
in other action the court 
unanimously ruled in a case from michigan that states are 
barred from regulating the way interstate natural gas companies 
issue securities to finance their operations 
heard arguments in a case from illinois on whether the 
socalled miranda warnings police give criminal suspects are 
adequate to insure their right to legal help a decision is 
expected to be announced by july

kansas democrats decided tuesday to allow 
local delegates pledged to the presidential runnersup in 
saturdays caucuses to vote at district conventions after all 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis won the kansas contest with 
278 of the 764 local delegates elected and jesse jackson finished 
second with 235 
however there was confusion over the local delegates pledged to 
tennessee sen albert gore jr and missouri rep richard gephardt 
and those who were uncommitted 
under state rules local delegates who supported a candidate who 
didnt reach a 15 percent threshold would be nonentities at the 
district conventions april 23 
the state decided monday that those local delegates would be 
unable to vote at the district conventions and would be ignored in 
computing national delegates from the districts 
but after conferring with the democratic national committees 
compliance commission which interprets the national rules for 
electing delegates to the national convention the state party 
decided tuesday that all local delegates will be allowed to vote 
thus the delegates pledged to gore gephardt and uncommitted 
could possibly form larger blocs that could secure national 
delegates 
an initial calculation by the associated press based on 
candidates strength at the local level showed that dukakis won 16 
national delegates jackson 14 gore five and uncommitted four 
but when peculiarities in the kansas rules are applied gore and 
uncommitted lack enough statewide strength to claim additional 
delegates the ap recalculation and state party count give dukakis 
18 delegates jackson 16 gore three and two uncommitted

warfare some officials complain 
the violence was certainly graphic but no more graphic than 
on the streets city attorney james hahn said monday a day after

extras and real gang names

county this year 
the orion pictures movie is scheduled for release april 15 and 
antigang specialists fear violence could erupt at theaters if 
rival gang members go to see it

thing we need to be concerned about and careful were just going 
to wait and see and monitor the situation 
sheriffs sgt wes mcbride president of the california gang 
investigators association said colors glorified gangs at times 
id be surprised if we dont have some people die because of

a warning advising suspects that they may 
remain silent and are entitled to an attorney is not adequate to 
protect their rights under the constitution the supreme court was 
told on tuesday 
donald honchell a cook county ill public defender appealing 
the 1983 murder conviction of a gang member said the miranda 
warning does protect a person from selfincrimination under the 
fifth amendment 
but he argued that once a suspect is indicted the warning 
alone is not enough to protect the sixth amendment guarantee of 
legal help 
the supreme court is using the illinois case to decide whether 
the warnings that police have been required to give since 1966 are 
adequate to advise suspects of their right to legal aid 
it ruled in miranda vs arizona that people accused of 
crimes must be informed of their rights to remain silent to have a 
lawyer to have counsel present during questioning and to receive 
free legal assistance if needed 
honchell contended that even if a defendant has waived his 
rights under miranda he has an automatic right to a lawyer as soon 
as he is indicted and may not be asked from that point on to submit 
to interrogation 
there is a shield around the accused through which the police 
cannot get a waiver honchell said at no time after the 
indictment should the police be allowed to go to the defendant 
seek a waiver and begin to question 
however a prosecutor said authorities would be unfairly limited 
if they cannot interrogate a defendant who is read his rights and 
then agrees to speak without a lawyer present 
jack donatelli an assistant cook county prosecutor also said 
the warning is perfectly understandable to defendants 
they have a commonsense meaning that enables defendants to 
understand they have both a right to counsel and that things could 
go against them if they dont have a lawyer with them when theyre 
in custody and questioned donatelli said 
honchell said police coerced his client tyrone patterson 22 
of evanston ill into making incriminating statements by telling 
him he had been indicted but donatelli said patterson understood 
his rights and agreed to be questioned anyway 
patterson a member of the vice lords street gang is serving a 
24year sentence at the pontiac correction center for his 
conviction in the aug 21 1983 beating death of rival black 
mobsters gang member james pudge jackson 
according to court briefs he was arrested on a misdemeanor 
charge following a gang fight received a miranda warning and 
signed a statement waiving his right to counsel 
two days later after initially refusing to discuss jacksons 
death patterson was told he had been indicted signed a second 
miranda waiver and agreed to answer questions the briefs said

the hot debate between mayoral and council 
candidates in parker is whether to use a 12acre sodded area for 
polo or soccer 
this is the horsiest county in the united states we have more 
horses per person in our community than they do in kentucky said 
dean salisbury 66 mayor of this town of 700 about 15 miles 
southeast of denver 
voters will decide april 5 whether to retain salisbury the 
towns first and only mayor or replace him with one of two 
challengers ann waterman 43 or mark lewis 36 
seven people are running for the four open seats on the town 
council including three of the incumbents and four challengers 
salisbury who has won ribbons as a carriage and sulky race 
driver takes credit for starting a regional park from 150 acres 
dedicated to the town by developers then cultivating about 12 
acres into a lowcost utility field for soccer or softball 
but he also hopes the grassy field can be used to host an annual 
polo match to lure thousands of spectators to parker as part of a 
drive for economic development 
the challengers say such schemes indicate salisbury is a better 
promoter than mayor and claim he has ignored the towns mundane 
recreational needs

for years gayle e culberson has been 
teaching kids at karval high school how to make ethanol in a class 
on energy conservation 
but when the industrial arts teacher got a letter from the 
federal bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms saying his school 
would have to pay 500 a year because it was a fuel alcohol 
producer he became a little upset 
so culberson did what ever civics teacher recommends he wrote 
his senator 
culberson wrote sen william armstrong that the school could not 
afford the tax and could lose its permit to produce fuel alcohol 
his class makes a few quarts a year he said 
without the permit he said students in this eastern plains 
community would miss an important lesson 
at a time when it seems important to reduce foreign oil 
imports reduce pollution in our states when education is 
struggling to better itself with diminishing budgets why was there 
a tax of this nature levied on fuel alcohol plants and educational 
facilities in particular culberson asked armstrong 
armstrong has responded by drafting an amendment that would 
exempt from the tax producers who make less than 10000 gallons of 
fuel alcohol per year 
this is a classic case of the bureaucracy gone berserk

gen manuel antonio noriegas 
opponents scorned what they called a cynical offer to negotiate his 
resignation and kept panama shut down tuesday with a general strike 
intended to force him out 
an estimated 90 percent of offices and industries were shut by 
the strike which appeared to be gaining support on its second day 
most shops and stores were closed public transportation was halted 
and many government employees did not go to work 
panama is out of cash because of pressure from the united states 
to force the ouster of noriega who is the real power in panama as 
commander of its 15000 soldiers and police the us dollar is the 
national currency and the supply has been cut off 
most government workers were paid only 75 of their midmonth 
wages last week and the 33 million endofthemonth payroll for 
the 130000 public employees problably wont be met pension checks 
due wednesday have been delayed at least until march 28 
hunger is spreading among workers as well as the poor 
unemployed and elderly many washerwomen cleaning women maids and 
cooks have lost their jobs because there is no money with which to 
pay them 
manuel solis palma the civilian noriega chose to run the 
government said on television monday night the general would 
resign in exchange for a national dialogue to reconcile 
differences with opponents of the regime he prefaced the offer 
with a diatribe against the united states 
the implication was that noriega under federal court indictment 
in florida on narcotics and money laundering charges would stay in 
panama and might retain power behind the scenes 
calling the offer a noble gesture solis palma said noriega 
pledged as an officer and a gentleman to resign before 
presidential elections scheduled for may 1989 
solis palma who has the title minister in charge of the 
presidency said he would not accept noriegas resignation unless 
all of the political forces in the country join a national 
dialogue 
noriega put solis palma in office feb 26 after president eric 
arturo delvalle tried to fire the general and the legislature 
dismissed delvalle instead 
delvalle still recognized by the united states is hiding in 
panama his dismissal began a run on panamas banks and they were 
closed the next week 
pressure from washington has included freezing virtually all 
panamanian funds in the united states including revenue from the 
panama canal 
reagan administration spokesmen rejected the noriega proposal 
last week noriega turned down a us plan for him to leave panama 
and live in spain 
the general said his plan was a panamanian solution to the 
crisis 
i have no reason to talk to the united states he told 
reporters after solis palmas speech i talk to panamanians 
guillermo cochez vice president of the christian democratic 
party said the proposed discussion would occur in a panel of 33 
members 22 of them supporting noriega 
this is not a dialogue he said its just cynicism 
aurelio barria said the general has to go immediately not 
eventually 
barria is a leader of the national civic crusade a coalition of 
200 business professional labor and political groups that called 
the general strike it was organized last june to lead the campaign 
against noriega 
solis palma spoke on television for 30 minutes devoting all but 
the last five minutes to castigating the united states he accused 
washington of economic aggression in an undeclared state of 
war 
he claimed the united states wants to renege on the 1977 
treaties under which the panama canal will be turned over to this 
country at midnight dec 31 1999 
the canal guarded by about 10000 us troops has been 
operating normally despite the crisis the united states sent 300 
more soldiers monday most of them security personnel 
because of increasing hunger the rev francisco verar said his 
roman catholic church in the poor san miguelito suburb is feeding 
more families every day 
if we had not done this there would have been chaos even 
cases of death he said we have people who have gone five six 
days without food 
longshoremen on strike for more than a week voted 
overwhelmingly tuesday to stay out but accepted part payment of 
back wages despite fears of compromising their position 
there are mothers and fathers who have to feed their 
children said luis asprilla a union leader 
in some parts of panama city workers formed vigilante groups to 
guard stores and other places of employment looting occurred 
during street protests against noriega last week

a bladder cancer treatment that 
avoids surgery has shown promising results in a preliminary study 
a scientist said tuesday 
twentyone of 36 patients who have completed the 
drugandradiation therapy were found free of disease for three to 
21 months said george prout professor of surgery at harvard 
medical school 
three others showed partial remission while treatment failed 
outright for nine patients the other three were not evaluable he 
told science writers at a seminar sponsored by the american cancer 
society 
the study focused on patients whose cancers had invaded the 
bladder muscle a condition usually treated by surgically removing 
the bladder prout said 
if the bladder is removed the patient must wear a bag to 
collect urine for the rest of his life it also essentially ends 
sexual activity 
the experimental treatment attacks liver cancer with radiation 
to the pelvis plus treatment with a mix of the drugs methotrexate 
velban and cisplatinum

nearly 300000 people have become sick and 11 
have died in shanghais 2monthold hepatpresses soon will 
be turning out new editions of highly popular works by mikhail 
bulgakov author of the master and margarita and boris 
pasternak who won the 1958 nobel literature prize for his novel 
doctor zhivago it has not yet been published in book form in 
his homeland 
the newspapers did not say whether foreign literature was 
included among the books to be made available foreign writers such 
as jack london ernest hemingway and emile zola are very popular in 
the soviet union and some have been available for years 
no details were given on the pricing system to be used for books 
published by their authors 
this is not going to be a cheap venture for the author 
pravda warned depending on the number of copies and the volume 
such a publication will cost roughly 2000 rubles and more 
that sum the equivalent of 3340 represents nearly a years 
pay for the average industrial worker 
the author in return will receive 20 percent of the sales 
income pravda said 
the program has not yet been put into the form of law pravda 
noted but already state publishing houses have many applications 
from authors who want to pay to see their works in print 
by offering an alternative to creation of publishing 
cooperatives the state publishing committee retains a monopoly on 
what gets into print 
on a related subject the newspaper soviet culture disclosed 
tuesday that glavlit the state body which for decades has been 
responsible for censorship is conducting a review of 6000 books 
held in special detention storehouses 
most of the fiction and nonfiction titles were banned during 
the 29year dictatorship of josef v stalin and removed from 
library shelves and book kiosks because their authors were deemed 
to have espoused politically hazardous ideas 
the vast majority of those books were works whose authors were 
subjected to repression during the years of stalins personality 
cult vladimir a solodin a member of the review committee told 
soviet culture the others had other faults for example 
forewords written by such repressed politicians quotes from their 
works or their photographs 
among the blacklisted books were 180 that contained references 
to nikolai i bukharin and 70 that mentioned alexei i rykov two 
prominent political figures from the early years of the soviet 
government executed by stalin but recently rehabilitated by 
gorbachev 
glavlit or the chief directorate for the protection of state 
secrets in publishing was created in 1922 to ensure freedom of the 
soviet press from ideological impurity it has served since as the 
chief censorship agency and would have banned the blacklisted 
books in the first place 
a glavlit committee went through 4000 of the ba 
readers but said the review was helping to resolve the deficit in 
good literature 
the 500 books left in special detention are mostly profoundly 
instigatory literature and nationalistic writings that could be 
used for ill purposes if allowed into general distribution solodin 
said 
the decision to keep them under wraps is not final and the 
glavlit committee will take another look at them once the initial 
screening is completed solodin said

the chairman of the us civil rights 
commission announced tuesday that he was bestowing an uncivil 
rights award on the mayor of newark nj for pressuring rep 
peter rodino dnj to retire because he is white 
chairman clarence pendleton who is black said that rodino 
receives the victim of uncivil rights award for the way in 
which he was treated by newark power brokers who have decided 
that he is not their representative hes just the wrong color 
at a news conference where he criticized the civil rights 
restoration act and the resignation under pressure of gallaudet 
university president elisabeth zinser pendleton said he was 
instituting his own personal uncivil rights award program in an 
effort to highlight the absurdities committed in the name of 
civil rights 
pendletons first recipient was newark mayor sharpe james who 
is black james has said the courts carved out rodinos 10th 
congressional district more than 12 years ago to elect a minority 
congressman and that its time to get that done pendleton 
said james worked with several other newark politicians in 
pressuring rodino to retire 
rodino announced march 14 that he would not seek a 21st term in 
congress minorities who make up the bulk of rodinos district 
have clamored for several years for a minority representative 
rodino has been pressured to retire so that a proper read 
this black representative can be elected said pendleton the 
notion that peter rodino doesnt represent the people in the 10th 
district is absurd they have elected him to congress 20 times and 
continue to support his leading role on civil rights issues 
james declined to respond to the criticism from pendleton said 
pam goldstein a spokeswoman for the mayor i will not dignify 
his comments with a response she quoted james as saying 
rodino also declined comment said spokesman larry spinelli 
pendleton said he would bestow his new awards as often as they 
are properly earned perhaps once a month if the civil rights 
restoration act passes today over the presidents veto i suppose i 
will have more than enough material 
pendleton said the civil rights restoration act represents an 
unwarranted invasion by big brother 
the statute forbids distribution of federal funds to entire 
institutions state and local government agencies and many 
corporations if any part of them practices discrimination it was 
spurred by a 1984 supreme court ruling that civil rights laws 
applied only to a specific program or activity receiving federal 
aid 
the head of the civil rights panel also said that one of his 
candidates for a victim of uncivil rights award had been 
zinser who was named the first woman president in the 124year 
history of gallaudet university for the deaf only to resign 
following protests over the fact that she was not deaf

patrick steptoe the doctor who delivered the 
worlds first testtube baby in 1978 and helped pioneer a technique 
that revolutionized infertilty treatment has died of cancer he 
was 74 
steptoe a gynecologist and obstetrician who pioneered the in 
vitro fertilization technique with physiologist robert edwards 
died monday night at chaucer hospital in canterbury 
on tuesday he was to have been decorated by queen elizabeth ii 
as a commander of the british empire an honor one step below a 
knighthood for services to his country 
an expert in infertility steptoe also was to have received the 
british medical associations gold medal one of the professions 
highest awards at its annual meeting in july 
mr steptoe made an invaluable contribution to medicine and 
raised the honor and dignity of the profession the association 
said british surgeons use the designation mr instead of 
dr 
the testtube baby technique gave hope to millions of childless 
couples and spawned a range of fertility treatments for both men 
and women 
more than 1000 testtube babies have been born as a result of 
treatment at bourn hall clinic near cambridge run by steptoe and 
edwards and thousands of others have born elsewhere in the world 
it is a very great loss to bourn hall and to me personally 
edwards said in the last three years he was working under 
considerable difficulties but carried on 
he wished to do service to his patients for as long as 
possible 
truck driver john brown father of louise joy brown the worlds 
first testtube baby said he and his wife lesley are forever 
in his debt 
there is no way we or any other couples mr steptoe helped 
can possibly repay him for what he has given them brown said 
louise was born on july 25 1978 in oldham england four years 
later the browns had a second testtube baby natalie jane 
the birth of louise brown the first human conceived outside the 
womb was hailed as a medical breakthrough on the order of the 
first heart transplant but some people were horrified seeing it 
as the dawn of a brave new world of baby farms and genetic 
engineering 
i am not a wizard or a frankenstein steptoe once said 
all i want to do is help women whose childproducing mechanism 
is slightly faulty 
under the in vitro fertilization technique which actually 
involves no test tubes eggs are removed from the prospective 
mother and fertilized with the intended fathers sperm in a glass 
dish the resulting embryo is then implanted in the mothers womb 
it took 10 years for edwards and steptoe to develop the 
technique 
working at cambridge university edwards worked out the 
procedure for fertilizing eggs in a laboratory dish and steptoe 
adapted a technique known as laparoscopy a way of seeing and 
operating inside the abdomen by inserting a tube with a fiber optic 
light 
originally intended for women who were unable to conceive 
because of blocked fallopian tubes in vitro fertilization has 
given rise to such procedures as embryo freezing egg and sperm 
donation embryo transfer and surrogate motherhood 
steptoe who was born on june 9 1913 qualified as a doctor in 
1939 and immediately went into world war ii service as a royal navy 
surgeon he was a prisoner of war in italy from 1941 to 1943 and 
was discharged with the rank of surgeon lieutenant commander in 
1946 
he worked as an obstetrician in state hospitals moving in 1951 
to oldham a northern england city where in the fall of 1967 he 
teamed up with edwards 
in 1984 a furor erupted over allegations that they had 
experimented on embryos although the scientists later insisted 
they had only observed embryos 
the same year the team proposed implanting embryos into animals 
to determine whether some conditions favorable to fertility exist 
in the animals uterus but not in a womans the idea eventually 
was dropped 
but steptoe said he and edwards never thought their work was in 
any way unethical we are not creating life he said we have 
merely done what many people try to do in all kinds of medicine 
to help nature 
steptoe said the greatest contribution of their work would 
likely be in early embryo research into genetic diseases 
he is survived by his wife sheena and a son and daughter 
funeral arrangements were incomplete

a car salesman didnt think hed be stepping on 
any paws when he put a pair of sevenfoot lion statues on the roof 
of his auto dealership and advertised the car institute 
but a roar of sorts erupted from the art institute of chicago 
which has lions guarding its entrance 
i didnt think people would be confused said joe levy jr 
the car dealer who said tuesday he had agreed to a compromise i 
dont know how much of their traffic weve been getting i think 
theres room for both of us 
the art institute contended ads for the car institute 
violated a museum trademark 
we agreed to discontinue the car institute levy said 
but theyve agreed to let us keep the lions on the building in 
evanston 
robert mars the art institutes vice president for 
administrative affairs said the advertising was the real problem 
to allow levy to capitalize on the institutions image might allow 
others to do the same and in an offensive way mars said 
i think it maybe sends a signal out to people who 
alltoofrequently try to use images from our collection that 
arent terribly appropriate he said 
mars said a mistake was made long ago when the museum did not 
protect its copyright of the painting american gothic by grant 
wood now we can no longer say anything about how parodies use 
the sternfaces farm couple mars said 
levy said he got the call from the museum attorney about a month 
ago last week he had his fiberglass lions painted the colors of 
nearby northwestern university to help clear up the confusion 
one is now white the other purple 
we hope they dont object he said 
mars said the lions even in purple and white can stay

four palestinians who had sought 
political asylum in sweden were ordered expelled tuesday for 
undisclosed security reasons a government official said 
the order came after prime minister ingvar carlssons government 
met in a special session to consider their appeal against a ruling 
by police and immigration authorities that they leave the country 
said erik lempert a senior official of the labor ministry 
a fifth palestinian was granted a residents visa for 
humanitarian reasons despite objections by the national security 
police lempert said 
he said the government normally granted asylum to stateless 
palestinians arriving from lebanon since the 1982 israeli invasion 
of that country but police objections weighed heavier in these 
cases 
one of the four was married to a swedish woman expecting their 
child in april 
lempert declined to specify the suspicions against the 
palestinians lawyers representing them were ordered not to 
comment but the attorneys were quoted by the national news agency 
tt as saying they would appeal

republican presidential hopeful bob dole 
campaigned in wisconsin on tuesday rather than return to washington 
for the senate override vote of president reagans veto of civil 
rights legislation saying i wasnt needed 
dole indicated both opposition and support for reagans veto of 
the civil rights bill in a confusing series of statements 
on a radio callin show dole said he would vote to override the 
veto if he were in washington but he added if it were the 
deciding vote i would side with the president 
he later elaborated saying the only reason he would vote to 
sustain reagans veto would be to give the white house a chance 
to rework the bill in a speech to milwaukee businessmen dole 
said that bill is not nearly as bad as advertised 
in washington his spokeswoman also issued a doubleedged 
statement dale tate said dole republican leader in the senate 
opposes the president on this issue and would like to reverse 
the supreme court ruling that prompted the legislation but she 
said if his vote were needed to sustain the veto he would 
in principle he opposes the president she said 
the democraticcontrolled senate had more than enough votes to 
provide the twothirds majority needed to override reagans veto 
with or without dole who was campaigning in wisconsin in advance 
of the states april 5 republican presidential primary 
vice president george bush the faraway frontrunner for the gop 
nomination announced on monday that he supported reagans veto 
im not going to start differing with the president after 7 12 
years into the vice presidency he said 
dole was criticized by bush earlier in the campaign for failing 
to take a clearcut position on key issues such as tax increases 
and arms control 
and a variety of statements by dole and allies left a confused 
impression on the hotly debated civil rights bill 
sen alan simpson the gop senate whip said he had been 
authorized to say on the senate floor that were he dole present 
and voting he would vote to sustain the presidents veto 
dole himself issued a statement for the record which did not say 
how he would vote 
i have always supported legislation to overturn grove city to 
restore the broad civil rights coverage that existed prior to that 
case he said 
at the same time i recognize that the grove city bill is 
not a perfect bill i am not fully satisfied with it but the 
fact remains that the administration and its congressional allies 
had the opportunity to offer amendments and they were voted down 
the legislation stems from a 1984 supreme court ruling that says 
that an organization receiving federal aid must follow 
antidiscrimination rules only for the program that receives the 
aid and not for the entire organization or institution 
the legislation would erase that distinction and require that an 
entire organization follow the rules dole was absent when the 
senate passed the bill in january reagan vetoed the bill saying 
it was too broad and infringed on the activities of religious 
groups small buisnesses and others 
civil rights groups have strongly suppored the bill and favor 
overriding reagans veto

the soviet union on tuesday increased official 
pressure on armenia and azerbaijan to halt ethnic unrest that has 
left at least 32 people dead 
the tass news agency said the presidium of the supreme soviet of 
the russian federation the nations largest republic and 
equivalent bodies in the ukraine byelorussia georgia and 
uzbekistan called on the national parliament to take firm action to 
end the tension 
the moves came amid increasingly negative coverage in the 
official press of armenian demands to annex the predominantly 
armenian nagornokarabakh region which is part of neighboring 
azerbaijan and the reported arrest of a leading armenian 
nationalist 
tamara grigoryants wife of armenianborn dissident sergei 
grigoryants said in an interview that paryur arikyan was arrested 
tuesday evening by three policemen in central moscow after meeting 
with a western journalist 
she said arikyan was accused of crossing the street illegally 
and that he informed her of his arrest by calling from a pay 
telephone as the policemen stood by arikyan said saturday he had 
traveled clandestinely to moscow after his passport was confiscated 
in armenia 
the government newspaper izvestia on tuesday criticized armenian 
activists who it said gathered almost 4000 people for a meeting in 
yerevan on march 19 to devise strategy to press their demands 
on monday the communist party newspaper pravda charged the 
armenians campaign has a clear antisocialist spirit 
ethnic rioting broke out in sumgait a azerbaijani city after 
armenians began protesting last month for annexation of 
nagornokarabakh officials say 32 people were killed but armenian 
activists say the death toll was much higher and that most of the 
dead were armenians killed by azerbaijanis 
the russian federation expressed concern and alarm over the 
ethnic unrest and asked the presidium of the national supreme 
soviet the countrys nominal parliament to adopt resolute 
measures aimed at uniting in all ways the soviet peoples 
the soviet constitution says little about the rights of 
autonomous regions such as nagornokarabakh but says the territory 
of a republic such as azerbaijan or armenia may not be changed 
without its consent that means azerbaijan would have to approve 
the annexation of nagornokarabakh to armenia 
under soviet law each of the countrys 15 republics is 
ostensibly sovereign but the appeals from the five soviet 
republics about nagornokarabakh seemed designed to serve as a 
reason for the national government in moscow to act on the 
simmering territorial dispute 
the policymaking central committee of the communist party 
rejected the demand for annexation on feb 20 but soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev promised on feb 26 that the issue would be 
considered when the central committee holds another meeting to 
discuss national disputes 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a regular 
news briefing that protests continued in armenia on sunday and 
monday a nationalist source said armenians would gather again in 
their capital of yerevan on saturday to decide whether to call a 
general strike 
gerasimov said the situation in azerbaijan and armenia still is 
too tense to allow foreign journalists to travel there 
a curfew is still in effect in sumgait although the situation 
there is regarded as absolutely normal gerasimov said in 
armenia i wouldnt call it normal because there are demonstrations 
going on and thats not normal 
arikyan told the associated press on monday that 7000 people 
had gathered in yerevan to protest the pravda article published 
earlier that day criticizing the movement to annex nagornokarabakh 
at a tuesday news conference in moscow before his reported 
arrest arikyan 38 a former political prisoner read what he said 
was the text of a telegram from armenian journalist y arakyelan to 
pravda editor viktor g afanasyev 
according to arikyan the correspondent said the article was an 
editors article expressing the will of the communist party 
central committee rather than the views of those whose names 
were attached to it 
arikyan chairman of an armenian nationalist group called 
alliance for national determination said the pravda article was an 
indication that authorities will not agree to unite 
nagornokarabakh with armenia despite appeals from local communist 
party and government officials 
arikyan once headed an underground armenian nationalist group 
called the national unification party and was jailed for 17 years 
beginning in 1969 for his political activities 
he said armenian activists in yerevan claim 78 people were 
killed in sumgait but he said i think a worse tragedy than 
sumgait awaits us

communist chinas chief representative in hong 
kong was quoted tuesday as praising modern capitalism as a great 
creation of human civilization 
xu jiatuns comments appeared in the probeijing wen wei po 
newspaper which ran the text of an interview he gave with a 
chinese magazine and appeared aimed at boosting confidence in hong 
kong after 1997 when china takes over the capitalist territory 
we have some comrades who always fear capitalism but in fact 
they dont understand that the modern capitalist system is a great 
creation of human civilization said xu who as head of the 
xinhua news agency branch is chinas chief representative in hong 
kong 
the xinhua official was quoted as saying china should 
systematically absorb the beneficial experience and knowledge from 
modern capitalism which he praised for guaranteeing an 
enivronment of free competition allowing production forces to 
develop and creating a good legal system 
in the past we believed capitalism would quickly die out 
xu was quoted as saying looking from todays perspective modern 
capitalism has a lot of room to develop 
chinas communist party last year reaffirmed its commitment to 
opening up the country and pushing marketoriented reforms to 
stimulate the economy 
xus comments not only indicated strong support for reform but 
also appeared designed to allay fears about what will happen to 
this bastion of capitalism after china takes over in 1997 
much of hong kongs welleducated middle class are seeking to 
move overseas before the territory reverts to chinese rule even 
though beijing has promised the territory can retain its capitalist 
economic system and enjoy a high degree of autonomy 
but many of hong kongs 57 million people are refugees from 
political campaigns in communist china and remain pessimistic xu 
acknowledged they have a kind of distrust of the communist party 
which is completely understandable 
he said residents will be allowed to criticize the communist 
party and socialism after 1997 but will be asked to love china 
and love hong kong 
this is what we call one country two systems xu was 
quoted as saying this will benefit chinas cooperation with 
every circle of people in hong kong especially the middle class

the house voted 4011 tuesday to continue and 
expand a program to encourage private companies to develop drugs 
for combatting rare diseases 
the bill which was sent to the senate extends the socalled 
orphan drug program through fiscal 1990 it would also expand 
the program which is overseen by the food and drug administration 
to include special devices and foods needed to help people with 
unusual maladies 
under the program companies are given tax credits and 
sevenyear exclusive marketing rights if they develop products for 
rare diseases without incentives the companies would not pursue 
development of those products because the small number of 
beneficiaries would not make it profitable according to supporters 
of the legislation 
the revised statute while expanding the program would triple 
its cost in the next few years the current annual authorization of 
4 million would grow to 14 million in fiscal 1990 
the reagan administration has said it has no objection to the 
legislation 
rep henry waxman dcalif chairman of the health subcommittee 
of the house committee on energy and commerce had also sought to 
include a provision to limit profits on orphan drugs however the 
restrictions were opposed by the pharmaceutical industry and waxman 
dropped them rather than face possible stalling tactics when the 
bill reached the senate 
the only dissenting vote was cast by rep philip crane rill

a court on tuesday fined toshiba machine co 
15750 for illegally selling sensitive technology to the soviet 
union and ordered suspended sentences for two former toshiba 
machine executives 
tokyo district court judge toshio yonezawa found that toshiba 
machines actions seriously damaged the economic activities 
foreign relations and trade policies of our nation which is trying 
to protect free trade and international cooperation 
between 1982 and 1984 toshiba machine a subsidiary of toshiba 
corp japans secondlargest electronics maker sold 17 million 
in sophisticated milling machines to the soviet union part of them 
allegedly through norways stateowned kongsberg vaapenfabrikk 
us officials alleged the machines helped moscow build propellers 
that make submarines quieter and harder to detect 
since the statute of limitations on that action had expired 
however the current case involved charges that parts and software 
were sold later in violation of foreign trade and exchange laws 
based on the regulations of the western allies coordinating 
committee for exports to communist nations 
the defense argued that the machine parts and software could 
have been produced by the soviet union and there had been no 
violation worthy of serious legal consideration 
but yonezawa said the violation cannot be dismissed as 
trivial since it involved misleading explanations made by toshiba 
machine officials to the ministry of international trade and 
industry and the destruction of related papers after the incident 
was uncovered 
yonezawa added that toshiba machines actions fed distrust of 
the japanese government and industry in the united states 
he held that the sale occurred with the approval of the 
companys president and under the direction of the corporations 
top executives 
hiroaki tanimura former deputy senior project manager of the 
companys first engineering department was sentenced to one year 
in prison with the sentenced suspended for three years 
ryuzo hayashi a former manager in toshiba machines material 
supply division was sentenced to 10 months in prison also 
suspended for three years 
following the decision joichi aoi president of toshiba corp 
told reporters the toshiba group has been taking the utmost 
efforts to assure that no such incident will recur and there will 
be no change in this policy in the future 
earlier in the milling machine case the japanese government 
banned toshiba machine from exporting to any communist nations for 
one year

a bill authorizing 35 million in 
transitional expenses for president reagans successor and 1 
million for reagan to move to retirement in california next january 
was approved tuesday by the house government operations committee 
the democraticcontrolled committee rejected a republican move 
to increase the expense allowance for the outgoing president to 
15 million from 1 million the level in effect since 1976 to 
offset the effects of inflation 
the proposed boost was opposed by rep jack brooks dtexas the 
panels chairman who said the budget squeeze requires congress to 
make some hard choices on spending cuts 
the panel approved raising the presidentelects allowance for 
transitional expenses to 35 million from 2 million the level in 
effect for the past 12 years it also rejected 249 a move by 
rep robert s walker rpa to forbid the presidentelect from 
accepting private donations to supplement federal transitional 
funds 
the 1 million for reagans initial retirement expenses if 
approved by the house and senate would cover his moving expenses 
from the white house to california and the costs of establishing an 
office for six months until funds for former presidents become 
available under a separate law

the military services had no problem meeting 
their recruiting goals last last year but there were some 
adverse signs for the future in lower reenlistment results the 
pentagon said tuesday 
releasing its latest quarterly report the defense department 
said the army navy air force and marine corps signed up 66300 
recruits during the first quarter of fiscal 1988 which ended dec 
31 
that compares with a combined goal of 65400 and all four 
services met or exceeded their individual quarterly objectives the 
pentagon said 
moreover the percentage of firsttime enlistees with a high 
school diploma actually increased slightly from 92 percent during 
the period in fiscal 1987 to 93 percent in fiscal 1988 
retention reenlistment results for the first quarter of 
fiscal 1988 were also satisfactory but with some adverse signs 
grant s green jr assistant defense secretary for manpower said 
in a statement 
firstterm reenlistment rates trailed comparable fiscal 1987 
statistics for three of the four services and while overall career 
retention rates showed some improvement over fiscal 1987 retention 
among secondterm and career navy petty officers continued to 
decline after falling short of objectives last year 
the pentagon pays particular attention to the percentage of men 
and women willing to reenlist after completing their initial 
obligation viewing it as a measure not only of military readiness 
and experience in the force but also job satisfaction 
according to the latest report 46 percent of military personnel 
eligible to reenlist for the first time during the period did so 
down from 49 percent during the comparable period in fiscal 1987 
some of the individual service declines however were much more 
precipitous for example the air forces first term reenlistment 
rate dropped from 74 percent to 62 percent over the year 
the marine corps rate dropped from 24 percent to 18 percent 
and the navys rate fell from 56 percent to 51 percent the army 
managed to buck the trend with a small increase from 40 percent in 
fiscal 1987 to 43 percent this fiscal year 
green noted that various reenlistment bonus programs had been 
suspended for 65 days during the period awaiting congressional 
action 
but most retention measures have fallen several percentage 
points below their 198384 peaks and this trend has been 
particularly noticeable among personnel in highertechnology skills 
that are in particular demand in the private sector he added 
meanwhile dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman restated 
the administrations strong opposition to a cut in the 43 percent 
pay raise proposed for military personnel in fiscal 1989 which 
begins oct 1 
the 43 percent hike exceeds the 2 percent proposed for civilian 
government workers and some congressional leaders are now arguing 
military and civilian workers should be treated the same 
the comparability studies show an 11 percent gap between 
military and civilian pay howard said the 43 percent pay 
raise is fully justified unless we want to return to the situation 
that we saw in the past where the disparity was so great that good 
people couldnt afford to stay in the military

extracts of a tropical plant appeared 
to reduce levels of hepatitis virus and liver cancer rates in 
woodchucks a hopeful sign for the worlds 200 million human 
viruscarriers at risk for the cancer a scientist said tuesday 
the trends emerged in analysis of data on about 60 animals that 
had become infected with the woodchuck version of the hepatitis b 
virus said baruch blumberg of the fox chase cancer center in 
philadelphia woodchucks are used in hepatitis research because the 
virus they carry so closely resembles the human hepatitis b virus 
blumberg stressed that the results are only suggestive and a 
prelude to a formal study of the plant extracts effects 
even if it doesnt get rid of the virus altogether it may 
still be useful he said after speaking to science writers at a 
seminar sponsored by the american cancer society 
that is because the virus now can lie dormant for decades after 
infection and if the extract can extend that period it may 
essentially block the progression to liver cancer until after a 
person has died of something else he said 
infection with hepatitis virus b has long been linked to later 
development of cancer originating in the liver as opposed to 
cancer that starts elsewhere in the body and spreads to the liver 
studies in taiwan have found that male carriers of the virus run 
more than 200 times the risk of developing liver cancer than 
noncarriers giving them a 40 percent chance of dying from the 
disease blumberg said 
the cancer is particularly common in asia and subsaharan 
africa he said in the united states the cancer society expects 
about 6000 new cancers of the liver this year 
the best way to deal with the problem is vaccination at birth 
for people at risk of the disease blumberg said such a vaccine is 
not recommended for the american population generally because the 
overall risk is so low he said 
china and taiwan have programs for vaccinating newborn children 
he said his institution has established a vaccine program in 
philadelphia directed at newborn children of carrier mothers and 
others in their household he said he hopes other such programs 
will be established 
but the world already has about 200 million carriers of the 
virus and more will be added every day until vaccination programs 
become fully effective he said 
the plant called phyllanthus ammarus grows in india and 
throughout the tropical world blumberg said it can be grown in 
the united states he said 
the extract of the plant appears to fight the virus by blocking 
a substance called dna polymerase that the virus needs to reproduce 
itself he said 
when the extract was injected into the bellies of woodchucks 
infected for a month evidence of the virus disappeared he said 
those infected longer showed decreases in the amount of virus in 
their blood 
treated animals also developed significantly fewer liver cancers 
than others blumberg said 
limited studies in animals suggest the extract does not cause 
significant side effects he said scientists are trying to isolate 
the portion of the extract that fights the virus he said 
raymond koff a liver disease specialist and professor of 
medicine at boston university said the work should be followed up 
with more study innovative exciting stuff has to be looked 
at he said in a telephone interview

a gas distribution company has 
warned customers nationwide that cylinders of silane gas may have 
been contaminated the same way as one that exploded killing three 
people officials said tuesday 
liquid carbonic industries corp of chicago issued the warning 
monday that the cylinders of silane may have been contaminated with 
an unstable oxidizer said dewey erzinger the companys director 
of public relations 
erzinger said he could not estimate the number liquid carbonic 
customers across the country but said most are in the electronics 
industry the company manufactures industrial and medical gases 
such as silane which is widely used to coat silicon wafers 
erzinger said company officials are investigating the origin of 
the cylinder that exploded thursday at the gollob analytical 
services plant killing three people and seriously injuring a 
fourth 
the state department of environmental protection has tentatively 
traced the cylinder believed to contain a volatile mixture of 
nitrous oxide and silane through three states before it reached 
berkeley heights 
the exact cause of the blast remains unknown say officials with 
the dep and liquid carbonics 
in its note to its customers liquid carbonic said the explosion 
may have been caused by some kind of oxidizer being drawn back into 
the cylinder 
if your process utilizes silane gas product in conjunction 
with oxidizers such as nitrous oxide or oxygen you are urged to 
make certain that oxidizers cannot be drawn back into your silane 
gas container the notice said 
meanwhile tuesday liquid carbonic completed removal of 300 
cylinders of silane from its harrison plant erzinger said he said 
the company may conduct similar removals at other plants around the 
country 
on monday nearly 1000 workers were held off their jobs on the 
san francisco peninsula after canisters containing potentially 
explosive chemicals were discovered at semiconductor facilities 
there 
chemical inspectors eventually concluded that the four canisters 
at advanced micro devices inc in santa clara and teledyne 
semiconductor in mountain view were harmless 
a similar precautionary evacuation took place sunday in 
pocatello idaho when officials of the gould incs semiconductor 
plant examined silane cylinders belonging to liquid carbonic 
one of the men killed in thursdays blast dennis feeney was a 
regional manager for liquid carbonic at the companys harrison 
facility the two others killed were gollob employees 
a liquid carbonic deliveryman james diemer lost a leg and 
suffered shrapnel wounds he was in fair condition tuesday in the 
plastic surgery ward of bellevue hospital center in manhattan

sen albert gore jr got the meeting hed 
sought with new york gov mario cuomo on monday but he got no 
endorsement for his presidential bid despite complimentary words 
from the governor 
hes very bright cuomo said of gore hes very deep in 
his knowledge of government he has a particular kind of appeal 
thats especially attractive to the democratic party at this 
moment 
but cuomo said he and lt gov stan lundine are not ready to 
publicly back a candidate he said of gore it was nice of him to 
come by but he added that during their private meeting at the 
state capitol sen gore said nothing that i havent heard him 
say before 
gore had tried to arrange a meeting with cuomo early last month 
in albany but couldnt cuomo said gore had asked to stop at the 
capitol again monday as part of a campaign trip through new york in 
advance of the states april 19 primary gore also campaigned in 
connecticut monday 
of course i asked for his support and we talked about his 
desire to play the most constructive role possible in helping the 
country and helping the democratic party win a victory in 
november gore said the tennessee senator said they also 
discussed problems new york and other states are wrestling with 
such as housing the homeless and aids 
gore rose to third place in the battle for nominating delegates 
by winning five southern states in the super tuesday primaries on 
march 8 
cuomo said the democratic race between frontrunners michael 
dukakis jesse jackson and gore has created a confused picture 
politically 
were stan lundine and i now accelerating the process of 
trying to determine how best to be useful to the democratic 
party cuomo said maybe well go beyond that and endorse 
somebody well know within a couple of weeks 
the fact that cuomo has yet to endorse any democratic candidate 
coupled with his refusal to rule out accepting a draft for the 
nomination if there should be a deadlocked national convention has 
kept alive the speculation that he might be angling for the 
nomination howver cuomo says he is not a candidate for president 
this year 
later gore in a quick swing through connecticut predicted he 
would do well in the states democratic presidential primary next 
tuesday despite massachusetts gov michael dukakis strong regional 
appeal here 
im extremely optimistic that were going to do very well 
here in spite of the fact that its in the backyard of one of my 
opponents gore said during a brief stop at an office building 
construction site outside of hartford 
were going to surprise some people here gore said 
gore expressed hope that connecticut gov william a oneill 
would make an endorsement soon rather than remaining uncommitted 
until the democratic convention in atlanta in july 
id love to have the governors endorsement and ive asked him 
for his support gore said but i certainly understand why he 
wants to take a close look at the race and think about it some 
more 
gore praised oneill lavishly calling him a tremendous 
leader whos done an outstanding job as governor

president reagan refused monday to discuss a 
possible pardon for former white house aide oliver north and a 
presidential spokesman said norths lawyer had not contacted the 
administration about the matter 
in response to a reporters question at the end of a ceremony to 
sign an afghanistan day proclamation reagan replied not going 
to discuss that now 
separately presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater repeated the 
administrations oftstated position that theres been no 
discussions of pardons 
he also said that the administration has not been contacted by 
norths attorney brendan sullivan who has been saying publicly 
that testimony may be sought from the highest officials of 
government 
the president will cooperate but well just have to wait and 
see what the format takes fitzwater said 
north was indicted last week by a federal grand jury on charges 
he conspired to divert iranian arms sales profits to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
earlier sen orrin hatch rutah said reagan should pardon 
north he said north had been guilty of misleading congress but did 
not intend to break the law 
i continually ask the question wheres the venality wheres 
the corruption wheres the criminal intent hatch said on cbs 
this morning i dont think anybody who watched oliver north 
believes that he intended to break the law or that he intended to 
be a criminal 
asked if north had misled congress hatch said thats true 
but keep in mind oliver north saw his buddies get killed in 
lebanon he found the terrorists who had killed them through leaks 
he was the fellow who helped plan the the grenada invasion he 
was the fellow who captured the achille lauro terrorists through 
leaks 
you go on right down the line i think that he was a hero 
then hes a hero today and i think we ought to get this behind us 
and i think a pardon would be the appropriate way to do that 
hatch said 
however rep thomas s foley dwash who also served on the 
committees that investigated the irancontra affair said the 
courts should decide the guilt or innocence of north and former 
national security adviser john m poindexter who also was indicted 
for the president to preemptively pardon them in advance i 
think would send a terrible signal to the country about the 
evenhandedness and objectivity of our legal system remember they 
are all assumed innocent foley said on the cbs program

federal parole officials recommended tuesday that 
an anticastro militant convicted of conspiring to bomb foreign 
freighters should be released after serving a threemonth prison 
sentence for violating parole his lawyer said 
the suggested sentence which includes time orlando bosch has 
spent in jail since returning to the united states must be 
approved by the us parole commission the panel is expected to 
decide within three weeks 
parole examiners made the recommendation recommended after a 
closed hearing tuesday boschs attorney george yoss said 
bosch 61 convicted of conspiring to bomb foreign freighters 
and of firing a recoilless rifle in 1968 at a polish freighter 
docked in miami served four years of a 10year federal prison 
sentence 
he has acknowledged violating his parole when he traveled to 
south america in 1974 he served 11 years in venezuelan jails until 
his acquittal on charges of bombing a cuban jetliner in which 73 
died in 1976 
but after serving his threemonth sentence by may 16 bosch 
probably will be taken into custody by the us immigration and 
naturalization service said yoss the ins has targeted bosch for 
possible deportation 
bosch entered the united states illegally last month after his 
release from a venezuelan prison since midfebruary he has been 
detained at the metropolitan correctional center in south dade 
several prominent cubanamericans including jorge mas canosa 
head of the cuban american national foundation testified before 
the parole examiners in a hearing closed to the public because it 
was an administrative procedure 
mas canosa said after the hearing that bosch should be released 
because he had learned his lesson and now would work peacefully for 
the overthrow of cuban president fidel castro 
it is a crime to keep this man behind bars mas canosa said 
dr alberto hernandez boschs physician said he testified that 
bosch suffered from stomach heart and prostate problems boschs 
illnesses would be aggravated by a prison sentence he said 
ted kline who prosecuted bosch in 1974 said he testified that 
bosch could be released safely 
tom kowalski the parole commissions atlanta regional 
administrator said the decision would be forwarded to regional 
commissioner george mckenzie rast who will make a recommendation

two men have been given a chance to avoid 
federal prison terms for their role in a racially motivated fight 
that resulted in the death of a mexicanamerican farm worker five 
years ago 
walter pringle 35 who faced a maximum 15year federal prison 
term was sentenced monday to 33 months in prison and assessed 
4450 in fines costs and restitution federal judge g kendall 
sharp said pringle would not have to go to prison if he can pay the 
money by sept 1 
pringle was found guilty in january of violating the civil 
rights of joseph ozuna 26 by beating him unconscious near 
seville a town of about 650 residents 60 miles north of here 
sharp also sentenced mark miller 25 to 12 months in prison 
sharp said he would suspend that sentence if miller could pay 
1500 in fines and restitution by sept 1 miller had pleaded 
guilty to conspiracy and testified for the government in the 
january trial 
both he and miller said later they would raise the money for the 
fines and stay out of prison 
a federal jury acquitted pringles exgirlfriend paula hires 
smith 29 of violating the civil rights of gilberto garza 17 by 
shooting him to death in the same fight 
the 1983 case triggered controversy when pringle received a 
sixmonth jail sentence a 15 fine and five years probation after 
pleading no contest to aggravated assault and battery and ms 
smith was given 10 years probation for her nocontest plea to 
manslaughter 
outrage over what were considered to be light sentences in the 
state circuit court criminal case led to a federal investigation 
and the january trial on civil rights charges in us district 
court in orlando 
according to the federal indictment and information from miller 
pringle and ms smith pursued cousins ozuna and garza into the 
countryside while pringle was beating up ozuna ms smith shot 
garza in the face with a rifle 
i have been handing down sentences for 10 years and i think 
without doubt this is the most difficult case i ever had in terms 
of meting out a sentence sharp told pringle 
but the judge said i am convinced that you will never do 
anything like this again 
pringle had contended that drinking got him into fights and the 
judge agreed adding that only pringle knows whether he is really 
prejudiced against mexicanamericans

more coast guard installations would be forced 
to close next year if congress fails to increase the agencys 
budget by 300 million the head of the coast guard said tuesday 
these are not intended as threats or scare stories these are 
the real choices that we face adm paul a yost jr commandant 
of the coast guard told a house subcommittee 
yost said the reagan administrations proposed fiscal 1989 
funding level of 298 billion would not enable the coast guard to 
reopen any of the nearly 30 stations and offices closed in february 
because of a 103 million shortfall in the current budget 
but yost said the administrations proposal would allow the 
remaining stations to stay open in addition it would restore to 
full levels drug patrols which were reduced by 55 percent last 
month and routine search and rescue patrols which were eliminated 
if congress approved a budget with only modest increases from 
1988 the agency would have a 171 million shortfall next year that 
would trigger a more serious round of station closings yost said 
i cant even come up with a list of coast guard facilities 
that could be closed he said 
rep earl hutto dfla chairman of the house merchant marine 
and fisheries subcommittee on the coast guard and navigation 
embraced the administrations budget proposal as the minimum 
necessary for the coast guard to continue to function in the manner 
expected of it by the congress and the american public 
hutto and yost said while the 1989 budget request is a big jump 
from current spending levels it really would just be bringing the 
coast guard up to past levels 
when adjusted for inflation the budget request for the next 
fiscal year is about the same as the 1983 spending levels however 
the coast guard since has increased its drug interdiction 
activities substantially 
the congressional general accounting office found that from 1980 
to 1987 the proportion of coast guard operating expenses devoted 
to drug operations more than tripled from 7 percent to 22 percent 
meanwhile the percentage devoted to more traditional coast 
guard duties such as search and rescue patrols and marine safety 
has been sliced from 60 percent to 51 percent the gao said 
last week yost unveiled an administration plan to transer 60 
million from other transportation department accounts to the coast 
guard to immediately upgrade patrol levels to last years levels

foreigners would be barred from working as 
crew members aboard us aircraft and ships during strikes against 
the carriers under legislation approved 302114 by the house on 
tuesday 
the restrictions would apply only to americanowned planes or 
ships that are entering or leaving the united states 
supporters of the legislation said the measure would protect the 
rights of striking american workers by preventing companies from 
hiring foreigners to replace them 
aliens should not be allowed to hurt american employees by 
working in their jobs as strikebreakers said rep marge 
roukema rnj the measures sponsor 
opponents said the bill would hurt carriers by forcing them to 
release foreign employees in the event of a labor walkout and 
would invite retaliation by other countries 
it is easy to be against foreign nationals said rep steve 
bartlett rtexas 
the legislation was written in response to a 1986 strike against 
trans world airlines inc by its flight attendants in which the 
workers accused twa of using foreigners to serve on transatlantic 
flights 
the bill was sent to the senate

newly issued guidelines for dealing with 
federal employees infected with the aids virus are in line with the 
general antidiscrimination recommendations of the governments

regulations are reasonable and reflect phs concerns 
windom no 2 official of the department of health and human 
services heads the sevenagency public health service that 
includes the centers for disease control food and drug 
administration and national institutes of health 
windom will review the guidelines thursday with personnel 
officers from about 30 major federal agencies 
the federal government as an enlightened and compassionate 
employer concerned with the health and welfare of its employees 
has an obligation to show the way in addressing the realities of 
the aids epidemic constance horner director of the office of 
personnel management said in a memo accompanying the guidelines 
initial distribution this week 
quoting from cdc statements on aids in the workplace the 
personnel office memo says the kind of nonsexual 
persontoperson contact that generally occurs among workers and 
clients or consumers in the workplace does not pose a risk for 
transmission of aids 
the guidelines instruct federal agencies to treat aidsinfected 
employees in the same manner as employees who suffer from other 
serious illnesses and say there is no medical basis for 
employees refusing to work with such fellow employees or agency 
clients 
fellow employes who disrupt agency functions by refusing to work 
with an aidsinfected person could be subject to appropriate 
corrective or disciplinary action under the guidelines

for a few fleeting weeks free enterprise 
thrived in brooklyn 
that was back in the good old days about two months ago when a 
thrifty commuter entering the greenpoint avenue subway station in 
the morning could buy a 1 subway ride for 50 cents 
the bargain was offered by three crafty entrepreneurs who 
discovered the key to a padlocked gate next to a turnstile they 
unlocked the gate put the padlock on the turnstile and went into 
competition with the new york city transit authority 
from about 5 am to 7 am weekdays the subway station was 
turned into a bargain basement according to an account in 
tuesdays new york newsday 
and then the police found out 
as of 215 fare for rider will be 55 cents per person read 
a flyer handed to riders shortly after the police crackdown and 
no pennies will not be accepted no more people we had run in 
with transit police so that why we raise it we couldnt afford of 
getting busted 
the flyer ended on a promotional note catch that fare 
special 
it became amusing observed transit police sgt tom 
sullivan still slightly astonished by this flowering of the 
entrepreneurial spirit because we arrested them they increased 
the fare 
the police had been notified by an irate token clerk who 
arrived with a uniformed police officer each morning at 7 am to 
find her competitors fully engaged in business 
the token booth was staffed only at rush hour the rest of the 
day patrons without tokens had to go to the main station entrance 
two blocks away those with tokens could go through the cagelike 
turnstile until the discounters arrived 
at first the men scattered when the token clerk arrived but 
after a while sullivan said they were being so brazen that they 
would just retreat to the stairwell and wait for the uniformed cop 
to leave 
then theyd return to business in full sight of the token 
clerk whose business dwindled about 100 riders a day were taking 
advantage of the reduced fare plunking their money into a bucket 
beside the swinging gate 
this really infuriated the railroad clerk said sullivan 
her complaints eventually led to undercover operations that 
resulted in the first arrests on jan 29 and the second arrests on 
feb 1 each time the men were issued desk appearance tickets and 
released and each time they went right back to work 
on feb 16 the police raised the stakes against paul franklin 
35 kenneth norris 36 and willie brown 22 this time they went 
to jail on charges including disorderly conduct petty larceny 
criminal tampering and other crimes 
so far franklin who like brown lived in an apartment near 
the station has pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and served 
eight days in jail norris who lived in a homeless shelter has 
pleaded guilty to petty larceny and been sentenced to 70 hours of 
community service including washing subway stations 
even as we made the arrests we had one guy in handcuffs and 
people were still walking up to him and trying to hand him money 
sullivan said they were pretty slick in their operation they 
thought they had all ends covered

commerce secretary c william verity opened a 
new round of japanese trade negotiations on tuesday with an appeal 
for fast resolution of the differences separating the two sides 
the negotiations involve us demands that japan allow american 
and other foreign construction companies to compete for an 
estimated 60 billion in public works projects planned in japan 
over the next decade 
verity announced that the american team would be headed by 
deputy us trade representative michael b smith who is taking 
over from j michael farren a deputy commerce undersecretary who 
is leaving the department because he was passed over for promotion 
i trust that everyone in this room shares my feeling that 
these negotiations on construction have gone on for too long 
already and that the time has come to bring them to a close 
verity said in opening remarks 
last week president reagans cabinetlevel economic policy 
council set a twoweek deadline for resolving the construction 
dispute if the issue is not settled by the deadline 
administration officials have indicated they will recommend that 
the president bring a trade complaint against japan a process 
which could lead to us trade retaliation against japan 
the japanese have offered to allow us companies access to 
seven public works projects us negotiators have contended in the 
past that this offer was too small and omitted sophisticated 
engineering jobs 
but verity in his remarks indicated a willingness to consider 
the japanese proposal as a starting point 
the japanese side has suggested that contracts worth 30 
billion in seven major projects could be opened to bidding by our 
firms he said very well then we simply ask that you open 
them and that over time you add additional projects until the 
japanese construction market is open 
verity called on the japanese to open up the broadest spectrum 
of contract work to us bidding 
earthmoving and runway construction are not enough he said

democrat richard gephardt charged tuesday that 
michael dukakis support for tough trade legislation is just a 
political ploy that will end after the michigan caucuses are over 
dukakis the massachusetts governor said his position on trade 
has been consistent and his staff released quotations from last 
year indicating his support for major provisions of a senate trade 
bill 
who is for a tough trade policy who is going to be for a 
tough trade policy after michigan gephardt asked in a telephone 
interview tuesday the answer is dick gephardt is and will be 
mike dukakis hasnt been isnt and wont be 
when he is on the east and west coast he wants to talk about 
free trade when hes in michigan he doesnt gephardt said 
gephardts tough trade legislation now in a conference 
committee on capitol hill has been the capstone of the missouri 
congressmans platform 
monday night dukakis endorsed trade legislation sponsored by 
michigan sen donald riegle who in turn endorsed dukakis gephardt 
quickly accused dukakis of having a battlefield conversion on 
trade saying the riegle bill was the senate version of the 
gephardt legislation 
dukakis and jesse jackson are tied for the lead in the polls on 
saturdays michigan caucuses with gephardt a distant third 
dukakis aides say that may be the reason for gephardts attacks 
on tuesday gephardt stepped up the attack questioning the 
sincerity of dukakis support for such legislation 
i think he remains against it i think it is a political 
ploy gephardt said by what he has done he is trying to have 
it both ways now that he is in michigan and we are five days 
out from the caucuses he wants to fool the people of michigan 
dukakis said in michigan late monday that his position hasnt 
changed 
he has been a strong opponent of the gephardt bill from the 
begining but has always been an advocate of leveling the trade 
playing field said dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
dukakis staff on tuesday pointed to quotes from the 
massachusetts governor last year in favor of the senate bill 
on july 11 1987 dukakis said i think the trade bill which 
the senate approved yesterday says if there is a consistent pattern 
of unfair trade practices there i think we have to do 
something 
i feel a lot better about the senate bill than the gephardt 
trade legislation dukakis said on aug 4 1987 
gephardt said dukakis has said in the past you dont need new 
legislation he has been profoundly negative about everything i 
have said about trade 
the congressman too provided quotes from dukakis last year 
quotes he said back up his charge of a flipflop 
the president today has all the authority he needs to do 
something about those unfair trade practices we do not need more 
laws or more amendments dukakis said at the aug 8 debate at 
drake university according to gephardt aides 
in debates in dallas and atlanta dukakis told gephardt you 
want a law dick i want to act 
and earlier this year in lansing mich gephardt aides said 
dukakis said we do not need more legislation 
the gephardt amemdment and the riegle bill do differ but both 
try to strengthen potential retaliation against us trading 
partners for unfair practices in general the riegle bill would 
target specific industries in foreign countries which engage in 
unfair practices the gephardt amendment would trigger retaliation 
against another country for running a big surplus with this country 
in part through unfair practices 
dukakis has always felt the president has had the authority to 
act the riegle amendment gives the president a better way to 
get there but he can pretty much get there on his own now

the city council has approved an ordinance 
requiring guests checking into the citys 11 hotels and motels to 
show identification 
the measure was proposed in january following the discovery of 
the bodies of two women in different hotel rooms the deaths one 
attributed to strangulation and the other to drowning were not 
related authorities said 
mayor francis x flaherty was expected to sign the ordinance in 
a couple of days said mayoral spokeswoman anne turner it would go 
into effect 20 days later she said 
councilman lincoln d chafee the only one of the seven council 
members to vote against the ordinance monday night called the 
measure loose and vague and cautioned the council against 
stampeding to enact a bad bill 
the ordinance was amended to say that information from a hotel 
registrant will be used only for emergencies or during criminal 
investigations the american civil liberties union had complained 
that the original version violated the rights of individuals 
the guest who pays for a hotel room would be required to show a 
drivers license major credit card state identification card 
military identification card passport vehicle registration or 
vehicle title documents 
councilman c kenneth wild jr who proposed the ordinance in 
january said it would help police investigate cases such as those 
of the two women identification would not be required of people 
other than the person signing for the room 
neither woman had paid for the room where she was found dead in 
the drowning two people were charged with leaving the scene of a 
death but no one has been arrested in the strangulation police

us troops sent here for emergency 
training exercises will stay on to complete the maneuvers a us 
military spokesman said tuesday although honduras says its border 
crisis with nicaragua is over 
right now the plans are to make it a 10 to 14day exercises 
we have not received any directive as to when to begin 
redeployment said us spokesman maj gary hovatter in a 
telephone interview 
he said exercises were taking place tuesday at four sites 
president reagan ordered 3200 american troops to honduras last 
week at the request of president jose azcona hoyo who had accused 
sandinista soldiers from neighboring nicaragua of penetrating 
honduran territory in pursuit of ussupported contra rebels 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua denied his troops were in 
honduras last week honduran jets twice bombed nicaraguan positions 
to force them to leave no casualties were reported 
honduran foreign minister carlos lopez contreras told the 
associated press in an interview tuesday the border tension has 
virtually disappeared after both the sandinistas and the contras 
suspended hostilities and began truce talks 
the three days of negotiations began monday in the small 
southern nicaraguan town of sapoa near the costa rican border the 
talks aim mainly at reaching a ceasefire so that both sides can 
strike a permanent peace accord in their 7yearold war 
the dispatch of the us troops bolstered the american military 
presence in honduras to about 6000 servicemen the reagan 
administration billed it as both a show of support for azcona and a 
warning to the sandinistas against further actions in the border 
region 
as the sandinistas pulled out of the bocay region where the 
incursion took place azcona said the additional us troops would 
not be needed much longer 
hovatter said however that the troops will complete their 
training first the united states has been carrying out joint 
exercises with the honduran military periodically for five years as 
part of the reagan administrations policy of isolating the 
sandinistas 
ten american soldiers were injured monday when their uh1 huey 
helicopter crashed during an exercise near the southern honduran 
town of juticalpa apparently as a result of mechanical failure 
hovatter said five or six of the injured soldiers would be 
released for light duty

the nixon white house kept heavy pressure on 
federal reserve board chairman arthur burns to do its bidding but 
gently turned aside complaints from one fed critic thencalifornia 
governor ronald reagan documents made public on tuesday show 
among 400000 pages of white house records released by the 
national archives is a sept 17 1973 letter from reagan to nixon 
complaining about the impact of a fed decision on california 
mortgage loans 
the documents also included many internal white house memoranda 
suggesting that white house aides devoted considerable effort to 
encourage burns appointed by nixon in 1970 to stimulate the 
economy prior to nixons 1972 reelection campaign 
critics claim the easymoney policy pursued by burns in the 
early 1970s did keep the economy humming through 1972 but set the 
stage for sharply rising interest rates and inflation in the 
following year triggering a recession 
in his letter to nixon reagan contended that the fed and the 
federal home loan bank board were drying up the availability of 
mortgage money in california 
they were doing this by easing restrictions that had kept 
interest rates which banks could pay on savings accounts below 
those offered by savings and loan associations reagan said 
the result he wrote has been a flow of funds from savings 
and loans to banks 
since savings and loans are the major supplier of funds for 
home building in california the result of the action threatened 
irreparable damage to his states homebuilding industry gov 
reagan charged 
present events have occurred which places the homebuilding 
industry in the state of california in a potentially grave 
situation reagan wrote 
the reagan letter was shunted back and forth among several 
aides with tod r hullin an assistant to domestic policy adviser 
john ehrlichman recommending that it be given special 
attention 
although white house assistant kenneth dam wrote a draft of a 
white house response the final job of answering reagan was given 
to george p shultz then nixons treasury secretary and now 
reagans secretary of state 
shultz told his future boss that while the nixon administration 
shares your concern a return to the former limitations on 
interests paid by banks would not solve the problem of california 
savings and loans 
we have been limited in our ability to maintain the 
availablity of home mortgage credit shultz said 
then he added inflation is our most important domestic 
problem and this administration firmly believes that the nation is 
best served in the longer term by our vigorous efforts to curb 
inflation 
the documents released on tuesday were a second installment of 
nixon white house material made public by the archives an earlier 
730000 papers from the white house central files unit containing 
many personal documents kept by nixon and his top lieutenants was 
made public in december 1986 
the newly released documents seemed likely to fuel longstanding 
speculation by critics that burns deliberately manipulated monetary 
policy to help reelect nixon an allegation the late central bank 
chairman repeatedly denied 
in any event the documents show a pattern of close white house 
involvement with the fed on monetary issues during burns tenure 
including frequent meetings among burns and top white house 
officials 
at one point the white house even arranged an appreciation 
luncheon for burns in late 1971 to which 58 leaders from the 
financial community were invited 
although the first 20 minutes of the late fed chairmans speech 
to the group was somewhat professorial burns at the end of his 
speech was very optimistic from this point of view the lunch 
was a success former white house aide peter flanigan said in a 
confidential memo to nixon 
noting that financial writers were then brought into the 
luncheon to speak to burns the memo continued while arthur is 
no then treasury secretary john connally in terms of stimulating 
a response the exercise was clearly a plus 
in an august 20 1970 memo to nixon his then chief economic 
adviser paul mccracken praised burns for effective leadership 
at the fed in easing monetary policy and proposed that the money 
supply be permitted to grow even more rapidly 
we urge this in no sense of trying to take over monetary 
policy but merely as those who will be held accountable for the 
economys performance during this period mccracken wrote to 
nixon 
the relationship between administration officials and the 
federal reserve system has always been a somewhat uneasy one 
mccracken added but it is the president who will be held 
politically accountable for the economic results of federal reserve 
policy 
burns himself wrote a confidential note to nixon on march 9 
1970 pointing out how the nations money supply had grown since he 
had been named fed chief five weeks earliers 
let me add that the fed boards liberalizing action took 
place only on february 10 the first meeting of the federal open 
market committee over which i presided burns wrote to nixon the 
committee is the feds chief policymaking unit

lyn nofziger tried unsuccessfully to make 
theninterior secretary walter hickel an emissary to protesting 
students after hickels famous protest letter to president nixon in 
1970 according to newly released white house documents 
nofziger a longtime political aide to president reagan who was 
convicted of illegal lobbying last month was working in the white 
house congressional relations office at the time 
a memorandum from nofziger to hr haldemann nixons chief of 
staff turned up in the latest batch of nixon white house files 
opened by the national archives on tuesday 
hickel wrote nixon on may 6 1970 after the invasion of 
cambodia by us forces in vietnam had set off a storm of protest 
on the nations campuses he said that attacks on the protesters by 
vice president spiro t agnew were creating an impression of a lack 
of concern for the attitude of a great mass of americans our 
young people 
the letter whose prompt appearance in newspapers dismayed the 
white house said nixon should among other things talk with 
members of the cabinet from time to time hickel was quoted in news 
accounts as saying he had had only two personal meetings with nixon 
since becoming secretary more than a year before 
nofzigers memo dated may 8 1970 said whether we like it 
or not wally hickel is the kids new hero suggest we use him 
suggest he meet with the president saturday and then send him out 
to talk to the kids 
why not have the president meet with a group of kids tomorrow 
at midmorning to take some of the steam out of the demonstration 
and give us some favorable publicity 
the nofziger memo was directed apparently by haldemanns 
office to dwight chapin nixons appointments secretary chapin 
seems to have sent it back to ken cole haldemanns assistant with 
the handwritten notation ken cole good idea c 
after that appeared the one word unattributed no 
nixon did meet with protesting students on his own without 
staff preparation at 5 am at the lincoln memorial that meeting 
garnered much publicity most of it in a tone of astonishment 
hickel and nixon defended each other in public appearances 
immediately after that but hickel did not get to see nixon and the 
president fired him on november 25 in a personal meeting 
hickel was traveling tuesday and could not be reached said his 
office in anchorage alaska nofziger had left for the day and also 
could not be reached according to his washington office

president francois mitterrand ended months of 
speculation on tuesday by announcing that he will seek a second 
term 
opinion polls have put the 71yearold socialist in the lead for 
the twostage election beginning april 24 although he was not 
formally in the race 
on tuesday mitterrand appeared on the nationwide evening 
newscast of stateowned antenne 2 television when asked if he 
would run mitterrand paused dramatically clearly relishing the 
moment and answered with a single word oui yes 
in reply to followup questions the president said he decided 
to run because he thinks disunity threatened to tear the social 
fabric of france 
i saw a risk that the country might fall again into the 
quarrels and divisions that have hampered it so often i want 
france to be united not be taken in hand by the spirit of 
intolerance by parties who want everything by clans by 
cliques he said 
as soon as mitterrand declared michel rocard until now the 
socialist partys only candidate withdrew from the race and gave 
the president his full support 
mitterrands plans had been the subject of intense speculation 
on some occassions he had indicated that he would preferred to 
retire and at other times hinted he would run because of a sense of 
duty 
in the end with four weeks remaining before voters go to the 
polls duty called 
the main conservative candidates premier jacques chirac and 
former premier raymond barre had criticized mitterrand for being 
coy and cutting short the democratic debate 
mitterrand justified his silence by saying that with the premier 
campaigning it was up to the president to look after the nations 
affairs in a nonpartisan way 
the conservatives hope to end what the french call 
cohabitation created when the conservatives ousted the 
socialists from control of the national assembly in march 1986 but 
were left with a socialist president with two years to go in his 
term 
the president is chief of state and has major duties in defense 
and foreign affairs he appoints a prime minister who must be 
backed by a majority of the national assembly the premier then 
names his cabinet and runs the government 
mitterrand said tuesday that after watching the campaign he 
feared opposing candidates were bringing on france disputes that 
threatened to damage the country 
we need social peace he said someone has to face up to 
this and i shall do it 
chirac heads the neogaullist rally for the republic and barre 
the centerright union for french democracy 
in a statement issued by chiracs campaign committee the 
premier said the stakes are now clear there is on one side the 
socialist party which wants to retake power to lead a socialist 
policy and its candidate casts aspersion on all the others 
there was no immediate reaction from barre 
national polls consistently placed mitterrand ahead of barre and 
chirac in a campaign that has been more a contest of styles than 
policies 
a handful of minorparty contenders including andre lejoinie of 
the oncepowerful communists are expected to draw a combined total 
of 5 percent of the vote or less jeanmarie le pen of the 
extremeright national front could get about 10 percent of the vote 
a poll published in the journal du dimanche newspaper sunday 
indicated 55 percent of the 1813 people polled were satisfied with 
mitterrand fortyeight percent were satisfied with chirac as 
premier 
another recent poll however indicated 30 percent of those 
queried were undecided 
mitterrand told the tv audience tuesday night that he would 
pursue the programs and policies of the last seven years 
i have maintained the confidence of the french people he 
said 
he suggested that if he won he might dissolve the national 
assembly and call for new parliamentary elections 
the first round of the elections is to be held april 24 with a 
runoff between the top two candidates scheduled for may 8

the tennessee valley authority bidding to 
recover from the 1985 shutdown of its entire nuclear power system 
won permission from the government on tuesday to restart the 
sequoyah unit 2 reactor near chattanooga tenn 
the 50 vote by the nuclear regulatory commission clears the way 
for the sequoyah plant to become the first of five licensed tva 
reactors to resume production of power the approval was 
conditioned however on tva resolving a lastminute problem 
involving temperature detectors in the plants pressurizer system 
the unanimous vote also provided a clear indication that the nrc 
is not seriously concerned at least from a safety standpoint 
about allegations involving the tvas nuclear chief steven a 
white 
in a case referred to the justice department last year nrc 
investigators questioned whites veracity when he certified in 
writing that another tva nuclear plant watts bar met federal 
quality assurance standards white has denied any wrongdoing 
nrc chairman lando zech said the commissioners had reviewed the 
case still pending at the justice department and we have 
concluded that there is no presently known regulatory reason to 
preclude authorization to restart sequoyah unit 2 
there is nothing unusual about the commissions consideration 
of a restart while investigations are ongoing zech added 
on capitol hill tva chairman marvin runyon told the house 
public works subcommittee on investigations that tremendous 
progress is being made in our nuclear recovery efforts led by 
steve white 
tva is about ready to turn its nuclear corner said runyon 
runyon said the tva hopes to have a second sequoyah reactor 
unit 1 ready for restart within six months 
the sequoyah facilities and three reactors at the browns ferry 
plant near athens ala were closed in 1985 for safety 
improvements after a management shakeup construction of four 
other reactors was slowed down and plans for nine others were 
canceled the tva still was left with 15 billion in longterm 
debts for the nuclear program 
runyon said the first of the browns ferry plants should be ready 
for restart sometime next year 
were not going to rush this process said runyon were 
proceeding deliberately and were putting public safety above all 
else no one reactor will be restarted unless we are conpletely 
confident and the nrc is fully satisfied that it can be operated 
safely and efficiently for a good long time

the nuclear regulatory commission on tuesday 
conditionally authorized a restart of the rancho seco nuclear power 
plant near sacramento calif after a 27month shutdown which 
triggered a management shakeup and hundreds of plant modifications 
the commission in a 50 vote stipulated that one remaining 
equipment problem excessive vibration in emergency diesel 
generators must be resolved to the satisfaction of the nrcs 
staff before the restart can begin 
even if the generator problem is handled swiftly rancho seco 
still faces an uncertain future area voters are scheduled to 
decide on the day of the california primary june 7 whether the 
913megawatt facility should be closed permanently 
the reactor is the sole nuclear plant owned by the sacramento 
municipal utility district but it represents about 55 percent of 
the utilitys generating capacity and is directly responsible for 
1000 jobs and 75 million in wages indirectly as many as 3000 
jobs and 150 million in wages are affected 
the plant which has long history of problems was shut down in 
december 1985 because of a power loss in its control system 
leading to severe overcooling of the reactor the nrc subsequently 
required major overhauls of the equipment as well as deep changes 
in management and operator training programs 
carl andognini smuds chief nuclear officer and ann taylor a 
board member of the utility told the commission the plant is ready 
for restart except for the diesel problem and pledged that safety 
would always remain the paramount concern in future operations 
taylor said theres tremendous support for the plant out 
there in the community 
but ed smeloff another board member said he thought rancho 
seco should be closed permanently even though i do believe it 
can be operated safely 
smeloff said he thought the dangers were economic arguing that 
the utility is too small to support an expensive nuclear plant with 
an uncertain potential for future production rancho seco 
represents a 200 million per year risk he said we are not a 
large enough utility to support that kind of risk 
one of the questions facing the voters is whether the plant

almost a billion dollars must be allocated to 
the space station next year or america will have to abandon plans 
to build the orbiting platform nasa administrator james c 
fletcher said tuesday 
a substantial cut in the space station budget added to delays 
caused by cuts in earlier years will make it useless for the 
national aeronautics and space administration to continue efforts 
to build the station he said 
this is year is crucial fletcher told the senate 
subcommittee on science technology and space otherwise weve 
got to just forget it and start over at a later date 
but senators attending the hearing warned fletcher that would be 
extremely difficult to get nasa its entire requested budget in a 
year when federal dollars are tight because of deficitcutting 
efforts seeral pressed him on how much of a reduction could be 
tolerated in the space station program but fletcher said the 
requested budget was the rock bottom that nasa needs 
fletcher said a severe cut in the station budget last year 
caused a full years delay and another cut in fiscal year 1989 
which begins oct 1 would make it a waste of the taxpayers 
dollars to continue the underfunded program 
nasas 1989 budget calls for a total of 9674 million for the 
space station plans call for the station to be assembled in orbit 
and for crews to start living in the orbiting laboratory in the 
middle of the next decade 
the station funds are part of a 115 billion appropriation 
request by nasa that would include money for space shuttle 
missions advanced shuttle rockets aeronautical research and a 
study of the technology that will be needed one day to send 
astronauts back to the moon and possibly to mars 
the budget request which was approved by president reagan is a 
24 pecent increase over nasas current spending blueprint 
fletcher said that unless congress passes the entire space 
budget there is no way for the us to maintain world leadership 
in space 
the entire future of the civil space program rides at risk on 
this budget he said this is a crucial year it will make 
or break the civil space program 
fletcher said the budget is the final boost needed for nasas 
recovery from the 1986 challenger disaster in which a space 
shuttle was destroyed and seven astronauts killed the shuttle 
fleet has been grounded since while the space agency corrected 
flawed equipment that caused the accident 
nasa tentatively plans to resume shuttle flights in august two 
are planned for this year seven in 1989 and 10 in 1990 
without this increase nasa will be in serious trouble 
fletcher said a major cut would be equivalent to the challenger 
disaster itself

a scholar abused research privileges at the 
library of congress and national archives to steal and try to sell 
letters signed by abraham lincoln winston churchill and other 
historic figures a prosecutor said tuesday 
charles merrill mount also defaced some letters between lincoln 
and civil war generals to remove government markings that would 
have alerted a rare documents dealer to the fact they were stolen 
assistant us attorney martin murphy said in his opening statement 
at mounts trial 
but mounts attorney charles mcginty argued mount had legally 
collected the documents and shoddy recordkeeping led the library 
of congress and national archives to believe the letters were part 
of their collections 
mcginty said the government would offer no evidence showing 
mount stole the documents a point murphy conceded 
mount 59 a washingtonbased author of several artists 
biographies tearfully denied the allegations but predicted he 
would be convicted 
mount told reporters outside court that associates in ireland 
including prime minister charles haughey had seen the documents 
when mount lived in ireland during the 1960s but mount said a 
government freeze on his assets prevented him from bringing 
witnesses to the united states to testify on his behalf 
without witnesses im going to be convicted he said 
mount is charged with two counts of interstate transportation of 
stolen property and faces up to 10 years in prison and a 10000 
fine if convicted his trial is expected to last three weeks 
mount was arrested in august when he tried to sell a 158page 
collection of civil war documents to goodspeeds book store for 
64600 a month earlier the store paid mount 20000 for 23 
letters signed by 19thcentury painter james mcneill whistler a 
churchill letter and one by henry james 
the whistler letters brought to boston in a plastic bag were 
stolen from the library of congress last july murphy told the jury 
the civil war collection disappeared from the national archives 
within a week before mounts aug 5 letter to goodspeeds offering 
to sell the documents murphy said mount spent the last five days 
of july viewing the collection murphy said 
mcginty asked the jury to note testimony about keeping records 
at the library of congress and national archives and how government 
records were stored before the archives opened in the 1930s 
he said thousands of historic records were lost and stolen after 
the civil war because they were kept in basements attics and even 
the white house garage 
records at the institutions show they should have possession of 
numerous documents that actually are in private collections 
mcginty said

the governments top health officer said 
tuesday that hospitals have engaged in a kind of medical arms race 
that assures neither quality care nor good value for the dollar 
sometimes you can save money and also improve care like 
concentrating certain procedures in hospitals that specialize in 
them said health and human services secretary otis r bowen 
this not only leads to better results for the patient it also 
allows us to benefit from economies of scale 
bowens remarks to a conference of the health care quality 
alliance followed a report by the 28member coalition that 
cautioned against emphasizing cost control to the point that the 
quality of care and quality of life are adversely affected 
the health secretary acknowledged that the government is 
concerned about rising costs in the medicare and medicaid programs 
but said we wont accomplish anything if we sacrifice quality 
for lower costs 
one reason todays health care is so expensive is that the 
financing of that care is little more than a collection of 
disincentives to practice costeffective medicine he said 
bowen contended that hospitals in order to attract doctors 
and their patients have bought and often duplicated the latest in 
medical hardware in a kind of medical arms race 
another reason for concern he said is that government tax 
policies which do not tax employerpaid health insurance coverage 
like some other fringe benefits have encouraged employers and 
unions to bargain for evergreater firstdollar coverage in health 
insurance plans 
compounding this folly bowen continued most insurance 
plans cover expensive hightech procedures and slight preventive 
services and all of this has made patients and their families all 
but oblivious to costs since they pay so little out of pocket 
turning to medicare he said creation of the program 23 years 
ago created a powerful incentive for the health care industry to 
develop the technology to treat the chronic degenerative diseases 
that afflict the aging 
bowen said he was not suggesting those procedures are bad on 
the contrary he said they have improved the quality of life 
for americans of all ages 
still to be decided is how much is too much how much 
heroic medical care and how many procedures to keep a dying patient 
alive are desirable for the patient the family and not least of 
all for society at large when is such care merely prolonging the 
act of dying rather than contributing to longer life or at least 
some type of quality to it 
bowen a physician whose first wife died of cancer and whose 
mother recently died in a nursing home said sometimes our 
hightech capability lures us into pursuing expensive answers when 
less costly ones are available our veneration of technology has 
become a cultural blindspot that sometimes keeps us from pursuing 
practical solutions to our problems 
the theme of the conference was balancing health care costs 
quality and access the challenge for the next administration 
the alliance membership includes the american medical 
association the alzheimers disease and related disorders 
association the arthritis foundation the american cancer society 
the american academy of pediatrics and the national council on the 
aging

secretary of state george p shultz will 
probably travel to the middle east within two weeks if israel 
agrees to further discussions on his regional peace plan an 
israeli diplomat said tuesday 
asher naim the information minister at the israeli embassy 
said he expects israels cabinet will vote to keep alive the shultz 
peace initiative when the issue is debated 
apparently secretary shultz will be in the middle east in 
two weeks time again he told reporters at the national press 
club 
israel will not reject the us peace proposals naim said 
and if the government indeed decides a neutral way that means 
you continue negotiations then probably secretary shultz will go 
to the middle east 
state department spokesman charles redman said tuesday that 
shultz had not yet decided to return to the mideast where he 
conducted a diplomatic shuttle last month 
another state department official who spoke only on condition 
he not be named said shultz probably would make his decision by 
the end of this week after being briefed by presidential envoy 
philip habib about his tour of four arab capitals habib visited 
jordan egypt and saudi arabia this week and is due back by 
thursday following a stop in morocco 
habib will bring with him reactions from the arab leaders to 
shultzs plan which calls for israeliarab talks to begin may 1 on 
palestinian selfrule and for the next phase to start by dec 1 to 
determine the future of the israelioccupied territories so far 
syria is the only party to have rejected the plan 
shultzs plans also may be shaped by his talks this week in 
washington with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
about the us peace plan which envisions international 
sponsorship for the arabisraeli negotiations the official said a 
group of us and soviet negotiators were scheduled to discuss the 
mideast on wednesday he said 
naim addressing reporters at the national press club said 
shultz would be coming back to the region because the israeli 
government will not reject his plan despite internal divisions 
they wont vote no theyll probably decide to continue 
negotiating about the plan he said 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir who visited washington 
last week rejects the international auspices proposed by shultz 
for the talks his rival foreign minister shimon peres has 
accepted the plan 
president reagan in an unusually blunt statement warned shamir 
against rejecting the plan and said the united states would not 
change its proposals to suit shamirs reservations 
but naim hinted at one possible avenue for continued 
negotiations with israel over the shultz plan there are some 
suggestions to cushion israels fears about an international 
conference he said 
naim was referring to proposed guarantees by the united states 
that an international conference would not have any power to impose 
solutions on israel other us officials have suggested these 
guarantees would be included in a memorandum of understanding 
between israel and the united states 
redman said the united states also might promise israel that the 
guarantees would be binding on future administrations 
we really have the sense that if we can get this thing moving 
that there really is no difficulty in having it move right across 
the boundaries of one administraiton to another he said

congressional support for a 44 billion atom 
smasher is dwindling rapidly because of budget constraints and 
irritation with the siteselection process house members said 
tuesday 
although seven states remain in the running for the 
superconducting super collider lawmakers say the huge project is 
in jeopardy 
some even advocate that it be scrapped at once 
now that all but seven states have been eliminated from the 
ssc siteselection process the remaining states should help put an 
end to the process said rep don ritter rpa its time to 
face up to the facts 
testifying before the house science space and technology 
committee ritter said a financial commitment to the highenergy 
physics project would endanger funds for scientific research in 
other fields 
ritter whose home state did not seek the project said the 
house budget committee recognized the conflict by appropriating 
100 million for the collider in fiscal 1989 rather than the 363 
million president reagan requested 
congressional delegations from the states picked as finalists 
said tuesday they are forming a task force to seek support for ssc 
funding 
my fear is we will end up with a site to build the ssc and no 
funds for construction said rep carl pursell rmich 
rep sherwood boehlert rny said that with the demand for 
budget cuts and the current feelings of lawmakers whose states were 
bypassed it will be wellnigh impossible to pay for this thing 
the collider would be a 53mile underground ring of magnets 
capable of whipping proton beams into each other with 20 times the 
force of the worlds most powerful existing accelerator 
scientists hope to learn more about the nature of matter from 
studying the subatomic particles created by the proton collisions 
the project is expected to bring thousands of construction jobs 
permanent employment for as many as 3000 people and an annual 
budget of 270 million to the host state 
an independent panel appointed by the department of energy 
reviewed 35 bids from 25 states before picking seven finalists 
illinois texas arizona colorado michigan north carolina and 
tennessee 
energy secretary john herrington said he would announce a 
tentative choice for the site in november and confirm the selection 
in january 1989 
but the science committees chairman rep robert roe dnj 
told doe undersecretary joseph selgado at the hearing that a 
question of credibility is arising about the selection process 
he said said several lawmakers have complained that the 
department failed to use the criteria it had established previously 
when the seven finalists were chosen

democratic sen albert gore jr told 
students at a campaign stop tuesday that combating illegal drugs 
would take precedence in foreign policy if he is elected president 
gore told a crowded gathering at traverse city high school that 
he would use the military to stop the flow of drugs into the united 
states 
he said the nations drug problem reflected a spiritual crisis 
an absence of hope 
we have to have the courage to say theres nothing more 
important in our foreign policy than stopping illegal drugs gore 
told the students ill change that and put the war on drugs at 
the top of our foreign policy agenda 
he commented while campaigning in michigan where polls show him 
trailing badly just four days before the states democratic 
presidential caucuses 
earlier in the day gore canceled a speech at the university of 
wisconsin in madison to return to washington to cast a vote to 
override president reagans veto of a civil rights bill 
he also stopped in harrisburg pa where he met with gov 
robert p casey who is neutral in the presidential race and 
received the endorsement of state legislative leaders 
gore said he was a little bit surprised at vice president 
george bushs decision to go along with reagans civil rights veto 
he added when push comes to shove the vice president never 
disagrees with president reagan i dont remember a time in eight 
years when he has been willing to express any disagreement with the 
president 
he really has not carved out an identity of his own in this 
election gore said 
in harrisburg he called pennsylvania an excellent opportunity 
for a gore victory in michigan he said he expected to do 
significantly better than expected 
gore is running far behind in polls in michigan and he is 
competing in the state without campaigning intensively his 
campaign has been airing radio commercials featuring an endorsement 
by singer johnny cash but has not aired television ads 
he is running television commercials in wisconsin a state where 
he figures to have a greater opportunity to demonstrate broad 
appeal outside his native south gore is scheduled to speak to the 
state legislature in madison wisc on wednesday 
in traverse city gore spoke to an overflow crowd of about 700 
students at an event held after school had ended for the day the 
auditorium was filled with handlettered posters such as one 
saying als your pal 
with him was the state house speaker gary owen a gore backer 
and the mayor of traverse city bryan crough who also endorsed him 
gores comments on drugs were in response to questions from 
students he pointed to the alleged involvement in massive drug 
smuggling by panama strongman gen manuel antonio noriega he has 
repeatedly accused the reagan administration of having continued 
support for noriega even after it had evidence of drug involvement

early senate ratification of the agreement 
banning mediumrange nuclear weapons worldwide hit a potentially 
major roadblock tuesday with the reopening of a longfestering 
constitutional feud between congress and the white house over the 
interpretation of treaties 
several members of the senate foreign relations committee 
expressed dismay at the development they said it could delay 
ratification of the new intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf 
treaty until after the planned summit meeting later this spring 
between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
on another front however the senate intelligence committee 
reported unanimously that soviet compliance with the new treaty can 
be monitored with great certainty 
but the panel made clear that detecting soviet efforts to cheat 
on a future pact making sharp cuts in longrange strategic arms 
would strain us intelligence capabilites 
the treaty interpretation controversy was raised in testimony 
before the foreign relations panel by sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the senate armed services committee 
nunn said a recent letter from white house counsel arthur b 
culvahouse jr effectively undercut previous assurances from 
secretary of state george p shultz that administration testimony 
on the new pact is authoritative 
the dispute stems from the reagan administrations unilateral 
reinterpretation last year of the 1972 antiballistic missile 
treaty with the soviet union in order to permit the deployment of a 
star wars missile defense system 
the new culvahouse letter undercuts the shultz assurance nunn 
told the committee by asserting that some administration responses 
may be less authoritative than others 
culvahouse suggested that the testimony of a secretary of state 
may be more authoritative than that of other administration 
witnesses or responses in writing to questions by members of 
congress nunn said 
culvahouse has since issued a second letter asserting that his 
original remarks were not inconsistent with the shultz statement 
but nunn said he finds that unacceptable 
it doesnt solve my problem nunn said it simply asserts 
there is no conflict you can assert anything it puts the 
shultz statement in the trash can saying that certain testimony is 
not to be taken seriously 
he said the culvahouse assertion casts doubt on the authority of 
several administration interpretations on a list of ambiguities in 
treaty language that might have to be resolved point by point in a 
time consuming process on the senate floor he said 
nunn said he believes the controversy must be resolved by the 
full senate and that another letter even one from the president 
would not be acceptable 
sen alan cranston dcalif said this is the major 
stumbling block and could create grave perils if we dont resolve 
it he predicted that the issue could result in a serious 
partisan split inside the committee and in the senate 
it would be tragic if this treaty was destroyed because we had 
a procedural dispute with the president said sen brock adams 
dwash 
the intelligence committee report was presented to the senate 
foreign relations committee as that panel prepared to consider a 
series of amendments to the mediumrange missile pact the final 
phase of a twomonth process of intense examination 
the treaty was signed by reagan and gorbachev on dec 8 it 
eliminates nucleararmed missiles with a range of between 300 miles 
and 3400 miles in europe and elsewhere and provides the most 
intrusive verification system in arms control history 
sen claiborne pell dri the foreign relations chairman 
said earlier he hoped the panel could complete its work by the end 
of the week sending the treaty to the senate floor for a vote 
expected sometime in april vote tallies in both parties predict 
ratification by far more than the required twothirds or 67 votes 
the intelligence committee conducted its own review of treaty 
provisions concentrating on the us capability to monitor soviet 
compliance with a variety of informationcollecting techniques 
including the use of spy satellites and onsite inspection 
the intelligence community will be able to monitor the 
drawdown and elimination of declared soviet missile launchers and 
associated equipment with great certainty the panel said in its 
final report 
but sen david boren dokla the intelligence panels 
chairman said that effective verification of a future pact cutting 
strategic intercontinental arms by up to 50 percent would require a 
significant and expensive bolstering of us intelligence 
capabilities 
the committee recommended investing more in programs that 
would be most helpful in verifying a start treaty in preventing 
technological surprise and in supporting us policy and operations 
in crises boren said 
speaking for the committee boren said that because a strategic 
arms reduction or start treaty would not involve a ban on an entire 
class of weapons but would rather impose limits on total numbers of 
weapons that will make the detection of cheating far more 
difficult 
the intelligence committee said also that the extensive onsite 
inspection requirements of a strategic arms treaty with soviet 
inspectors given access to some of the most sensitive us military 
facilities could have a significant impact on us intelligence 
operations 
it said that while it has overall confidence in the ability of 
the us to detect soviet cheating on the inf treaty soviet 
compliance with some of the treatys provisions will be difficult 
to verify 
the panel noted for example that a controversy between the 
central intelligence agency and the defense intelligence afency 
over the number of ss20 missiles in the soviet arsenal remains 
unresolved with the dia estimating a larger number 
but it said the treatys ban on flight testing will ultimately 
limit the utility of any covert ss20 force

the united states should establish stronger 
ties with the rightest party that won convincing victories in 
municipal and legislative elections in el salvador a congressman 
who monitored the weekend elections said tuesday 
sundays elections which had a 70 percent voter turnout despite 
threats of violence by leftist guerrillas proved that the 
republican nationalist alliance will be a major force in el 
salvador said rep john g rowland rconn the party known by 
its spanish acronym arena won a majority of the elections over the 
moderate christian democrat party of president jose napoleon duarte 
we really need to concentrate on working with the arena 
political party rowland told reporters at a news briefing 
we need to get more involved we have invested there millions 
and millions of dollars in foreign aid its the only country 
thats had any democratic reform of significance over the last few 
years it would be a shame to see the whole thing fall apart he 
said 
rowland pointed to arenas strong electoral support across a 
wide crosssection of salvadoran society and efforts by the party 
to moderate its views and he noted the low profile taken by former 
army maj robert daubuisson the partys controversial founder who 
has been accused of links to salvadoran death squads 
my impression is that arena is not as nearly as right as 
we had originally suspected theres tremendous support among the 
people rowland said there are some bad apples of course 
within their party but our information suggests that maybe theyre 
not the crazies that you might suspect 
rowland was one of six house members who monitored the elections 
our observations concluded that it was a fair and open 
election he said

a jury tuesday recommended a former state 
trooper be sentenced to life in prison without parole for murdering 
his trooper girlfriend the first woman state trooper in the nation 
slain while on duty 
circuit judge jc norton will not be bound by the jurys 
recommendation when he sentences joe duncan who was accused of 
killing elizabeth cobb to collect 350000 in life insurance 
no date for sentencing was set immediately 
ten members of the dallas county jury voted for life 
imprisonment without parole while two voted that duncan should die 
in the electric chair the jury convicted duncan of capital murder 
monday night after about three hours of deliberation 
in a sentencing hearing tuesday duncans daughter pleaded that 
his life be spared he was he is the best father you could 
have 14yearold tanya duncan said 
duncan 33 was convicted of shooting miss cobb 31 in the head 
at close range oct 11 her body was found the next day behind the 
wheel of her patrol car which was parked behind a rural church 
at the time the fbi described miss cobb as the first female 
state trooper in the nation slain while on duty 
prosecutors charged that duncan killed miss cobb for a 250000 
life insurance policy that paid an extra 100000 if she died in 
the line of duty the slaying occurred 10 days after the policy 
went into effect on the rookie trooper with duncan as beneficiary 
defense attorney henry pitts said the trials most decisive 
factor was evidence showing duncan gave investigators conflicting 
accounts before his arrest 
jurors saw a videotape that showed duncan denying he knew 
anything about miss cobbs death and a second tape in which he 
told investigators he found the slain troopers body shortly after 
she was killed duncan said he didnt tell anyone of finding her 
body for fear he would be accused of the crime

forty wild welsh ponies were shot 
dead and left to rot on this great salt lake island because the 
rancher who rents the island said he could not afford to capture 
and move them 
the carcasses were discovered saturday by a private pilot on a 
recreational flight said antelope state park superintendent mitch 
larsson who had gone to the island monday concerned the animals 
may have died from disease 
the uninhabited island was leased to rancher dallen ward last 
fall and ward killed the horses to make way for sheep he plans to 
move from his home in almo idaho said weber county sheriffs lt 
archie smith 
ward said monday that the horses were overgrazing the island 
and the cost of moving them was prohibitive 
we looked at every avenue possible and economically i couldnt 
do it he said explaining he would have had to hire a crew to 
round up the horses and rent a barge to move them 
he also said he could find no buyers for the animals 
ward said he shot the animals himself but he refused to discuss 
details 
bruce dibb an attorney for the owner of the island steven 
richards sr said the horses were introduced about 30 years ago 
with commercial recreation in mind however the enterprise never 
got off the ground and the horses became wild 
dibb said his client removed about 100 horses by barge last 
year but the others eluded capture 
the shootings probably did not violate utah law said john fox 
a special deputy for the utah humane society unless it can be 
proved the horses suffered or didnt pass out right away it is 
legal he said 
however fox said ward may have violated the law by not burying 
the horses within 48 hours a misdemeanor 
smith said he planned to speak to weber county attorney reed 
richards to determine whether charges should be filed 
the ponies appeared to have been dead for about two weeks said 
utah veterinarian michael marshall who accompanied larsson to the 
island monday 
there is no real danger from the carcasses other than maybe a 
bird pecking on them then flying across to the mainland with that 
material marshall said but i dont see any way to bury them 
you would have to airlift a backhoe over there to do it

north carolinas attorney general is 
preparing to ask the us supreme court to uphold a state law 
requiring professional fundraisers for charities to tell potential 
donors how the money will be used 
the nations highest court is scheduled to hear arguments 
wednesday on north carolinas petition to reverse lowercourt 
rulings which struck down the 1985 law as a violation of the first 
amendments freedom of speech guarantee 
both sides agree that the outcome of the case could have a 
nationwide impact on the professional fundraising industry which 
attorney general lacy thornburg called a 
multimultimilliondollar business and on smaller charities 
that lack personnel to raise money 
its really a question of survival said errol copilevitz a 
kansas city attorney representing the national federation of the 
blind of north carolina inc and the optimist club of north 
raleigh nc which filed a lawsuit in 1985 challenging the law 
about 75 charities have filed a friendofthecourt brief 
opposing the statute many are represented by independent sector 
an umbrella group including such organizations as the american red 
cross and the american cancer society copilevitz said tuesday 
thornburg said maine connecticut indiana and west virginia had 
filed briefs in support of north carolinas law 
the most controversial provision requires professional 
fundraisers to tell people they solicit what portion of the money 
will be spent on the charitable cause and how much will be used to 
cover expenses 
the purpose of the law is to promote honesty through 
disclosure in very much the same way that banks and other 
institutions are required to tell for example what their interest 
rate is going to be thornburg said at a news conference 
a study of fundraising campaigns conducted in north carolina by 
professionals on behalf of charities between 1980 and 1984 showed 
that on average only 13 percent of gross receipts were returned 
to the charities he said 
the law presumes that whenever a professional group retains 35 
percent or more of the gross receipts it has reaped an excess 
profit thornburg said 
the solicitations licensing branch of the state department of 
human resources is empowered to increase the charitys share if it 
finds excessive profit for the fundraisers 
if allowed to stand the law would bolster public confidence in 
charities thornburg said we feel that if a donor knows in 
advance what portion of the funds are going back to the charity 
then they will much more freely give 
but wayne shevlin president of the raleigh chapter of the 
national federation of the blind of north carolina inc disagreed 
if the first thing you have to say is how much is going for 
expenses most people are going to hang up before youve had a 
chance to go through the spiel shevlin said 
the law might drive out of business many small and mediumsized 
charities he said 
copilevitz said most potential donors who want information on 
how the money will be spent ask for it many states including 
north carolina require professional and amateur fundraising 
groups to provide such details on request he said 
most states regulate fund solicitation he said but north 
carolinas law goes far beyond any other 
us district judge earl britt struck down the measure as 
unconstitutional on may 14 1986 a finding upheld by the 4th us 
circuit court of appeals in richmond va on april 23 1987

federal fueleconomy standards will cause 
thousands of traffic deaths next year by discouraging the use of 
safer larger cars two researchers said tuesday as the government 
reported a slight increase in auto fuel efficiency last year 
fuel economy regulation inevitably leads to smaller lighter 
cars that are inherently less safe than the cars that would be 
produced without a binding fueleconomy constraint said a study 
by robert w crandall of the brookings institution in washington 
and john d graham of the harvard school of public health in boston 
they estimated the standards would cause 2200 to 3900 traffic 
deaths next year 
also tuesday the transportation department told congress that 
passenger cars sold in the united states got 282 miles per gallon 
last year overall up 02 miles per gallon from the previous year 
transportation secretary jim burnley said americans tended to 
buy slightly heavier higher performance cars last year than in 
prior years and imports showed a shift way from subcompacts to 
compacts increasing their market share by 8 percentage points 
among the big three automakers chrysler corp had the most fuel 
efficient cars fleetwide in 1987 at 276 mpg down from 278 mpg 
in 1986 
ford motor co had a fueleconomy of 268 mpg unchanged from 
the previous year and general motors corps was 264 mpg up from 
262 mpg the previous year 
weighted by sales imports had an fuel economy of 31 mpg down 
from 317 mpg the previous year 
domestic cars averaged 267 mpg up from 266 mpg the year 
before 
burnley used the report to reiterate his support for elimination 
of the fueleconomy requirement saying it placed us 
manufacturers at a disadvantage against their foreign competition 
the greatest contribution we can make to keeping jobs in the 
united states and to making the domestic auto industry competitive 
on a worldwide basis is to repeal the fuel economy rules 
burnley said thousands of american jobs are threatened because 
of an anachronistic law that is doing substantial harm to our 
economy and our trade balance 
the corporate average fuel economy standards cafe for short 
from 1978 sought to encourage more fuel efficient cars and thereby 
reduce petroleum use at a time of shortages and soaring prices 
the required fuel economy this year is 26 mpg of gasoline 
manufacturers that fail to meet the standards are liable to fines 
using mathematical models crandall and graham estimated the 
cafe standards had reduced the weight of cars by 500 pounds to 
3100 pounds despite sharp declines in oil prices after 1981 that 
in an unregulated market would be expected to encourage manufacture 
of larger cars 
that decline in weight caused by cafe is associated with a 14 
to 27 percent increase in occupant fatality risk the study said 
they applied that range to existing traffic fatality figures to 
make their estimate of the number of additional deaths likely in 
1989 
the estimate took into account such factors as the tendency of 
occupants of smaller cars compared with those of larger cars to 
buckle their safety belts the study said 
the study also said the cafe standards by raising the cost of 
desirable highperformance cars have encouraged people to drive 
their cars longer extending the useful life of older less safe 
and higherpollution cars 
rep bob carr dmich said at a news conference marking the 
studys release he hopes the conclusions will help win support for 
legislation he introduced last year to abolish the cafe standards 
congress is not the place to design auto models carr said 
acknowledging the bills chances of passage this year are slim 
the study by crandall and graham is scheduled for publication 
next year in the journal of law and economics 
the study was released by the competitive enterprise institute 
a publicissues group espousng freemarket principles crandall and 
graham said they did the study without funds from the institute

the justice department sued tuesday to force the 
palestine liberation organization to close its mission to the 
united nations and the plo envoy defiantly responded that he could 
live on the street as a refugee 
the government sought a federal court order barring the plo 
zehdi labib terzi head of the plos observer mission and five 
other plo officials or employees from continuing to operate the 
mission or any plo office in manhattan or at any other location 
the action is required under the 1987 antiterrorism act which 
found the plo and its affiliates were a terrorist organization 
responsible for numerous violent incidents including the murder of 
an american citizen during the hijacking of the cruise ship achille 
lauro in 1985 
terzi said he would have no comment on the plos possible legal 
response until he reads the complaint 
the only asset we have in this country is the building we live 
in he told reporters maybe they want me to live on the 
street but this would not be the first time the palestinians 
become refugees 
he called efforts to freeze plo funds financial terrorism to 
strangle us 
earlier tuesday he had said if they force me to leave i 
will have to move to the united nations on international 
territory out of reach of us marshals in 1973 plo chief yasser 
arafat spent a night at the united nations because he could not 
stay on us territory 
in amman jordan plo foreign affairs spokesman farouk kaddoumi 
said tuesday before the suit was filedwe will keep the office 
open until the american police seal it off then we will go to the 
united nations and live there 
this will become a continuous headache to the us 
administration said kaddoumi 
former us attorney general ramsey clark the plos legal 
counsel was not available for comment his office said tuesday 
clark did not immediately return messages left at the office 
clark has said however that he would seek to have the federal 
complaint dismissed on grounds that us courts lack jurisdiction 
in the matter involving an international treaty in this instance 
between the united states and the united nations 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said he would have to 
wait until the un general assembly adopts a resolution wednesday 
before commenting on possible legal action 
the 159member general assembly is to vote on a resolution 
supporting the plos right to operate and deploring us moves to 
shut the mission the draft of the resolution calls on the 
secretarygeneral to take measures to allow the plo to carry out 
its official functions as a un invitee 
in a separate action last september the state department 
ordered the closing of the plos information office in washington 
that was before congress passed the antiterrorism act which 
president reagan signed on dec 22 the law took effect monday 
under the law congress determined that the plo and its 
affiliates are a terrorist organization and a threat to the 
interests of the united states its allies and to international law 
and should not benefit from operating in the united states 
earlier this month secretary of state george shultz called the 
act one of the dumber things that the congress has done lately

a lawsuit filed tuesday alleges that an 
underground prison facility for women in lexington ky was 
designed specifically to house political activists and that inmates 
are subjected to inhumane treatment 
civil liberties groups filed the suit in us district court 
here against nine federal officials including attorney general 
edwin meese iii it seeks the immediate transfer of the inmates 
from the highsecurity facility to the general population of a 
federal womens prison 
the lexington control unit opened in november 1986 now houses 
five inmates and contains 16 basement cells constructed beneath the 
federal prison at lexington the us bureau of prisons said last 
october it will phase out the unit the only highsecurity unit for 
women in the federal prison system 
the primary purpose for the creation of the unit was to 
confine prisoners whose political associations and affiliations 
were determined to pose a security threat said the suit 
alleging violation of the womens constitutional rights all the 
women in the unit are suffering psychological and physical harm as 
a direct consequence of their isolated confinement in this 
underground segregation unit 
a new medium and highsecurity facility for women will be 
opened in june in marianna fla and the phaseout in lexington 
will be completed shortly thereafter said bureau of prisons 
spokeswoman kathryn morse she declined to comment on the suit 
the small basement facility has virtually no natural 
light and is illuminated 24 hours a day by fluorescent lights 
said the suit prepared by the national prison project of the 
american civil liberties union and other attorneys 
the women the suit said are monitored continuously by staff 
and video cameras have no opportunity to participate in any of the 
activities available to the general prison population and are 
subjected to random strip searches 
we believe the womens lives are in danger said susan 
waysdorf a spokeswoman for civil libertarians supporting the suit 
theyre beginning to experience signs of behavior modification 
general disorientation vision problems loss of appetite 
sleeplessnes 
among the inmates are silvia baraldini convicted of 
racketeering and conspiracy in aiding a 16 million brinks 
armored car heist in nyack ny that left a guard and two police 
officers dead another inmate at lexington is susan rosenberg 
linked by law enforcement officers to the same bungled brinks 
robbery 
baraldini serving a 43year term was transferred to lexington 
after refusing to be interviewed by an fbi agent the suit said 
rosenberg serving a 58year term for possession of weapons and 
explosives in connection with a 1985 police raid in new jersey was 
told that she would be confined to the unit until she changes her 
political beliefs the suit alleges 
when civil liberties groups began to expose lexington as a 
political prison federal officials hurriedly brought in two 
other women serving long sentences a coalition of prominent 
civil libertarians said in a statement about the lexington unit 
one of the women brought in later sylvia brown serving a 
27year term for violating probation and escaping from a federal 
prison was told that her release from the unit would depend on her 
lack of interaction with the political activists the suit added

president reagan harshly criticized the 
process of gerrymandering on tuesday complaining that republicans 
are getting shortshrift treatment in the redrawing of 
congressional boundary lines 
i promise you this as far as the president of the united 
states is concerned hes not going to be sitting around his garden 
sniffing roses in 1988 reagan told a group of republican elected 
officials 
im going to be out on the campaign trail telling the 
american people the truth about how the electoral process has been 
twisted and distorted he said 
reagan noted that reapportionment is scheduled in 1991 and said 
that having republicans in state and local offices is the only 
hope we have of getting a fair deal and thats what were asking 
for an end to the antidemocratic and unamerican practice of 
gerrymandering congressional districts 
gerrymandering is the political process by which congressional 
district lines are redrawn in such a fashion as to benefit the 
party in power whether democratic or republican 
reagan said there were 367 congressional races contested by both 
major political parties in 1984 in these contests the president 
said republicans won half a million votes more than democrats but 
the democrats won 31 more seats 
in his remarks reagan said that gerrymandering has become a 
national scandal the democraticcontrolled state legislatures have 
so rigged the electoral process that the will of the people cannot 
be heard they vote republican but elect democrats 
the president maintained that the congressional map is a 
horror show of grotesque contorted shapes district lines jump 
back and forth over mountain ranges cross large bodies of water 
send out little tentacles to absorb special communities and ensure 
safe seats 
reagan said that while republican party chairman frank 
fahrenkopf has challenged democratic gerrymandering in courts 
ultimately its in the state legislatures that the battle for 
fairness must be won and thats why republicans are going to have 
to campaign with all our heart and soul for republican state 
legislative candidates 
reagan has steadfastly refused to take sides in the competition 
for the republican party nomination to succeed him but has 
indicated he will campaign actively for the nominee 
in his talk tuesday the president signaled that he would hit 
the campaign trail for an array of other causes including his plan 
to speak out against the practice of gerrymandering

nicaraguas defense minister gen 
humberto ortega said at the end of a second day of peace talks 
between sandinista and contra rebel negotiators that he expected a 
concrete agreement on wednesday 
he declined to elaborate telling a news conference obviously 
we arent able to go into details 
earlier tuesday both sides said they had exchanged proposals 
which agree on major points for an extended ceasefire accompanied 
by amnesty and release of political prisoners 
contra leader adolfo calero told reporters we worked hard 
during the day we clarified points that coincide and we are 
working on differences 
it was a fruitful day and tomorrow could be even better 
calero described the second round of talks as direct and 
frank 
the two sides began three days of meetings monday at this town 
on the costa rican border trying to end a civil war that president 
daniel ortega says has cost 26500 lives since 1981 both sides 
suspended battlefield action during the talks 
the sandinista delegation proposed a 30day truce that could be 
extended to three months during which the ussupported contras 
would lay down their weapons and join a national reconciliation 
dialogue 
victor hugo tinoco the deputy foreign minister announced the 
proposal at a news conference for every rebel who stops fighting 
he said the leftist government will free one of the 3300 
political prisoners it considers eligible for release 
most prisoners are former members of the national guard as the 
army was called under the late president anastasio somoza whom the 
sandinista revolution overthrew in july 1979 
contrary to previous sandinista demands tinoco said rebels who 
put down their arms would be free from prosecution without applying 
for amnesty and could take party in nicaraguan political life 
they would be permitted to operate uncensored newspapers 
magazines and radio stations but television would remain a 
government monopoly 
contra proposals as outlined to reporters by spokesman bosco 
matamoros call for a 45day truce beginning on good friday april 
1 rebel fighters would move to ceasefire zones and a permanent 
truce would be negotiated by sandinista and contra leaders 
matamoros said the contras demand total and unconditional 
amnesty when the ceasefire begins so anyone who had left 
nicaragua for political reasons could rejoin the political 
economic and social process without any conditions 
contra leaders also want to join a national dialogue between the 
sandinistas and their internal political opponents 
an agreement signed monday night by president ortega the 
defense ministers brother and leaders of eight opposition 
political parties has a significant effect on that contra demand 
it says the parties pledge to discuss internal political 
issues exclusively with the government and the government will 
discuss exclusively with rebel groups all matters involving a 
ceasefire 
according to matamoros other contra demands include immediate 
total amnesty freedom for all political prisoners and an end to 
mandatory military service 
tinoco said at the moment at which a ceasefire is signed 
whether it be for 30 60 or 90 days according to what the 
counterrevolution wants at that moment the leadership of the 
nicaraguan resistance contras will be able to rejoin civic and 
political life and even participate in the national dialogue that 
seeks a reconciliation of all nicaraguans 
both sides propose international monitoring of the ceasefire 
the sandinistas would have a 15member international commission 
including representatives of the united nations organization of 
american states contadora and its support group 
contadora is made up of mexico venezuela colombia and panama 
and began trying to negotiate peace in central america several 
years ago the support group is argentina brazil uruguay and peru 
the battlefield truce appeared on tuesday to be holding it was 
the first agreed suspension of fighting since truce for christmas 
and new years during which some fighting was reported 
alfredo cesar a former sandinista who leads the contra 
delegation called the exchange of proposals a step ahead on 
monday night he told reporters neither side seeks a military 
victory over the other 
both ceasefire and reconciliation talks are required under the 
peace plan signed aug 7 by the five central american presidents 
it also calls for greater democracy in the region and an end to 
both foreign aid to insurgents and the use of one countrys 
territory for attacks on another 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo nicaraguas roman catholic 
primate is attending the talks as one of two observers 
he acted as mediator in four previous ceasefire conferences in 
which the sides did not meet facetoface they were held outside 
nicaragua and ended without agreement 
the other observer is joao baena soarez general secretary of 
the organization of american states

north carolina should encourage students to 
finish high school by denying drivers licenses to people under the 
age of 18 who drop out the lieutenant governor said tuesday 
lt gov bob jordan a democrat who plans to run against 
republican gov jim martin in the nov 8 general election held a 
series of news conferences across the state to introduce a package 
aimed at reducing the states dropout rate 
jordan is expected to win the democratic nomination in the may 3 
primary martin has no opposition 
a similar bill failed during the 1987 legislative session but 
jordan said he was confident he could steer the measure through the 
democratdominated general assembly 
jordan said martin had made no proposals to reduce the dropout 
rate although during his term nearly 100000 youngsters one 
student in four have left school without a diploma 
martin told reporters jordans proposal was reasonable and 
interesting but said he did not know whether it would work 
jordan said that if elected he would set a goal of halving the 
rate by 1992 
the drivers license provision would give young people an 
incentive to remain in school jordan said under the proposed law 
dropouts would have to wait until their 18th birthday to get a 
license while those still in school could take the license test at 
age 16 
the state of north carolina should do what a lot of parents 
do he said when their kids dont study or dont do well in 
school they take away some privileges some parents take away 
their car keys 
jordans package also includes hiring more guidance counselors 
and additional technical training

danas an influential weekly 
newspaper in zagreb on tuesday called for pope john paul ii to 
visit communist yugoslavia 
it said in an editorial in slovenia there is not a single 
serious reason against a papal visit if there are reasons 
elsewhere against the popes trip then these should be dealt with 
in a public discussion 
if john paul should come to yugoslavia he probably would visit 
only slovenia and croatia the two northern republics that are 
predominantly roman catholic according to danas 
at the annual meeting last week of the slovenian socialist 
alliance a communistled organization alliance secretarygeneral 
joze smole said it was time to do everying possible to arrange 
a papal visit 
danas noted allegations that croatian authorities were opposed 
to a papal visit and said the decision could not be made by one 
republic alone 
it is expected that if the pope visits croatia he would honor 
the late cardinal aloisius stepinac who was convicted of 
collaborating with nazi troops in world war ii the cardinal died 
under house arrest in his native village and his body was buried in 
the zagreb cathedral 
danas said there have been 11 visits to the vatican in the past 
year by yugoslav state representatives compared to one by a 
ranking catholic leader cardinal agostino casarolis visit to 
djakovo croatia in 1985 to mark a st methods anniversary 
smole said yugoslavia should at least honor the principle of 
reciprocity in its relations with the holy see 
government officials have said a papal visit could take place 
when agreement is reached on all conditions 
there was speculation that such a visit was discussed when 
premier branko mikulic had a 30minute audience with the pontiff on 
jan30 
danas said the clergy of the orthodox church and atheists 
probably would not gladly see the pope in yugoslavia but the 
opposition does not come from these quarters alone 
the situation in yugoslavia is so complex that a papal visit 
unless it gained a kind of national consensus would indeed 
become a motive for political showdowns

press conditions in 
haiti improved after the duvalier dictatorship fell but a 
restrictive code and government intimidation still cause concern 
the interamerican press association said tuesday 
an iapa delegation said that after president jeanclaude 
duvalier fled to exile in france in 1986 ending 29 years of harsh 
rule by the duvalier family radio stations and newspapers 
flourished 
local newspapers resumed political commentary bans were lifted 
on newspapers published abroad by exiles radio stations the main 
source of news in a country where illiteracy approaches 80 percent 
rehired staff members who had been deported or hounded into exile 
when jeanclaude duvalier fled haiti in february 1986 the 
media like haitians in general assumed that they had democracy 
and acted accordingly harold hoyte managing director of the 
barbados nation told the iapa 
haitian publishers radio and tv station directors opposition 
leaders and officials all agree that there was in fact almost 
total freedom said hoyte who traveled to haiti on march 1718 
and spoke with newly elected president leslie manigat and many 
others 
the sense of journalistic freedom changed when the provisional 
government a militaryled junta issued a press code in july 1986 
it required journalists to have university degrees declare news 
sources and be accredited annually 
haitian reporters told the delegation the code raised concern 
they also expressed concern about recent communiques from the 
information ministry and armed forces cautioning the news media 
about publishing or broadcasting reports from abroad that might be 
perceived as negative to the image of haiti or its leaders 
managers of newspapers radio and television stations were 
almost unanimous that there is now selfcensorship of certain news 
and an awareness that to offend the army is to risk new 
repression hoyte said 
he said manigat supports the press code and brushed aside the 
delegations arguments that the best press law would be no press 
law at all 
in general hoyte said the delegation was satisfied that 
conditions for the press in haiti are much better than those under 
the duvalier dictatorship but also notes with concern the 
atmosphere of intimidation and mistrust and the prospect of a new 
press law which will maintain some of the present limitations 
three delegation members stopped off in portauprince last week 
before going on the dominican republic for the iapa meeting the 
others besides hoyte were wilbur landrey foreign editor of the st 
petersburg fla times and chairman of the iapa freedom of the 
press committee and iapa president ignacio lozano editor of la 
opinion in los angeles calif

a prosecutor accused of fabricating death 
threats against herself during extradition proceedings for two 
sikhs charged with terrorism gave fbi agents a description used to 
make a sketch of a suspect a lawyer for the sikhs said tuesday 
the fbi showed the sketch to several new jersey sikhs during an 
investigation of the threats against special assistant us 
attorney judy g russell and one was ordered to appear before a 
federal grand jury said lawyer ronald kuby 
kuby represents sukhminder singh he and ranjit singh gill are 
accused of terrorism in india 
a federal magistrate ruled in february that gill and singh could 
be extradited the hearings were conducted amid tight security 
partly prompted by the threats to ms russell and an anonymous 
letter sent to the magistrate ronald j hedges 
in a hearing before hedges on monday us attorney samuel a 
alito jr said there was evidence that ms russell may have 
manufactured the threats 
laboratory tests found the same typewriter was used to address 
the envelopes and to fill out ms russells application to the 
justice department in 1983 the typewriter was found in her home 
along with three similar letters in envelopes as well as materials 
apparently used to make the letters out of words cut from 
newspapers and magazines the prosecutor said 
ms russell who left the us attorneys office before the 
hearings began but handled the case as a special assistant is in a 
private hospital her attorney robert j fettweis has declined to 
comment 
federal authorities have said they would request a new 
extradition hearing to avoid the appearance of impropriety and 
were considering how much of the proceedings should be repeated 
kuby said tuesday he wanted all pretrial arguments repeated 
before a new magistrate and possibly outside of new jersey 
at mondays hearing alito said the allegations about ms 
russell have no bearing on the cases final outcome 
during the investigation into the threats kuby said one of his 
clients amarvir sonny singh was ordered to appear before a 
newark grand jury investigating the threats 
they didnt question him they just viewed him to see if he 
matched the sketch kuby said amarvir singh was later told by 
investigators not to return for a lineup kuby said 
the lawyer said agents told sikhs they interviewed that the 
sketch was based on ms russells description of a man who shouted 
a threat at her in a shopping mall 
first assistant us attorney michael chertoff said he would not 
comment on the shouted threat because it was not on the public

a judge on tuesday gave bishop college two months 
to come up with 200000 but rejected a motion to take the 
struggling school out of protection of bankruptcy court 
us bankruptcy court trustee george mcelreath had sought to 
dismiss the schools chapter 11 reorganization petition that would 
have left bishop vulnerable to lawsuits from its 400 creditors who 
are owed more than 125 million 
us bankruptcy court judge robert mcguire in denying 
mcelreaths motion ordered the school to raise 50000 every two 
weeks beginning april 5 if the school cannot prove it has the cash 
on hand within three days of each deadline he will reconsider the 
motion to dismiss the chapter 11 petition 
its a good deal said bishop attorney t glover roberts 
its incentive for the school especially the students to do 
something 
roberts said the school which has failed to meet its payroll 
for two months has operating expenses of 200000 a month and 
would not have survived if the trustees motion had been granted 
bishop is in a deeper and deeper financial hole roberts 
said 
observers in the packed courtroom mostly bishop students and 
faculty applauded mcguires ruling afterward many joined in 
singing the schools alma mater in the courthouse lobby 
judith swift attorney for bishops largest creditor its 
facultystaff committee praised the judges ruling 
clearly the debtor is in violation on matters of legal 
concern but law is about equity too swift said the equity 
here is the human concerns of the students and faculty 
swift told the judge that 28 of the schools approximately 50 
faculty and staff members had agreed to work without pay for the 
rest of the term if bishop was allowed to stay open 
only two creditors joined mcelreaths motion to dismiss the 
chapter 11 protection 
though he rejected the motion the judge said mcelreath was 
right to carry out his duty as courtappointed trustee to point out 
bishops violations of the bankruptcy filing the most notable the 
judge said was the accrual of nearly 700000 in new debt since 
the school filed for protection last may 
school officials are hoping for aid from the us department of 
education which is expected to decide next week whether to renew 
400000 in funding for the school that funding was lost last year 
when the southern association of colleges and schools failed to 
renew bishops academic accreditation because of its financial 
problems 
bishops board of trustees voted earlier tuesday to allow 
conversion of the schools bankruptcy filing from chapter 11 to 
chapter 7 at the end of the spring semester in late may unless the 
schools dire financial situation changes 
under chapter 7 bishop would close and its assets would be sold 
to pay creditors 
school officials are also working to get back 150000 from two 
churches that recently withdrew donations the churches backed out 
after dallas businessman clifford sugerman reneged on a 300000 
pledge 
sugerman had promised to match donations up to that amount 
sugerman whose chapter 13 bankruptcy petition filed in 1985 is 
still an open case gave no reason for dropping the pledge and his 
sugarman foundation is now under investigation by the state 
attorney generals office 
bishop college affiliated with the national baptist churches 
was founded as a college for blacks in 1861 it currently has about 
300 students

the fairness of legal proceedings for the sharpeville six a 
group of blacks granted a onemonth stay of execution last week 
they were convicted of complicity in the mob killing of a black

congress overrode president reagans veto of a 
major civil rights bill tuesday ending a fouryear battle to 
restore broad protection for women minorities the elderly and the 
handicapped 
a 7324 vote in the senate followed by a 292133 tally in the 
house handed reagan a severe political defeat and reversed a 1984 
supreme court decision that sharply restricted the reach of four 
antidiscrimination statutes 
the votes in both chambers exceeded the twothirds majority 
needed to enact a law over a presidential veto it was the ninth 
time congress had rejected a reagan veto 
the white house pledged to enforce the new law which reagan had 
called a federal power grab 
we presented an alternative civil rights act which stated the 
presidents strong views against discrimination in this country 
a white house statement said the congress chose to override the 
presidents veto we will work to implement the new law 
people who voluntarily take federal funds have an obligation 
to treat everybody else fairly said rep barney frank dmass 
summing up the rationale of lawmakers who have been pressing for 
the civil rights restoration act since the high court ruling 
the moral majority which had campaigned against the bill said 
after the vote that the legislation would cause severe damage to 
the free exercise of religion and will put at risk our other 
guaranteed freedoms 
the court said only specific programs or activities receiving 
federal aid had to comply with four major civil rights laws 
the restoration act bars discrimination by institutions 
government agencies and some corporations that receive any federal 
aid that means if a college physics department for example 
receives federal assistance the entire college would fall under 
the civil rights laws 
reagan and his congressional allies argued for a less sweeping 
alternative saying the act went far beyond simple restoration 
they said it would curtail religious liberty and expand federal 
control over the private sector 
its a blank check to the bureaucrats and the litigators 
said rep james sensenbrenner rwis 
but house speaker jim wright dtexas said in a statement that 
reagans veto was wholly unnecessary and it provoked an 
unnecessary confrontation the new law will not end illegal 
discrimination but it does represent a step forward in making 
america truly a land of equal opportunity for all 
supporters in the house erupted into cheers and applause when 
the twothirds mark was reached in the senate the mood was more 
subdued 
sen edward kennedy dmass chief senate sponsor of the bill 
said the senate had demonstrated that this country does not want 
to retreat on protections of rights for the american people 
the opposition leader sen orrin hatch rutah said 
sometimes you win some and sometimes you lose some thats the 
nature of our process 
ralph neas executive director of the 185group leadership 
conference on civil rights called the votes a bipartisan 
reaffirmation of civil rights and a bipartisan repudiation of the 
civil rights extremism of the reaganbush administration it was a 
great victory for civil rights and for the nation 
the us chamber of commerce however said the bill does 
little to protect these basic rights and may end up imposing 
unncessary regulatory burdens on businesses farmers and others 
opponents contended the bill had little to do with civil rights 
and had much to do with what reagan on tuesday called a power 
grab by washington designed to take control away from states 
localities communities parents and the private sector and give it 
to federal bureaucrats and judges 
reagan had proposed an alternative last week that would enable 
more institutions to escape regulation on religious grounds and 
limit most corporate compliance requirements to specific plants or 
facilities receiving federal aid 
as they voted tuesday many lawmakers even some who voted to 
sustain reagans veto denounced a lastminute campaign against the 
restoration act by the conservative moral majority 
they said they received hundreds of calls from people who said 
they had been told the bill would force them to hire homosexual 
ministers and teachers give new privileges to drug addicts and 
intrude on their freedom to practice or contribute to their 
religions 
rarely has the legislative process been subjected to such a 
campaign of misinformation and distortion said sen george 
mitchell dmaine 
senate gop leader bob dole of kansas and acting gop leader alan 
simpson of wyoming also criticized the campaign simpson said he 
was concerned about erroneous claims that massive new rights 
would be created while dole said in a statement that there were 
serious misconceptions about what this bill does 
jerry c nims president of moral majority said in a statement 
after the vote that the override is likely to be the major 
political issue for evangelicals in the 1988 elections 
if enough people are not voted into office to change whats 
occurred we will have entered the moral dark ages nims said 
dole who was absent for the initial vote was on the campaign 
trail tuesday for the gop presidential nomination and did not vote 
then either on a radio callin show in milwaukee dole said he 
would vote to override the veto if he were in washington but he 
added if it were the deciding vote i would side with the 
president 
eight gop senators who initially voted for the bill switched 
tuesday and supported reagan they were simpson thad cochran of 
mississippi paul trible of virginia john warner of virginia 
larry pressler of south dakota charles grassley of iowa john 
danforth of missouri and christopher bond of missouri 
in addition two senators who didnt vote last time sens 
malcolm wallop of wyoming and james mcclure of idaho sided with 
the president 
the supreme court ruling came in a challenge to federal 
regulation mounted by tiny grove city college in pennsylvania in 
its attempts to reverse the decision congress became enmeshed in 
controversies over abortion religions and federal intrusion and 
was unable to pass a corrective measure until this year 
the restoration act says entire institutions and government 
agencies must not discriminate if any program or activity within 
them receives federal aid entire corporations are covered if they 
provide a public service such as health care or if the aid goes to 
the business as a whole as in the chrysler corp bailout 
farmers receiving crop subsidies people using food stamps and 
other individuals receiving federal assistance would not be subject 
to regulation an institutions refusal to perform or pay for 
abortions would not be considered discrimination against women 
the supreme court decision applied specifically to title ix of 
the 1972 education amendments barring sex discrimination in 
federally funded education programs it was interpreted also to 
cover the 1964 civil rights act barring racial discrimination in 
federally assisted programs the 1973 rehabilitation act barring 
discrimination against the handicapped in any program or activity 
receiving federal aid and the 1975 age discrimination act barring 
employment discrimination against older people

democratic presidential contenders paul simon and albert gore 
jr broke off campaigning tuesday long enough to return to their 
senate desks and vote to override president reagans veto of a 
civil rights bill republican contender bob dole stayed away and 
straddled the issue 
with saturdays michigan caucuses looming as the next campaign 
test for the democrats rep richard gephardt attacked michael 
dukakis for a battlefield conversion on trade issues so 
important to the automotive industry dukakis aides retorted that 
the massachusetts governor has long been in favor of trade 
legislation just not gephardts proposal 
jesse jackson was in michigan too turning his antidrug 
crusade into a slap at the reagan administrations central american 
policy the no 1 threat to your lives today is drugs he told 
a high school audience in lansing were not threatened by 3 
million sandinistas and if so cant be saved from them by 15000 
contras 
dukakis at the massachusetts statehouse in boston did change 
his stance on one issue agreeing tuesday to support a ban on 
furloughs for firstdegree murderers after public pressure stemming 
from the release of a murderer who raped a maryland woman 
i try to listen i try to learn said dukakis who 
previously had called the furlough program for murderers essential 
for maintaining order in the states prisons 
later dukakis made a trip to connecticut to pick up 
endorsements from sen christopher dodd and gov william oneill 
oneill predicted dukakis would do extremely well in next 
weeks primary 
sources said dukakis also would win the backing on wednesday of 
new jersey sen bill bradley whose name crops up consistently in 
speculation about a darkhorse emerging as the democratic nominee in 
a deadlocked convention 
that would leave new york gov mario cuomo alone among the 
prominent noncandidates who has yet to make an endorsement 
an abc news poll suggested a matchup between dukakis and vice 
president george bush in the general election could be a close 
race the network tuesday night its nationwide poll of 1007 people 
gave dukakis 48 percent and bush 47 percent the margin of error 
was 35 percent abc said 
bush was in washington during the day and the only other gop 
hopeful pat robertson was cutting his staff to avoid exceeding a 
federal spending limit aide connie snapp said the payroll has been 
cut from a maximum of 230 to about 100 and another 30 or 40 aides 
may be released later in the month 
reagans veto of the civil rights bill and the 
democraticcontrolled congress attempt to override dominated the 
political news during the day the senate voted 7524 to overturn 
the presidents veto more than the twothirds majority needed the 
house also voted to override 292133 
simon who is hoping to win the wisconsin primary on april 5 
said he sponsored the legislation in 1984 when it was first 
introduced 
this is something that ought to appeal to the basic good 
instincts of every member of the senate and the house he said 
he said the issue involved is are we going to make real the 
dream of equality in the constitution 
gore returned to washington from harrisburg pa after 
collecting endorsements from several legislative leaders he also 
met with gov robert casey but came away without an endorsement 
gore used the civil rights bill to attack bush the prohibitive 
frontrunner for the republican nomination gore said bush who 
announced monday that he supported reagans veto of the measure 
always sides with the president even when the proposals are 
unfathomably dumb 
when push comes to shove the vice president never disagrees 
with president reagan he said adding that bush didnt disagree 
with selling arms to iran for hostages or in keeping panama 
strongman manuel noriega on the cia payroll despite evidence of 
drug involvement 
bushs top campaign spokesman pete teeley dismissed 
suggestions that bush would begin looking for an issue to disagree 
with reagan on just to prove his independence 
the fact is six months ago everybody was writing that george 
bush had to disagree with the president in order to get the 
nomination everyone now sees that that was a myth the spokesman 
said 
far far behind in the republican presidential race dole said 
he stayed in wisconsin rather than return for the senate vote 
because i wasnt needed 
he said he was personally opposed to the presidents veto but 
asked on a milwaukee radio station callin program he said but 
if it were the deciding vote i would side with the president 
dole who was attacked by bush earlier in the campaign for not 
taking firm stands on issues such as arms control and tax 
increases placed a formal statement in the senate record that did 
not take a precise stand 
in part it said i have always supported legislation to 
overturn grove city to restore the broad civil rights coverage that 
existed prior to that case at the same time i recognize that 
the bill is not a perfect bill i am not fully satisfied with 
it but the fact remains that the administration and its 
congressional allies had the opportunity to offer amendments and 
they were voted down 
dole was absent when the bill passed the senate originally in 
january 
the legislation stems from a 1984 supreme court ruling that says 
an organization receiving federal aid must follow 
antidiscrimination rules only for the program that receives the 
aid and not for the entire organization or institution the 
legislation would erase that distinction 
gephardts repeated jabs at dukakis centered on the trade issue 
that is central to his own campaign the missouri congressman is 
the sponsor of legislation calling for retaliation against unfair 
trading practices dukakis opposes the gephardt provision but 
declared a few days ago that he favors a different proposal backed 
by sen don riegle the michigan senator who bestowed his 
endorsement on monday 
were getting some battlefield conversions gephardt said

nicaragua told the security council 
tuesday the united states is plotting an invasion of that central 
american nation 
honduras meanwhile rejected nicaraguas call for un 
observers to visit the hondurannicaraguan border where there was 
fighting last week between soldiers of the leftist sandinista 
government and usbacked contra rebels 
nicaraguan envoy rita delia casco said of the alleged us plot 
the danger is not past indeed it is growing america plans 
to provide a central american gulf of tonkin incident to serve as a 
pretext for direct invasion and escalation of intimidation and 
threats 
the united states sent 3200 soldiers to honduras last week at 
the request of the honduran president who accused nicaraguan 
soldiers of penetrating honduran territory while chasing the 
rebels president reagan said the us move was to show support of 
honduras and as a warning to nicaragua 
ms casco director of the foreign ministrys department of 
international organizations said the situation points to the 
possibility of imminent imperialist military action on a broad 
scale 
the gulf of tonkin incident occurred when washington said north 
vietnamese boats attacked two us destroyers in that waterway on 
aug 2 1964 congress passed the gulf of tonkin resolution five 
days later and the united states began a military buildup in south 
vietnam that led to major american involvement in the vietnam war 
a fourmember un team was leaving tuesday night to inspect the 
nicaraguan side of the border with honduras 
un spokesman francois giuliani told reporters that honduras 
turned down a un offer to send observers to that country 
honduran ambassador jorge ramon hernandez told the council a 
un team was not necessary because the five central american 
presidents in a regional peace plan signed last august had set up 
an executive committee to verify compliance with the accord 
hernandez said sandinista troops invaded honduras and his nation 
had the right to selfdefense 
our military response has been limited so far and the 
international assistance we are asking for basically has a 
deterrent nature he said 
honduran jets raided nicaraguan positions last week in the bocay 
region which straddles the border between the two countries no 
injuries were reported 
on sunday honduran officials said the nicaraguans were 
withdrawing and the us troops would leave the country soon maj 
gary hovatter a us military spokesman in honduras said tuesday 
that the american troops were conducting training exercises that 
could last from 10 to 14 days 
us ambassador herbert s okun the deputy permanent 
representative at the un told the council that nicaragua had 
launched a massive attack against the rebels who have base camps 
in honduras 
the sandinistas committed aggression against honduras he 
said it was not the other way around 
okun said the sandinistas retreated into nicaragua without 
crushing the rebels because honduras reacted forcefully and the 
united states demonstrated its determination to help honduras 
he said stability will return to central america only when 
nicaragua complies with the regional peace plan and gives up its 
selfappointed right to subvert neighboring democracies and to 
launch premeditated attacks

president francois mitterrand who said tuesday he 
will seek reelection next month has managed in one sevenyear 
term to be both the least and most popular chief executive in the 
30 years of the fifth republic 
mitterrand 71 led the leftist surge in may 1981 that ousted 
president valery giscard destaing and the centerright alliance 
that had controlled the national assembly for 23 years 
the victory avenged socialist mitterrands defeats in the 
presidential elections of 1965 by charles de gaulle and 1974 by 
giscard destaing 
after five years french voters turned against the socialists in 
the march 1986 parliamentary elections and returned control to the 
right creating what became known in france as cohabitation 
between a socialist president and a conservative premier 
socialist policies had dragged mitterrands popularity rating in 
public opinion polls as low as 27 percent but under the unwanted 
marriage with the conservatives it soared again to a consistent 55 
percent or more 
the president pursued costly social programs after the 
socialists gained power but then reversed course instituting 
austerity measures 
economic troubles brought his party to power and caused its 
downfall five years later after the socialist defeat mitterrand 
eased into the role of elder statesman and held himself above the 
daytoday battles of governing commenting on issues only 
occasionally 
he was born oct 26 1916 in jarnac in western france and 
attended universities in paris earning degrees in law and letters 
he was drafted into the army in 1938 and shot and captured during 
the german invasion in may 1940 
mitterrand escaped from a prison camp in germany returned to 
france and created a resistance network his long feud with de 
gaulle began when mitterrand refused to unite his resistance group 
with de gaulles 
it was in the resistance days that he met danielle gouze and 
they married in 1944 soon after france was liberated he held 
several government posts including interior and justice minister 
during the chaotic postwar fourth republic 
in the early 1970s he built the moribund socialist party into a 
major political force but the union of the left he formed with the 
communists fell apart in 1977 
not until the final days of the 1981 campaign did the two main 
leftist parties join forces again to defeat giscard and oust the 
conservatives 
mitterrand shocked much of the west by bringing communists into 
his government but the union lasted only three years in 1984 the 
communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy

dissident stockholders dropped their 
opposition to texaco incs financial reorganization plan tuesday 
as a federal judge opened a hearing on whether to implement the 
proposal 
texaco the nations thirdlargest oil company announced that 
96 percent of the shares voted 174 million of 181 million backed 
the plan which would allow the company to emerge from bankruptcy 
court protection 
after receiving the vote results us bankruptcy court judge 
howard schwartzberg heard comments on the plan but no one opposed 
it 
later he recessed the hearing until wednesday morning 
even though the plan received more than the twothirds vote 
needed from shareholders the final decision on whether the plan 
was fair and equitable rested with schwartzberg 
if schwartzberg confirms the plan texaco could emerge from 
bankruptcy protection by midapril which would be a year after it 
sought protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the federal 
bankruptcy code 
texaco was the biggest company ever to seek refuge in the 
bankruptcy courts 
shortly before the hearing harvey miller the bankruptcy lawyer 
representing texaco announced that attorneys for dissident 
shareholders had dropped their opposition to the reorganization 
plan 
those stockholders had objected to provisions that would free 
officers and advisers of texaco pennzoil co the former getty oil 
co the sarah getty trust and the j paul getty museum from all 
liability arising out of the court fight that resulted from a 
texacopennzoil battle over getty oil 
texaco said it was forced into bankruptcy court by a requirement 
that it post a multibilliondollar bond while appealing the 103 
billion judgment held against it by pennzoil 
a houston jury had awarded the judgment in november 1985 after 
finding texaco had interfered wrongly with pennzoils agreement to 
acquire part of getty oil before texaco bought getty itself 
in december pennzoil agreed to accept 3 billion in cash from 
texaco to drop the judgment the settlement was the keystone of the 
overall bankruptcy reorganization plan which would require texaco 
to pay its other creditors an additional 25 billion 
while some shareholders first opposed dropping liability for 
executives in the pennzoil matter others were unhappy with 
antitakeover provisions of texacos charter and bylaws that they 
argued entrenched management and lessened accountability 
the leader of the latter group was takeover specialist carl c 
icahn who controls 148 percent of texacos common stock making 
him the companys largest shareholder despite his opposition to 
those provisions however he had said he would vote for the 
reorganization plan 
icahns involvement along with reported interest by fellow 
takeover artist t boone pickens and others made texaco a prime 
target for takeover speculation in recent weeks 
the company cleared another obstacle on friday when it announced 
it had reached a framework for resolving a dispute with the 
internal revenue service 
in january the irs said it was pursuing claims totaling as much 
as 65 billion against texaco but friday texaco said it would put 
into escrow 1 billion over the next four years while negotiating 
the dispute after emerging from bankruptcy reorganization

said his group would stay all night or even several days until the 
grand jury was disbanded some 15 to 20 protesters remained at the 
scene at midevening 
a spokesman for attorney general robert abrams would not say if 
the grand jury was meeting tuesday but there was no sign of grand 
jury activity 
gov mario cuomo selected abrams to investigate and if 
necessary prosecute the case 
at one time sharpton maddox and mason had insisted that abrams 
personally handle the case they have since demanded a special 
prosecutor but cuomo has refused 
maddox says abrams has violated the law by disclosing certain 
facts about the grand jury such as the instructions it received 
its purpose for forming and its makup he said state law requires 
that grand jury proceedings be secret

you can basically say we were a blink of an eye away from 
anything that could happen rinn said 
im never going to allow my ship to be shot at and hit said 
rinn adding the fate of another sister ship the uss stark is 
not lost on us the stark lost 37 of its crew when hit by an

out this military operation as a retaliatory strike against 
provisional sinn fein the ira in response to the slaughter of 
innocents at la mon darkley brighton and enniskillen referring 
to some ira attacks in the last decade 
he stood silently in the dock through the 10minute hearing 
while a police officer also testified that stone told detectives 
i would state i am a dedicated freelance loyalist protestant 
paramilitary no surrender 
stone was charged with killing three people march 16 at a 
funeral in milltown for three ira members shot by british security 
forces in gibraltar an alleged accomplice is being held by police 
he has not been identified 
stone also is accused of killing three other catholics shot in 
sniper attacks between november 1984 and may 1987 the victims were 
a milkman a bread delivery man and a carpenter none with known 
ira links 
an outlawed protestant guerrilla group the ulster freedom 
fighters claimed responsibility for each of those murders 
in catholic west belfast where british authorities ordered a 
massive murder investigation after the killing of two british 
soldiers during another ira funeral on saturday police erected 
road blocks at main roads into the ghetto

court order to force the networks to yield their film 
government sources said lawyers were considering legal moves 
the two soldiers whom the army has acknowledged should not have

thousands of israelis mobbed prime minister 
yitzhak shamir on his return from a us visit tuesday and cheered 
him for his firm opposition to an american peace plan in the 
occupied lands violence continued 
the army said troops shot and killed a palestinian man in a 
clash monday night bringing the arab death toll in 15 weeks of 
protests in the occupied territories to 107 according to un 
figures the israeli army has suffered one fatality 
at least three more protesters were wounded in clashes and a 
palestinian who allegedly collaborated with israeli authorities was 
shot and killed by fellow arabs palestinian reports said 
an israeli soldier was taken to a hospital after being hit in 
the chest with a rock during a demonstration tuesday in the gaza 
strip refugee camp of deir el balah an army spokesman said 
returning from a weeklong visit that included talks with 
president reagan and secretary of state george p shultz shamir 
said us officials had set no deadlines for israel to accept the 
plan 
no one demanded anything from us he told reporters at tel 
avivs ben gurion airport it all depends on us 
shamir also hinted shultz was considering a return to the middle 
east in another attempt to defuse israelipalestinian tensions 
asher naim the information minister at the israeli embassy in 
washington said shultz will travel to the middle east in two weeks 
to continue negotiating for acceptance of his regional peace plan 
state department spokesman charles redman said tuesday that shultz 
had not yet decided to return 
naim also said israels cabinet probably would vote to keep 
alive the shultz peace initiative when it debates the issue in two 
weeks 
entering jerusalem shamirs car was mobbed by thousands of 
delighted supporters who danced sang and waved banners saying 
shamir remains strong 
these good wishes went with me wherever i went shamir told 
the crowd mostly members of his rightwing likud bloc and jewish 
settlers no one dared force on me decrees that lovers of the 
land of israel could not accept 
shamir used harsh words to restate his objections to the shultz 
plan 
these proposals in our opinion will not bring peace closer 
and the peace may even be harmed if our disagreements are not 
taken into consideration he said 
shamir has repeatedly objected to a major component of the us 
plan an international forum that would launch peace talks between 
israel and its arab neighbors he fears the forum would be hostile 
to israel and force concessions from territories occupied in the 
1967 middle east war 
shultzs plan also calls for three years of selfrule for the 
15 million palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip with 
talks on an overall settlement to begin in december 
foreign minister shimon peres who heads the centrist labor 
party and has supported the shultz plan toured the gaza strip on 
tuesday and discussed granting autonomy to its 650000 mostly 
impoverished residents before implementing autonomy in the west 
bank 
it would be a scandal and a mistake to just get up and leave 
gaza peres told reporters but if we could reach an 
arrangement of autonomy with jordan which would enable us to 
live on terms of security with gaza im for that 
the death toll rose as the body of a palestinian was found in 
the hills of tubas a west bank village 50 miles north of jerusalem 
an army spokesman confirmed troops shot the man monday night 
when their patrol was attacked by protesters hurling rocks metal 
bars and bottles

camp when he attacked an officer with a metal pole israel radio

its hard to imagine a more miscast version of 
julius caesar than the allstar revival currently ambushing 
audiences at the new york shakespeare festival public theater 
not since elizabeth taylor and richard burton curdled noel 
cowards private lives several seasons back has so much star 
power been used to so little effect in this case the big guns 
parading around in white and burgundy togas are al pacino martin 
sheen edward herrmann and john mcmartin 
each operates independently on stage never connecting with the 
other performers or the play a variety of acting styles are adrift 
in this endless exhausting production that seems much longer than 
its two hours and 30 minutes 
this is a julius caesar that doesnt connect on any level 
not as political drama personal tragedy or even historical 
pageantry coming right after the publics spirited and sensual 
midsummer nights dream it is a major disappointment 
julius caesar is a transition play bridging the historical 
plays and the later great tragedies the drama requires actors 
comfortable in both settings there are none in this production 
and director stuart vaughan is at a loss to impose any sort of 
style or unity to the diverse proceedings 
pacino as mark antony gives the evenings most bewildering and 
idiosyncratic performance the actor has a magnetic physical 
presence and its impossible not to watch him when he is on stage 
his antony moves like a feral streetwise gang leader who belongs 
more in the bronx than in ancient rome so does his accent 
to compensate for his bluecollar patois pacino speaks in a 
slow deliberate cadence he spits out each word carefully as if he 
were afraid of mispronunciation whats left is language devoid of 
any feeling or emotion 
sheen in the pivotal role of brutus has much the same problem 
with the plays poetry he gives an unshaded monotone performance 
sheens brutus also lacks the patrician bearing that should be the 
hallmark of this plays most interesting character hes a cipher 
and that blandness dilutes the tragedy 
as a result interest shifts to another of the conspirators 
cassius played by the usually reliable herrmann a tall 
vulturelike villain the actor starts out strongly insinuating 
his way into the good graces of brutus his explanation of why 
caesar should be killed is chillingly logical and effective but 
once the deed is accomplished herrmann falters his performance 
turns petulant and cassius becomes a scolding old maid furious 
that things have turned out wrong 
mcmartins caesar is also problematic although he captures the 
mans vanity theres little here to suggest a charismatic leader 
hes laconic rather than a commanding figure whose popularity 
threatens the empire 
the supporting cast is equally unmemorable and all over the 
forum in acting ability and accents although jerry mayer has a 
nice moment or two as a comic cobbler 
vaughans direction collapses in the second act awkward 
battlefield tableaux alternate with more intimate scenes that show 
the unraveling of the assassins lives its a tossup as to which 
scenes are more chaotic or unmoving the deaths of brutus and 
cassius seem to come more as a relief than as the inexorable result 
of fate the tragedy is nowhere to be found 
the setting designed by bob shaw doesnt help the drama the 
playing area is all exposed brick as are the inevitable columns 
making the stage look like a soho loft undergoing renovation 
julius caesar is the second production in the public 
theaters ambitious marathon to present all of shakespeares 36 
plays over a sixyear period next up is romeo and juliet 
starring peter macnicol and cynthia nixon as the starcrossed 
lovers it begins performances april 19 maybe it can get the 
publics shakespeare celebration back on track

the united states has offered to fly 
panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega to exile as an 
inducement to get him to leave that troubled country us 
officials said tuesday 
the offer came last week when two state department envoys met 
with noriega in panama and encouraged him to step down said the 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
noriega has refused to accept any arrangement that involves his 
departure from panama although the government of spain has offered 
him asylum 
the two state department envoys william g walker and michael 
kozak told noriega in their meeting that the us proposal to fly 
him into exile might be the last best offer he would receive 
for ending the crisis in a way that ensured his personal safety 
one official said 
the official said the offer would also allow noriegas family 
and friends to accompany him 
senior administration officials believe noriega will be forced 
from office shortly because of growing opposition to his rule in 
the panamanian defense forces 
the officials speaking only on condition they not be named 
said the antinoriega sentiment within the military has been 
accelerating over the past week and is probably the most important 
factor working against his survival as defense chief 
they said noriegas efforts to overcome the crisis probably were 
not helped with his conditional offer monday night to resign before 
the may 1989 presidential elections 
state department spokesman charles redman said panamanians 
regard the offer as a ploy to buy time a view he said was 
shared by the united states 
the message from panamanians is clear for the good of panama 
noriega should leave redman said referring to the hostile 
reaction of panamanian opposition leaders to the proposal and to 
the continued virtual shutdown of the country because of a general 
strike 
his presence is the root cause of continued political and 
economic instability redman said the ongoing general strike 
is only the most recent demonstration of the overwhelming 
opposition from all segments of panamanian society to noriegas 
continued rule 
president reagan arriving on capitol hill on tuesday for talks 
on his campaign to aid the nicaraguan contra rebels said we feel 
noriega should leave panama when reporters asked him about the 
situation in panama 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said any proposal 
that calls for noriegas resignation as defense chief but does not 
include his actual departure from panama is like getting the fox 
out of the hen house then giving him quarters next door 
fitzwater said noriegas plan would allow him to remain in 
control of the defense forces 
noriegas offer to resign announced monday night in a national 
broadcast by civilian chief of state manuel solis palma was 
conditioned on a dialogue with the opposition 
fissures in the defense forces were evident last wednesday when 
there was a coup attempt against noriega even though the plot was 
crushed officials said a number of officers knew about the 
conspiracy but said nothing rather than tip off noriega 
the coup attempt was the tip of the iceberg one official 
said 
discontent within the military is what everybody was looking 
for he said and almost without warning there it was 
this development is more significant than the wave of strike 
activity in recent weeks and the countrys acute cash shortage 
reflected in the governments inability to meet the public payroll 
according to the officials 
redman said the defense forces were weakened on monday when a 
series of promotions were announced he said the promotions were 
based on political not professional reasons 
noriega was said to have been defiant last friday during a 
3hour meeting with two state department envoys who encouraged him 
to resolve the crisis by seeking political asylum in spain or 
another third country 
noriega told the envoys they had come under the influence of 
panamanian oligarchs opposed to him and that the americans 
were dumb enough to believe them one official said 
the two officials walker and kozak appealed forcefully to 
noriega to step down but were rebuffed 
they told noriega that unless he resigns the panamanian defense 
forces could fall into disrepute and suffer the same fate as the 
nicaraguan national guard this was a reference to the military 
force which served under the somoza family dynasty and was 
dismantled by the sandinista government after the 1979 revolution 
noriega also was told that the reagan administration is eager to 
see the defense forces survive and to continue its prescribed role 
as guardian of national sovereignty 
walker and kozak reportedly encouraged noriega who is under 
indictment on drug smuggling charges in florida to accept an offer 
by spain under which he would be allowed to go to that country 
provided he asks for asylum and the united states does not seek his 
extradition the drug charges 
the united states says the legitimate government in panama is 
that of president eric arturo delvalle who tried to dismiss 
noriega on feb 25 
but the noriegadominated national assembly voted to oust 
delvalle and palma was named new head of state noriega opponents 
then called for a general strike in protest

mikhail s gorbachev said tuesday its absurd to 
blame moscow for nicaraguan conflicts and the soviet union has no 
militarypolitical plans for central america 
we are not reckless adventurers the soviet leader said 
gorbachev also said his economic and social reforms have brought 
an upsurge of ideological clashes in his own country that are 
still going on 
his remarks came as foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
conferred in washington with secretary of state george p shultz on 
issues including the superpower dispute over nicaragua 
shultz wants moscow to stop military aid to nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government while shevardnadze voiced serious 
concern about us policies in central america the united states 
backs nicasraguan rebels known as contras 
assistant secretary of state rozanne l ridgway and state 
department spokesman charles e redman accused the soviets on 
monday of furnishing an unceasing supply of weapons to the 
sandinistas 
gorbachev the general secretary of the soviet communist party 
outlined the soviet position on central america at a kremlin 
meeting tuesday with uruguays president julio sanguinetti the 
official tass news agency reported 
tass quoted gorbachev as saying we will never understand how 
nicaragua can threaten the united states and the western hemisphere 
in general we will never accept the absurd claim that the hand of 
moscow is the cause of the conflict and an obstacle to resolving 
it 
the soviet leader said that the ussr does not have any 
militarypolitical plans in respect to that region and this theme 
has never even cropped up in our relations with the nicaraguan 
leadership according to tass 
why should we need this gorbachev said to provoke the 
united states or somebody else in latin america we are not 
reckless adventurers 
gorbachev said the soviets never supplied arms to leftist rebels 
in el salvador and guatemala 
he made no specific mention of us charges of arms deliveries 
to the nicaraguans 
gorbachev also referred in his conversation with sanguinetti to 
domestic affairs saying the economic and social reforms he 
introduced have brought ideological clashes 
he said that those disputes have not yet subsided because 
people want to know fully why things that had come into being in 
extraordinary extreme circumstances were retained also in normal 
conditions 
tass did not specify what gorbachev was referring to he may 
have been talking about the drive by some armenians to annex the 
predominantly armenian region of nagornokarabakh which has been 
part of neighboring azerbaijan since 1923 
gorbachev said he expects the shultzshevardnadze negotiations 
will help set the agenda for his fourth summit meeting with 
president reagan which both sides have said will take place in 
moscow in late spring or early summer 
the talks will show if there is a real possibility to 
prepare a treaty on strategic longrange nuclear offensive arms 
in time for president reagans visit to moscow whether it will be 
possible to reach agreement on questions of the afghan and middle 
east settlement and on other pressing issues gorbachev was 
quoted as saying

a judge ruled tuesday that harvard 
university was entitled to papers of the late playwright tennessee 
williams after harvard attorneys promised that earnings from any 
publication would benefit his sister 
williams the author of plays including a streetcar named 
desire and cat on a hot tin roof died in 1983 at age 71 
the hearing one of the final steps in distribution of the 
williams estate came after harvard objected to a plan by southeast 
bank in miami which holds the papers as executor of the estate to 
give the manuscripts in trust to harvard 
the trustees for the 78yearold sister rose williams wanted 
the papers given in trust so the actual manuscripts could be 
sold if she needed additional money for medical and living expenses 
she has been institutionalized for 53 years in ossining ny 
having undergone a lobotomy to relieve an unstable mental 
condition many of williams plays are said to reflect the special 
tenderness and concern he felt for his sister and others who are 
lonely or mentally disabled 
the university held that it had the right to clear physical 
possession of the documents and monroe county circuit judge helio 
gomez agreed saying he found no limitation in williams will on 
giving the papers to the school 
harvard attorney frank connors assured miss williams trustees 
that if anything had commercial value she would have the benefit 
attorney jim hendrick who represents miss williams trustees 
told the judge that contents of some of the papers may be 
scandalous and may make reference to persons still living 
they may not be appropriate to make public at this time 
hendrick said 
the papers reportedly appraised at 175000 include sealed 
envelopes said to contain manuscripts such as the one that later 
evolved into the rose tattoo and the first draft of sweet 
bird of youth as well as written notes and notebooks of various 
kinds hendrick said 
they include various plays and manuscripts including some that 
have not been published he said 
the estate was valued in the millions and has been distributed 
gradually since his death but hendrick declined to place a value 
on the overall estate 
hendrick said the question about the papers was the last 
contested portion of the will of which he was aware he predicted 
that legal procedures surrounding distribution of the estate should 
be concluded in the next month

is the united states headed downhill spending 
and taxing away its might and power 
the thesis has arisen again popularized by among other events 
an academics bestselling book describing the rise to dominance 
and eventual deterioration of mighty nations through the ages 
several factors fit into the notion that assigns the latter role 
to the united states including budget imbalances big defense 
budgets trade difficulties slow growth and onerous taxes 
hastening the demise according to neat but perhaps not correct 
analyses is the kontradief theory named for a russian economist 
who many years ago claimed to have found a 50year cycle of 
economic rise and fall 
as viewed by the most gloomy of forecasters the us economy 
and much of the worlds economy has entered a decline phase 
the gloomy prospect seemed to fit a paul erdman scenario 
judging at least by the covers of his books he is you might know 
author of the crash of 79 the last days of america and 
the panic of 89 
he laughed no way said the economistauthor while the country 
has troubles he said it is in the process of renewing itself 
with lots of 30yearolds with new ideas and energy now entering 
positions of power 
forget it he said of the decline thesis weve got the 
resources were dynamic and weve got an infusion of the best of 
other countries through immigration 
why he asked should we listen to a dead russian economist 
who made his observations before airplanes flew and before the 
development of service economies 
but oddly in the midst of one of the longest economic 
expansions ever the notion of a dynamic america is sometimes lost 
buried under concern for the worst aggregation of economic problems 
since the great depression of the 1930s 
but dynamic america exists in the concepts of many scholars 
among them david birch who won a wide following for his research 
on small business while teaching at massachusetts institute of 
technology 
small business says birch represents renewal it has become 
the big picture in america 
such businesses are innovating exporting and creating jobs he 
reminded a meeting of national small business united an 
organization of independent business people that had it origins 
during the 1930s 
turbulence in the business community often gains attention with 
takeovers and demises and problems at wellknown companies but 
underlying the surface turbulence birch suggests is a strata of 
economic stability and growth 
we turn over about 8 to 10 percent of our corporations and 
about 8 to 10 percent of our jobs in this country every year 
said birch founder and president of cognetics inc an economic 
research firm in cambridge mass 
it means he continued that we turn over half of the american 
economy every five years half of all the companies and half of 
all the jobs change every five years 
new business he pointed out find niches create products and 
eventually compete and force larger companies to innovate or die 
after tracking about 12 million businesses for close to two 
decades what we began to realize was that there was this huge 
changing of the guard taking place he said 
the dinosaurs were dropping like rocks and a whole bunch of 
little manufacturing companies were taking their place he added 
the turbulence that accompanies the process is economic decay 
and a waning of power to some viewers to others it is seen as 
renewal

argentines may have fallen out with 
the english over the falkland islands but the uppercrust still 
likes the way they talk 
that is evident on the quaintly british campus of st georges 
college in quilmes where argentine children are still being sent to 
learn english with the proper accent and prepare to go on to 
cambridge or oxford 
for as much as 7800 a year in tuition the 330 boys and girls 
who attend the only britishstyle boarding school in argentina are 
assured as fine an education as if they lived in england said 
headmaster graham sims 
ninety instructors from britain teach children aged 3 through 18 
the fundamentals as well as computer programming chemistry 
advanced mathematics and english literature 
english at st georges is the most common classroom language 
although argentinas education ministry requires that bilingual 
schools teach some courses in spanish 
the school operates on british discipline 
we are very strict and that means the boys and girls are not 
allowed any physical contact in school holding hands is out 
sims said in an interview weve all got to lead disciplined 
lives if not we become pretty hopeless human beings 
st georges is in quilmes a city of 100000 people 12 miles 
south of buenos aires once a popular residential area for the 
british who earlier this century built most of argentinas 
railways it is most noted now for a brewery and the school 
dotting the 62acre campus are a chapel rugby fields gardens 
two swimming pools a horseriding academy and dormitories where 
students are required to place their folded clothes and towels on 
racks in the bathrooms 
the only inkling this is not britain is when schoolchildren 
break into spanish after class or when argentinas flag is raised 
each morning outside the administration building 
it really is a little piece of britain in argentina said 
ray mckay counselor at the lincoln school in northern buenos 
aires the only american school in argentina the student body is 
almost all argentines from wealthy families who want their kids to 
speak english 
lincoln has 550 students most of them children of us embassy 
personnel diplomats and businessmen in argentina its schedule 
follows the us system with summer vacation from june through 
august the englishstyle and argentine schools have their vacation 
from january to march the southern hemisphere summer 
st georges founded in 1898 is considered one of the four top 
schools in argentina for learning english 
we offer a 24houraday education experience said peter 
stoyle director of studies at st georges wakeup calls are at 
630 am and lights are out across campus by 10 pm which is the 
normal dining hour in argentina 
student magdalena winter 15 hopes someday to become a diplomat 
most people here believe were getting a very good education 
so we learn to put up with things that maybe we dont always 
like she said 
three other top britishstyle schools st andrews st 
catherines and northlands are in the northern suburbs of buenos 
aires but they do not offer boarding 
st andrews is observing the 150th anniversary of its founding 
by scottish settlers with 1900 students st andrews is the 
largest of the britishtradition schools and oldest of the 
bilingual schools in argentina 
one of its headmasters watson hutton was credited with 
introducing soccer to argentina at the turn of the century 
without him thered be no diego maradona said headmaster 
kevan prior referring to the star of argentinas 1986 world cup 
champions 
st andrews has been coed since 1980 
we have a particular ethos particular spirit something the 
parents of argentine upper middleclass children choose prior 
said 
tuition is 1600 to 2400 a year 
northlands school near st andrews is considered the top girls 
school in argentina headmistress jehane taylor takes pains to 
separate her school from anything british 
this is an argentine school with no funds from england that 
happens to teach english she said 
sensitivities over anything british comes from problems 
regarding the britains falkland islands in the south atlantic off 
argentina the argentines have claimed them since 1833 and here 
they are called the malvinas argentina invaded the falklands in 
april 1982 and were driven off by british forces three months later 
during the falklands these britishstyle schools got lots of 
phone treats some of them obscene said mckay of the american 
school some kids were pulled out by their parents and there were 
some classroom tiffs over the socalled imperialist british 
so its really kind of remarkable now that so many argentines 
send their kids to these schools i suppose its kind of the snob 
thing to do 
st catherines school for girls like st georges offers the 
international baccalaurete program for its 1100 students the 
program allows students to enter colleges in the united states at a 
secondyear level or qualify for advanced study in england 
a st catherines coordinator marie philpotts described the 
school as british to a certain extent tuition ranges from 
1050 to 1600 a year compared to 1000 to 2000 a year at 
nortlands 
mrs taylor head of northlands said the tradition of 
argentines sending their children to englishstyle schools goes 
back several generations 
the school founded by a british governess in 1920 gives 985 
students an anglosaxon point of view and a latin point of 
view giving students different ways of looking at knowledge

the ouster by southern baptist officials of a 
scholar for contending that god upholds his compact with judaism 
opens an old wound in christianjewish relations 
it also pointed to a lingering but increasingly repudiated 
attitude in some church quarters 
historical church theories that god revoked his commitment to 
jews replacing it with a pact with christianity figured for 
centuries in antijewish prejudice and persecution 
however many protestant and roman catholic scholars have 
rejected that notion as have some denominations 
if gods covenant has been broken with the jews its 
reasonable that other covenantal relationships might also be 
broken says the rev george j sheridan who was removed from 
his post 
therefore we in the church would be an endangered species 
however sheridan contends that god doesnt go back on his 
promises either to the mother religion judaism or to the 
offspring of it christianity and he cites romans 11 
remember it is not you christians that support the root 
but the root that supports you and so all israel will be saved 
for the gifts and call of god are irrevocable 
sheridan 46 of union city nj was dismissed after 13 years 
of working with jews as regional director of the interfaith witness 
department of the southern baptist home mission board 
my point is that the covenant with the jews was not 
abrogated he said in an interview maintaining that they are 
saved through gods mercy just as are christians but without 
accepting jesus 
christians unlike jews needed jesus to draw them to the one 
same god sheridan said 
a letter notified him he was relieved from his assignment jan 
31 because of his theological position relative to evangelizing 
the jewish people something he opposed as unnecessary 
it also offends jews implying their faith is useless 
sheridans ouster strikes me like the middle ages commented 
rabbi leon klenicki director of the interfaith department of the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith 
in atlanta the mission boards president the rev larry lewis 
said sheridans view wasnt acceptable the board lately came under 
fundamentalist sway as have most of the 146millionmember 
denominations agencies 
lewis said the bible teaches there is no other way to 
salvation except through a personal faith in jesus christ 
sheridan with degrees from southern baptist theological 
seminary in louisville ky and princeton theological seminary in 
princeton nj linked his ouster to the heresy of marcionism 
thats what this thing borders on he said the marcion 
heresy was that the god in jewish scripture the old testament is 
different than the god of the gospels new testament 
marcion a secondcentury preacher whose views were condemned by 
the church rejected the old testament which historic christianity 
accepts along with the new testament 
i believe in jesus christ sheridan said that jesus 
christ is god but for me to believe that the god of jesus christ 
is not the god of jews rooted in their scripture is the heresy of 
two different gods 
sheridan said that after a tense meeting with officials last 
year he wrote a letter at their request outlining his views and 
his dismissal followed in it he said in part 
the scriptures provide a chronicle of how god has taken the 
initiative in concrete historical ways to save gods people 
in the bible the term savior properly is ascribed to 
godin the christian gospel god comes to the world in the person 
of a man jesusin the new testament the title savior is 
applied sometimes to god and sometimes to jesus christ 
emphasizing that he bears the authority of god 
this established that jesus christ is the revelation of god 
who as the hebrew scriptures teach is the one and only savior 
of the people of god to distinguish between the god revealed in 
the hebrew scriptures and the god revealed in jesus christ is for 
christians a heresy 
god saves his people the entire bible asserts this salvation 
is not brought brought about by the goodness of the people but by 
the merciful initiative of god jesus christ provides the way for 
the nations to be engrafted into the people of god 
i find in the entire christian bible no hint that god cancels 
out lovingkindness freely dispensed or promised in fact we find 
the gifts and the call of god are irrevocable 
for this biblical reasoni believe that the jews of today 
as ever receive salvation through their having been chosen by god 
in covenant with abraham moses and the prophets 
the election of the church is prefigured in this election of 
israel and if the election of one is subjection to cancellation 
so too is the election of the other

how do you figure it three movies in a row with the same basic 
plot last year it was dudley moore and kirk cameron changing 
brains in like father like son now we have judge reinhold 
pulling a switch with his young son fred savage in vice 
versa soon to come george burns trading identities with his 
collegeage grandson charlie schlatter in 18 again 
such coincidence is unfortunate since all three movies possess 
the capacity to entertain 
vice versa in fact is a nifty comedy of the supernatural 
variety it benefits from a clever script by dick clement and ian 
lafrenais who also produced lively direction by brian gilbert 
and the inspired teaming of reinhold and young savage as the 
misplaced father and son 
the role reversal is caused by a golden skull stolen from a thai 
temple in like father like son it was a laboratory potion 
in 18 again an auto crash 
reinhold is a chicago department store executive who is a less 
than adequate parttime parent his 11yearold son lives most of 
the time with his mother who is now remarried during a brief 
visit father and son touch the skull and become transformed 
the fun begins though both victims are distressed by their new 
identities reinhold is more interested in rock music and his pet 
frog but he reports to the office and tries to fake his way 
through matters that are as foreign to him as trigonometry 
savage attends school but he is bored by the childish doings 
and finishes his tests in a few minutes he withers the school 
bullies and barks orders to his limo driver he devises a radio 
transmitter so he can guide reinhold through an allimportant sales 
meeting with the store chief william prince 
much of the hilarity is played off reinholds attempts to resist 
the advances of his sexy date corinne bohrer and to explain his 
bizarre behavior to his secretary gloria gifford 
reinhold beverly hills cop with his loony face and 
rubbery body is perfect for this kind of tomfoolery matching him 
all the way is fred savage the princess bride who draws big 
laughs by mouthing his adult dialogue director gilbert and the 
writerproducers have devised a genuinely sweetnatured movie with 
only a few swear words by savage to warrant the pg rating 
from columbia pictures running time 98 minutes

innerspace 8995 vhsbeta rated pg 
 
innerspace is last summers fantasy adventure offering from 
the steven spielberg factory its one claim to distinction is the 
spirited comic presence of martin short 
the movie directed by joe dante takes off from the notion 
first explored in the fantastic voyage 20 years ago that a 
man can be miniaturized and injected into the bloodstream of 
another 
in this case the shrinking man is a daring but drunken test 
pilot played by dennis quaid and the unwitting recipient is a 
walter mittylike supermarket clerk played by short 
the overly complicated plot involves rival scientists and enemy 
agents trying to steal the computer chips that make the 
miniaturization possible since quaids air supply is limited 
short aided by a newspaper reporter played by meg ryan must 
race the clock to retrieve one of the chips needed for 
reenlargement 
some of the hijinks are clever but the frenzied car chases grow 
tiresome the special effects are good but occasionally graphic 
especially one scene in which a villain is dissolved in a pit of 
gastric acid 
short makes a believable and likable character out of jack 
putter who starts the movie on the brink of a nervous breakdown 
but ends up a selfassured hero quaid and miss ryan have less to 
work with and several other capable actors are more or less wasted 
in minor parts including kevin mccarthy fiona lewis and henry 
gibson 
innerspace is harmless enough for helping kids 8 and over 
while away a rainy afternoon adults however may grow weary 
before the caper has run its course

petulia 5995 vhsbeta rated r 
 
what is dr archie bollen doing in a hightech motel with the 
rich lovely and utterly weird petulia darned if he knows 
were about to become lovers she informs him as he tries to 
unhook the feathery jacket to her sparkling gown they dont not 
then anyway 
the scene in the first 30 minutes of richard lesters 
petulia introduces us to the title character played by julie 
christie who has just picked up the recently divorced bollen 
george c scott at a san francisco charity ball while her husband 
richard chamberlain looks on 
bollen declares petulia a kook but she haunts him in more 
ways than one ultimately showing up at his apartment with a stolen 
tuba and broken ribs and crawling into his life but even bollens 
love cant save petulia from herself and a violent marriage 
using flashbacks and flashforwards lester and cinematographer 
nicolas roeg present a stark sometimes funny sometimes 
frightening portrait of love among the spoiled rich during the 
turbulent end of the 1960s on the small home screen in the 1980s 
the movie holds up just fine with some richly textured images and 
closeups that show a beautiful christie a young chamberlain as 
remembered from tvs dr kildare days and a somewhat sexy scott 
there are also a few cameo surprises such as janis joplin with 
big brother and the holding company entertaining at the benefit 
music by the grateful dead also permeates the flick 
petulia with its love triangle and battered wife themes 
easily plays today and like the graduate gives a savage 
portrait of a time not forgotten

savage rca eurythmics 
 
on savage the eurythmics are misanthropic caustic and a 
bit paranoid theyre strong on attitude but weak on delivery 
the record emphasizes a big beat mostly via programmed drums 
and bass lines that make for mechanical music worst is the opening 
cut beethoven i love to listen to add singer annie lennoxs 
dry delivery and the resulting sounds have both the pulse and 
personality of a locomotive 
lost in the thundering shuffle are the lyrics by lennox and dave 
stewart which positively snarl on paper lennox spends much of the 
record telling us that love is cheap and men merit no respect 
love is a temple love is a shrine buy some love at the five and 
dime she sings on the best song you have placed a chill in my 
heart 
oddly lennox and stewart ease up on the syncopation on the last 
two cuts of the record which closes with the upbeat brand new 
day after 11 songs filled with cynicism its hard to believe 
the optimistic message is sincere but maybe it presages more 
subtlety and finesse on their next record

live the road mca the kinks 
 
its bad news when the best thing on an album titled live 
the road is a studio cut but thats the case with the kinks 
latest record 
it opens with a new composition ray davies engaging 
autobiographical the road theres gas in my tank and ive 
still got a ways to go the veteran rocker sings on the rest of 
the album recorded in concert last summer the kinks play with the 
verve of a driver intent on getting good mileage 
there are stirring moments in the 50 minutes of music come 
dancing sparked by dave davies fluid guitar work the 
provocative art lover which only ray davies could have 
written and the rocking destroyer and around the dial 
but it the albums other new song and cliches of the 
world are too long and too ambitious the other performances are 
routine with riffs and tempos that belong in a heavy metal cutout 
bin 
live the road is not a bad set and the kinks deserve 
credit for reprising some of their lesserknown material from the 
1980s at one point they tease the audience with a false start of 
lola but from such a wellrespected band its a 
disappointment

lee chulsoo draws stark pictures of 
exhausted factory workers and peasants clawing the earth with their 
hands because he sees beauty in their suffering 
beauty lies in the ordinary lives and suffering of the common 
people the artist says with a shy smile 
lee is a leader of the growing minjung or grassroots school 
of art that has evolved in south korea in recent years as a 
reaction to decades of authoritarian rule and the impact of 
industrialization 
minjung artists who have attracted a wide following among young 
korean artists advocate using art to fight for democratic reform 
by depicting the hardships of poor workers peasants and slum 
dwellers 
minjung art aims to expose the social evils and injustices in 
society it also participates in the movement of the masses said 
lee a quiet gentle man who often smiles as he explains his ideas 
the bold realistic style of minjung art and its bleak portrayal 
of life are considered shocking in a society where artists 
generally concentrate on landscapes or happy rural scenes 
minjung art is about the suffering of many koreans who work long 
hours for a very meager living and spend their lives in poverty 
lee said it also is about how industrialization has destroyed 
traditional rural values and made life bleak and polluted he said 
lees bold woodcuts and portraits feature haggard men and women 
drained by unrelenting labor and bleak hopeless lives a man claws 
at the stony earth of his fields a woman working at a sewing 
machine in a factory dreams of heaven a begger huddles in front of 
a church 
i want to instill a detailed concrete sense of reality into 
my works he said 
many of lees subjects have disproportionately large hands and 
feet that have become a trademark of his work lee says he doesnt 
know why he makes feet and hands so large 
some critics have denounced the new style as violent and crude 
political propaganda that is not art skepticism over the quality 
of the works by minjung artists lingers on said one critic 
lee rejects charges that his work is crude propaganda he 
defends it as a reaction to decades of oppressive rule and says his 
only goals are democracy and aiding the poor you have to compare 
our works with the violent nature of the political powers that 
be he said 
but lee also rejects the idea that he is a political artist 
saying his work is a repudiation of politics politics oppresses 
humans he said 
lee says his works are inspired by the hope that a fair society 
based on greater equality and compassion can be built he dreams of 
a kinder gentle world and says showing how people suffer can help 
bring change 
im not a radical he said im an optimist 
minjung art is also antiwestern because its followers say that 
western influence has eroded traditional korean values and brought 
industrialization and other dehumanizing influences 
western influence has brought with it decadence lee said 
lee moved to the countryside two years ago because of concern 
that industrialization was destroying traditional rural values his 
work often features a rural life he fears is slipping away 
some of lees works were recently displayed at a seoul gallery 
a steady flow of visitors viewed the lines of stark woodcuts 
displayed on whitewashed walls in the grimy basement gallery 
lee admitted the show was a sign of political liberalization and 
of how artists are allowed freedom the government of president roh 
taewoo which took office in february has promised to end 
authoritarian rule and allow complete freedom of expression 
lee makes a living as a book illustrator and spends much of his 
time working to develop minjung art he says he wants to develop 
the quality of the art and establish it alongside other artistic 
schools 
we are striving to give better forms and flesh to our ideas 
he said

in the past decade george thorogood has gone 
from playing holeinthewall saloons to headlining stadiums but 
the whiskeyvoiced rocker figures his career holds a few more 
roadhouse bars before he hits the retirement home 
i cant wait until i become a hasbeen a hasbeen that never 
was actually he said with a cackle i cant wait till that 
happens because i know i can make a living playing bars and have 
a lot of fun a great time 
which is he says what his band the destroyers are having now 
on their national tour although thorogood makes no bones about 
saying theyd rather play stubbs barbecue a small texas blues 
bar than madison square garden 
we started out and still are a bar band said thorogood 
whose career has kept alive the sound of muddy waters howlin wolf 
and other blues legends its just that the bars are a little 
bigger these days 
thorogood and company are to blame for that since 1977 theyve 
cranked out a series of successful albums and singles starting 
with a remake of hank williams who do you love on their debut 
album and stretching to the current lp born to be bad 
despite his success thorogood has not catered to top 40 radio 
studiously avoided studio tricks and stayed about as far from the 
mainstream as any contemporary band can 
even if i tried im not going to be able to get out of this 
style of playing thorogood said during a manhattan stop in the 
tour there might be a different hook here or there but 
basically its going to be your two threechord rock or your 
slow toughguy blues 
i dont want to change that and i couldnt if i wanted o 
because i have tried i have sat down and tried to play other 
styles of stuff and it was a disaster 
with that in mind thorogood and band included some classic 
covers on the new album elmore james shake your money maker 
chuck berrys you cant catch me and hank snows im movin 
on 
thorogood also wrote several songs in the same vein for born 
to be bad songs which he stressed carry no deeper message 
than lets all have a good time 
i figure im not operating on anybodys skull here its not 
brain surgery man said thorogood its just two chords and 
people are supposed to dance to it and laugh at it and two hours 
later forget about it thats what entertainment is 
thorogood was introduced to the blues scene in his native 
delaware an area he quickly admits was no rootsrock hotbed 
i was so foolish staying in the philadelphia area because 
its not a blues area he said if i had my wits about me i 
would have gone to san francisco or chicago where people know this 
sound their whole lives 
but no matter where he he grew up thorogood believes it was 
inevitable hed end up listening to muddy waters and chuck berry 
i think the things youre supposed to hear in your life will 
come to you you dont go finding them they come to you he 
said so it just came to me a little later 
once thorogood heard the music he began taking it to audiences 
with the zeal of a bible belt preacher delivering the good word 
the band is constantly on the road in 1981 they went on a 
5050 tour in which they played in all 50 states on 50 
consecutive dates 
and while they have moved up from bars to arenas thorogood 
figures that sooner or later hell be back on the roadhouse circuit 
playing for barroom crowds enjoying his golden years with a cold 
beer and some hot licks 
i always thought wow wouldnt it be great if i did bad to 
the bone and i was 60 and i had on a gut on me like jackie 
gleason and i walked out there with a tshirt that said something 
like sex machine

scholars entering yale universitys 3 
millionvolume sterling memorial library are discovering theres 
definitely more to a book than its cover 
the librarys eccentric books exhibit includes works 
containing a rotting tortilla encased in plastic a miniature 
standup portrait of humphrey bogart and a threedimensional 
illustration of sperm fertilizing an egg 
these are morethanabook books says gay walker the 
librarys arts of the book department curator who put together the 
exhibit 
the more than 110 books in the exhibit have flaps foldouts 
revolving wheels unusual shapes cutouts or objects such as a pair 
of 3d glasses although childrens books are represented most of 
the volumes are aimed toward adult readers 
walker says the earliest known example of an eccentric book is 
johannes muellers 1474 kalendar also known as 
regiomontanus the text contains two cutout movable discs tied 
onto a diagram that shows the movements of the moon 
the yale exhibit has a fascimile of the book printed in 1937 as 
well as several original copies of 16thcentury books with 
revolving diagrams by petrus apianus the royal astronomer for 
charles v 
another early innovation was the flap cutout paper pasted onto 
a book page that either added to an illustration or revealed one 
when lifted up 
euclids elements of geometry translated into english by h 
billingsley and printed in london in 1570 was the oldest example 
of a flapped book identified by walker it contains several 
illustrations of geometrical figures that use flaps to illustrate 
the solid figure she says 
anatomy books also made early use of flaps revealing various 
layers of the body by as early as 1573 walker writes in a catalog 
of the exhibition among them was george spratts 1833 obstetric 
tables which had several printings fifteen of its lithographed 
plates contain a total of 50 flaps with explicit illustrations 
there are books with eccentricities in other fields besides the 
sciences in the exhibit are childrens books with all kinds of 
innovations including one that folds out into a fiveroom 
miniature house landscape books humor books art books and many 
more 
pulltabs depress a computer key in one book and cause a robots 
pants to fall down in another in the great movies live by 
maxim jakubowski and ron van der meer paper versions of screen 
stars in famous scenes from flicks ranging from casablanca to 
king kong literally stand up from the pages 
in 100 million million poems by raymond queneau 14 lines of 
poetry cut from 10 pages but still attached to the binding can be 
combined into almost limitless poetic possibilities 
jonathon millers and david pelhams the facts of life 
published in 1984 uses tabs wheels flaps and moving and 
stationary popups in its illustrations including one in blue and 
gray showing the fertilization of a human egg 
included in a category that walker labels artists book are 
wesleyan university artist and english professor joseph reeds two 
books made out of candy boxes one is a whitman sampler box that 
contains a mostly visual essay on walt whitman 
the other the book of eights has the eight dwarfs a new 
addition being stuffy the eight deadly sins the eighth being 
boringness and the eight wonders of the modern world which 
include trump tower in new york and graceland the late elvis 
presleys home in memphis tenn 
a 1977 volume of eye a yale art magazine contains the 
plasticencased tortilla 
eccentric books published today are especially popular in the 
childrens fields says walker popup books popular in the 
victorian age have been revived by waldo h hunt a los angeles 
publisher who manufactures them in colombia she says 
walker says the idea for the exhibition started when she was 
invited to give a talk on any subject she chose which ended up 
being eccentric books 
the librarian found that very little research had been done in 
the area she devised the categories such as flap and popup to 
which she assigned the books 
walker also designed the exhibits catalog which contains two 
popups and a serrated edge she produced the catalog on a home 
computer had its cover printed professionally and bound the 
61page work by hand at night in her home 
the exhibit is open through april 15

fiddler vassar clements has played 
country music jazz rock n roll and classical for groups as 
diverse as the grateful dead and the boston pops 
and for the past two decades hes recorded in the top studios 
with his instrument its been a romance of sound separated only by 
the styles he performs 
when the rhythm is good i can play it clements says 
the 59yearold artist has just released an album with the 
intriguing title new hillbilly jazz the name signifies a sound 
as versatile as the man who plays it 
its heavy rhythm solid dynamic he said in his soft 
southern voice that contrasts the exuberance of his playing but 
its not fidgety music its smooth danceable 
this marks his 20th year in nashville where hes added luster to 
the citys country style after relocating from kissimmee fla 
people ask me what kind of music im playing and i say i 
dont know he said its just happy moving music 
along the way he played with rock veterans the grateful dead on 
their wake of the flood album and toured with them when they 
were known as old and in the way 
it was a departure from the country music he grew up playing 
when he and his cousins formed a band 
it was a challenge and i loved that he recalled about his 
days with the dead its exciting to take a chance 
he also played with the boston pops joining his close friend 
john hartford when hartford was a guest artist in a pops concert 
in addition he recorded with the monkees that was by 
coincidence he was working on a recording session when someone 
asked him if he wanted to stay and play on another one 
i didnt know until later it was the monkees he said 
hes had no problem adjusting to the various styles even on 
short notice such as the monkees session you just go in and do 
it after so many years no tunes change much ive never had a 
problem with that 
clements taught himself to play at age 7 and has no formal 
training the first song he learned was theres an old spinning 
wheel in the parlor 
it took forever he said 
it was gods gift something born in me he said about his 
talent i was too dumb to learn it any other way i listened to 
the grand ole opry some id pick it up one note at a time i was 
young with plenty of time and i didnt give up youd come home 
from school do your lessons and thats it no other distractions 
i dont read music i play what i hear 
but he understands how helpful it is for youngsters to be 
grounded in classical music and formal training it should help 
them clements said 
he was employed at the kennedy space center in florida for a 
year in the mid1960s working on plumbing at various times he 
also worked in a georgia paper mill was a switchman for atlantic 
coast railroad sold insurance and had a potato chip franchise 
but music was always part of his life 
id always play square dances anything he said 
all the performing carried him to nashville where one of his 
first breaks was being featured on the album will the circle be 
unbroken by the nitty gritty dirt band 
he then became heavily in demand for recording sessions of all 
types this year he was nominated for a grammy award with french 
jazz violinist stephane grappelli for their together at last 
it was a truly great time he said about working with 
grappelli it was a challenge but it came easy we felt alike on 
a lot of things 
clements wont say that hes getting better at playing but 
prefers to say that it just comes easier 
if i quit improving id have to quit it would be work and 
thered be no sense staying in a rut and not learning anything id 
hate to play the same way all the time it would become 
mechanical 
clements who owns three fiddles and still practices some has 
no favorite song when things go right i enjoy playing all of 
them anything that comes up 
similarly he doesnt mind if his instrument is called a fiddle 
or a violin 
i say fiddle but if someone says violin it doesnt matter

roper corp which resisted general electric 
cos previous moves to snatch it from whirlpool corp says it 
will study ges latest sweetened 507 million buyout offer 
the giant appliance makers new offer for roper came on monday 
just hours after ge filed suit challenging ropers agreement to 
merge with whirlpool in a 470 million deal 
ge on monday increased its tender offer for ropers outstanding 
shares by 9 to 54 a share topping whirlpools 50ashare offer 
in a bidding war that according to some analysts may have run its 
course 
the prices are pretty generous to what we on wall street would 
call the intrinsic value of roper said cornelius sewell an 
analyst with argus research corp 
roper rose 250 a share to close at 5550 in composite new 
york stock exchange trading adding to fridays 575 a share runup 
in a statement issued after the stock market closed roper said 
it was reviewing ges new tender offer and planned a board meeting 
later in the week to determine the companys position on the 
sweetened bid 
whirlpool began the legal battle last week suing ge on the 
grounds the fairfield connbased conglomerate tried to 
sabotage a whirlpoolroper merger with a competing bid 
ge said roper rebuffed a merger proposal last november and 
contended the roper board authorized a 3750ashare merger with 
whirlpool after whirlpool threatened to mount a hostile takeover 
bid according to delaware state court documents 
ge which on march 6 made its initial 45ashare offer alleged 
roper failed to test the price before agreeing to merge with 
whirlpool ge also contended roper concealed ges interest in the 
company when it advised shareholders to tender their stock to 
whirlpool 
roper also gave benton harbor michbased whirlpool a socalled 
lockup option to purchase 16 million newly issued shares for 
3750 each if their deal fell through which would make any 
subsequent roper acquisition more expensive ge is seeking to block 
the issue and transfer of those shares 
in a separate suit filed in us district court in delaware ge 
claimed both whirlpool and roper failed to adequately disclose 
terms of their merger agreement under securities and exchange 
commission laws and neglected to mention ges interest in roper 
whirlpool alleged in its suit last week that a ge executive 
tried to persuade roper to break its contract with whirlpool the 
suit said ge intentionally maliciously and unjustifiedly engaged 
in a continuing course of conduct to sabotage the deal 
part of whirlpools lawsuit seeks 117 million in damages or 
the difference between its 50ashare offer and original offer 
ge vowed to vigorously defend itself against the charges and 
is seeking to transfer the suit from us district court in grand 
rapids mich to federal court in delaware 
roper headquartered in augusta ga last week endorsed 
whirlpools sweetened bid robert cook ropers president and chief 
executive officer said then that the company has a strong desire 
to see this combination successfully completed although he had 
no further comment when contacted monday 
david whitwam whirlpools president and chief executive stated 
monday that his company remains committed to pursuing its attempts 
to block ge and acquire roper 
analysts say a roperwhirlpool merger would move whirlpool ahead 
of ge as the nations leading appliance maker for ge acquiring 
the appliance and lawn equipment maker would enhance its supplier 
relationship with sears roebuck amp co and give it a valuable share 
of the gas stove market 
analysts estimate that roughly twothirds of ropers sales come 
from its agreement to supply sears with its kitchen appliance and 
lawn equipment products 
ges bid stems from its decision last year to expand its market 
share by selling gas stoves rather than manufacture the gas 
stoves ge now purchases them from four companies including roper

still smarting from a major courtroom defeat 
last week campeau corp says it is working on other options in its 
battle to acquire federated department stores inc 
campeau got another legal setback on monday and faces further 
courtroom entanglements over its attempt to acquire federated 
which has accepted a rival offer from rh macy amp co inc 
a federal judge on monday rebuffed campeaus proposal to extend 
its 618 billion tender offer so it would expire simultaneously 
with macys offer if he removed federateds poison pill 
takeover defense 
judge leonard sand in a closeddoor session said the poison 
pill would remain in place at least until federated makes a final 
recommendation to its shareholders said campeau spokeswoman nancy 
raeside 
in a key ruling on friday the judge had denied campeaus 
request to block the use of federateds poison pill which campeau 
says will prevent it from completing any takeover of federated 
the defense makes a takeover prohibitively expensive by allowing 
federated shareholders to buy more of the companys stock at a 
steep discount 
margaret nicolaides a campeau spokeswoman said the 
torontobased developer was definitely working on other 
options she said she could not elaborate on what those options 
were 
however there were reports that campeau was considering 
sweetening its bid or proposing a friendly merger neither tactic 
has met with success in the past during the companys monthslong 
quest for federated 
in another matter judge sand scheduled a wednesday hearing over 
a macy complaint that campeau made false statements in fullpage 
advertisements in thursday editions of the new york times and wall 
street journal 
separately macy announced that the waiting period during which 
the federal government could ask for information about the possible 
antitrust implications of a macyfederated merger had expired with 
no further requests a request would extend the waiting period 
automatically 
the retailer also confirmed it had agreed to sell 11 of 
federateds 14 abraham amp straus stores if it wins the takeover 
fight the agreement reached with new york state attorney general 
robert abrams over the weekend calls for macy to divest new 
yorkarea aamps stores because they are in direct competition with 
macy branches 
in georgia where macy stores would compete with federateds 
richs chain attorney general michael bowers said the state will 
not oppose a macyfederated combination but analysts speculate 
that macy might sell the richs stores anyway 
macy is conducting a 63 billion tender offer for federated 
under an agreement with federated management 
macy is offering 7735 a share in cash for 7043 million 
federated shares for a total of 54 billion macy would exchange 
shares in the merged company macysfederated inc and issue 
convertible debt securities for the remainder of federateds 895 
million outstanding shares analysts have estimated the total value 
of the offer at 63 billion 
federated stock rose 62 cents to 6687 in new york stock 
exchange composite trading monday 
campeaus bid is a twostep allcash package that would be 
worth 68 a share or 618 billion it is offering 75 each for 
705 million federated shares and proposes to acquire the 
remaining stock for 44 cash per share in a subsequent merger 
macys offer expires at midnight est april 4 the campeau offer 
must remain open at least until midnight friday pending a 
securities and exchange commission ruling on whether campeau must 
submit documents on its financing for the takeover

the union trying to prevent eastern airlines 
from selling its lucrative east coast air shuttle says it is happy 
with penalties a federal judge has levied on the carrier but the 
company says it plans to appeal the sanctions 
us district judge john h pratt on monday said he would fine 
eastern 10000 per day if the airline commits any future 
violations of a court order that had blocked the shuttle deal 
pratt also ordered eastern to halt all efforts to get government 
permission to go through with the sale and he said the airlines 
top officials would have to write to all 32000 eastern employees 
informing them that the carrier had flouted an earlier court order 
and promising that no further violations would occur 
he imposed most of the sanctions we asked for edgar n 
james a lawyer for the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers said there werent any surprises but its 
pretty strong 
but company officials insisted their court fight was not over 
eastern continues to believe strongly that we have not 
violated any court orders the company said in a written 
statement read by spokeswoman karen ceremsak from the airlines 
headquarters in miami 
john j gallagher easterns attorney said the airline would go 
to court today to appeal the penalty and the original finding of 
contempt 
pratt found eastern in contempt on march 10 for violating an 
order he had issued july 2 that order had forbidden the company 
from changing working conditions of the 12000 mechanics and other 
ground workers represented by the machinists 
eastern owned by texas air corp announced feb 5 that it 
would sell its shuttle to a newly created texas air subsidiary for 
225 million the shuttle flies between washington new york and 
boston 
frank lorenzo chief executive of texas air and eastern has 
argued that financially ailing eastern needed the cash but union 
leaders have insisted the move was aimed at stripping labor of 
power at the carrier by transferring thousands of workers to 
another corporate entity within texas air 
the machinists union had asked pratt to force a court 
appearance by lorenzo to discuss the shuttle deal but in his 
ruling monday pratt said lorenzo could send another corporate 
representative 
the union had also asked pratt to fine eastern 20000 daily for 
future violations of the judges orders the judge instead ruled 
the airline would face 10000aday fines for violations committed 
after april 5 
pratt did not grant a union request that the airline restore the 
jobs of all eastern employees who quit because of the announcement 
that the shuttle would be sold 
in 1986 texas air also the corporate parent of continental 
airlines took over eastern a large carrier that lost 182 million 
last year 
since that time lorenzo has sought wage concessions from unions 
and has tried selling several of easterns most profitable assets 
to other texas air subsidiaries that he also controls unions 
representing eastern employees have waged wellpublicized fights to 
thwart him

investor howard kaskel who says his plans to 
boost shareholder values have been rebufffed repeatedly by kansas 
city southern industries inc is moving to take over the company 
an investment group led by kaskel said monday it was offering 
60 cash a share or about 594 million for the 89 percent of the 
railroad concerns common stock that it does not already own 
the new york investor in a letter to the companys management 
also indicated he would attempt to place his own slate of directors 
on the kansas city southern board if it rejected or failed to act 
on the buyout offer by april 4 
kansas city southern which also has interests in financial 
services said its board would consider the allcash proposal soon 
at a special meeting 
the company has nearly 111 million shares outstanding and the 
kaskel group claims it controls about 12 million shares 
in new york stock exchange trading kansas city southern jumped 
875 a share to 55 on monday 
kaskel outlined the merger proposal in a letter to landon h 
rowland president and chief executive of kansas city southern and 
requested an opportunity to negotiate all aspects of the offer 
including price 
he said completing the proposal was subject to reaching a 
definitive agreement approval by the requisite number of directors 
and stockholders and satisfaction of all regulatory requirements 
kaskel said he had made various proposals to company management 
over the past eight months on ways to maximize shareholder values 
unfortunately you have rejected each of my suggestions 
kaskel wrote 
in addition he said he found it dismaying that the board 
erected obstacles designed to entrench itself and to prevent 
stockholders from realizing a full return on their investment 
among these steps kaskel cited the recent issuance of about 14 
million shares or almost 15 percent of the companys 
thenoutstanding common stock to employee stock ownership plans at 
49 a share 
this could only have been motivated by the boards desire to 
place substantial voting power in its hands as a means of 
opposing proposals that may be brought before its shareholders 
the letter read 
kaskel also cited kansas city southerns continued efforts to 
acquire the southern pacific railroad despite southern pacifics 
binding agreement for its sale to the denver rio grande 
other than rowlands announcement that the board of directors 
would consider the offer at a special meeting kansas city southern 
indicated it had no further comment until the board had an 
opportunity to study the offer

orders to us factories for big ticket durable goods 
continued to fall sharply in february the government reported 
today 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last at least three years totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1114 billion last month a 18 percent decline which was 
identical to the drop in january 
it was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable 
goods orders had been down for two consecutive months 
the backtoback drops surprised analysts who had been 
predicting that orders would turn up again in february following a 
january decline which was blamed on volatility in the aircraft 
sector 
separately the treasury department said monday the federal 
government ran a 239 billion budget deficit in february 
following a rare surplus the previous month 
the 161 billion january surplus occurred because that months 
social security checks were mailed early and counted in the 
december spending figures 
for the first five months of the current budget year the 
government has run up a deficit of 897 billion 49 percent lower 
than the deficit incurred in the same period a year ago according 
to treasury calculations 
on wall street analysts blamed inflation fears and lingering 
postcrash anxiety for the broad decline in stock prices 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell sharply at the 
opening and remaining lower throughout the session closing down 
2023 points at 206714 broader market indices also fell 
on the bond market analysts said prices slipped and interest 
rates edged up in light trading that reflected continued 
uncertainty about the outlook for inflation and the economy 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond fell point or 
about 250 for every 1000 in face value as its yield rose to 
870 percent from 867 percent late friday 
foreign exchange trading also was quiet with the dollar 
responding to declines in stocks and bonds by dropping against all 
major currencies except the canadian dollar 
oil futures prices rallied with crude piercing the 17abarrel 
level before sliding back in late trading following a statement by 
saudi king fahd on prices and production 
fahd suggested that cheating on production quotas and prices by 
some members of the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting 
countries encouraged further weakness in prices 
that punctured the rally on the new york mercantile exchange 
where contracts for april delivery of west texas intemediate the 
benchmark us crude oil closed at 1649 per barrel down 9 cents 
from friday the april contract had been up as much as 45 cents 
during the day

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods fell again sharply in february the government said 
today in a report that surprised analysts who had been looking for 
a rebound 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years totaled a seasonally adjusted 
1114 billion last month a 18 percent decline which was 
identical to the drop in january 
it was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable 
goods orders had been down for two consecutive months the 
backtoback declines were the largest since a 23 percent plunge 
last august 
the two drops surprised analysts who had been predicting that 
orders would turn up again in february following a january decline 
which was blamed on volatility in the aircraft sector 
the weakness provides evidence that the economy slowed during 
the early part of 1988 as businesses cut back on orders in an 
effort to get control of bulging inventories 
the economy is weak it hasnt fully recovered from the stock 
market fallout said michael evans head of a washington 
forecasting firm 
but evans who earlier had been forecasting a recession said he 
now believes the country will be able to muddle through without a 
downturn during this presidential election year 
he said he was expecting overall economic growth as measured by 
the gross national production to average around 18 percent in the 
first three months of the year down from gnp growth of 45 in the 
fourth quarter 
the weakness last month was widespread with only the 
transportation sector showing any strength orders for cars trucks 
and aircraft showed a 35 percent gain to 293 billion following a 
9 percent drop in january 
orders in the volatile defense category fell 79 percent to 78 
billion without this decline total orders would have fallen a 
slightly smaller 13 percent 
the key category of nondefense capital goods considered a good 
indicator of industry investment plans fell 59 percent last 
month this sector is expected to provide much of the strength for 
the economy this year as businesses step up investment spending to 
meet growing export demand 
orders for electrical machinery fell 73 percent while orders in 
the nonelectrical machinery sector were down 88 percent the 
biggest drop for any sector 
orders for primary metals such as steel dropped 02 percent 
following a 144 percent plunge in january 
shipments of durable goods dipped 01 percent in february to 
1088 billion as a large decline in machinery shipments was 
partially offset by an increase in transportation

a trades union congress committee belatedly voted 
tuesday to back a singleunion deal at an electronic components 
plant that ford motor co has scrapped 
ford decided against opening the 73 million plant in dundee 
scotland after it was unable to win a singleunion agreement and 
the automaker said tuesday that despite the committees vote its 
decision was irrevocable 
ford had reached an agreement with the amalgamated engineering 
union to represent the expected 450 workers at the plant but other 
unions representing workers at 21 ford plants in britain balked at 
the plan 
fords decision caused an uproar in britain where unions have 
been squabbling among themselves about how best to counter the 
erosion of their power under conservative prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
the unions are particularly divided about whether to accept 
singleunion and nostrike deals which have become more common in 
britain in recent years 
on tuesday members of the finance and general purposes 
committee of the trades union congress britains large umbrella 
labor organization voted 11 to 10 to back the singleunion deal 
the decision goes to the tucs general council on wednesday for 
ratification 
gavin laird general secretary of the engineering union said he 
would fly to detroit to ask ford executives to reverse their 
decision after the ratification 
but britains and fords biggest union the transport and 
workers general union held out against a single union agreement 
ford blamed the failure of the unions to reach agreement for its 
decision to cancel the deal 
in detroit tuesday ford spokesman john emmert said the company 
still considered its decision as final 
we certainly intended it to be irrevocable and i dont have 
anything in mind which would suggest that it isnt emmert said 
in a british broadcasting corp television interview

merv griffin today boosted his bid to acquire 
resorts international inc to 295 million while also waging a 
court fight to help him win control of the hotelcasino company 
griffin co the entertainerbusinessmans private investment 
company said in a statement today that it decided to increase its 
initial bid of 225 million or 35ashare after reviewing 
appraisals regarding the value of resorts 
based on 643 million class a and class b shares outstanding 
griffins latest bid for both classes of stock is valued at about 
46 a share 
separately griffin said monday it filed a 500 million federal 
lawsuit in new york against real estate developer donald trump and 
resorts directors claiming breach of fiduciary duty to 
shareholders among other things 
trump who has voting control of resorts and is the companys 
chairman sued griffin last week accusing the entertainer of 
interfering with trumps contractual agreement to acquire complete 
control over resorts 
since making its initial offer thursday the griffin co has 
indicated it may raise the price if justified by nonpublic 
information from resorts a hotelcasino concern with operations in 
atlantic city nj and the bahamas griffin said trump made that 
information available late last week 
trump who is making his own 22pershare bid for the resorts 
stock he doesnt already own said he wont boost his offer and has 
maintained that he will not sell his shares to griffin 
resorts board said it decided not to pursue griffins initial 
bid because in light of trumps rejection the issue was moot 
griffin said in a statement today that he would not approve any 
deal between resorts and trump unless class a shareholders 
receive a premium over my prior 35ashare offer 
the nonpublic documents were contained in a securities and 
exchange commission filing trump made on friday to supplement his 
tender offer for resorts 
trumps tender offer which had been scheduled to expire monday 
was extended until 1201 am est on april 1 
griffins president michael nigris said the documents included 
a 13 billion appraisal of resorts properties including a 
whencompleted value for its luxurious but troubled taj mahal 
hotelcasino in atlantic city 
the appraiser further said it was prepared to support a bank 
mortgage loan of 550 million guaranteed by resorts nigris said 
based on those numbers we may be able to sweeten our 225 
million bid nigris said monday 
the 550 million mortgage is the amount trump has said will be 
needed to complete the taj mahal when resorts began work on the 
project in 1984 it estimated the total price at 535 million that 
figure has since soared to 9385 million based on trumps 
estimates 
trump became involved with resorts last year when the company 
ran into financial difficulties with the proposed 42floor 
1250room taj mahal he bought up most of resorts class b common 
stock which carries 100 votes per share thus giving him 88 
percent voting control 
he also pledged to help arrange financing for the costly taj 
mahal project and in exchange was granted a fiveyear operating 
contract for resorts properties valued at about 100 million 
resorts has 752000 class b shares it has 57 million class a 
shares that carry one vote each

in this corner affable courtly and somewhat 
portly mervyn edward griffin the singer and talk show host who in 
recent years has emerged as a wily and successful businessman 
and in the far corner brash new york real estate developer 
donald j trump best known for building designerlabel 
skyscrapers owning casinos and having more than a modest dose of 
braggadocio 
late last week griffin and trump squared off over control of 
resorts international inc the new jerseybased hotelcasino 
concern that trump has been offering to acquire for 22 per share 
or about to acquire griffin last week offered 35 per share or 
225 million for the atlantic citybased company which also has 
operations in the bahamas 
the battle escalated today when griffin increased his bid to 
295 million which values both class a and class b resorts shares 
at about 46 each 
both contestants among americas wealthiest men trump is listed 
by forbes magazine as worth at least 850 million and personally 
claims 3 billion in wealth forbes lists griffin as worth 300 
million 
for 23 years griffin served as host of the popular merv 
griffin show one of tvs longestrunning series winning 10 emmy 
awards in the process 
in 1986 he sold privatelyheld merv griffin enterprises 
producer of the merv griffin show and two of his other 
successful creations wheel of fortune and jeopardy to 
cocacola co for a reported 250 million but he remains chairman 
of the company and there is speculation he may take over as host 
of wheel of fortune when host pat sajak leaves to do his own 
show 
unlike many entertainers who squander their money through bad 
investments and mismanagement the 63yearold griffin has earned a 
reputation in hollywood as a shrewd businessman 
he has parlayed his entertainment fortune into a business empire 
that includes radio stations a major closedcircuit television 
operation widely used at racetracks and extensive real estate 
holdings in beverly hills and northern california 
griffin whose hobbies are music tennis and good food lives 
stylishly but not ostentatiously in a 10000squarefoot beverly 
hills mansion near the homes of mca inc chairman lew wasserman and 
investor marvin davis 
by contrast the 42yearold trump who in a decade transformed 
himself from a local landlord into a national real estate mogul 
has worked hard to make his name synonymous with ostentation 
he routinely travels in one of his fleet of five helicopters 
when william bricker was ousted as chief executive of dallasbased 
diamond shamrock corp amid criticism over his imperial lifestyle 
trump purchased his luxurious boeing 727 private jet 
his primary home is a 10 million triplex penthouse atop his 
glitzy trump tower in midtown manhattan for relaxation he 
retreats to his 118room mansion in west palm beach fla or his 
15bedroom georgian manor in greenwich conn 
i cant afford for things not to be the best trump has 
said contending the glamour attached to his name and the 
buildings that bear his name allows him to attract prices of 
1700 per square foot for some of his new york condos 
with a massive war chest to spend trump was attracted by the 
lure of profits in takeover speculation in the past year he 
bought stakes in allegis corp holiday corp and bally mfg co 
and raked in about 122 million in profits when he later sold the 
stock to the company or rival suitors 
earlier this year trump said he was considering buying up to 
249 percent of entertainment conglomerate mca the parent of 
universal studios which is frequently mentioned as a takeover 
target but nothing has come of it 
likewise nothing has come of his indications in january that he 
might buy up to 15 percent of federated department stores inc 
which later became the takeover target of campeau corp 
but when griffin decided to battle trump for resorts the fight 
generally was expected to be short and victorious for trump 
griffin is offering more money but trump holds 88 percent of 
resorts voting power through his ownership of nearly all of its 
class b common stock which carries 100 votes per share 
trump has insisted he will oppose griffins proposal and for 
that reason resorts board decided it was moot to pursue the issue 
with the entertainer 
but griffin has persisted on monday he slapped trump and 
resorts directors with a 500 million lawsuit accusing them 
among other things of breach of fiduciary duty 
that action came after trump on friday filed a 250 million suit 
against griffin and his allies claiming fraud stock market 
manipulation and interference with trumps contractual arrangements 
with resorts 
meanwhile some holders of resorts 57 million class a shares 
who had earlier indicated they would support trumps 22pershare 
offer now are having second thoughts their lawyers say

a unanimous supreme court today ruled that 
states are barred from regulating the way interstate natural gas 
companies issue securities to finance their operations 
the court ruling in a dispute between the michigan public 
service commission and a detroitbased pipeline said the federal 
energy regulatory commission has sole authority to regulate such 
financing 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said the state 
authority sought by the michigan agency is preempted by the 
federal natural gas act of 1938 
a federal appeals court previously had ruled against the 
michigan authorities 
michigan law required pipeline companies to get advance approval 
from the state public service commission before issuing securities 
the law was passed to assure that the securities were being 
issued for a legal purpose one related to the more efficient 
delivery of natural gas 
the regulatory law was challenged in 1984 by american natural 
resources which operates a pipeline system carrying natural gas to 
distribution customers in michigan illinois indiana iowa 
kansas missouri ohio tennessee and wisconsin 
according to court documents the anr has plans to issue 150 
million in securities to help finance projects costing about 560 
million

stocks turned mixed today strengthened by 
higher bond prices and takeoverrelated buying but restrained by 
investor reluctance to participate in a market still suffering 
postcrash uncertainty 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 116 points to 
206830 by 11 am on wall street 
among broader market indicators the new york stock exchanges 
composite index of all listed issues rose 010 to 15157 the 
american stock exchanges market value index rose 020 to 29838 
gaining issues barely outnumbered losers on the nyse with 613 
up 558 down and 527 unchanged volume totaled 455 million shares 
after 90 minutes 
rising prices in the bond market injected some optimism on wall 
street because they dampened anxiety over inflation and higher 
interest rates bonds were buoyed by lower oil prices and a 
government report that showed a surprising drop in factory orders 
for durable goods in february 
some stocks also were boosted by rumored and actual takeovers 
reflecting a stunning increase in merger activity over the past 
several weeks 
nevertheless stockbrokers said the relatively low volume of 
trading and the lack of any significant economic signals showed 
that many investors remain reluctant to reenter the market in the 
aftermath of the october crash

ah robins co says it will submit another 
amended reorganization plan as the result of a court hearing on the 
adequacy of the companys disclosure statement 
us district judge robert r merhige jr and us bankruptcy 
judge blackwell n shelley conducted the hearing monday listening 
to a series of objections to the disclosure statement 
the document is the basis by which women with dalkon shield 
injury claims and other creditors of robins will decide how to vote 
on the companys reorganization plan 
robins spokesman roscoe e puckett jr said monday evening that 
as a result of the hearing the company will submit a sixth 
amended and restated plan of reorganization incorporating certain 
changes mostly in the wording of the statement the new plan 
will be filed in bankruptcy court by march 28 he said 
merhige set an april 25 deadline for mailing the plan of 
reorganization to dalkon shield claimants and the companys other 
creditors for a vote the votes must be received by july 11 and a 
confirmation hearing will be july 18 puckett said 
merhige also said he hoped to choose by april 11 the five 
trustees who will administer the nearly 25 billion compensation 
fund for dalkon shield victims 
the us supreme court in a related action monday let stand a 
ruling against a 15 million emergency fund to help women who 
became infertile from using the intrauterine device which robins 
sold in the early 1970s the supreme court also refused to review a 
ruling that placed on hold several lawsuits against the insurer of 
the iud 
robins has been in chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings since 
august 1985 the richmondbased maker of pharmaceuticals sought 
court protection from creditors as lawsuits mounted against the 
birth control device 
joseph f mcdowell iii a manchester nh attorney for 35 
users of the iud told merhige and shelley the disclosure statement 
should not go out because it appeared to give a discharge from 
liability to not only robins but to its insurer corporate 
directors and members of the robins family 
attorneys for robins and the aetna casualty amp surety co that 
insured the dalkon shield said claimants voting to ratify the 
reorganization plan are not prevented from subsequently going to 
court mcdowells objection was overruled 
an attorney for the internal revenue service challenged an 
arrangement for robins to repay the federal tax agencys priority 
claim over a sixyear period 
were being asked to make a 62 million unsecured loan at 
prime interest said stuart gibson an irs tax lawyer 
merhige however overruled the objection its your own 
fault the judge told gibson i asked you to settle it and 
you couldnt do it 
in washington the supreme court upheld the 4th us circuit 
court of appeals decision to reject the 15 million emergency 
fund which merhige had approved as a means of helping women still 
of childbearing age to regain fertility through special surgery 
the emergency fund was challenged by robins stockholders as 
giving preferential treatment to a select group of claims while the 
final reorganization was pending 
the high courts decision not to review the stay of lawsuits 
against aetna upheld merhige and the 4th circuit the appeals court 
said the suits brought by women in kansas and new hampshire 
inevitably would pull in robins and thus would detract from the 
ongoing bankruptcy proceedings

once again detroit is asking itself whether the 
neon glare of a colony of gambling casinos can attract cash and 
jobs to a city short on both 
voters in the nations sixthlargest city rejected casino 
gambling in 1976 and 1981 by margins of 3to2 in advisory votes 
this time a battalion of civic leaders is studying the issue at 
the behest of mayor coleman a young amid criticism from local 
pulpits and unfavorable results of a recent poll 
a 67member commission will issue a report on the casino 
questions by midmay even a favorable recommendation would have to 
be followed by another citywide referendum and approval by the 
michigan legislature and gov james blanchard 
following youngs lead most members of the detroit casino 
gaming commission have taken a carefully noncommittal public stance 
on the issue 
i dont know if casino gambling is good for detroit said 
cochairman samuel gardner former chief judge of detroit 
recorders court i never really sat down and concentrated on it 
i can think of good things and bad things but i dont have all the 
facts 
to young the vagaries of detroits manufacturing economy 
justify another look at casino gambling unemployment which has 
risen and fallen with the uneven fortunes of the auto industry 
peaked at more than 20 percent in the mid1970s and averaged about 
115 percent in 1987 more than 3 percentage points higher than the 
statewide rate 
while auto sales have recently shown some improvement the 
industry is struggling to protect jobs these days not create them 
i dont think its a panacea to all our problems young said 
in announcing the casino study by the same token i dont 
believe that any enterprise that offers the prospect of 50000 jobs 
can be cavalierly dismissed especially without an indepth 
examination 
other than citing 50000 potential construction and casino jobs 
young has been reserved about who would develop the facilities or 
where they would be located specifics have come from real estate 
developer patrick meehan who for several years has proposed 
developing as many as 12 casinos on belle isle an island park in 
the detroit river meehan however has been excluded from the 
commission and has been criticized by young for acting without 
proper authority 
will it be the major industry in detroit absolutely not 
said commission cochairman frank stella a suburban business 
executive in london it isnt in puerto rico and vienna its 
not if its going to be here its going to help create jobs and 
augment the local tourism and convention trade he said 
this might create some jobs jobs to chauffeur people be a 
bodyguard or shuffling chips said a critic ralph slovenko a 
professor of law and psychiatry at wayne state university in 
detroit 
casinos have provided thousands of jobs and millions of dollars 
of revenue for new jersey since they were legalized in atlantic 
city but james w hughes chairman of the urban planning and 
policy department at rutgers university said casinos have 
fulfilled their darker prophecies too 
hughes who coauthored a 1983 book the atlantic city 
gamble said the jobs created have been mostly menial employment 
higher positions have been filled with outsiders including 
experienced nevada dealers and workers skimmed from other fields 
such as nurses whose interpersonal skills qualified them for jobs 
as dealers 
slovenko also was unimpressed by the potential property tax base 
created by multimilliondollar casinos saying everything thats 
coming into the city has got so many tax abatements they end up 
hardly paying anything 
youre potentially creating a monster with limited economic 
benefits unless its really tightly linked to hotels and downtown 
convention facilities as an ancillary device hughes said in 
a telephone interview from new brunswick nj 
other critics have accused young of stacking the commission with 
casino supporters although stella estimated that backers and 
opponents each comprise about 10 percent of its membership and the 
rest including himself are undecided 
casino opponents led by detroit accountant thomas barrow who 
unsuccessfully challenged young in the 1985 mayoral election 
collected enough signatures to place a casino referendum on the 
aug 2 primary ballot results of one poll and the potential 
influence of hundreds of preachers appear to point toward defeat of 
the issue 
a statewide telephone survey of 350 residents conducted 
recently for the detroit free press showed 53 percent opposed to 
casino gambling in detroit and 39 percent in favor with the rest 
undecided or having no opinion 
a coalition of protestant clergy has pledged to rally support 
against the casino proposal 
there is power in the word and the word as we understand it 
is that casino gambling is in opposition to the will of god the 
rev john peoples a city council member and cochairman of the 
coalition told the free press 
gov blanchard has expressed skepticism about casinos benefits 
but said he would keep an open mind while awaiting the commissions 
findings 
young despite proclaiming objectivity and pledging to abide by 
the commissions recommendations said in announcing the study that 
the odds on casino gambling might be narrowing 
i dont think detroiters ever had a serious discussion in 
which the facts were presented prior to the 1976 and 1981 
referenda he said i think detroiters voted in full ignorance 
the previous two times

the recent surge in oil prices ground to a halt 
when the markets got word of saudi king fahds latest statements on 
the current state of prices and crude production 
fahd suggested in a statement issued monday that cheating on 
quotas and prices by some members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries encouraged further weakness in prices 
that sent prices into full reverse on the new york mercantile 
exchange where contracts for april delivery of west texas 
intemediate the benchmark us crude gave up an early 45cent 
gain to close at 1649 per barrel down 9 cents from friday 
among refined products traded on the exchange wholesale heating 
oil closed up 035 cent at 4540 cents per gallon after having 
risen to 4670 cents per gallon earlier unleaded gasoline gave up 
a 141cent gain to close up 012 cent at 4611 cents a gallon 
the decline continued in early trading today west texas 
intermediate was down 28 cents to 1611 a barrel while heating 
oil was off 005 cent to 4335 cents a gallon and gasoline fell 
051 cent to 4560 cents a gallon 
the basic factor in balancing supply and demand is the 
commitment of all member states to opecdecreed quotas and prices 
but if one member fails to live up to this commitment then the 
result will affect the market this is what we witness presently 
the official saudi news agency quoted fahd as saying 
under these circumstances it would be difficult to ask those 
committed to opec output and price controls to modify the 
situation at the expense of their quotas the king said 
analysts said saudi arabia is believed to have been discounting 
its oil lately and that some traders interpreted fahds remarks as 
justifying that action 
as such it undermined a recent rally by reiterating the 
kingdoms wellknown postition that it would not sacrifice its own 
production or prices to bolster the market while other cartel 
members continue to cheat 
prices which had been sagging rose strongly after opec 
president rilwanu lukman nigerias oil minister said last 
thursday he would announce new measures to bring stability to the 
market at a press conference today 
however a source close to lukman said today that the press 
conference was expected to focus on nigerias domestic oil policy 
although questions on opec might be raised by reporters 
in addition a spokesman for the stateowned nigerian national 
petroleum corp said the press conference although originally 
scheduled for today was more likely to take place wednesday or 
thursday 
lukmans announcement last thursday came one day after he 
declared he would not seek an early meeting of opec ministers 
despite a weekslong trend of eroding prices at the time 
thus many analysts said monday they were not certain what 
measures lukman could announce that could have any substantive 
effect on prices 
most people dont believe hes got anything new to tell the 
world said donald morton vice president for energy futures in 
the boston office of prudentialbache securities inc 
james steel an analyst at refco inc commodities said he 
believed there were fears prices would drop sharply once 
disappointment over lukmans comments set into the market and 
that the saudi king had thus stepped in to soften the blow 
i think thats why fahd made the statement today steel said

stocks turned mixed today strengthened by 
higher bond prices and takeoverrelated buying but restrained by 
investor reluctance to participate in a market still suffering 
postcrash uncertainty 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials was down 149 points to 
206565 by noon on wall street 
among broader market indicators the new york stock exchanges 
composite index of all listed issues was unchanged at 15147 the 
american stock exchanges market value index rose 016 to 29834 
gaining and losing issues were about even on the nyse with 636 
up 645 down and 520 unchanged volume totaled 653 million shares 
in the morning session compared with 6576 million monday morning 
rising prices in the bond market provided some optimism to wall 
street because they dampened anxiety over inflation and higher 
interest rates bonds were buoyed by lower oil prices and a 
government report that showed a surprising drop in factory orders 
for durable goods in february 
some stocks also were boosted by rumored and actual takeovers 
reflecting a stunning increase in merger activity over the past 
several weeks 
nevertheless stockbrokers said the relatively low volume of 
trading and the lack of any significant economic signals showed 
that many investors remain reluctant to reenter the market in the 
aftermath of the october crash 
people still are wounded said philip c puccio manager of 
institutional trading at dillon read amp co those wounds have not 
scarred over yet theres fear we could be looking at another

the supreme court today rejected the internal 
revenue services attempt to impose stiffer taxes when individuals 
or business partnerships form corporations to obtain financing 
by an 80 vote the court said real estate developers in 
kentucky should not be subjected to a heavier tax burden because 
they formed corporations for the sole purpose of borrowing money 
jesse c bollinger either individually or in partnership with 
others developed eight apartment complexes in the lexington ky 
area beginning in 1968 
to obtain constructionfinancing loans bollinger formed 
corporations to borrow the money at 8 percent interest kentuckys 
usury law at the time limited the interest noncorporate borrowers 
could be charged to 7 percent and lenders were not willing to 
finance bollingers projects at that rate 
when bollinger and his partners sought to claim business losses 
connected with the apartment projects on their individual federal 
income taxes the irs disallowed it 
the tax agency said the losses must be attributed to the 
corporations deemed to be the true owners of the apartment 
complexes that designation worked to the tax disadvantage of 
bollinger and his partners 
a federal appeals court ruled against the irs and todays 
decision upheld that ruling 
writing for the court justice antonin scalia said the 
corporations had been formed for a legitimate nonmanipulative 
purpose 
it seems to us that taxavoiding manipulation is 
adequately avoided when the corporation is acting as agent for 
its shareholders with respect to a particular asset the apartment 
complexes is set forth in a written agreement at the time the 
asset is acquired scalia said 
he also noted that the corporations at issue in this case 
functioned as agent and not principal with respect to the asset 
for all purposes and the corporation is held out as the agent and 
not principal in all dealings with third parties relating to the 
asset 
the case is commissioner irs vs bollinger 861672

italian investor carlo de benedetti has 
increased his holdings in societe generale de belgique sa by 353 
percent but it was not known if his alliance held a majority stake 
in belgiums largest holding company officials said tuesday 
an official at de benedettis french investment company cerus 
sa who asked not to be named did not know whether the public 
offer gave de benedetti and his allies control of the company 
this alliance claimed to control 4701 percent of societe 
generales shares before tuesday the newly purchased shares would 
apparently raise this to 5054 percent but the cerus official said 
the 4701 percent might have included some shares from the public 
offer 
on march 10 a francobelgian alliance opposing de benedetti 
claimed to control 507 percent of societe generale 
tuesdays announcement was the latest twist in one of europes 
biggest and most complex takeover battles it failed to provide 
definite clues about the outcome more than two months after de 
benedetti first announced his bid for 166yearold societe generale 
on march 10 de benedetti called for shareholders meeting which 
should make it clear which side has a majority the meeting is set 
for april 14 
meanwhile a court case was still pending on a societe generale 
capital increase to fend off de benedetti the ruling in that case 
might still dramatically change the stakes each side claims to hold 
cerus the investment firm through which de benedetti was vying 
for control of societe generale said tuesday it had obtained 1087 
million additional shares or 353 percent of the companys total 
share capital including warrants 
cerus launched a public offer for the extra shares on feb 15 
the bid was to have expired march 4 but has since been extended 
the offer was designed to acquire 21 million shares or about 7 
percent of the share capital of societe generale 
cerus offered 8000 francs or 228 for ordinary shares in the 
last stage of its public offer 
reacting to tuesdays announcement the management of societe 
generale which opposes de benedetti said there were no defections 
from the francobelgian alliance to cerus camp 
de benedetti wants to turn societe generale into the platform of 
a paneuropean holding company while the francobelgian group wants 
to keep the company firmly entrenched in the belgian economic 
fabric 
on tuesday societe generale announced its net profit in 1987 
fell 221 percent to stand at 4138 billion francs societe 
generale has a stake in over 1200 companies worldwide and the 
government has stressed the company is vital for its investment 
strategy technological development and its relations with its 
former colony zaire 
the de benedetti group consists of cerus the us investment 
bank shearson lehman hutton inc the swiss bank companie de banque 
et dinvestissements and the food giant nestle sa two belgian 
partners and several smaller allies 
the francobelgian alliance is anchored around the french 
investment firm companie financiere de suez and belgiums biggest 
insurer groupe ag sa and includes several other partners

a federal jury has awarded a record 795 
million to the estate of an ibm executive and his wife killed in a 
delta air lines crash outside dallas including more than 6 
million for his lost potential earnings at the computer company 
the jury at us district court in manhattan deliberated just 
five hours before returning its verdict at 830 pm monday in the 
suit by the estate of philip d estridge 47 of new canaan conn 
and his wife mary ann 
estridge who received much of the credit for moving ibm into 
the personal computer market and his wife were among 137 people 
killed when the lockheed l1011 crashed on approach at dallasfort 
worth international airport on aug 2 1985 
i thought it would have been more and it should have been 
more said attorney lee kreindler who had asked for 25 million 
for estridge and 5 million for his wife i was a little 
disappointed with the numbers 
but evelyn eubanks one of three daughters who filed the suit 
said they were happy with the judgment and the end of the case 
we dont think anything could have happened any better and 
were definitely relieved its over she said it doesnt make 
it better but it helps us to live with it 
kreindler said the sum awarded monday was a record for 
compensatory damages in a wrongfuldeath suit the breakdown was 
625 million for estridges loss of earnings 750000 for loss of 
enjoyment of life and 100000 for mental anguish 
for mrs estridge the jury awarded 750000 for loss of 
enjoyment of life and 100000 for mental anguish 
shortly before estridge died the jacksonville fla native was 
named overseer of ibms worldwide manufacturing operations based 
in new york at a salary of 240000 yearly 
although the trial was held in new york city the award was 
reached under the law of estridges new home state of connecticut 
to allow for the salary projection figures kreindler said 
delta lawyer john sabetta declined to comment on the award but 
told judge john e sprizzo he would appeal delta spokesman bill 
berry referred all calls to the companys insurance carrier us 
aviation underwriters and had no comment 
the estridge verdict came on the same day of opening arguments 
in another suit stemming from the fatal crash 
a wrongfuldeath suit on behalf of julie ann zarnt of boca 
raton fla opened monday with a 12minute videotape highlighting 
her 15 years of life 
the first half of the tape was made from silent home movies it 
showed her as a newborn first coming home and as a toddler 
celebrating birthdays and christmas

in the stock market the names numbers and 
skills of the players change but the game remains about the same no 
matter how many times we are told that its a whole new ball 
game 
never was that advice more freely offered more uncritically 
accepted and more avariciously followed than in the stock market of 
1987 which crashed to reality on oct 19 
it is by popular agreement the big lesson emerging bit by bit 
as the event recedes into history and as once giddy and greedy 
minds resume more sober interpretations of the economy 
the various studies under way or completed seem to emphasize 
such factors as portfolio insurance and futures trading and 
other technical factors that arose over the past decade and 
seemingly changed the markets makeup 
no doubt such factors could have contributed but it is now 
patently clear they couldnt have done so without the presence of 
the same old psychological undercurrent that boosted stock prices 
beyond reason 
the omens were there to absorb or ignore 
shares sold at 22 times earnings vs a longtime norm under 15 
they were priced at 2 to 3 times a companys liquidation value a 
full point above the longterm norm dividend yields were half what 
they should have been 
critics with a classic education in the ways of the stock market 
pointed to these lessons and more and were scorned as 
oldfashioned who were they to argue with sophisticated electronic 
computations do computers lie 
the oldtimers admonitions have left an eerie echo a painful 
one somewhat akin to parental warnings that were ignored because 
every child knows parents issue warnings to children because 
thats what parents are supposed to do 
looking back some of the markets smartest investors including 
bigname portfolio managers for mutual funds insurers and the 
like wonder how they got drawn into a market they knew was headed 
for a fall 
they knew but apparently couldnt resist the temptation of what 
they thought was easy money just as others before them fell 
because they were governed by emotions peculiar to the human 
species 
it is still a debate with some of them as they review the crash 
they knew the old rules still applied they knew the market was 
destined to correct its imbalance that is fall they knew the 
rules of the game hadnt changed 
but they ask was it reason or emotion that governed their 
decision to jump in was it unreasonable to assume that a market 
propelled ever higher no matter how irrationally offered an 
opportunity to make a quick buck 
was it reasonable or foolish to ignore the stories of quick 
profits by your brotherinlaw and not be tempted to do the same 
or for a fund manager was it foolhardy or sensible to try keeping 
pace with dicethrowing competitors 
you can blame the crash on new trading techniques the 
acceleration of trading activity by means of computers and the 
instantaneous communications that seem to exaggerate advances and 
declines 
something might be done eventually to mute the adverse effects 
of these factors but judging from the evidence of last fall there 
is little that can be done with the players themselves 
the names and numbers change and some of the techniques too 
but the game will always be played by human beings and they can be 
expected to act no differently

shareholders attending what could be 
firestone tire amp rubber cos last annual meeting tuesday voted to 
shorten the companys name but had little to say about bridgestone 
corps bid for the tire maker 
about 900 people attended the halfhour meeting where 
shareholders voted to change the companys name to firestone inc 
shareholders asked only two questions about bridgestones offer 
to pay 80 a share or 26 billion for firestones outstanding 
shares stockholders will meet again april 25 to vote on the tender 
offer 
bridgestones bid which was accepted by firestones board 
exceeds a 186 billion offer from italian tire maker pirelli spa 
after the meeting firestone chairman john j nevin met briefly 
with reporters and discussed firestones talks with bridgestone and 
pirelli firestone and bridgestone had planned a 75 percent joint 
venture until pirelli made its unsolicited 58ashare bid for all 
of firestones 32 million outstanding shares 
nevin said he told both bridgestone and pirelli in negotiations 
that firestone was holding talks with a third firm that he declined 
to identify 
nevin speculated that bridgestone was able to make its tender 
offer quickly because of its prior knowledge of firestone 
bridgestone purchased a plant from firestone in 1983 
i dont want to speculate on what bridgestone would have done 
under other circumstances but i think all of the background that 
bridgestone had acquired in discussions with us earlier certainly 
made it much more possible for bridgestone to move quickly in a 
twoweek period said nevin 
i think that had we announced in midfebruary that the board 
of directors had decided to enter into a joint venture with pirelli 
rather than bridgestone i think it was improbable that bridgestone 
then would have made an unsolicited tender offer this was by no 
means an unfriendly action on bridgestones part nevin said 
he reiterated that he has no plans to buy back from bridgestone 
any of firestones nontire businesses including its 1500 
mastercare car repair operations

opec president rilwanu lukman postponed 
indefinitely a scheduled news conference that was expected to have 
focused on stabilizing sagging oil prices the guardian newspaper 
said 
last week nigerian petroleum ministry officials said lukman 
would announce tuesday new measures to bring stability to the 
market 
but the ministry said the news conference had been called off 
according to the newspaper no new date was given 
lukman has accused the western news media of trying to 
destabilize the oil market to bring down prices adding opec would 
not be driven into taking emergency measures to stop the fall of 
oil prices 
he also has vowed the cartel would stand firm on its decision to 
produce 1560 million barrels of oil a day a barrel of oil is 
equivalent to 42 gallons

canada said monday it will accept two rulings of 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade by lowering 
protectionist barriers on wine and liquor and pacific coast fish 
processing 
trade minister pat carney told the house of commons in ottawa 
that canadians would be exposed to the law of the jungle in 
world commerce if the government did not support the rulings 
scheduled for ratification tuesday by the full council of gatt 
which is based in geneva 
canada had the option of fighting or ignoring the rulings by the 
95nation gatt which sets international trade rules and 
adjudicates disputes between members but that course could have 
led to retaliation such as duties on canadian goods 
a preliminary gatt ruling last fall said canadas 
provincebyprovince system of marketing alcoholic beverages 
unfairly favors domestic wine beer and liquor 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the gatt panel was assessing a longstanding complaint against 
canadian liquor boards by the 12nation european community which 
wants to sell more wine and brandy in canada 
carney said canada will open borders to more foreign wine and 
liquor as the gatt asked but protection will continue for the 
34 billion canadian beer industry 
canadian wines mostly of low quality have a 45 percent share 
of the domestic market because of a government policy limiting 
imports ontario province puts a 66 percent surcharge on foreign 
wines 
the europeans do not plan largescale beer exports although 
beer was included in their complaint but if canada dropped its 
import barriers for beer the path would be cleared for the major 
us breweries to swamp the canadian market 
at present canadian provinces only permit the sale of beer 
brewed within each province by the nations 40 breweries with a 
few foreign imports us beers are brewed in canada under license 
the brewers association of canada warned last week that 19000 
canadian jobs would be lost if the american beer companies moved in 
carney said the government is reviewing a petition by canadas 
33 wineries to launch a gatt challenge to the heavy subsidies 
enjoyed by european economic community vineyards in the meantime 
the government will consider adjustment programs for canadian wine 
growers and winemakers she said

introduce new measures to force canadian fishermen to land their 
catch in british columbia some are now selling salmon or herring

the dollar ended slightly higher against most 
major foreign currencies in european trading tuesday gold prices 
fell 
most of the days activity occurred in cross trades that did not 
involve the dollar the pound and the yen gained against the west 
german mark while the french franc steadied against the mark on 
expectations that president francois mitterand would announce that 
he will run in next months election 
with attention focused elsewhere nobody is too sure what to 
do with the dollar said keith dipple chief trader at banque 
francaise du commerce exterieur in london 
dealers said the yen remains strong because of expectations that 
japanese financial institutions will buy the currency at the end of 
the japanese fiscal year

dollar closed at 12707 yen down 128 yen from last friday the

stocks turned narrowly higher today in another 
slow trading session that brokers attributed to underlying investor 
reluctance to participate in the market because of resilient 
postcrash uncertainty 
were right on the top of the fence and dont know which way 
were going to fall said robert otoole manager of 
overthecounter trading at shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks confined to a 
narrow range through most of the session was up 216 points to 
206930 by 3 pm on wall street 
among broader market indicators the new york stock exchanges 
composite index of all listed issues rose 016 to 15163 the 
american stock exchanges market value index rose 044 to 29862 
gaining issues barely outnumbered declines on the nyse with 772 
up 679 down and 502 unchanged volume totaled a sluggish 11658 
million shares with an hour of trading left 
stocks were helped somewhat by a surprising drop in factory 
orders for durable goods in february the report by the commerce 
department suggested to some strategists that the economy isnt as 
strong as previously believed thereby raising the possibility that 
interest rates wont creep up 
brokers said the market also received a boost by sharp increases 
in borrowed shares sold on the nyse and amex in the month ended 
last tuesday an increase in socalled short sales of stock often 
is considered good for the market because it means these borrowed 
shares eventually must be repurchased 
some stocks also rose because of rumored and actual takeovers 
reflecting a stunning increase in merger activity over the past 
several weeks 
nevertheless brokers said the relatively low volume of trading 
and the lack of any significant economic signals showed that many 
investors remain reluctant to reenter the market in the aftermath 
of the october crash 
people still are wounded said philip c puccio manager of 
institutional trading at dillon read amp co those wounds have not 
scarred over yet theres fear we could be looking at another 
downdraft 
lucky stores was the most active nyse issue jumping 14 to 46 
on volume exceeding 34 million shares after rival chain american 
stores announced a 45ashare tender offer for the company 
speculative buying affected a range of other companies including 
pillsbury up to 45 usg up 3 to 38 and himont up 3 to 44 
on the amex resorts international class a shares rose 3 to 31 
after entertainer merv griffin boosted his offer for the company in

wheat and soybean futures prices ended higher 
while corn futures slipped slightly tuesday at the chicago board of 
trade 
the novemberdelivery contract for soybeans rose 7 cents to a 
contract high of 666 a bushel 
wheat futures were supported by notions that india still 
suffering the effects of a recent drought would be offered a 
substantial amount of us wheat under the agriculture departments 
export bonus program 
corn prices however were pressured by news that vermont sen 
patrick leahy is moving ahead with legislation that would 
ultimately put more corn on the market

there is no evidence gd searle and co 
withheld information from the food and drug administration in 
winning approval for its copper7 intrauterine contraceptive 
device an fda spokeswoman said tuesday 
fda officials met with searle representatives last week to 
discuss whether company documents recently unsealed in a minnesota 
court case challenging the iud were available to the government 
agency before it approved the device in 1974 
the gist of our initial review is that weve had that 
information all along and that we got it when we initially began 
reviewing searles application for approval of the iud said 
spokewoman susan cruzan 
theres no evidence they didnt give us all the necessary 
inforatmion when we began our review she said 
the searle iud remains on the government approved list but the 
company stopped selling it in 1986 citing growing costs from court 
suits 
the company faces about 500 suits by women who claim that the 
copper7 caused them to develop pelvic infections the company has 
won 14 of the 17 suits that have gone to trial and maintains that 
the device was and is safe

ailing first republicbank corp might have to be 
split into pieces to make texas largest bankholding company more 
attractive to investors experts said 
first republicbank weakened by a run on deposits and 
multimilliondollar losses received a 1 billion injection of 
capital from the federal deposit insurance corp last week 
but because it could take as much as 5 billion to rescue the 
nations 13thlargest bank holding company banking regulators are 
considering breaking up the holding company as a marketing 
alternative 
fdic chairman l william seidman said that certainly is an 
option 
the holding companys banks in major markets could be packaged 
together or in regional or in statewide combinations experts said 
the first thing you think of is splitting the company into 
bitesize morsels said james sexton a former director of 
supervision at the fdic who is a consultant at bracewell amp 
patterson an austin texas law firm 
its a very large bank for someone else to acquire said 
tanya azarchs a banking analyst with standard amp poors corp in 
new york i dont see anyone on the scene thats willing to do 
that 
first republic reported a 1987 loss of 6568 million 392 
billion in problem assets and had deposit outflows of more than 2 
billion this year assets total about 332 billion 
the bank holding company however is in the process of 
consolidating some of its banks which could make a breakup more 
difficult those moves already have cut the number of banks from 
103 to 73 and plans are to continue mergings until only 40 remain 
the holding company has banks in dallas austin houston and san 
antonio 
although the breakup of the holding company could make it more 
accessible to investors some argue it would be better if the 
company remained intact 
these banks are intertwined having common management 
borrowers and computer systems sexton said breaking off 
chunks presents some tough administrative problems

democrat richard gephardt charged tuesday that 
michael dukakis support for tough trade legislation is just a 
political ploy that will end after the michigan caucuses are over 
dukakis the massachusetts governor said his position on trade 
has been consistent and his staff released quotations from last 
year indicating his support for major provisions of a senate trade 
bill 
who is for a tough trade policy who is going to be for a 
tough trade policy after michigan gephardt asked in a telephone 
interview tuesday the answer is dick gephardt is and will be 
mike dukakis hasnt been isnt and wont be 
when he is on the east and west coast he wants to talk about 
free trade when hes in michigan he doesnt gephardt said 
gephardts tough trade legislation now in a conference 
committee on capitol hill has been the capstone of the missouri 
congressmans platform 
monday night dukakis endorsed trade legislation sponsored by 
michigan sen donald riegle who in turn endorsed dukakis gephardt 
quickly accused dukakis of having a battlefield conversion on 
trade saying the riegle bill was the senate version of the 
gephardt legislation 
dukakis and jesse jackson are tied for the lead in the polls on 
saturdays michigan caucuses with gephardt a distant third 
dukakis aides say that may be the reason for gephardts attacks 
on tuesday gephardt stepped up the attack questioning the 
sincerity of dukakis support for such legislation 
i think he remains against it i think it is a political 
ploy gephardt said by what he has done he is trying to have 
it both ways now that he is in michigan and we are five days 
out from the caucuses he wants to fool the people of michigan 
dukakis said in michigan late monday that his position hasnt 
changed 
he has been a strong opponent of the gephardt bill from the 
begining but has always been an advocate of leveling the trade 
playing field said dukakis spokesman leslie dach 
dukakis staff on tuesday pointed to quotes from the 
massachusetts governor last year in favor of the senate bill 
on july 11 1987 dukakis said i think the trade bill which 
the senate approved yesterday says if there is a consistent pattern 
of unfair trade practices there i think we have to do 
something 
i feel a lot better about the senate bill than the gephardt 
trade legislation dukakis said on aug 4 1987 
gephardt said dukakis has said in the past you dont need new 
legislation he has been profoundly negative about everything i 
have said about trade 
the congressman too provided quotes from dukakis last year 
quotes he said back up his charge of a flipflop 
the president today has all the authority he needs to do 
something about those unfair trade practices we do not need more 
laws or more amendments dukakis said at the aug 8 debate at 
drake university according to gephardt aides 
in debates in dallas and atlanta dukakis told gephardt you 
want a law dick i want to act 
and earlier this year in lansing mich gephardt aides said 
dukakis said we do not need more legislation 
the gephardt amemdment and the riegle bill do differ but both 
try to strengthen potential retaliation against us trading 
partners for unfair practices in general the riegle bill would 
target specific industries in foreign countries which engage in 
unfair practices the gephardt amendment would trigger retaliation 
against another country for running a big surplus with this country 
in part through unfair practices 
dukakis has always felt the president has had the authority to 
act the riegle amendment gives the president a better way to 
get there but he can pretty much get there on his own now 
dukakis spokesman dach said

economists stuck by their optimistic predictions for us 
manufacturing on tuesday in spite of a government report that 
orders to american factories for bigticket durable goods fell 
18 percent in february 
in other news the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
fell 099 point to 206615 the dollar was mixed against other 
major currencies and bond prices were little changed in light 
trading 
the commerce department said orders for durable goods items 
expected to last three or more years totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1114 billion in february following an identical 18 
percent january decline 
it was the first time since the spring of 1986 that durable 
goods orders have fallen for two consecutive months 
economists maintained that manufacturing companies still were 
enjoying good business because the weaker dollar has boosted export 
demand 
what we have is a twomonth hesitation after some big 
increases said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
still analysts said the backtoback declines showed businesses 
were cutting back on orders in the early part of 1988 in an effort 
to get control of bulging inventories inventories swelled at the 
end of 1987 while consumer demand fell 
cynthia latta an economist with data resources inc noted that 
while new orders fell in february the total backlog of unfilled 
orders rose 07 percent to 3971 billion the 12th consecutive 
monthly increase 
this backlog suggests that factories can keep humming along 
for a while even though new orders dropped she said

a department store chains attempt to avoid 
paying taxes for merchandise catalogs received by its louisiana 
customers sparked skeptical questioning tuesday in the supreme 
court 
andrew rinker jr representing new orleansbased dh holmes 
co seemed to be having little success in arguing that his client 
should not have to pay a louisiana use tax on the catalogs 
value 
rinker spent nearly 30 minutes responding to the justices 
questions by contrast shreveport la lawyer robert g pugh 
concluded his presentation for state tax officials in less than 10 
minutes because he was asked so few questions 
the courts decision is expected by july 
rinker from new orleans contended that no tax should be 
assessed because the catalogs are published in other states and 
mailed directly to louisiana residents 
the state imposes a tax on all tangible personal property bought 
or used within louisiana 
when rinker argued that the department store chain actually had 
paid for a service delivery of the catalogs and not for goods 
several justices seemed to disagree 
holmes put this whole operation into creation said chief 
justice william h rehnquist 
justice sandra day oconnor questioned whether delivery of the 
catalogs even through the us mail is an activity that can be 
taxed 
she later seemed to answer her own question in the affirmative 
holmes caused the distribution in louisiana it ordered it it 
paid for it 
when rinker contended that it is holmes customers not holmes 
who use the catalogs justice byron r white responded holmes is 
having that use provided 
when justice thurgood marshall asked could holmes have made a 
dollar in the state of louisiana without the catalogs rinker 
said many of the customers who frequent holmes 13 stores in 
louisiana did so long before catalogs were mailed out 
those are pretty old people white quipped 
rinker acknowledged that the department store chain could be 
subjected to the louisiana tax if the catalogs are delivered to the 
state and distributed from there but he said the current setup 
precludes state tax liability 
pugh argued that the real taxable activity undertaken by holmes 
is maintaing a market in louisiana for their sales 
dh holmes co also operates stores in mississippi alabama and 
florida but 82 percent of its catalogs are mailed to louisiana 
residents 
the state tax imposed on holmes is based on 82 percent of the

eight states on tuesday filed suit accusing 
dozens of insurance companies of conspiring to create the liability 
insurance crisis making coverage unavailable or too costly for 
many governments and businesses 
the companies actions were a major contributor to the 
insurance crisis that forced so many cities and businesses up 
against the wall california attorney general john van de kamp 
said at a news conference 
it was the public and the consumer who paid the price for this 
collusive exercise in corporate greed he said 
david ostwald a vice president of the insurance services 
office a 1400member rate and policy advisory organization named 
in the lawsuits called the claims unfounded and denied the 
existence of a conspiracy 
the lawsuits filed in us district court here by seven states 
accuses major us and british insurance firms reinsurers and 
ostwalds trade group of using secret agreements and internal 
pressure several years ago in an effort to eliminate the most 
common type of general liability policy that covering any damage 
that occurs during the policy term regardless of when the damage is 
discovered 
reinsurers provide vital backup coverage for other insurers van 
de kamp said 
the attorneys general of california new york west virginia 
wisconsin minnesota massachusetts and alabama filed similar suits 
in us district court in san francisco naming 32 insurance 
companies underwriters and associations 
van de kamp said arizona would sue in the same court wednesday 
a separate lawsuit was filed in state court in austin texas 
these defendants have sucked the blood of our nations 
economic wellbeing texas attorney general jim mattox said at a 
news conference texas filed suit in state court because the state 
has one of the toughest best antitrust laws in the nation he 
said 
as a result of the conspiracy californias suit said property 
damage insurance for local governments nonprofit agencies such as 
child care centers and various businesses suddenly became 
unavailable or prohibitively expensive 
in california and elsewhere local governments cut back or 
eliminated services such as parks and police because of insurance 
expenses van de kamp said many local government officials blamed 
rising damage awards in injury suits and joined the insurance 
industry in efforts to restrict the right to sue 
the lawsuits claim the companies targeted for elimination 
coverage for spills and other types of pollution incidents and 
general liability for damage discovered after the life of a policy 
known as occurrence coverage 
the companies instead favored more limited policies covering 
only losses that were suffered and claimed within the policy term 
excluding damage that was discovered later the suits said 
the lawsuits said four major insurance companies hartford 
allstate cigna and aetna started a campaign in 1984 to curtail 
coverage that was generally available in the industry 
according to the suits the companies got major us and british 
reinsurers including underwriters at lloyds of london to 
threaten a boycott of any us insurance company that provided the 
broader coverage 
among other things the plaintiffs seek to restructure the 
insurance services office by giving noninsurers a majority on its 
board and making public its data on insurance coverage losses 
ostwald said from his office in new york city that pollution 
insurance and occurrence coverage remained available with some 
restrictions 
pollution coverage was changed in response to expansive court 
decisions he said 
its simply incorrect to assert that an attempt was made to 
impose this policy on the marketplace he said referring to the 
alleged effort to scrap occurrence coverage 
insurance rates increased mainly because of a demonstrable 
increase in claims losses and a drop in interest rates slowing 
down insurers investment income he said 
steven perelman a spokesman for aetna casualty and surety co 
a defendant in texas and california termed the action another 
political move by political officeholders who have consistently 
opposed any and all efforts to address the real problems of the 
nations liability system 
david willis spokesman for the cigna property and casualty 
group also named in both lawsuits said its really an 
ingrained condition of how we operate in all our jurisdictions that 
we conform to whatever antitrust regulations exist we do not 
violate laws 
in addtion to iso the suit in texas named eight companies that 
served on the iso executive committee aetna cigna firemans fund 
insurance co hartford fire insurance co liberty mutual 
insurance co st paul fire and marine insurance co the 
travelers insurance co and usfampg corp
