the convention later told reporters that the platform should 
have been neutral now you have a position thats prochoice 
why

platform committee said the stance should be considered all 
encompassing and conceded that the plank is a break with the 
national platform which is strong righttolife

three days before a courtordered deadline 
texas again failed to overhaul its finances to give more money to 
poor schools but gov bill clements says the state actually has 
three weeks to get the job done 
the house in a largely partyline vote tuesday failed by eight 
votes to muster the 100 needed to override clements veto of a 555 
million schoolfinance bill the house then adjourned the senate 
voted last week for an override 
the democratcontrolled legislature had designed the bill to 
answer a unanimous texas supreme court order to give more money to 
poor schools if a measure is not enacted by friday a 
courtappointed master will come up with a plan 
i think a compromise will be reached that will be acceptable 
to everybody concerned and will be an excellent bill the 
republican governor said i think in a matter of another week 
well have it all done and everybody can go home and have a good 
time 
house speaker gib lewis said he expected clements to call 
lawmakers back for a fourth special session on school finance as 
early as today 
we will continue to negotiate work with the governor and find 
out what issues that we can compromise with him lewis said 
one thing i am trying to prevent and im going to try the best i 
can is not allow a master to write a school plan for the future of 
texas education 
clements has said lawmakers have until june 21 to enact a bill 
because that is when court master william kilgarlin will file his 
final plan for the 31 millionstudent school system 
in october the supreme court declared texas school finance 
system unconstitutional because of wide disparities in spending 
between rich and poor districts as in most states schools in 
texas are supported mostly by property taxes 
courts in a dozen states have overturned school finance systems 
in recent years the others are kentucky new jersey kansas 
wisconsin california connecticut washington west virginia 
wyoming arkansas and montana 
in vetoing the bill last week clements decried the halfcent 
sales tax increase lawmakers want to help pay for the measure 
rep eddie cavazos a democrat from corpus christi said a 
courtwritten plan is looking more attractive to those who 
represent poor districts 
weve done the best we can and they wont accept it thats 
fine let them try to deal with a master said cavazos chairman 
of the house mexican american legislative caucus

the group of oakland calif medics is known as heart to heart 
and to many soviet families they are more than an exchange program 
they are the gift of life to children born with heart defects 
after her husbands summit meeting with president bush raisa 
gorbachev plans a visit next week to oaklands childrens hospital 
heart to hearts base 
more than half the 50000 children born in the soviet union each 
year with heart defects die before their first birthdays 
the heart to heart team of doctors and nurses know they 
personally can help only a few of those children but their 
educational programs for both medical personnel and parents are 
designed to benefit a greater number 
the group is planning its third trip to leningrad this fall to 
operate on several children and teach more soviet doctors advanced 
heart techniques 
earlier this year 130 families who had learned of the 
15member teams visit from newspaper stories or friends traveled 
great distances just for the chance to have their children examined 
at leningrads childrens hospital 
the waiting room was a mixture of elation and sadness as some 
parents learned their children could be operated on and others were 
told their childs condition was inoperable 
most of the operations actually are simple the us doctors 
say just a matter of having the proper training and equipment 
within days they say many of the children are up and around 
showing renewed energy 
then nurse lili cook can tell those parents from now on your 
children can lead a normal life

an antique dealer has won a court battle giving 
her the right to hang queen victorias bloomers from her market 
stall 
anne swift who runs a store in portobello road londons main 
antique shopping area successfully appealed against a ban imposed 
by local councilors 
could you say queen victorias undergarments have connotations 
of dirt and shabbiness mrs swift asked in a london magistrates 
court on tuesday 
councilors had banned stalls from selling secondhand clothing 
but allowed mrs swift to continue as long as she displayed 
garments flat mrs swift deals exclusively in antique textiles 
appealing the order mrs swift told the court she could not 
sell the valuable victorian garments that way because they would 
become creased and damaged 
dermot woolgar representing the royal borough of kensington and 
chelsea said the stall was a shambles and obstructed the view 
of other stalls 
among the antique lace needlework and fabrics on sale were 
several items said to have been worn by queen victoria the 
garments included three camisoles valued at 500 each one 
nightgown at 845 and a pair of bloomers whose price is available 
on application

this city is going bonkers over bugs 
there are nightly updates on the tv news recipes in the 
newspaper even a special hot line heralding not the coming of the 
apocalypse but the emergence of inchlong critters called cicadas 
the noisy devils unearth temselves every 17 years to mate 
shriek incessantly and drive homeowners crazy 
millions of the winged creatures are expected to emerge in parts 
of illinois iowa indiana and wisconsin during the next few days 
covering back yards and forests with their brownish crunchy bodies 
after mating and laying eggs that will remain underground for 
another 17 years the cicadas will die the orgy should be over by 
early july and experts say the creatures are harmless 
but that hasnt calmed the hysteria 
its completely unfounded said field museum entomologist 
phil parrillo people are going out and getting insecticide to 
spray on them but theyre only going to be here for a few weeks 
gee whiz dont worry about it 
the males produce a large shrill sound the females are mute 
they may be a nuisance in terms of the sound that they make 
he said tuesday and they can damage young trees where they lay 
their eggs 
other than that theyre really not going to cause a 
problem he said 
midwesterners might get a different impression from reading the 
newspaper or watching the news lately 
the cicadas have reached elmhurst a broadcaster announced 
in a teaser for a recent television newscast 
wlstv news has run five or six reports saying that theyre on 
their way and also a story on what people can do to protect their 
young trees said jim lichtenstein assignment editor 
the cover of a recent chicago tribune sunday magazine featured 
the warning get ready the 17year itch of the cicada is about 
to begin 
the chicago suntimes last week set up a hot line which has 
received at least 60 calls a day from curious or horrified 
homeowners with questions about the bugs said jim martinez 
metropolitan editor the newspaper even printed recipes for readers 
brave enough to eat the creatures 
michael kendall a chicago attorney tested one of the recipes 
with some cicadas he found monday night in his brothers suburban 
back yard 
we parboiled them and then sauteed them in butter and garlic 
and ate them sort of like shrimp kendall said they taste like 
sort of a starchy potato they had a sort of scalloplike 
consistency 
parrillo says this batch of cicadas brood 13 lives in the 
top third of illinois parts of eastern iowa and western indiana 
and in southern wisconsin 
other broods on different 17year cycles live throughout the 
eastern united states and some cicadas emerge every 13 years he 
said he knows of no other periodic cicadas that are appearing this 
year 
if people can set aside their insect phobia long enough to 
appreciate whats happening its something that i think they 
should go out and take a look at said parrillo blaming the news 
media for helping create cicada mania 
but the suntimes martinez said the bugs warrant the coverage 
how often do you have all these little bugs coming out of the 
ground making so much noise being such a nuisance he asked 
its just a fascinating bit of nature that we dont often get a 
chance to look at

now that the soviet army has left 
afghanistan moslem fundamentalists are turning their wrath on 
western aid agencies and afghan women who work for them 
threats of revolutionary action against the women issue from 
faceless tribunals with mystery memberships and names like council 
of islamic jihad reformist movement of moslem youth and mujahed 
brothers jihad means holy war and mujahedeen are holy warriors 
leaders of guerrilla groups fighting the sovietsponsored 
government in kabul deny knowledge of the tribunals which have 
made their presence known through letters warning afghan women away 
from the western agencies 
more than 3 million afghan refugees live in camps around this 
frontier town at the foot of the khyber pass the route to 
afghanistan 
scores of humanitarian aid groups established headquarters in 
peshawar after the red army entered the afghan civil war in 
december 1979 and refugees started streaming into pakistan the 
last soviet military forces left last year 
letters signed by the groups written by hand or typed began 
circulating in refugee camps in may 
one said the aid groups engaged in immoral activities one of 
the characteristics and products of western civilization that is 
not proper for moslem women 
a mob of about 5000 people in the nasir bagh refugee camp 
attacked operations of shelter now international which is financed 
by several christian groups causing nearly 1 million in damage 
over mosque loudspeakers moslem clerics exhorted the mob and 
denounced western influence 
the targets were a sewing center for widows and an elementary 
school for girls nasir bagh is considered the showcase of the 250 
refugee camps in pakistans northwest frontier province 
in midmay about 100 afghan men chanting down with 
foreigners and death to afghans who work with foreigners 
destroyed a concrete factory established by shelter now 
international in afghanistans eastern nangarhar province 
a mob attacked the austrian relief committee headquarters in 
peshawar the next day but did little damage 
most refugees have nothing to do with this whole business 
said ted albers a spokesman for an umbrella group of 51 agencies 
he said rivalries among the seven guerrilla organizations based 
in pakistan had caused much uncertainty but there was no evidence 
of a coordinated effort to undermine western aid programs 
much of the foreign aid has gone to hezbiislami or party of 
god led by gulbuddin hekmatyar 
tales abound of how hekmatyar known for antiwest rhetoric 
threw acid in the faces and on the arms and legs of unveiled afghan 
women in the early 1970s before fleeing to pakistan 
president najibullah of afghanistan has emphasized the 
fundamentalist element of the rebel groups in his propaganda 
campaign against the guerrillas 
women in kabul particularly teenage girls say they fear they 
would be forced back into veils if hekmatyar or abdul rasul sayyaf 
came to power 
sayyaf prime minister of the guerrilla government will not 
talk to female journalists and forces western women to wear 
tentlike veils in his presence 
gulzar khan pakistans commissioner for afghan refugees would 
not say what the government was doing to protect the aid agencies 
or their programs for women but said you cant wish it away 
the problems are there 
afghan women are afraid 
a young woman concealed in a voluminous shawl glanced around 
nervously before hurrying into a walled compound in peshawars maze 
of alleys 
she calls herself farida fearing to use her real name because 
she is on a list compiled by selfappointed protectors of islamic 
purity 
farida 31 runs an elementary school financed by a west german 
agency she has been threatened repeatedly by fundamentalists and 
blames radical followers of hekmatyar a bomb was found outside the 
school in 1984 and defused 
hekmatyar denies responsibility for such acts 
farida said of the radicals for 10 years ive been with these 
people they are not like humans sometimes they call me and say 
we want to kill you 
what should have been a fiveminute drive to faridas school 
took nearly half an hour because she did not want it known that a 
foreign journalist was visiting 
im afraid but i take care of myself and i want to give 
courage to the girls she said 
she goes to her school each morning in one outfit and is dressed 
differently when she leaves for two months she couldnt reach her 
home because afghan men blocked the way 
farida opened the school in 1980 with 27 students she now has 
575 girls and 363 boys taught separately 
my heart wants to help these refugee children she said 
this is the chance for afghan children 
the future for women in afghanistan is very dark the 
difficulties are many

injured them

judi bari and darryl cherney of the group earth first had been 
scheduled to be arraigned tuesday on charges of criminal possession 
of explosives 
cherneys attorney doug horngrad said the prosecutors action 
indicates the charges were groundless 
if they had a case to go forward on they would have filed 
charges today horngrad said im of the opinion there arent 
going to be any charges

nguyen van nam sat at his home at the high 
island detention center the middle tier of a threelevel bunk bed 
he shares with his wife and two children and vowed to die rather 
than return to vietnam 
if hong kong refuses to grant him refugee status he said 
through an interpreter we would rather be dead here than go back 
to vietnam 
similar responses were echoed by several other high island 
residents during interviews tuesday indicating that the days of 
tranquility for what has been a model detention center for 
vietnamese boat people may be numbered 
so far high island has been free of the rioting mass escapes 
and occasional suicide attempts that have plagued other detention 
centers for boat people since a group of 51 vietnamese were 
forceably repatriated late last year 
the government has refused to allow journalists into any 
detention center since the deportation citing safety concerns 
but in recent days small groups of journalists have been taken 
to high island in an apparent attempt by the government to put the 
best face on the camps where squalid living conditions have been 
the subject of harsh international criticism 
we have at the moment a happy camp police supt rl 
nicholls said of the facility which is in a country park about an 
hours drive from downtown hong kong but he added we dont 
think the complexion of this camp will last much longer 
a main reason that high island has remained relatively calm is 
that almost none of its residents have gone through the screening 
process that determines who will be resettled overseas and who will 
be repatriated the camp is home to almost 7000 people 
by contrast nearly 8000 of the 22000 vietnamese at the 
whitehead detention center have been informed they will not be 
granted refugee status security forces have fired tear gas to 
quell rioting and uncovered hundreds of homemade weapons at the 
camp in recent months 
the screening of high island residents is scheduled to begin 
this summer police at the facility expect some resistance and 
there are already signs of impending defiance 
ill never go back to vietnam said a 33yearold man 
surnamed tran who vowed to commit suicide if the government tries 
to force him back 
they can force me to go back to vietnam only if they tie my 
feet and hands said nguyen son ha 49 from the northern 
vietnamese province of quang ninh 
several vietnamese expressed concern about the screening 
process in which immigration officials determine who qualifies for 
refugee status to qualify for such status immigrants must prove 
they fled their homeland out of a wellfounded fear of persecution 
all high island residents interviewed by this reporter expressed 
confidence they would be screened in but more than 80 percent of 
the boat people screened so far have been rejected 
vietnamese residents confirmed that high island which opened in 
november is a relatively quiet camp with little crime but they 
complain about the quality of food the lack of books and magazines 
and what they consider harsh treatment by some police officers 
the boat people are crammed into 22 huts each family sharing a 
tiny bunkbed tier and the camp is surrounded by an approximately 
20foothigh fence topped with two loops of barbed wire 
many vietnamese lie listlessly on their beds as children scamper 
up and down the center aisle 
but nicholls points out there is more space between the huts at 
high island than at other detention centers and there is a 
basketball court and open concrete space for other games 
he said about 900 children attend classes managed by

douglas beatties final bed on a cold rainy 
night was a steel trash bin death came in the morning when the 
container was emptied into a garbage truck and the 36yearold 
drifter was crushed 
authorities were disturbed by the manner of beatties death but 
it wasnt the first time a homeless stranger had passed away 
a thousand miles away paula wyatt had been waiting for word of 
her brother for nine years since he abruptly left home he died 
without her learning what led him to flee or how he had spent the 
intervening years 
this isnt a person who wasnt loved he was loved dearly by a 
lot of people a sobbing mrs wyatt said in a telephone interview 
from her home in whitehall pa a pittsburgh suburb 
his life has been a mystery for the family he was a kind and 
gentle person he just couldnt hack it we tried so hard to 
find him and we couldnt 
beattie was something of a loner and had a drinking problem 
before he disappeared for good his two brothers and two sisters 
sometimes lost track of him during drinking binges they said 
the circumstances of his death have been so devastating that 
some family members have been told only that he died of exposure 
said mrs wyatt 
we are all carrying a lot of guilt a super amount of guilt 
she said if we had been able to reach doug it may have made a 
difference 
two years ago the family tried to track him down to inform him 
he had inherited about 15000 from his aunt said ron wyatt 
beatties brotherinlaw 
ed tutewiler of the salvation army in wausau said he has seen 
hundreds of men like beattie guys running away from themselves 
by hitting the road 
whats different is the way beattie died 
someone crushed by a garbage truck is unusual someones 
throat slit isnt tutewiler said the streets are far more 
dangerous to someone doing harm to you than a freak accident like 
this 
an autopsy found that beattie was alive when the garbage truck 
lifted the trash bin and unloaded it may 10 the autopsy couldnt 
determine whether he was conscious 
a bulldozer operator at a landfill spotted the mangled body 
among some rubbish authorities identified beattie from a card he 
carried from a post office 
all mrs wyatt knows about beatties life since he left in 1981 
is what the police told her that he had been in reno nev 
within the past two years was arrested for trespassing in oregon 
in june and arrived in wausau about may 3 
beatties family remembers him as kind to children he had 
worked as a bartender and had a talent for drawing they had hoped 
he would become an architect 
seeking to explain his problems the family said beatties 
father died when he was a baby when he was a teenager beatties 
mother barely escaped a fire that destroyed their apartment said 
ron wyatt 
beatties stay in wausau was like that of other drifters 
authorities said police officer craig dunbar found him wandering 
the streets drunk on may 3 with 2 to 3 in his pockets dunbar 
took him to a mental health center the local equivalent of the 
drunk tank in the town of 33000 
he appeared very healthy just drunk dunbar said he 
didnt seem like a bad guy a troublemaker 
after his release from the center beattie spent two nights in a 
motel courtesy of the salvation army tutewiler said on may 9 a 
roman catholic priest offered to pay for his stay at a motel 
later that evening beattie called the rev jerome hoeser from a 
restaurant telling him the motel claimed not to have a room the 
priest told beattie to call him again from the motel hoeser never 
received another call 
the motel had vacancies hoeser said but apparently mistrusted 
beattie because he didnt have id 
there was no reason why he shouldnt have been able to find a 
place the priest said

gases could build up and explode at an 
underground radioactive waste dump the government hopes to open 
this year according to a memo by an environmental protection 
agency official 
the memo was released tuesday at a hearing on the proposed waste 
isolation pilot plant which the department of energy hopes to use 
as a permanent repository for wastes from nuclear weapons plants 
the government hopes in the fall to begin a fiveyear test 
program storing waste in the underground salt beds 26 miles 
southeast of carlsbad 
the epa held tuesdays hearing to consider a variance that would 
allow doe to bypass certain hazardous waste treatment requirements 
to get the variance the doe must show the wastes would not leak 
out 
the memorandum prepared in august by ben smith of the epas 
land disposal restriction branch raises safety concerns that 
should be addressed in an independent investigation said james 
werner a spokesman for the natural resources defense council 
which released the memo 
smith wrote that lowlevel waste would probably contain acetone 
and various alcohols widely used as cleaning solvents 
if these solvents are present the possibility of 
accumulation of flammable gases in the waste storage rooms is 
significant he wrote such an explosion could kill hundreds of 
workers and destroy the 700 million repository 
smith said in an interview in todays new york times that the 
energy department had never seriously considered the threat of an 
explosion his superiors disregarded his conclusions smith said 
an epa spokesman said the agency had a consultant study the 
issue after it received smiths memo based on the consultants 
findings we didnt think there was a serious gas buildup 
explosion threat for the period were talking about said matthew 
hale an official in the epas office of solid waste 
the fiveyear program will allow epa to determine how much gas 
is generated in underground storage hale said gas buildups will 
be monitored during the period 
michele merola a spokeswoman for concerned citizens for nuclear 
safety charged that the does variance petition was being rushed 
through the epa at top speed 
an activist who identified himself as richard deyo was charged 
with disorderly conduct after jumping onto the stage at the hearing 
and upsetting the podium

state governments squeezed hard by rising 
milk orange juice and cereal prices are making cuts in a 
federally funded program that furnishes food to needy women 
infants and children 
thirtysix of 44 state governments responding to a recent survey 
said they were cutting their portions of the 21 billion special 
supplemental food program for women infants and children also 
known as wic 
the survey was taken by the national association of wic 
directors 
rep tony p hall dohio chairman of the house select 
committee on hunger said a survey by his panel came up with 
virtually the same results 
it means we wont have as many healthy children and mothers as 
we wanted because all of these people are medically at risk for 
malnutrition and anemia said hall 
the program provides poor women and their youngsters with 
vouchers redeemable at the grocery store for specific kinds of food 
in stated amounts included are milk cheese cereal juice and 
infant formula 
it provided food to a record high 455 million individuals in 
february 
the program has been a favorite with congress which has 
increased its funding every year despite demands for cutbacks in 
the reagan era hall is seeking a 150 million increase annually 
for the next five years with the first installment coming oct 1 
the extra funds once were envisioned as a way of expanding the 
program but supporters now are doubtful if we stay even well 
be lucky hall said 
rising prices for milk and to a lesser degree orange juice and 
cereal have been pinpointed as the prime sources of the budgetary 
strain 
the agriculture departments food and nutrition service had 
figured on inflation in food prices this year of a little over 4 
percent authorities said the cost of basic items have risen at 
about double the expected rate thus grants to the states have not 
been enough to maintain benefit levels 
states have found varying ways to economize 
weve talked to the states about the first measure being to 
find less expensive ways to provide the same nutrition without 
cutting volume of food or nutritional value of food said f 
philip shanholtzer a spokesman for the food and nutritional 
service 
texas has cut the cereal allowance for 1yearolds and 
2yearolds from 36 ounces a month to 24 ounces a month and will 
drop 27000 program participants those receiving benefits reached 
a peak of 357000 in january 
when prices go up on food items that means our budget wont 
go as far and we have to serve fewer people said ray krzesniak 
chief of staff services for the health departments bureau of 
women infants and children 
texas gets 148 million from usda under the program as well as 
55 million in state funds plus a hefty rebate on each can of 
infant formula 
meanwhile iowa is planning to end benefits for postpartum 
women who are not breastfeeding that would drop an estimated 
4000 participants and reduce the total of individuals receiving 
benefits to 45000 for a 400000 savings 
california plans to cut the monthly juice allotment for children 
3 years old to 5 years old for an expected savings of 12 million 
it also hopes to save 6 million by eliminating vouchers for cheese 
currently only about half of those eligible are receiving 
benefits according to bach many states are not able to provide 
food to individuals who fall into the lowest priority categories 
there are literally millions of young children who would 
qualify for wic who are not getting served bach said

the agriculture department is proposing to 
resume imports of ostriches and other flightless birds banned for 
the last nine months after exotic ticks were found on some of the 
creatures 
the african bont ticks and bontlegged ticks were found on 
ostriches imported from tanzania on aug 2 the ban went into 
effect on aug 15 
the ticks carry heartwater and east coast fever diseases that 
are not found in the united states and which do not affect humans 
but which can become established among livestock and wildlife 
the ostriches had been released from their 30day quarantine at 
a usdaapproved facility in mundelein ill without discovery of 
the problem the birds then were moved to farms in texas oklahoma 
ohio and illinois officials said there was no sign that the ticks 
had become established there 
other birds covered by the plan include cassowaries emus kiwis 
and rheas

a bill sponsored by former ku klux klan 
leader david duke to ban affirmative action easily passed the 
lousiana house 
the 6628 vote tuesday sent the measure to the senate the vote 
crossed party lines 13 representatives abstained 
you can camouflage things but racism is racism said one 
opponent democratic rep cd jones who is black 
he added you still must understand that we live in the united 
states and federal law takes precedence over the louisiana 
legislature and thank god for that 
duke a former kkk grand wizard elected to the house as a 
republican from a nearly allwhite district in 1989 argued that 
affirmative action seeks to eradicate discrimination by putting 
in a policy of discrimination 
this bill simply prohibits racial discrimination in hiring 
promotion scholarships he said there is no justification to 
discriminate against someone who works hard who is qualified for a 
job 
the 39yearold founder of the national association for the 
advancement of white people is running for us senate the state 
gop has endorsed another candidate

a bulldozer razed the mcmartin preschool 
bringing to an end a frantic search by parents for secret tunnels 
and hidden chambers where they claim their children were molested 
and engaged in satanic rituals 
some of the parents held a news conference tuesday to demand the 
state bar association investigate district attorney ira reiners 
prosecution of the case the longest and costliest criminal trial 
in us history 
raymond buckey 31 is the remaining defendant in a case dating 
to 1984 that once involved hundreds of child molestation 
allegations at the school the six other defendants were acquitted 
or charges against them were dropped 
buckey is being retried on eight molestation counts unresolved 
by a jury that acquitted his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 
in manhattan beach construction crews tuesday razed the 
singlestory school building to make way for an office building 
private investigator ted gunderson a former fbi agent hired by 
parents and others sympathetic to the alleged victims said he found 
disturbed dirt beneath the school he said it indicated tunnels 
and secret chambers once existed 
the district attorneys office conducted a similar excavation 
several years ago but found no evidence of tunnels 
the parents group who previously have criticized reiner for 
allowing the trial to stretch indefinitely without success tuesday 
attacked him for refusing to help their excavation 
we shouldnt have to be paying for this said joanne farr 
whose 12yearold daughter attended the mcmartin preschool 
reiner has defended the prosecution and said he continued the 
case out of the parents desire for justice 
parent marilyn salas said courts in california should supply a 
childs advocate to help children through testimony and to instruct 
judges and juries on how children go through the process of 
remembering events 
she said recanting and then recalling details was normal for 
children but considered unreliable by adults acquittals in the 
mcmartin case came after some of the children repeatedly changed 
their stories 
salas said parents would like the state to change its statute of 
limitations to allow children time to grow up the current statute 
gives people six years to bring charges in most crimes

education program 
the program is aimed at promoting use of newspapers in schools 
around the world to help youngsters develop lifelong reading habits 
several publishers including those from countries with the 
highest literacy rates said television is cutting into the reading 
habits of young people 
in japan for example disenchantment with newspapers is 
proceeding at a frightening pace said kazuo ichiriki chairman 
and owner of the newspaper kahoku shimpo in sendai 
japanese high school students spend an average of just six 
minutes a day reading newspapers and 20 percent of university 
students dont read newspapers daily ichiriki said 
japanese publishers began a newspaper in education program 4 
years ago said ichiriki because people from that nation were 
spending just 30 minutes a day reading and two hours a day watching 
tv about 85 percent of japanese schools now make use of newspapers 
in classroom lessons 
the programs are important not just to protect our 
selfinterest but because the future of japan could be adversely 
affected he said 
we are in a war in fighting for resources and recognitiion in 
schools said uzal h martz jr president and publisher of the 
pottsville pa republican 
in sweden newspaper readership among 9to14yearolds has 
declined slightly recently after a decade of stability largely due 
to increased television viewing said birgitta pahlen newspapers 
in education manager for the swedish newspaper publishers 
association in stockholm

the city council passed a measure outlawing 
ammunition sales during the weeks before the fourth of july and new 
years eve holidays when thousands of bullets are fired into the 
air by revelers 
eight people were wounded last new years by slugs that 
plummeted back to the earth hitting the ground at nearmuzzle 
velocity 
a spokesman for a gun owners group said the problem should be 
addressed through education not legislation 
banning ammunition sales is like trying to solve the problem 
of accidents at rush hour by prohibiting the sale of gasoline 
between 3 and 6 pm said bj johnson 
its going to be an inconvenience for the persons who love to 
stand in line just before new years eve or the fourth of july to 
buy ammunition for the purpose of discharging their weapons said 
councilman richard alatorre who sponsored the measure 
mayor tom bradley is expected to sign it

amnesty international today urged the congo to 
either try or release 26 political prisoners including a roman 
catholic priest and an expresident held in the west african state 
since 1987 
the rev joseph ndingas arrest reportedly stemmed from an order 
that church bells be sounded to warn that government forces were 
approaching to detain expresident joachim yhombyopango amnesty 
said 
some of the detainees have been accused of plotting to overthrow 
the government of president denis sassounguesso who belongs to 
the congos mbochi ethnic group all the detainees are members of a 
rival group the kouyou 
the londonbased international human rights organization said it 
had received reports that some of the detainees have been severely 
beaten in jail and it has grave doubts that they would get a fair 
trial 
the 26 prisoners mostly civilians were among some 70 members 
of the kouyou group arrested in 1987 or 1988 in the congo capital 
brazzaville or in the northern town of owando where ndinga has 
his parish amnesty said 
all the others were released without being charged before the 
end of last year 
amnesty international believes that some of the remaining 26 
are being held because of their nonviolent opposition to government 
policies or their family or ethnic connections with those accused 
of conspiring against the government the organization said in a 
report 
yhombyopango was jailed for five years without trial after he 
was deposed in 1979 he was rearrested in 1987 
amnesty said it has adopted ndinga as a prisoner of 
conscience the organization has adopted or is investigating 
3180 such prisoners worldwide people it believes have never 
advocated violence and are held purely for their political or 
religious beliefs

embassy of neighboring sierra leone where dozens sought visas

wound in the back told reporters the soldiers said they were 
looking for rebels who get their support from the gio and mano 
tribes 
when guards refused to open the gates of the compound about 5 
miles from the city center soldiers jumped the 5foot wall 
rounded tribespeople up at gunpoint and made them strip then 
loaded them naked into several military jeeps the witnesses said 
reporters who visited the compound were show a bundle of 
clothing shoes and sandals witnesses said it belonged to the 
abductees 
a woman who escaped said the soldiers were from does krahn

roadblock

shortages were worsening and prices climbing photographic studios 
also did well as people lined up for passport photographs needed to 
apply for visas

work

many monrovians said they not only fear the rebels but are also 
frightened by undisciplined government soldiers who they say are 
often drunk or drugged

mayor marion barry acknowledges in a published 
interview that he smoked crack cocaine the night of his arrest but 
he contends federal authorities tried to kill him by providing a 
potent dose 
in an interview in todays editions of the washington post the 
mayor also said he was confident he would not be convicted on drug 
and perjury charges because in this town all it takes is one 
juror saying im not going to convict marion barry 
barry said the fbi sting operation in january that led to his 
arrest was part of a long effort by federal authorities to 
discredit him 
the prosecutors have been dipping and dabbling in the politics 
of washington for a long time and its unconscionable the mayor 
was quoted as saying and then to try to kill me its 
unprecedented 
barry said the videotape that recorded the sting and his arrest 
is more damaging to the government than to me 
it shows they bought the liquor they did everything there 
they had me ingest cocaine crack cocaine which could have killed 
me i could have been dead now with 70 80 90 percent pure 
cocaine the mayor said 
judy smith a spokeswoman for the us attorney was not at home 
to comment on barrys remarks her husband said late tuesday night 
on tuesday a federal judge set the stage for barrys trial to 
begin next week when he tentatively refused to separate 14 criminal 
charges into two cases 
meanwhile close advisers were telling barry that he should 
abandon his reelection hopes and seek a deal with prosecutors 
said top city officials who spoke on the condition they not be 
identified 
but barrys campaign staff director anita bonds denied a 
report that the mayor would consider making a deal with the 
government 
barry is getting himself ready for trial plea bargaining is 
not in the picture bonds said 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson said that by 
thursday prosecutors must provide the defense with names of 
government witnesses and any previous statements those witnesses 
have made to investigators 
assistant us attorney richard roberts said prosecutors expect 
to have about 30 witnesses testify against barry 
jury selection is scheduled to start monday 
the mayor is charged with three felony counts of perjury before 
a federal grand jury in connection with his alleged involvement 
with drugs he also is accused of 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy 
barrys lawyers had asked to sever the conspiracy charge and 
five drug possession charges brought may 10 defense attorneys 
argued that the government hadnt named barrys alleged 
coconspirators and hadnt given times and places for the new 
charges 
jackson said that splitting the charges into two trials would 
create problems 
i dont know how we would pick a second jury that hadnt 
been exposed to testimony from the first trial the judge said 
barrys lawyers said they would not try to use alcoholism as a 
defense 
the defense could have called witnesses to suggest that barrys 
drinking diminished his capacity to give complete and accurate 
answers to investigators 
using such a defense would have required barry to turn over his 
medical records to the government 
barry was treated for substance abuse at clinics in florida and 
south carolina after his jan 18 arrest 
as for barrys political plans the sources said that longtime 
barry associates ivanhoe donaldson joseph yeldell and elijah 
rogers all have urged the mayor not to seek reelection in recent 
days the same men also have advised the mayor to enter plea 
negotiations the sources said 
when barry left a weekend meeting with those former aides the 
mayor was leaning against running for a fourth fouryear term 
said sources familiar with the discussion but sources also said 
that barry was far less responsive to suggestions that he negotiate 
with prosecutors 
barry campaign officials picked up petitions friday for a 
potential reelection bid the first formal step to a possible 
candidacy

rep howard coble won 600 in a pinball 
tournament rep silvio conte sold 250 worth of hay and rep 
olympia snowe got 9914 in wedding gifts 
those nuggets are among the information from the momentous to 
the trivial spread on the public record tuesday when the house 
released its annual financial disclosure forms 
the forms illustrated how for most house members the 89500 
salary the taxpayers paid them in 1989 was only part of their total 
income and they showed how widespread is the practice not only of 
accepting speaking fees from special interests but also of 
accepting expensepaid trips to make the speeches 
for example rep robert livingston rla who is on the panel 
that doles out money for defense made separate trips to california 
in february and december collecting 6000 each time from defense 
contractors rep billy tauzin dla reported 24 free trips 
during the year to speak to interest groups 
often the travel appears to be less than all work the american 
horse council paid for two days in lexington ky for rep toby 
roth rwis and his wife including tickets to the kentucky derby 
and winter speaking trips often are to destinations warmer than 
washington rep edward madigan of illinois and his wife made such 
forays to rancho mirage calif orlando fla and phoenix ariz 
two of the trips were to speak to groups affected by the house 
agriculture committee on which madigan is the senior gop member 
rep william gray dpa got five days with his wife in jamaica 
for a conference sponsored by the aspen institute which also paid 
for a separate trip for gray to bermuda 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the taxwriting ways 
and means committee was the overall speaking fee champion 
collecting 285000 during the year members are allowed to keep 
only 26850 so rostenkowski gave the rest to charity 
others receiving top dollar for speaking were gray the no 3 
house leadership figure who took in 164098 and rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo who claimed 160517 speaker thomas s foley 
dwash reported he received 32000 in honoraria and majority 
leader richard gephardt dmo reported 34500 republican whip 
newt gingrich of georgia collected 67491 and handed over 29304 
to the atlanta zoo 
as part of a bill raising their government salaries house 
members agreed that 1990 will be the last year they will receive 
honoraria senators will allow themselves lower government salaries 
than house members after this year but will keep their speaking 
fees 
among the bits of financial trivia reported tuesday 
rep olympia snowe rmaine was married during the year to 
maine gov john mckernan and listed her wedding gifts including a 
bicentennial bowl worth 310 from sen george mitchell a democrat 
according to the list she could still use three place settings in 
her china pattern shes got enough candlesticks 
rep silvio conte rmass put his total worth at 22 
million along with stock dividends and rental income he listed 
250 from the sale of hay 
rep howard coble a north carolina republican said he won 
600 in a congressional pinball tournament sponsored by the 
amusement and music operators association he said he gave it to 
charity 
rep alex mcmillan rnc wasnt required to but he kept 
track of the little goodies that flowed into his office from 
lobbyists and others in 1989 his list included books and tshirts 
pork rinds bug spray a golf umbrella and three pairs of socks 
there was an ibm paperweight a miniature television candy wine 
and two tickets to washington redskins football games total 
214538 
republican rep james sensenbrenner of wisconsin is a 
philatelist who values his stamp collection at 25000 rep bill 
archer rtexas collects coins and says his collection is worth 
more than 16000 
reps lynn martin rill and barbara kennelly dconn each 
received small oriental rugs from benazir bhutto the prime 
minister of pakistan who made a speech to a joint meeting of 
congress last year 
freshman republican rep porter m goss of florida turns out to 
also be among the wealthiest members of congress his assets are 
valued at 54 million to 109 million or more including stocks 
bonds and real estate 
in addition to their speaking fees and other honoraria members 
of congress and most other federal officials are required to 
disclose their assets not including their homes their 
investments most liabilities and gifts 
but the numbers usually are not precise because the forms 
require that values be listed only by broad category for example 
a multimilliondollar holding is reported only as worth more than 
250000

jacqueline valente freed in beirut in april after 
more than two years as a hostage was sentenced to two months in 
prison today for taking two daughters from her exhusband in 
defiance of a custody ruling 
prosecutors had requested only a onemonth suspended sentence 
during the hearing in toulon but the presiding judge andre 
fortin decided to impose a harsher penalty 
he said ms valente 32 had committed a premeditated 
kidnapping in 1983 and expressed irritation that she refused to 
answer questions about the mysterious circumstances of her own 
abduction 
ms valente was allowed to remain free pending an appeal and 
possible medical tests she was sentenced to six months in prison 
four of which were suspended 
the case dates back to august 1983 when ms valente refused to 
take her daughters marielaure and virginie back to their 
father after one of their regular visits with her 
no word was heard about ms valente and the girls until november 
1987 when a fatahrevolutionary council a libyanbacked 
palestinian group led by terrorist abu nidal declared it had 
taken them hostage along with five belgians also aboard a yacht in 
mediterranean 
the two girls were freed in 1988 and ms valente was freed 
april 10 along with her belgian companion fernand houtekins and 
their own daughter sophieliberte 
prior to the release sophieliberte had been widely described 
as a 2yearold born in captivity but relatives and others after 
meeting her in person agreed she was at least 4 leading to press 
speculation that the yacht was seized much earlier than previously 
reported 
newspapers also said that the hostages had been kept in libya 
despite their claims they were held in lebanon and had been 
abducted by the libyan navy not by abu nidals group 
ms valente and houtekins refused to discuss these matters in 
public saying they did not want to jeopardize efforts to free 
houtekins four relatives still held 
during the court proceedings ms valentes lack of substantive 
answers prompted the judge to accuse of her of bad faith she 
frequently testified she did not remember details about her 
abduction 
fortin said ms valente took the two girls out of france 
clandestinely using false passports 
and the children in all of this did you think of them he 
asked 
ms valentes exhusband pascal betille declined to comment on 
the judgment saying he wanted to minimize any adverse effects on 
the two girls 
he expressed hope that authorities would grant his request to 
cancel ms valentes visiting rights

nasa said it will be late tonight 
before engineers can pinpoint two hydrogen leaks that forced 
cancellation of todays launch of columbia and its 150 million 
observatory 
the planned 1238 am liftoff was scrubbed just six hours 
before launch after sensors detected rising levels of hydrogen gas 
in columbias engine compartment the gas leak occurred while the 
shuttles rocket propellant tank was being loaded with liquid 
hydrogen and liquid oxygen 
nasa spokesman bruce buckingham said today that all of the 
propellant must be vented from columbias big external tank before 
workers can search for the exact point of the leaks in the maze of 
plumbing in the spacecrafts aft engine compartment 
buckingham said that it will be late tonight or early thursday 
before nasa engineers know for certain what repairs are needed 
earlier nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said it will be at least 
several days before another launch attempt 
columbias seven astronauts were in their quarters several miles 
from the launch pad tuesday when the hydrogen leaks were 
discovered they were to have boarded the space shuttle about two 
hours before launch 
four of the astronauts left the kennedy space center this 
morning to fly to their home base at the johnson space center near 
houston the other three crewmen were to follow later today 
although concentrated hydrogen is highly explosive malone said 
columbia was never in an unsafe position at any time 
nasa engineers spent hours opening and closing valves and 
watching a network of sensors before finding the general area of 
the leaks about midnight one was from a 17inch valve in a pipe 
that carries fuel from the tank to the engines the other was in 
ground equipment malone said 
shuttles have three main engines that burn a propellant of 
oxygen and hydrogen the propellant chilled to a liquid is loaded 
into the external tank about five hours before launch the tank 
actually contains two vessels one for the oxygen and one for the 
hydrogen the two elements are combined in the rocket engines 
where they ignite and produce thrust 
about 5 percent of the liquid hydrogen or nearly 20000 
gallons had been pumped into the external tank when the scrub was 
announced officials said less than 25 percent of the liquid 
oxygen or 35800 gallons had been loaded 
columbia is to be the first shuttle flight in five years devoted 
entirely to scientific research 
its payload an observatory called astro will study invisible 
radiation streaming from distant stars and galaxies the crew will 
work an intense aroundtheclock schedule of observations during 
the nineday mission 
the observatory includes three telescopes that detect 
ultraviolet radiation given off by stars and planets and a fourth 
telescope that will detect xrays 
we humans look at the universe in visible light said 
lennard fisk chief nasa scientist but the universe is in fact 
bright in many other kinds of radiation and astro will allow us to 
see the universe in ultraviolet light and in xrays 
the astro instruments are in columbias cargo bay they will be 
operated remotely by astronauts on board the shuttle and by signals 
from the ground 
columbias crew includes four astronomers jeffrey a hoffman 
robert a r parker samuel t durrance and ronald parise the 
commander is vance d brand the pilot guy s gardner the seventh 
crewman john m lounge 
the astronauts also will give science instruction to 42 middle 
school students at two nasa centers the teaching will be recorded 
on videotape and distributed nationwide 
columbia also has on board a ham radio and the astronauts hope 
to talk to cosmonauts aboard the soviet space station mir and to 
operators of amateur radio stations around the world

to those who knew the frugal ways of longtime 
newspaper reporter virginia wood davis she was the last person 
they thought would leave behind a personal fortune worth 25 
million 
we thought virginia was poor she had everyone fooled 
friend and executor of the will jim taylor said this week i have 
cursed and fussed and just asked why virginia why 
until shortly before she died of cancer on feb 1 at the age of 
70 all she appeared to have was her twobedroom house here a few 
household and personal belongings and her ford truck 
but before her death ms davis put about 21 million into 
certificates of deposit divided among her friends in a will she 
bequeathed 80 percent of the remaining 400000 to the journalism 
department at her alma mater western kentucky university 
she also left a 194page typewritten account of her life her 
own eulogy and instructions for her cremation 
ms davis had been a reporter and editor since 1943 she worked 
for 13 newspapers including the tampa times the tampa tribune 
the st petersburg times and the pasco news in dade city her last 
job was with the mccreary co record in whitley city ky 
at the end of her career in the early 1980s she earned 325 a 
week 
friends and relatives say she saved money and denied herself 
even the most basic comforts 
ms davis clothing appeared to be second hand and most of the 
vehicles she drove had seen better days 
to beat grocery store prices ms davis would go to nearby 
fields and pick unharvested leftovers 
virginia could not stand to see any of the vegetables go to 
waste but some of the stuff was not any good said friend 
pauline mccall she insisted on picking it 
ms mccall believes her friend saved fanatically because she was 
afraid she would be faced with a major emergency and wouldnt be 
able to handle it 
we just all accepted virginia for who she was taylor said

soviet patrol boats have arrested 170 japanese 
fishermen caught aboard north korean vessels and moscow will 
reportedly put the men on trial for malicious poaching in 
soviet waters 
the incident in the north pacific has proved potentially 
embarrassing to the japanese government and revealed further 
strains in the alliance between north korea and the soviet union 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said today the 
japanese embassy in moscow began inquiries into the seizure about 
10 days ago 
japan and north korea have no diplomatic relations but the 
unfolding saga has revealed a burgeoning relationship between the 
two countries fishermen 
among the 202 crew members on the vessels were 170 japanese the 
officers and other crew members were north koreans japanese 
authorities said 
the japanese coast guard said a soviet naval vessel escorted 
eight of the seized fishing boats early today to port in the 
sovietheld island of shikotan in the kuril chain 45 miles off the 
northern japanese island of hokkaido 
the japan broadcasting corp quoted a soviet official in moscow 
as saying the fishermen would be tried on shikotan within five 
days such incidents usually are settled by fines or confiscation 
of fishing boats 
japan has an agreement to take 11000 tons of soviet salmon a 
year and regularly fills that quota it was not immediately clear 
what advantage the japanese fishing company shoho fisheries co 
gained from fishing under the north korean flag 
a fishery official who demanded anonymity said north korea had 
no agreement to capture soviet salmon in the north pacific fishing 
waters 
soviet authorities have accused north korea of malicious 
poaching of salmon that spawned in soviet rivers kyodo news 
service reported from moscow 
agreement on a quota is required before a countrys vessels can 
take salmon that originated in another countrys rivers said 
tatsuaki maeda a hokkaido university professor who specializes in 
fishing territories 
it is still illegal to go fishing in soviet territory under 
the north korean flag and in that sense i dont understand the 
merit of sending disguised japanese ships over there maeda 
said 
he said however that it was possible the japanese fishermen 
might have thought there would be no problem since north korea and 
the soviet union are allies such a deal also could have given the 
north koreans muchdesired foreign currency he said 
maeda said several countries have fished salmon on the high seas 
without quota agreements and have been overlooked for years paying 
no penalties and angering fishermen from countries bound by quota 
agreements 
the nonquota fishing countries include north and south korea 
and taiwan he said 
the north koreanflagged ships were seized outside the 200mile 
soviet zone the foreign ministry said but under international 
rules migratory fish such as salmon belong to the country where 
they were spawned 
a spokesman for a hokkaido fishing company kitajima fisheries 
said his companys vessel was one of those hired out through 
another japanese company to provide technical guidance to the 
north koreans we are not poaching fish said the spokesman 
who refused to have his name used 
the soviet embassy in tokyo declined to comment today on the 
case

two brothers separated when their adoptive 
parents returned one of them to an orphanage will be allowed to 
visit each other the couple has decided after a legal battle 
a tentative agreement reached tuesday will allow the boys to 
visit weekly with flexibility for scheduling conflicts or for the 
changing desires of the children 
the older boy identified only as 11yearold tony was given up 
by a suburban bellwood couple after six years about six months ago 
when the couple said they could not form an emotional attachment to 
the boy 
when the boy later asked to see his 8yearold biological 
brother who was still living with the couple the couple declined 
saying they were afraid the older boy was emotionally unstable and 
potentially violent 
tuesdays settlement appeared to end three months of court 
battles seeking to allow visitation between the two boys an april 
court order allowed visits but the couple went back to court to 
stop the visits making new claims about the older boys violent 
tendencies 
cook county public guardian patrick murphy representing the 
older boy countered with demands that the parents undergo 
psychological testing and provide depositions documenting the older 
boys behavior 
murphy said tuesday the latest demands were dropped and he was 
satisfied with the agreement 
its what we originally asked for he said 
murphy who had filed a lawsuit seeking 50000 in emotional 
damages from the parents also agreed to drop the lawsuit 
the emotional harm was for refusal to grant visits murphy 
said this negates that 
the older boy originally returned to the hephzibah childrens 
association orphanage is now living with a foster family in 
suburban oak park

arab leaders today called for political and 
economic sanctions against nations that recognize jerusalem as the 
capital of israel and they denounced us policies in the middle 
east 
they also promised to take action against countries that support 
the emigration of soviet jews to israel and israels continued 
control of the occupied territories a palestine liberation 
organization spokesman said 
however the arab leaders statement at the end of their summit 
meeting did not contain the harsh condemnation of us policy that 
iraq the plo and other arab hardliners had demanded egypt and 
saudi arabia led the moderates 
winding up the threeday summit the arab leaders also pledged 
to take united action to ensure the worlds 5 million palestinians 
gain an independent state they said arab east jerusalem should be 
its capital 
in their closing communique today the representatives of 16 
arab nations said the summit affirmed that the arab powers will 
take political and economic measures against whichever country 
recognizes jerusalem as the capital of israel it did describe 
the measures or name nations to be targeted 
the purpose for which the conference was convened has been 
realized yasser abedrabbo a member of the plos ruling 
execuive council told reporters he also said in an earlier 
session with reporters that the arab leaders called for sanctions 
against countries that encourage the emigration of soviet jews to 
israel and the israeli occupation of arab land 
the summit hardliners had demanded tough action to block the 
expected emigration of as many 750000 soviet jews to israel in the 
next few years the influx began after us officials tightened 
immigration quotas and soviet authorities relaxed their rules for 
travel to israel 
the moderates have been arguing against using the arabs 
economic wealth as a political weapon and they have been battling 
to avoid provoking tension amid the climate of uncertainty in the 
volatile middle east 
it was not clear whether the proposed sanctions would involve 
disrupting arab oil exports as iraq has proposed but most 
analysts believe it is unlikely that the arab producers will impose 
an oil embargo as they did in 1973 to protest western support for 
israel in the october war of that year 
abedrabbo said the leaders agreed to form a committee of the 
foreign and economic ministers of the 21member arab league to 
draft within two months a detailed plan of action that links the 
political and economic relations with other countries to their 
policy toward the arab cause 
abedrabbo leads the plo delegation that has been negotiating 
with the united states in tunis tunisia since plo chairman yasser 
arafat publicly renounced terrorism and recognized israels right 
to exist in november 1988 
israeli immigration officials said sunday they expect up to 
20000 soviet jews a month with 150000 arriving in the jewish 
state this year 
the current influx of soviet jews to israel is coming mainly 
through hungary poland finland and austria 
the arabs fear that the unrestricted immigration of large 
numbers of soviet jews to israel will undermine peace efforts they 
are also concerned that many of the soviet jews will be settled in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip forcing out hundreds 
of thousands of palestinians 
the occupied territories seized by israel in 1967 were 
designated an independent palestinian state by the plos 
parliamentinexile the palestine national council in 1988 the 
israelis also seized jerusalem in the 1967 war and later annexed it 
in the closing statement the arab leaders condemned the us 
house and senate for supporting israels claim to jerusalem as its 
eternal capital 
they made the statement even though the united states officially 
recognizes tel aviv as israels capital us policy is that the 
status of jerusalem must be negotiated 
however the summit stopped short of a threatened denunciation 
of the us administration for supporting israel and being biased 
against the arabs 
the summit also paid tribute to the 30monthold palestinian 
uprising in the israelioccupied lands 
the leaders stressed the necessity of extending official and 
public assistance materially and politically until the ultimate 
objective is achieved and the palestinian state is created in 
the west bank and gaza

boris n yeltsin the newly elected president of 
the russian republic sat down with 130 legislators today to 
negotiate the makeup of a coalition government for the largest 
soviet republic 
legislators said yeltsin immediately came under pressure to 
retain as russian prime minister alexander vlasov a member of the 
communist party politburo who had been yeltsins rival in tuesdays 
balloting for president 
yeltsin opened todays meeting in a businesslike fashion and set 
only one limit asking that one of his deputies be a woman 
legislators said 
yeltsin a frequent critic of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and his gradual reforms was reported to have gained the 
last few votes he needed by offering to guarantee a place in his 
government for other factions 
although most of the russian legislators are communist party 
members they range from radical reformers like yeltsin to 
hardliners unhappy with even the more modest innovations of 
gorbachev 
yeltsin won his new job tuesday on the third ballot in the 
russian congress of peoples deputies 
yeltsin poses a substantial challenge to gorbachev both through 
his personal popularity and his demand that much authority be 
transferred from gorbachevs central government to the republics 
that would greatly increase his power since russia is the 
largest republic with 52 percent of the soviet unions 289 million 
people and threequarters of its land 
the strapping whitehaired siberian said tuesday he would seek 
reconciliation with gorbachev and avoid confrontation with him as 
long as it would not hurt russias interests 
he took the first step in that direction today meeting in the 
ornate st georges hall of the grand kremlin palace with 
representatives of each political faction and each ethnic region in 
the russian federation 
yeltsin asked for two to three nominations for each ministerial 
post in the russian government he said the candidates would be 
presented to the full russian congress for confirmation starting 
thursday it was not clear how such a system would lead to the 
delicate balance of political forces and personalities typical of a 
coalition government in the west 
the session was closed to reporters after the first few minutes 
legislators said the talks were not aimed at parceling out 
portfolios in the council of ministers to specific political 
parties or factions 
we dont really have hard political divisions like that right 
now explained igor bratishev an economist and deputy from 
rostovondon who participated in todays meeting with 130 
legislators arrayed around a vast rectangle under the ornate 
vaulted ceiling of st georges hall 
so far 24 legislative groups have registered including 
yeltsins own democratic russia and one called communists of 
russia but the majority have a narrow focus such as ecology 
medical workers and legislators concerned with the problems of 
refugees 
the socalled conciliation committee is seeking a consensus 
on candidates for prime minister and the three assistants to 
yeltsin said vladimir ivanov a legislator from buryatia near lake 
baikal in siberia 
people want yeltsin to suggest vlasov for prime minister 
ivanov said 
the committee representing each political group and each ethnic 
region in the russian federation is examining candidates personal 
qualifications and morale convictions bratishev said 
in ottawa canada on tuesday gorbachev told reporters he was 
somewhat concerned about yeltsins victory but encouraged by 
the new russian presidents vow to settle divisions in the congress 
and work with the kremlin leadership 
if however he is playing a political game then we may be in 
for a difficult time gorbachev said 
gorbachev who was to arrive in washington today for a summit 
with president bush spent days watching the struggle for control 
of the russian congress he even took the floor to speak against 
yeltsin 
yeltsin and many soviets said the election could help advance 
reforms in the soviet union 
it may be a blessing in disguise soviet foreign ministry 
spokesman gennady gerasimov told reporters at the united nations in 
new york gorbachev has his critics from both the left and the 
right and possibly it is better to have the election of a critic 
from the left 
vitaly churkin another foreign ministry spokesman said 
yeltsins election might actually help gorbachev because 
gorbachev is for radical reform and he needs more popular support 
for that 
gorbachev brought yeltsin to moscow to head the citys communist 
party but the two men fell out over yeltsins public criticism in 
1987 of the pace of reform and have been at odds ever since 
as president of the russian congress a newly created body that 
holds the russian federations highest government authority 
yeltsin acts as chief executive of the republic 
as the first president of a newly reorganized legislature he 
will play a major role in shaping his powers and duties which as 
yet are unclear

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in a 
bid to expand soviet contacts with industrialized countries will 
meet in san francisco after the washington summit with south korean 
president roh taewoo us officials said today 
the two countries have no formal diplomatic relations and the 
soviets maintain strong ties with north korea which conducted a 
brief and nowsuspended dialogue with the prous government in 
seoul 
gorbachev is struggling to get a grip on the soviet economy as 
he left moscow for talks beginning on thursday with president bush 
the soviet capital and other cities were experiencing panic buying 
in anticipation of broad price hikes pegged to adoption of a market 
system 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
meeting with roh would be held while gorbachev was in san francisco 
as part of his sightseeing expedition after the summit talks 
concluded on sunday 
gorbachev also is stopping in minneapolis after his four days in 
washington 
the meeting is the most dramatic gesture by the soviets toward 
south korea a foe for more than 40 years of moscowbacked north 
korea 
moscow is emerging as a promising trading partner for south 
korea and trade and other relations are expanding rapidly 
in december 1989 the soviet union and south korea opened 
consular departments in their trade offices in each others 
capitals and began limited consular service 
the arrangement restricts the functions of the departments and 
the qualifications of officials working there the departments 
cannot fly national flags and officials working there are denied 
normal diplomatic privileges 
in march south korean news reports said the soviet union has 
proposed opening full consular ties with south korea as a prelude 
to establishing formal diplomatic relations 
the proposal from soviet officials came as kim youngsam leader 
of south koreas governing party visited moscow and said his 
countrys basic position is to move directly to formal diplomatic 
ties without going through an intermediary step the news reports 
said 
south korean foreign minister choi hojoong signed an agreement 
in prague in march establishing formal diplomatic relations with 
czechoslovakia last year poland and hungary set up ties with 
south korea 
the bush administration which has been encouraging dialogue 
between the two koreas welcomed the return monday by north korea 
of the remains of five american servicemen killed in the korean 
conflict 
it was the first return of american remains in 36 years by north 
korea north koreas ambassador to the united nations ho jong 
said in an interview published sunday that his country wants 
practical measures to improve usnorth korean relations 
the new north korean attitude appeared to be linked to moscows 
previous efforts to expand contacts with south korea us 
officials have said north korea may also be concerned that the 
turmoil within the soviet union could threaten the largescale 
assistance moscow provides to that country

a flower grower and seven other people are 
charged with enslaving more than 100 undocumented workers from 
mexico and forcing them to work long hours at petty wages 
lured by promises of good pay the mexicans were smuggled into 
the united states then kept at the 50acre ranch until they could 
pay off a 435 smuggling fee according to a federal grand jury 
indictment issued tuesday 
the ranch operators beat workers and threatened to alert 
immigration authorities if they tried to leave the compound which 
was surrounded by a 7foot fence the indictment alleged 
ranch owner edwin m ives 54 and five other people face up to 
52 years in prison and 2 million in fines if convicted of all 15 
charges in the indictment federal prosecutors said 
the charges involve labor and civil rights violations and a 
federal antislavery statute said assistant us attorney carol 
gillam 
two ranch foremen naju lnu and paringer singh were named in a 
criminal complaint filed last month 
this is a very significant case that involves very serious 
violations of peoples human rights gillam said the charges 
were developed based on allegations by former workers and ranch 
documents gillam said 
ives attorney robert m talcott has maintained that ives was 
not aware of any abuses at his griffith ives co ranch in somis in 
ventura county about 50 miles northwest of downtown los angeles 
the indictment alleges that ives supervised the ranch operation 
and on one occasion personally recruited an undocumented worker and 
told another that he could not leave the ranch until his smuggling 
fees were paid 
prosecutors maintain the workers toiled 16 hours a day for a 
fraction of the 425perhour minimum wage in addition workers 
were required to buy food and basic staples from a company store at 
inflated prices the indictment said 
as a result of these deductions the alien workers often 
received net pay for over 160 hours of work in a 15day period of 
less than 100 and in some cases actually no pay because the 
deductions exceeded the amount of the paycheck the indictment 
said 
one worker allegedly suffered permanent head and back injuries 
during a beating ives refused to pay for treatment in the united 
states and instead gave the worker 100 to help pay for treatment 
in mexico the indictment said 
also named in the indictment were pedro pinzon 30 rony havive 
30 alvaro ruiz 39 josue david pinzon 23 and the alleged 
smuggler mauro casares 64

the president of the illinois national 
organization for women says the groups endorsement of sen paul 
simon was only intended as a recommendation to the national now 
on tuesday illinois now president kim villanueva said the 
groups state political action committee enthusiastically and 
wholeheartedly endorses paul simon in his reelection campaign 
against rep lynn martin rill 
but later tuesday national now president molly yard issued a 
statement saying the only now group authorized to endorse in 
federal elections is the national now pac 
informed of yards statement villanueva said illinois now 
actually was recommending that nows national political action 
committee endorse simon a democrat 
i think that was an inaccuracy on my part villanueva said 
tuesday i should have explained it further 
yard said the national now pac would consider the illinois 
groups recommendation for a simon endorsement at its next meeting 
the senate race in illinois has posed a problem for womens 
groups who have to choose between a woman and a male longtime ally 
the national abortion rights action league on tuesday endorsed 
simon because of his strong prochoice stand spokeswoman renee 
cravens said simon is a cosponsor of a bill that would write the 
us supreme courts roe vs wade decision into federal law 
paul simon is a strong leader in the senate and we want to 
keep him there cravens said 
at the now news conference simon said he has a stronger record 
on womens issues than martin 
independent womens groups are looking at the record of both 
lynn martin and myself and to my knowledge every independent 
womens group that is taking a stand is either endorsing me or 
staying neutral simon said 
reacting to the illinois nows recommended endorsement of simon 
martin said throughout my years in congress i have never 
received the endorsement of illinois now 
if i must support mandated quotas budgetbusting amendments 
and other extreme positions as now does in order to win their 
endorsement then hats off to paul simon

a californiabased evangelist may be the 
next owner of the defunct ptl ministrys assets including its 
satellite tv network and the heritage usa christian retreat a 
newspaper reported today 
the charlotte nc observer quoted unidentified sources as 
saying morris cerullo 58 an assemblies of god pastor who heads 
worldwide evangelism inc based in san diego has offered 52 
million for ptls remaining assets 
cerullos organization also has branches in great britain 
canada israel and zimbabwe 
a woman who answered the phone at cerullos organization today 
said he was out of town and could not be reached for comment 
hes not available and i have no one else who is available 
said the woman who declined to give her name 
ptl bankruptcy trustee dennis shedd did not immediately return a 
call today he has confirmed he is negotiating with a major 
party 
earlier this month shedd signed a contract to sell ptls 
television network to evangelist oral roberts for 6 million unless 
someone else agreed to buy all the assets as a package deal 
shedd was scheduled to ask us bankruptcy judge thurmond bishop 
on thursday to approve the contract with roberts but he said that 
if he accepts the broader offer he will recommend throwing out the 
roberts deal 
the home box office cable television network has asked the 
bankruptcy court in columbia to block the sale to roberts saying 
it doubts he has the resources to make the 242000 monthly lease 
payments for the use of a satellite controlled by hbo 
in court papers hbo cited the widely reported economic 
turmoil of the oral roberts organization hbo also argued that 
shedd had no right to transfer the satellite lease 
ptl has been in bankruptcy proceedings since june 1987 two 
months after founder jim bakker resigned in the wake of a 
sexandmoney scandal involving church secretary jessica hahn 
bakker is serving a 45year term in a federal prison at rochester 
minn on convictions last year of fraud and conspiracy 
although the ptl network still operates carrying other 
evangelists programs heritage usa has been closed since 
september the 500acre retreat near fort mill has five 
restaurants a 10 million water park and two 500room hotels one 
of them unfinished it also includes about 1700 undeveloped acres 
last year toronto businessman stephen mernick failed to close 
on his 65 million deal to buy ptl because he could not get title 
insurance for the heritage usa property the land is part of an 
unsettled claim by the catawba indians who have filed suit 
contending 144000 acres of land was illegally sold to the state in 
1840

the contra rebels agreed today to 
resume disbanding after the new government promised to set aside 
rural areas where they can live police themselves and join town 
councils 
the agreement was contained in an accord drafted by the 
government and contras on tuesday night and signed early today 
the contras agreed to try to finish disbanding by june 10 a 
deadline set in a may 19 accord the government of president violeta 
barrios de chamorro 
that accord broke down when the contras stopped disarming 
saying the chamorro government was not fulfillig its commitments to 
provide food housing jobs and security for fighters who lay down 
their weapons 
on tuesday the rebels and the government resumed talks 
suspended friday after the guerrillas announced an alleged massacre 
of 14 disbanded fighters no evidence of any such attack has 
surfaced 
there were misunderstandings but misunderstandings are solved 
by talking and what we want as nicaraguans is peace and 
reconciliation chamorro said at a dawn news conference 
israel galeano the top contra commander said there was no 
reason the demobilization should not resume the usbacked rebels 
fought a nineyear war with the former leftist sandinista 
government which left office on april 25 
under the agreement announced late tuesday but signed today the 
rebels were to demobilize a considerable number of combatants 
in honor of mothers day celebrated today in nicaragua 
they also said they would demobilize at least 100 rebels a day 
in each of the five security zones where the 13000strong 
guerrilla force has concentrated if the deadline is to be met 
however the number of rebels disarming would have to be at least 
200 daily in each zone 
so far fewer than 2000 rebels have turned in their weapons to 
united nations and organization of american states missions 
supervising the demobilization process 
in exchange for the demobilization the government agreed to 
establish more than 20 rural development centers rebels who are 
largely peasants will also be given priority in recovering 
farmlands confiscated by the sandinistas 
under the latest accord a police force staffed by demobilized 
combatants will be created immediately the force which will 
police only development centers will fall under the goverment 
ministry 
the contras were to be represented in the government of 
resettlement areas they were also to be represented in government 
ministries that deal with the resettlements 
in the development zones the rebels are to integrate themselves 
back into peaceful civilian life most of the zones will be in war 
zones around the country but the exact areas have not yet been 
determined

a key soviet military figure was bound for 
washington today in an 11thhour drive to forge agreements on 
nuclear and conventional weapons for president bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to announce at their summit meeting 
the imminent arrival of col gen labronislav omelichev first 
deputy on the soviet defense ministrys general staff was viewed 
by us officials as a move by moscow to settle some of the issues 
that have eluded us and soviet negotiators over four days of 
talks 
omelichev a specialist on strategic nuclear weapons was 
considered instrumental in the headway the two superpowers made in 
negotiations here in february 
the current negotiations at the state department got a 
presummit boost on tuesday with an agreement on how to define 
tanks and armored personnel carriers this will help in carrying 
out cutbacks in us and soviet arsenals in europe and also in 
verifying compliance with an eventual arms reduction treaty 
but us officials disclosing omelichevs imminent arrival 
said there was no breakthrough on a halfdozen strategic nuclear 
weapons issues nor they said have the negotiators settled on a 
definition of combat aircraft the key sticking point in the 
conventional arms arena despite the presence of the top soviet 
negotiator oleg a grinevsky 
there is ample agreement on enough strategic weapons reductions 
to allow bush and gorbachev to issue a declaration during the 
fourday summit which begins on thursday 
bush also intends to press the soviet leader to revitalize the 
stalled negotiations between the north atlantic treaty organization 
and the warsaw pact in vienna austria on reductions in troops and 
nonnuclear weapons 
apart from disagreement over combat aircraft the united states 
is pushing to limit planes that the soviets insist are defensive in 
nature the soviets are reluctant to complete the accord without 
assurances that a unified germany would not pose a threat to peace 
in europe 
us officials insisting on anonymity said bush was prepared 
to tell the soviet leader that the western allies would consider 
limits on the new german army but only as part of a deal in which 
soviet troops would be curbed within the soviet union

milwaukees roman catholic archbishop rembert

pastoral letter on women is so unsatisfactorey that it might as 
well be abandoned 
in a column in the archdiocesan weekly catholic herald he said 
the very credibility of the document comes into question in 
treating the issue of womens ordination 
he said that the document emphasizes womens equality but fails 
to deal with the traditional link between church authority and 
ordination a role the document rejects for women as does the pope 
it is easy to see the bind the authors are in weakland 
wrote however since the letter avoids a basic question involved

sen david durenberger one of seven senators 
facing ethics investigations today disclosed that he accepted free 
lodging at the florida condominium of a friend for each of the past 
three winters 
durenberger said he accepted the christmastime gifts from robert 
windom a former official in the department of health and human 
services aides said the gifts were inadvertently omitted from 
financial information material the minnesota republican filed in 
previous years 
durenberger disclosed the vacation gifts as he and 99 other 
senators made an annual public accounting of their finances 
as in previous years lawmakers reported accepting thousands of 
dollars in speaking fees to supplement their salary also disclosed 
were hundreds of trips many abroad for which lawmakers were 
reimbursed by special interests political organizations and think 
tanks 
the reports also show that senate majority leader george 
mitchell boosted his income by 50000 last year by making paid 
speeches while republican leader bob dole more than doubled that by 
accepting 108900 in honoraria 
mitchell donated 11000 of his honoraria to charity to keep 
within senate standards for outside income while dole gave away 
73150 to fall below the limits the reports show 
dole reported assets worth considerably more than mitchells but 
the worth of both was dwarfed by the numerous multimillionaires in 
the senate workplace of a rockefeller kennedy and the several 
heirs to family fortunes 
sen john heinz rpa for example reported assets valued at 
137 million to 1725 million or higher among them 45 holdings 
listed as being worth over 250000 large blocks of stock in 
the food giant hj heinz co are a considerable chunk of his 
holdings 
in addition to the vacation stays durenbergers amendments 
reported a 484000 loan he had not previously disclosed in his 
senate reports but which has been previously reported in the media 
durenberger reported accepting 62185 in honoraria last year 
and said he gave 26400 to charity to meet senate limits for 
keeping honoraria 
another of the members under investigation california democrat 
alan cranston reported accepting no honoraria last year in keeping 
with a pledge he made in late 1988 cranstons investment and real 
estate holdings supplemented his 89500 senate salary handsomely 
and he also reported being reimbursed for trips to jamaica 
switzerland and yugoslavia 
mitchells report shows him to be a man of relatively modest 
assets he kept 39000 of his honoraria to supplement his 99500 
annual senate salary and received a 5000 award from bowdoin 
college in his native maine 
besides his washington home which mitchell said was purchsed in 
late 1988 for 320000 his only reported assets were bank accounts 
worth from 17005 to 55000 he said he had no liabilities 
mitchel reported reimbursements for 15 trips all within the united 
states and several to speak to democratic party groups he also was 
paid 22500 in book royalties 
dole reported assets worth 345297 to 809277 and no 
liabilities the value of the assets cannot be determined precisely 
because members are required to list their worth only in ranges 
for example an asset worth 10000 would be listed only as being 
worth 5001 to 15000 and a 1 million asset as being worth 
over 250000 his 108900 in 1989 honoraria was up from 
67750 in 1988 when he gave 31750 to charity 
this is the last year house member can accept honoraria but the 
senate has not taken any action to end the controversial practice 
house members were allowed to keep honoraria up to 30 percent of 
their salary or 26850 for most members senators can keep up to 
40 percent of their salary 35800 for most members and 39800 
for members of the leadership 
as majority whip cranston falls third in the democratic 
leadership behind mitchell and senate president pro tempore robert 
byrd 
cranston one of the socalled keating five under 
investigation for intervening with regulators on behalf of 
california savings and loan owner charles keating announced in 
late 1988 he no longer would accept honoraria 
the california democrat reported 1989 income of 330797 to 
571485 supplementing his 89500 senate salary with rent 
interest and dividends from investments and real estate holdings 
he also received 18253 in social security benefits also among 
his assets was a blind trust valued at over 250000 
byrd on the other hand reported 1989 income of 132203 to 
154693 supplementing his 99500 senate salary with 19500 in 
honoraria he also received 12080 in royalties for a country 
music record on which he plays fiddle and said he accepted a 
rocking chair valued at 465 from the west virginia forestry 
association 
doles top deputy republican whip alan k simpson of wyoming 
reported 1989 income of 229900 to 248100 he said he accepted 
90600 and gave 55100 of that total to charity simpson was paid 
40000 to do the face off radio program he conducts with sen

the clarionledger jackson miss on the federal energy 
regulatory commission 
a recent us supreme court decision should slap some sense into 
congress about the frankenstein monster of the federal energy 
regulatory commission 
voting 90 the court struck down california regulations aimed 
at assuring survival of trout in the american river and rock creek 
a small tributary 
the court said the federal power act preempts californias 
streamflow regulations 
so with one fell swoop of the pen california its citizens and 
its elected representatives have no say over their wildlife or 
streams or the environment they live in if ferc has an interest in 
the matter 
that cannot possibly be the intent of congress that ferc can 
decide the fate of fish and wildlife in a state without the 
citizens input runs counter to the most basic notions of civil 
government thats fascism 
congress must rein in this agencyrunamok

los angeles times on clean air bills 
two versions of a federal clean air act now heading for 
conference on capitol hill should make many americans breathe 
easier 
for now and for president bush the 40120 house vote for 
the bill with his marks all over it is the tidiest victory of 
his presidency 
and bush got everything he asked for and then some 
both the senate and house approved the pioneering program to 
control acid rain that is killing lakes and forests in canada and 
the northeastern united states 
both bills call for 10millionton reductions in sulfur dioxide 
emissions 
both versions went along with the bush idea to give utilities 
that make an extra effort to cut emissions pollution credits that 
they could save for future use or sell to other companies 
and toxic emissions from chemical plants and other polluters 
would fall by as much as 70 percent to 90 percent 
in one example of what makes the house bill by far the 
preferable one the senate version dictates precisely how crude oil 
must be refined to make cleaner gasoline it seems when 
politicians start practicing chemistry strange things happen the 
senate formula would in effect make carbonmonoxidereducing 
ethanol most commonly make from corn the only gasoline additive 
that could raise its oxygen content to stipulated levels this 
might make senators from corn states more interested in clean air 
but ethanol also increases emissions of the basic ingredients of 
smog and for southern california and many other urban areas that 
is bad 
the bills could cost american industry and consumers 20 billion 
a year so writing the clean air act was a bruising process and 
its not over yet 
but at this point it looks like winners all around

the hudson dispatch union city nj on wellesley students 
protesting barbara bush as their commencement speaker 
a group of seniors at wellesley college gave the nations 
newspaper columnists an early christmas a few weeks ago by 
expressing their patrician outrage at the selection of barbara bush 
as commencement speaker at the massachusetts school they 
petitioned school officials to boot the first lady off the platform 
arousing a furious chorus of howls from the columnists 
how exactly did they do it they said this 
wellesley teaches us that we will be rewarded on the basis of 
our own merit not that of a spouse to honor barbara bush as a 
commencement speaker is to honor a woman who has gained recognition 
through the achievements of her husband which contradicts what we 
have been taught over the last four years at wellesley 
the customary response to this irritating sneer has been to 
point out that mrs bush left smith college to become a wife and 
mother and a homemaker and if that isnt what americas all about 
by golly then what is 
if the wellesley seniors are saying theyd never stoop so low to 
marry a millionaire and dont want to listen to a lady who did 
well fine theyre certainly more intellectually consistent than 
their colleges administration if theyre saying that they wish to 
consider only the sort of futures and realities in which they not 
husbands will be at center stage well thats their prerogative

shawano wis evening leader on standards for door openers 
its time for the federal government to impose standards on 
automatic garage door openers 
too many of these openers are killing and maiming youngsters 
throughout the united states 
currently manufacturers of garage door openers are not required 
to meet underwriter laboratory standards for automatic reverses 
such mechanisms automatically reverse the downward motion of garage 
doors if something impedes their progress 
most of the time the item struck by the closing garage door is 
a bike or a ball or some other object in increasingly alarming 
numbers however children are being caught under the doors 
when functional reverses are in place the garage door pops 
right back up and little damage is done yet some experts think 
that up to 50 percent or half of all automatic garage doors 
installed in the us today do not have reverses or have 
reverses that for one reason or another are not in working 
condition 
as more homeowners install automatic garage door openers the 
danger to children increases to deal with this growing problem and 
prevent future harm we believe the us products safety commission 
should mandate standards for reversing mechanisms on all new 
automatic garage door openers

the providence ri journalbulletin on radio free europe 
theres been some talk in washington lately about closing radio 
free europe the notion behind this is that eastern and central 
europes democratic revolutions are so well entrenched that the 
need for an honest and prodemocratic voice to beam news about 
national and regional events into the area is no longer necessary 
thats ridiculous 
soviet troops still reside in much of the region indeed it was 
recently disclosed that the modest withdrawal of soviet troops from 
east germany that had been under way has been suspended without 
explanation at the same time soviets have made contradictory 
remarks about armscontrol negotiations 
and perhaps most ominous is that communist bureaucrats of 
totalitarian and conspiratorial bent are still comfortably in place 
throughout eastern europe many are doing what they can to sabotage 
the political and economic reforms being attempted by the democrats 
who are officially in charge of these bureaucracies 
the voice of america chartered to tell the story of the united 
states abroad does a fine job but it isnt specifically organized 
to promote democracy in eastern and central europe for that task 
the region still needs radio free europe which has been a 
messenger of hope to millions of people

candidates cesar gaviria promised a battle without mercy the 
others spoke of dialogue or even of ending the caprices of 
the united states meaning the extradition of the traffickers 
the government cannot be ready to do battle against this

mainichi shimbun tokyo on statements about korea by emperor 
akihito and prime minister toshiki kaifu 
the apology clarified it was japan that had caused the 
unfortunate past and a feeling of pain and regret for hurting 
korean people was indicated as the emperors honest feeling 
behind the prime ministers comments is an apology from each 
japanese national and a severe sense of selfcriticism 
however it is not a problem that only words can solve japan 
should have 120 percent understanding of the past and promise the 
establishment of fruitful partnership between japan and south korea 
we need to realize that we only reached the starting point where 
we should begin solving the core problems left between japan and 
south korea 
it is natural for koreans to think that japan has never felt 
pains of victims or guilt as the assailant because japan has been 
lazily delaying solution while showing no sincere efforts 
the important thing is to have a firm recognition of history and 
an effort to pass it to the next generation which is largely 
missing here 
we need education to have people learn true history

the nation bangkok thailand on saturdays parliamentary 
election in burma 
while there was widespread pessimism at first that the election 
would be far from free and fair early reports indicated 
minimal intimidation or vote rigging in the polls that could leave 
the national league for democracy of aung san suu kyi with a 
majority 
this is as much a resounding victory for the nld as a damning 
testimony against the military dictatorship of gen saw maung which 
seized power in a coup in september 1988 that left thousands of 
prodemocracy demonstrators dead 
loudly and clearly the people in burma are airing their desire 
to end the choking status quo 
they have done this legally through the ballot 
now that the military has allowed the world to see what the 
majority of people really desire they have placed themselves in the 
open 
the ball now is in the court of the military after so many 
years in power the military apparatus is in a consolidated position 
of privilege 
even if they want to give up their rule they will want a 
guarantee that they would not be left out in the cold 
the nld landslide triumph and the euphoria of the people should 
not necessarily be considered the end of the repressive period it 
is in fact the beginning of the ordeal over how burma will develop 
so that the people and the military can coexist peacefully without 
fear or repression

the indian express new delhi on the burma election 
the people of burma have repudiated the ruling military junta 
in no uncertain terms in the justconcluded elections but the 
establishment soon of a genuine democratic setup for which they 
have given a resounding vote cannot still be taken for granted 
in 1988 the popular uprising was drowned in blood with the 
champion of burmese socialism gen ne win stepping down only to 
pull the wool over the people and enable another military dictator 
gen saw maung to continue to rule with an iron hand now with 
the national league for democracy led by ms aung san suu kyi 
heading for a twothirds majority in a new 485member legislature 
as conceded even by the hated miliitary rulers grave doubts about 
their true intentions have arisen 
if the game of these tyrantsinademocraticguise is to be 
foiled the world powers in particular the united states and 
japan must put economic diplomacy to good effect 
a heartening development is that the us senate has recently 
voted 920 to ban all imports from burma it is to be hoped 
that the us house of representatives too will likewise exert 
presure on the bush administration to ensure that the people are 
not denied the fruits of their clearcut verdict

pap news agency reported 
the fare increases were planned before the labor strife broke 
out may 20 railway spokesman tadeusz bronowski told pap on 
wednesday he said the increases are due to higher fuel and 
operating costs and the cut in state subsidies under the 
governments economic reform program 
typical of polands state industries the railroad had used 
large government subsidies to keep fares unrealistically low for

following weeks of intense congressional 
and media attention the us naval academy has announced new 
regulations to halt physical and mental abuse of freshmen 
under the new rules any midshipmen found guilty of physical 
abuse of freshmen or plebes during indoctrination could be 
expelled even if the act falls short of what is considered hazing 
tuesdays order follows weeks of intense attention and calls for 
investigations into reports of student abuse including that of 
19yearold gwen marie dreyer of encinitas calif 
she resigned from the academy last month after male midshipmen 
handcuffed her to a urinal taunted and photographed her 
tuesdays general order by the academy superintendent rear adm 
virgil l hill jr also calls for increased demerits and 
restrictions for forcing a fellow upperclassman to engage in 
horseplay 
up to now the maximum punishment would be restriction and 
demerits what weve done is elevate violation rules governing 
physical contact to a dismissal said lt cmdr mark van dyke 
academy spokesman we try very hard to prevent violations of 
human rights but we also accept the fact that mistakes will happen 
these actions are being taken to underscore the determination 
that the superintendent and the other academy leadership have to 
keep these problems in check 
the order came one day after 35 people organized by the anne 
arundel county chapter of the national organization for women 
demonstrated outside the academy during the annual graduation ball 
the protesters called for tougher punishment for behavior that 
amounts to acts of terrorism specifically complaining that the 
middies who handcuffed dreyer were only reprimanded 
van dyke declined to say if the midshipmen who taunted dreyer 
would have been dismissed under the new rules saying the case is 
still under review he also declined to say if their dismissal was 
still a possibility 
van dyke noted that hazing which has been prohibited for almost 
100 years already carries the penalty of expulsion 
the freshmen indoctrination manual defines hazing as any 
unauthorized assumption of authority by a midshipman such as 
an older student subjecting a freshman to cruelty undue 
humiliation hardship or oppression or the deprivation or 
abridgement of any right 
plebe indoctrination is part of the required training of a 
firstyear student van dyke said it includes for example 
chopping in which a plebe must walk double time cant talk 
and must make a 90degree turn at every corner 
its designed to apply stress and teach them to obey strict 
orders but thats not hazing van dyke said if you had 
someone chopping through the halls and the plebe is grabbed by a 
midshipman thats a dismissal offense 
women have been admitted to the nations service academies since 
1976 at annapolis they account for a little more than 10 percent 
of this years graduating class of about 1000 
at the us air force academy in colorado 100 women are among 
the 971 graduates there are 89 women in this years graduating 
class of about 900 at the us military academy at west point ny

without a presidential candidate in sight 
democrats leapt ahead today with 1992 convention preparations by 
designating new orleans and new york as finalists in the 
competition for the partys nominating session 
this is a wideopen process party chairman ronald h brown 
said after receiving the recommendation from the convention site 
selection committee the convention is scheduled to run from july 
16 through july 19 1992 
brown said he would visit both cities within the next week or 
two and expected some tough negotiations before making the 
final decision 
at this point brown said i dont have a personal choice 
he said he doesnt believe the location of the convention has 
any particular political significance in a presidential campaign 
it is not where the convention is held but what is said from 
the podium brown said 
the republicans are receiving bids for their 1992 convention and 
plan to announce their decision in january while the gop will 
visit potential sites and weigh their bids president bush could 
make those efforts academic if he decides to express a choice 
new orleans was the site of the 1988 gop convention that 
nominated bush for president 
the 1976 democratic convention that nominated jimmy carter the 
last democrat to win a national election was held in new york 
some senior democrats have recently expressed concern about the 
lack of activity by potential 1992 presidential candidates so far 
no democrat is expressing any interest in challenging bush for 
reelection and none is engaging in the sort of covert early 
maneuvering usually picked up at this early stage 
normally at this stage of the game you would have least one or 
two out making all the body language doing the fundraising 
denying they were a candidate said former party chairman john 
white 
the 46member siteselection committee visited four cities this 
year including the two finalists houston and cleveland 
the cleveland presentation impressed the panel with its 
enthusiasm the citys convention hall in suburban brook park was 
described as the equal or better than the facilities in competing 
cities but clevelands shortage of nearby hotel rooms was a fatal 
handicap 
i think we were taken seriously this time which gives us a 
real chance in 96 said ohio democratic party chairman james 
ruvolo 
the democrats want unlimited access to the hall for six weeks 
before the opening of the convention and a commitment of 15 
million in support services to include police protection and rental 
of the facility 
the convention is expected to attract 35000 people and millions 
of dollars in economic benefits atlanta was estimated to have 
gained about 70 million from the 1988 convention that nominated 
michael dukakis for president 
new york made the strongest financial bid offering the 
democrats 22 million in cash and services plus an enormous 
potential for additional fundraising during the convention but 
madison square garden was regarded by many as too small for the 
more than 5000 delegates and alternates and thousands more 
onlookers city officials offered a plan to provide additional 
seating but several selection committee members were skeptical 
in addition the media work space in new york would be in the 
javits center half a mile away from the convention site 
new orleans had trouble meeting the financial requirements and 
is in a state that is a stronghold of the antiabortion movement 
placing it at odds with the prevailing sentiment of the democratic 
party but its superdome offered more than enough space for the 
delegates plus the thousands of news media needing room to work 
both cities were able to guarantee plenty of hotel rooms and are 
home to some of the nations bestknown restaurants 
cities that have expressed interest to the republicans include 
houston the city bush calls his hometown kansas city mo st 
petersburg fla and cleveland new york and new orleans also are 
regarded as potential bidders atlanta expressed early interest but 
has since dropped out

angry anticommunist demonstrators 
jostled the mayor of bucharest this morning as he arrived with 
garbage trucks and street sweepers to end their 39day protest in a 
city square 
shouting down with communism and get out get out a 
group of about 40 demonstrators stood behind a newly reinforced 
metal barricade at one end of university square they urged mayor 
dan predescu to send the equipment elsewhere where there are piles 
of garbage 
predescu announced late tuesday that the city would take due 
measures today to clear the square because the lengthy blockade 
has cut off one of the citys main thoroughfares 
but 10 hours after the mayor arrived the trucks and sweepers 
remained parked just outside the square which the demonstrators 
have declared a communistfree zone no move was made to tear 
down the barriers and rushhour traffic continued to detour around 
the square 
a strong earthquake struck bucharest and other cities today but 
it caused no panic among the demonstrators said dr dragos 
nicolescu who has been tending to hunger strikers participating in 
the protest 
the demonstrators were swearing at iliescu when the earthquake 
happened nicolescu said referring to presidentelect ion 
iliescu 
dan lungu 28 who has lost 48 pounds since he started fasting 
may 3 said i was praying to god when the earthquake came it 
was as if it was god who was calling us i could feel that 
pedestrians stopped to watch shout and occasionally boo the 
protesters 
after a sleepless night waiting for something to happen the 
demonstrators spotted about 10 women street sweepers walking toward 
the square at 630 am followed by the mayor 
several demonstrators rushed toward the mayor surrounding and 
pushing him one woman hit him on the head with a newspaper and was 
pulled away by octavian radulescu a member of the association of 
former political prisoners he shouted dont push him because 
thats what they are waiting for 
one man yelled take your communism away from our free zone 
the demonstrators key demand is that former highranking 
communists be banned from public office for 10 years the mayor 
insisted he had nothing to do with iliescu a former communist 
party politburo member who won a landslide victory in may 20 
elections 
iliescu who called the protesters thugs and later 
apologized had ordered the square cleared before the elections 
but prime minister petre roman said the demonstrators could stay 
even though their protest was unauthorized 
i am not a communist and i am not a representative for what 
iliescu says i only want to clean this place it is my duty the 
mayor said 
eventually demonstrators who act as guards for 11 hunger 
strikers participating in the protest surrounded predescu to 
protect him the mayor remained in the square for an hour arguing 
with any protester who approached him 
viorica panaitescu 64 who was visiting the hunger strikers 
tent camp on the side of the square said authorities will be 
more and more drastic its still the communists that are leading 
us i know they the hunger strikers are right but they must 
stop fasting 
shortly before midnight a drunken man who tried to remove one 
of the barricades was surrounded by a group of about 60 nervous 
demonstrators several punched and beat him and he was taken by 
ambulance to a hospital his face bloody 
the government released a statement tuesday night saying it 
would do everything possible to stop the hunger strike some people 
have been fasting for four weeks and the ministry of health warned 
that they could face irreversible damage 
demonstrators have remained split on ending their occupation 
six key groups in the square fearing the hunger strikers might 
die have decided to switch to weekly protests the group for 
social dialogue romanias leading intellectuals backed them 
saying the demonstrators had already won a moral victory other 
groups have vowed to remain in the square because their demands 
havent been met 
orthodox church leader patriarch teoctist urged the government 
tuesday to start a dialogue with the demonstrators several other 
attempts to initiate talks have failed

in a costsaving test that might be tried 
elsewhere overseas cable news network and cbs news will share a 
bureau and satellite facilities in berlin says cnn executive vice 
president ed turner 
the test will start in midjune and is a a limited 
experiment in which the two organizations will maintain separate 
correspondents and producers he says 
cbs news spokesman tom goodman said wednesday the network had no 
comment on what would be a unique sharing of office space with a 
stillgrowing cable rival 
although an experiment and on a small scale the berlin bureau 
arrangement would be the second deal between cbs and a company 
owned by atlanta cable tycoon ted turner who tried to buy cbs in 
1986 
last september turner network television announced a 50 
million contract with cbs that lets tnt show 50 hours of coverage 
from the 1992 and 1994 winter olympics cbs owns the us 
television rights to those games 
the cnncbs news arrangement in berlin is really more symbolic 
than anything else ed turner no relation to cnns owner said 
in an interview last week 
what is unusual about it is two rival tv news organizations 
cohabiting under the same roof and sharing a satellite feed 
point and saving each other a little money he said and well 
see where it goes from there 
asked if there might be similar cbscnn arrangements elsewhere 
overseas turner replied that were looking at some but right 
now theres nothing to talk about 
the costsaving effort comes at a time all the major networks 
are trying to reduce or share costs of news coverage overseas 
several years ago nbc bought nearly 38 percent of visnews a 
londonbased overseas tv news service visnews majority owner is 
the reuters news company but the british broadcasting corp also 
owns an 1125 percent interest 
nbc and visnews recently began sharing the same office in 
moscow and the bbc uses nbcs satellite facilities there to 
transmit its stories to london according to nbc 
abc owns 45 percent of another londonbased overseas tv news 
service worldwide television news whose subscribers include abc 
news cbs news and cnn

mikhail gorbachev a politician in deep 
trouble back home could get plenty of advice from this towns 
political consultants 
theyd tell him open a negative campaign against boris yeltsin 
do something almost anything to satisfy a soviet 
whathaveyoudoneformetoday mentality and get rid of that 
dreadful red flag 
when washingtons practitioners of public relations and campaign 
consulting were asked what they would tell the visiting soviet 
president if he were a client they didnt hesitate 
gorbachevs political problems breakaway republics the 
election of critic yeltsin as president of russia the largest 
soviet republic bloody clashes in armenia panic buying in the 
stores werent enough to faze most of the imagemasters 
the thing he cant do is lose the initiative said jody 
powell former press secretary to president jimmy carter and now 
with ogilvy amp mather the pr firm hes got to keep being in 
motion and doing things and making sure the people are reacting to 
him rather than the other way around 
another veteran of the carter white house anne wexler now 
running a government relations firm shares that view if i were 
advising him on anything she said id say move ahead 
briskly 
consultant bob beckel adviser to democrats agreed gorbachev 
understands he has to come up with one big bomb after another 
three yards and a cloud of dust is not for him 
beckel said he is just the man to advise gorbachev since i 
ran walter mondales campaign you know i know what it is like to 
bring bad news to the boss 
roger stone who has earned a living offering tips to richard 
nixon ronald reagan and george bush thinks gorbachev made a big 
mistake with that longfaced television speech sunday night 
imploring his people not to give in to panic 
gorbachev went on the air as waves of consumers swept through 
staterun stores buying everything in sight to beat sharp announced 
price rises 
austerity has never won an election in this country said 
stone walter mondale ran for president saying i will raise 
your taxes and you see where that got him austerity as a 
political message is a loser if i were gorbachev id be looking 
for deep tax cuts it worked for ronald reagan 
gorbachevs speech got bob squires head shaking too 
squire an expert for democrats on using television said on 
tv he looked like gorbachev imitating brezhnev the sourfaced 
former soviet leader 
the problem with that speech is that he looked so grim it 
might have induced people to listen to what he was saying which 
would be a disaster said squire 
squires advice pick a fight with yeltsin whose theme song 
ever since he was thrown out of the soviet leadership in 1987 has 
been that gorbachev was doing too little too late 
gorbachev has let yeltsin become the good guy said squire 
gorbachev needs to focus on policies not personalities 
yeltsins proposals would be much more painful than the reality the 
people are facing today hes got to make yeltsin the issue 
gorbachevs problem is he invented the good guy version of soviet 
politics if you live by your personality you die by your 
personality 
beckel tongue in cheek offered this counsel take an early 
pension 
and this maybe he ought to give it up and get himself made 
secretary general of the un pause the problem is the 
russians might veto him 
john buckley who advises conservatives says gorbachevs 
problem shortterm anyway is just about hopeless 
good policy makes good politics says buckley no truer 
cliche has ever been spoken 
victor kamber who runs a pr and advertising agency that 
serves liberal causes finds himself agreeing with buckley all 
the great speeches in the world wont help gorbachev theres a 
whathaveyoudoneformetoday mentality he hasnt dealt with 
and after gorbachev solves all his immediate crisissized 
problems squire offers one last bit of advice hes got to do 
something about that awful flag hes got a blood red flag with a 
hammer and sickle on it he needs a blue flag with a white dove 
something like that but that can come later

agreements ranging from chemical weapons to 
air travel will be concluded at the ussoviet summit but getting 
superpower signatures on bigticket missile and trade accords is 
proving more difficult 
president bushs talks with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev starting thursday are likely to produce a joint 
declaration on progress toward agreement on the first treaty to 
reduce the number of us and soviet longrange nuclear missiles 
but its almost certain the treaty will not be ready for signing 
expectations for signing a trade agreement to ease us tariffs 
on soviet products also are fading but better than a halfdozen 
separate agreements are ready for signing at a ceremony set for 
friday here is a brief rundown on the agreements 
an end to production of all us and soviet chemical weapons 
mainly poison gas and nerve agents and destruction of all but 
5000 tons of each sides chemical arms stockpiles until a global 
production ban is put in place it is unclear whether this would be 
put in the form of a formal treaty requiring ratification by a 
twothirds majority of the senate or an executive agreement that 
would require a simple majority vote by both the house and senate 
the agreement is expected to include provisions for each side to 
inspect the other sides weapons destruction 
a protocol to provide against cheating on existing treaties 
that limit nuclear tests the 1974 threshold test ban treaty and 
the 1976 peaceful nuclear explosions treaty limit soviet and 
american underground nuclear tests to a yield of 150 kilotons 
no agreement is expected on the tougher question of whether to 
prohibit all nuclear tests the soviets favor such a ban the bush 
administration opposes it 
expanding commercial air travel between the united states and 
the soviet union by adding four american and six soviet cities to 
current airliner routes the deal will allow one more soviet and 
six more us airlines to run the routes and it will inaugurate 
regular cargo flights between the two countries 
additional us cities to be provided service are anchorage 
alaska chicago san francisco and miami the additional soviet 
cities are kiev minsk magadan khabarovsk tbilisi and riga in 
latvia 
a new 5year bilateral atomic energy agreement would provide 
for closer cooperation in nuclear reactor safety fusion energy and 
basic atomic science the deal coincides with heightened 
international concern about the safety of some soviet commercial 
nuclear reactors in light of the 1986 chernobyl accident that 
killed at least 31 people 
a grain deal effective jan 1 1991 committing the soviets to 
buy more american wheat feed grains and soybeans it guarantees at 
least 10 million tons in us sales annually an increase of 1 
million tons annually from the current agreement which took effect 
in 1983 
a maritime transportation pact to make it easier for us and 
soviet commercial vessels to deliver goods to ports in one 
anothers country the agreement will increase the number of ports 
in which the ships can call and will ease the length of advance 
notification time required of the arriving ships 
the two nations also are likely to conclude a maritime boundary 
agreement that recognizes soviet jurisdiction over four disputed 
arctic islands 
opening reciprocal cultural and information centers in 
washington and moscow the centers one in each city would offer 
student counseling and provide lending library and language 
services as well as sponsor seminars and exhibitions some terms 
of the agreement were still being negotiated this week 
the first governmenttogovernment agreement to increase 
student exchanges between the two countries it sets an exchange 
goal of 1000 students from each country by 1995

arab leaders ended their summit wednesday 
with harsh criticism of the united states saying its support of 
israel encourages the jewish state to stonewall peace moves and 
settle jews on occupied land 
their statement was seen as a major defeat for proamerican 
moderates led by egypt and saudi arabia 
the 20page final communique urged a halt to the influx of jews 
into israel and pledged financial and political support for the 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule of the occupied 
territories no figures were made public 
the communique was released after a threeday summit marked by 
disagreement between hardliners and moderates plo chief yasser 
arafat called the summit to discuss arab concerns over the 
immigration of soviet jews to israel 
some lastminute changes were made on the draft text tempering 
an outright threat of economic sanctions and possibly an oil 
embargo on states that encourage jewish immigration to israel 
instead the leaders instructed economic financial and foreign 
ministers of the 21member arab league to meet within two months to 
reevaluate relations and recommend to the next summit possible 
sanctions against states that facilitate immigration to israel 
that appeared to be the only concession the hardliners led by 
iraq and the plo made to the moderates 
israeli officials have said hundreds of thousands of jews could 
go to israel in the next few years because of relaxed travel 
restrictions in the soviet union and tighter entry quotas in the 
united states 
arabs fear the emigrants will be settled in occupied territories 
and drive out the palestinians 
the israeli government denies it has a policy of settling jewish 
emigrants in the occupied territories 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi wearing a silver and white 
african robe spoke to the conference wednesday and said 
palestine will be the graveyard of the jews 
he said arabs must increase their population from 100 million to 
1 billion to confront israel with a population explosion a 
recording of his address was broadcast by baghdad television 
the final communique said the arab leaders affirmed that the 
arab powers will take political and economic measures against 
whichever country that recognizes jerusalem as the capital of 
israel 
it denounced nonbinding recent votes in both chambers of 
the us congress that described jerusalem as the capital of 
israel it also warned of an explosion in the middle east 
because of israeli policies 
the united states shoulders the main responsibility for this 
situation because of the military capabilities financial 
assistance and political cover it extends to israel without which 
israel would not have been able to continue its aggression and 
challenge of international will the statement said 
it urged all states to stop any assistance or loans that might 
facilitate the settlement of jewish emigrants in occupied 
palestinian or other arab lands 
it askd the united nations to to guarantee that the jewish 
emigrants will not be settled in occupied territories it 
demanded international supervision to guard against the 
settlement of jews on occupied land and to protect palestinians of 
the west bank and gaza strip 
on other issues the final communique stressed backing for 
iraqs legitimate right to selfdefense and its right to defend 
itself against any aggression with whatever means it sees fit 
that was a declaration of support for iraqi president saddam 
hussein who has said he would hit israel with chemical weapons if 
it deployed its nuclear arsenal against iraq or any other arab 
country 
iraq has binary chemical weapons iraqbound shipments 
allegedly containing components of an iraqi super gun have 
been seized in britain greece turkey and italy 
an egyptian suggestion that the summit call for a nuclear 
chemical and biological weaponsfree middle east was shot down by 
hardliners on grounds that israel would not make such a commitment 
the communique also called for a special fund to help rebuild 
wartorn lebanon 
syria iraqs main arab foe boycotted the meeting mainly 
because of its venue lebanon which has twothirds of its 
territory under syrian control also did not participate 
the next summit the communique said will convene in egypt in 
november

one census form came back with tooth marks on 
it another included a note asking for money a third simply 
included the response none of your business 
when you send questionnaires out to count a quarterbillion 
americans chances are not all the responses will be what was 
expected 
for wanting to know how many people live in the us you 
people are all nosey wrote one woman on her census form 
i thought this was a census not a history quiz replied 
another 
and one man methodically wrote none of your business in 
response to each question on his form 
the census is continuing and people who dont provide 
information will likely get a call from their local census 
enumerator 
so far officials say just more than 80 percent of american 
households have been counted either in the mailback portion of 
the count or by workers going doortodoor the effort is expected 
to continue for at least several weeks 
some enumerators have even resorted to rowboats in floodravaged 
areas of texas reported census spokesman jim wilson in dallas 
many of the people filling out forms are going beyond the limits 
of the forms square boxes however to express more personal 
thoughts about the census and themselves 
wilson has been collecting some of the census responses from 
across the nation that go beyond the bureaucratic expectations his 
collection includes 
a census form with a large chunk missing and teeth marks over 
the remainder with a note saying that the familys golden 
retriever had chomped it and asking for a new form 
the census sounds like an autobiography not a head count 
i answered the questions the best i know how we are two old 
people 
brad study and no science questions notes on bugs dad can 
help wilson suggests this note scrawled on the envelope may 
not have been intended for the census bureau 
i am 74 i own this property that is all i intend to say 
one woman listed her two pekingese with a note saying that to 
her these are people these are not dogs their language 
spoken was listed as pekingese 
one man listed his state of residence as confusion 
a woman apparently annoyed at questions about type of 
employment and place of work included a note stating

palestinian guerrillas in speedboats 
attacked the israeli coast today but israeli forces killed four of 
them and captured 12 before they could hurt thousands of people on 
the beach or tel aviv hotels 
a faction of the palestine liberation organization claimed 
responsibility for the raid which apparently was aimed at the 
hotels which were crowded because of a religious holiday no 
israelis were hurt 
one of the six guerrilla speedboats came ashore only a few 
hundred yards from a crowded mediterranean beachclub in nizzanim 
18 miles from tel aviv the other five guerrilla boats were 
intercepted before they reached land 
witnesses said the speedboat that reached land had 11 guerrillas 
abaord and was headed north toward tel aviv when it was chased 
ashore by an israeli gunboat the guerrillas were pinned down in 
the sand dunes by heavy fire from elite army units and soldiers in 
two usmade cobra helicopter gunships 
four guerrillas were killed the army said 
a second boat was intercepted en route to an undisclosed 
location on the beachfront north of tel aviv 
in bagdad iraq the plo faction known as the palestine 
liberation front said it carried out an attack in retaliation for 
the killing of palestinian leader abu jihad in tunisia two years 
ago 
abu jihad a nom de guerre for khalil alwazir was killed by a 
commando widely believed to be israeli in tunis tunisia in april 
1988 
the faction is led by abul alabbas who has been convicted in 
abstentia by an italian court for masterminding the hijacking of 
the italian cruise liner achille lauro in 1985 one american was 
killed during the hijacking 
hussein alabed the factions representative in baghdad said 
the guerrillas today attacked selected and limited targets on the 
palestinian coast it was unclear whether the attack had the 
endorsement of plo chairman yasser arafat who pledged in december 
1988 to abandon terrorism 
alabed confirmed that four guerrillas were killed but he 
insisted that 11 others were still fighting 
most civilians were forced off the beaches south of tel aviv 
where they had come on the shavuot holiday or festival of weeks 
which marks the giving of the ten commandments 
in his comments on lt gen dan shomron the armed forces chief 
of staff blamed the raid on alabbas group abul alabbas was 
responsible shomron said during a news conference in tel aviv 
it was his decision to kill people in the most populated areas of 
israel 
the army said a guerrilla mothership from beghazi libya 
released the six smaller craft 120 miles from the coast it said 
the raiders who were armed with katyusha rockets and other heavy 
weapons planned to kill civilians at hotels in tel aviv 
the raid was the largest palestinian infiltration attempt by sea 
since march 11 1978 when a dozen guerrillas from palestine 
liberation organization chief yasser arafats fatah faction came 
ashore and hijacked a bus on the coastal highway north of tel aviv 
thirtythree people were killed and 82 wounded in the incident 
todays attack was launched on the final day of an arab summit 
in baghdad 
during the summit arab leaders including arafat verbally 
attacked israel the leaders also called for political and economic 
sanctions against nations that recognize jerusalem as the capital 
of israel and they denounced us policies in the middle east 
after todays raid police ordered the evacuation of thousands 
of israelis from a 30mile stretch of beaches south of tel aviv 
they also told thousands of other residents near the beach to stay 
home 
it was well planned but as far as we know totally 
unsuccessfully said an army spokesman who could not be 
identified in keeping with army regulations 
one guerrilla squad landed at midmorning on an empty stretch of 
beach at nizzanim 18 miles south of tel aviv about 3000 israeli 
beachgoers were enjoying themselves at a packed club only a few 
hundred yards away 
naval rear adm micha ram said the second vessel was spotted 
about 20 miles from tel aviv and told to stop by an israeli 
gunboat they lifted their hands and were ordered to jump in the 
water later we fished them out he said 
zvi amitai 57 a member of the nizzanim kibbutz communal farm 
said he was collecting driftwood when he saw the speedboat slicing 
through the water followed by an israeli patrol boat he said a 
spotter plane circled overhead and there was gunfire 
he said the guerrillas landed 20 yards away on a strip of beach 
that was empty except for himself and a few fishermen 
they jumped from the boat and didnt shoot as if they didnt 
see us amitai said they just ran for the dunes 
an israeli who was on the beach with his wife and children said 
all the attackers had been killed or captured in little more than a 
half hour we heard some firing i saw a boat coming in very 
fast from the sea onto the beach he said 
minutes after that a couple of israeli patrol boats came into 
the area and started shooting in the direction where the boat had 
landed said the man who declined to give his name the 
firefight continued for about half an hour and then helicopters 
flew in and started shooting in the same area 
army radio said the mother ship from libya had passed by port 
said on the suez canal it said egyptian authorities had been 
notified but did not elaborate 
though the attack appeared to have been planned in advance of 
the arab summit foreign minister moshe arens linked the raid to 
the strident rhetoric coming from the arab leaders

greece and the united states initialed a 
new defense pact on wednesday that will allow us military bases 
to remain on greek soil for the next eight years 
the agreement ended nearly a year of uncertainty over the fate 
of the bases 
the united states has four bases and about 20 smaller units 
around the country but is closing two of the bases as part of a 
worldwide costcutting drive 
sources who asked not to be identified said the new accord 
allows for the two remaining us bases to continue to operate in 
greece they are a major naval installation at souda and an air 
force electronic surveillance station at gournes both are on the 
southern island of crete 
government spokesman vyron polydoras told reporters the content 
of the pact would be released in two weeks 
the agreement will remain classified until submitted to the 
appropriate services of the us defense and state departments 
polydoras said 
he confirmed that some operations of the hellenikon air force 
base near athens slated for closure by washington would be 
transferred to souda the other base to close under the us plan 
is a naval communications station at nea makri northeast of athens 
the previous fiveyear agreement covering defense and economic 
ties between the countries expired in december 1988 
the new agreements title makes no reference to economic ties 
between the two countries 
polydoras refused to say whether greece would receive financial 
aid as part of the new agreement kiki munshi press attache of the 
us embassy in athens also refused to give details of the pact 
premier constantine mitsotakis of the conservative new democracy 
party was elected in april and pledged to reach an agreement with 
the united states on the bases 
andreas papandreous socialist government which lost power in 
national elections in june 1989 had conducted 17 rounds of talks 
with the united states but failed to arrive at an accord 
mitsotakis is a staunch supporter of defense ties with the 
united states he leaves for washington on june 3 for talks with 
president bush 
the greek parliament will have to ratify the accord before it 
becomes law with an absolute majority required in the 300member 
house 
mitsotakis has 150 seats in parliament and the backing of one 
deputy who represents a small conservative party political 
analysts expect the bill to go through 
the diplomats leading the negotiating teams initialed the accord 
at the foreign ministry on wednesday they are ambassadors christos 
zacharakis of greece and alan flanigan of the united states 
the initialing followed two rounds of intensive talks in athens 
and one in washington this month

filling their refrigerators because they fear massive price 
increases when the nation converts to a free market officials said 
wednesday 
east germans are making a run on canned goods meat soap sugar 
and everything that can be stored said commerce ministry 
spokeswoman christian boschek 
food distributors also are sitting on large stocks of meat and 
other goods creating shortages apparently while waiting for the 
july 2 economic merger with west germany the government said 
unification of the german states economies is expected to bring 
higher prices and massive unemployment 
government spokesman matthias gehler said subsidies on food will 
be scrapped july 2 and prices will be set by the free market 
rather than the state 
but subsidies for utilities rents and public transporation will 
remain at least until dec 31 when the government will assess the 
effects of capitalism on the country gehler said 
we cannot have half a marriage we want to enter into it 
entirely he said at a news conference 
prices of many products already are rising as west german goods 
begin filling east german stores 
boschek said people she called hamster buyers were 
purchasing as many goods as they can 
gehler said more than 100 inspectors will be sent around the 
country to investigate reports that east german food distributors 
and producers are intentionally keeping products off the market 
until july 2 on that date they can be paid in convertible west 
german marks 
the centerpiece of the economic union is the conversion of east 
german currency to west german marks 
under a treaty between the germanys most east germans will be 
able to convert up to 2400 to west german marks at a 11 rate 
amounts above that will be converted at a 21 rate 
salaries and pensions also will be converted at a 11 rate 
the government will begin passing out applications next week to 
east germans for converting their cash 
east germans now have 440 billion marks in savings accounts 
said wolfrid stoll vice president of the east german staatsbank 
that includes 25 million accounts held by 16 million east germans 
and hundreds of thousands held by enterprises legal entities and 
foreigners 
stoll said banks would stay open longer and personnel would be 
reinforced to handle the expected crunch he urged east germans to 
remain calm and levelheaded when the droves of people begin 
descending on east german banks 
he said east germans are expected to open between 15 million 
and 2 million new accounts in june alone in anticipation of the 
economic union east germans must have their money in bank accounts 
to convert their currency 
the government will begin passing out west german currency to 
stores in the days before the economic union is official east 
germans will be able to buy products in east german marks and get 
their change back in west marks at a 21 exchange rate

victory for all of us and there would be a celebratory orgy 
tonight at his favorite hangout the woody creek tavern in aspen 
thompson 53 last week was ordered to stand trial june 25 on 
four felony and three misdemeanor charges after the preliminary 
hearing before judge charles buss who threw out a felony charge of 
using cocaine

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev today paid 
his respects to canadas war dead and prepared to head for 
washington expressing confidence that he and president bush will 
agree on a way to permit german unification 
but gorbachev reaffirmed his countrys opposition to a united 
germany belonging to nato 
i havent yet heard any alternative from the west he said 
after meeting with prime minister brian mulroney it seems that 
it is just like an old record that seems to be playing the same 
note again and again i would like us to find a new melody 
gorbachev planned to fly to washington this afternoon for four 
days of talks with bush they are expected to focus on german 
unification arms reduction and trade 
asked tuesday if he was optimistic about reaching agreement over 
germany and its membership in nato gorbachev replied i am sure 
of that and tell that to the american people 
gorbachev has warned that us insistence on nato membership for 
a united germany could stall the withdrawal of soviet troops from 
eastern europe 
the soviet union has moved progressively from outright 
opposition to german reunification to acceptance of the concept 
under some formula that would provide assurances a new german giant 
would never again pose a military threat to its neighbors 
gorbachev met mulroney at the war memorial and laid a wreath 
honoring canadian soldiers after playing of the national anthems 
there was a moment of silence then a lament played by a lone piper 
gorbachev then surprised everyone by walking part of the short 
distance to parliament hill for his second round of talks with 
mulroney 
gorbachev and mulroney strolled slowly toward the ornate gray 
stone parliament building smiling and occasionally speaking to 
people in the crowd they then got in their cars to drive the final 
stretch 
it was the second time since his arrival that gorbachev mingled 
with canadians on the street tuesday night he spent nearly an 
hour amiably chatting answering questions and shaking hands with a 
crowd on a pedestrian mall 
outside parliament today hundreds of protesters chanted waved 
flags and carried placards appealing for independence for the 
baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia which were 
forcibly annexed by the soviet union in 1940 
later in a toast at a luncheon mulroney lamented the lot of 
leaders who attempt reform a problem faced by both himself and 
gorbachev 
leadership in the service of reform is no guarantee of 
political popularity mulroney complained obviously referring to 
gorbachevs difficulties in implementing economic and political 
reform and mulroneys own problems involving frenchspeaking quebec 
and disgruntlement over new taxes 
gorbachev also talked about change and the breakdown of 
established views and stereotypes 
today at a watershed in world history and politics the 
friendly feelings and creatiave aspirations of our two peoples can 
serve as the northern pillar of the bridge of confidence and 
security between the east and the west he said 
at parliament hill gorbachev was asked by a reporter about the 
powerful earthquake that struck romania and the soviet union today 
ive been told there were several shocks in moldavia and 
armenia which were even felt in moscow gorbachev said but 
everything is ok there was no devastation no destruction 
gorbachev said he saw no reason to break off his trip and return 
home 
after the ussoviet summit ends sunday he plans to leave for 
minneapolis followed by a trip to san francisco where he will 
meet with south korean president roh taewoo us officials said 
today 
the two countries have no formal diplomatic relations and the 
soviets maintain strong ties with communist north korea which 
conducted a brief and nowsuspended dialogue with the prous 
government in seoul 
gorbachev left worsening domestic troubles at home including 
panicbuying and clashes between troops and militants in armenia 
as he flew to canada for an overnight visit before going to his 
second summit meeting with bush 
on the sidelines soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
and joe clark canadas minister for external affairs held two 
meetings on a number of international and bilateral issues 
the future of a new united germany and a changing role for the 
north atlantic alliance figure to be among the more sticky issues 
during the visit to the united states clark said the two subjects 
were high on the agenda in meetings between soviet and canadian 
officials 
shevardnadze said he and clark were in general agreement on 
canadas desire for an increased role for the 35nation conference 
on security and cooperation in europe but there were differences 
on germany and its membership in nato 
clark said both canada and the soviet union would work toward a 
summit of the csce nations the united states canada and all 
european nations except albania which met for the first time in 
helsinki finland in 1975 
meanwhile canada announced it will extend a 500 million line 
of credit or about 425 million in us dollars to the soviet 
union for the purchase of canadian goods and services over the next 
two years in the past canada has extended 360 million to the 
soviets

the name of his hometown is nothing to smile 
about for chuck raines 
hes tired of all the jokes and has begun a lobbying effort 
aimed at getting town leaders to rename the tiny jackson county 
town near the ohio line 
when the community was first named the word gay meant merry 
joyous and lively raines said but as times have changed so 
has the meaning of the word 
last week raines petitioned the jackson county commission 
which would have to approve any name change raines hasnt 
suggested a new name he just knows he hates gay 
the commission has not acted yet but raines is already facing 
opposition 
ruth skinner the towns postmaster for the past 32 years said 
the town got its name in the 1850s the way she sees it gay was 
gay before gay was homosexual 
im satisfied with the way things are this place was named 
gay a long time before this other stuff got started

a veteran of the world war ii invasion 
of normandy haunted by the memories of seeing his friends killed 
in battle committed suicide on memorial day 
he was never able to recover from the shock of being in 
handtohand combat and seeing friends killed before his eyes 
wayne mathews said of his father james arnold mathews 
the elder mathers 65 shot himself in the head at his suburban 
hoover home wayne mathews said tuesday 
wayne mathews said his father had seen psychiatrists for years 
for treatment of depression it was helping him when he was 
involved with it but it didnt stick 
his father was 18 when he went to fight german forces in france 
as a tank gunner the invasion of normandy began on june 6 1944 
dday and mathews went in as part of the armys second wave a day 
later 
during a battle in belgium the gun on mathews tank jammed and 
he climbed out under heavy fire to clear it with a ramrod an 
officer saw his heroism and helped him get the bronze star 
in the same battle the tank next to his was blown up killing 
his best friend before the war ended most of his other friends 
fell 
after the war he built a successful home improvement company 
and raised four children but friends said the man who appeared to 
be a witty charmer could never shake his vivid memories of the war 
he was not wiped out instantaneously in combat but i really 
think the scars he sustained in a combat situation did claim him 
it just took it a long time i would say the war probably invaded 
his life every day said chris doss a samford university law 
professor 
mathews funeral was scheduled for thursday at elmwood chapel in

a bill sponsored by former ku klux klan 
leader david duke to ban affirmative action easily passed the 
louisiana house enraging blacks who called it unconstitutional and 
a racist political ploy 
the bill was designed to help dukes campaign for the us 
senate state sen william jefferson charged at wednesday news 
conference by the 20member black legislative caucus 
it is simply a bill to advance the causes of mr david duke 
thats it were not going to just play a game that involves david 
dukes electoral politics said jefferson 
duke is running as a republican for the senate seat now held by 
democrat j bennett johnston the state gop leadership however 
has endorsed another republican state sen ben bagert 
while duke basked in tuesdays 6536 victory he acknowledged 
his bill would have problems in the liberal senate 
the senate being the kind of body it is wont pass it 
predicted jefferson a power in the upper chamber 
state rep cd jones a black caucus member told reporters 
louisiana 13 million blacks should be concerned only with the 
intent of the bill drafted by a former klan grand wizard whose 
legislative office once sold pronazi books 
the bill is in conflict with federal law and therefore is 
nothing in and of itself said jones the issue here is the 
intent of the bill to divide races the racist intent to set poor 
people and blacks back 25 years 
the house vote sends a signal to the nation that its all 
right to be racist all right to be a former member of the ku klux 
klan that you can draw on that experience to be a member of this 
body it sends a signal to corporate america that louisiana is a 
place where racism is alive and well 
gov buddy roemer said he would veto the bill if it got to his 
desk but didnt expect it to clear the senate 
duke said all his bill does is prohibit discrimination 
for blacks to call this a racist bill is hypocrisy he said 
those who voted with me endorsed the principle that people should 
be judged on individual merits abilities and talents not on 
their race 
affirmative action programs are geared to help minorities 
overcome past discrimination said jones lyndon johnson when 
the civil rights act was passed 25 years ago said you cannot take 
people who for years have been shackled remove the shackles put 
them in a race and tell them they can now compete with everybody 
else evenly 
asked how long affirmative action programs would be needed 
jones said until racism ends 
jefferson said he didnt believe racism is widespread in the 
legislature he said he understood the affirmative action vote 
might have been revenge for black defections earlier in the day on 
a vote to establish a state lottery 
lottery proponents blamed its defeat on three blacks longtime 
supporters who didnt vote for the measure because they didnt like 
certain amendments to the bill 
i dont think its a good trade to get upset about a lottery 
vote and then vote the other way on a basic human rights issue 
jefferson said 
dukes affirmative action bill got only 36 votes last year but 
many of those who voted against him in 1989 backed his latest 
measure 
i think maybe the lottery affected one or two votes duke 
said but i had the votes to pass it lottery or not 
roemer said he hopes the rest of america doesnt judge louisiana 
on the basis of the house vote 
i have trouble with the author he sends all kinds of wrong 
signals roemer said the signal is not what the author says 
but that the state is open to everyone black and white and from 
whatever part of the world they come 
watch our actions and not the words of one legislator or even 
one vote in the house a lot of those votes have complex feelings 
behind them including feelings of the failure of old affirmative 
action programs we have new programs

new home sales plummeted in april to their 
lowest level since the nations economy emerged from the 198182 
recession the government said wednesday 
analysts attributed the fifth consecutive decline to continued 
doubledigit mortgage rates 
the commerce department reported that new home sales totaled a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 546000 units in april the 
smallest number since 521000 units were sold in december 1982 
were seeing the worst of it right now said economist mark 
m zandi of regional financial associates in west chester pa in 
april and early may mortgage rates were at their highest levels 
and have come back down since then 
according to national surveys by the federal home loan mortgage 
corp recent mortgage rates peaked at 1067 percent during the 
first week in may and had fallen to 1033 percent by last friday 
the rates ranged between 1025 percent and 1056 percent in 
april 
thomas holloway an economist with the mortgage bankers 
association said the recent decline may help sales in the 
nearterm but that rates would track in the range of 1025 percent 
to 105 percent for the rest of the year 
on the other hand john a tuccillo chief economist with the 
national association of realtors said we expect mortgage rates 
to trend downward in the summer which should spur sales of new 
homes and existing homes 
tuccillo said rates also have cut into sales of existing homes 
which also slipped in april down 21 percent it was their third 
drop in four months although sales were unchanged in march 
david seiders chief economist with the national association of 
home builders said in addition to high rates the general economic 
sluggishness is having an adverse affect on sales 
income growth and employment growth are clearly weak he 
said 
as a result of the weak sales inventories of new homes rose to 
their highest level since july 1982 a 81month backlog at the 
april sales pace compared with 82 months during the last 
recession 
both median and average prices for new homes set records in 
april but analysts generally agreed that reflected sales gains in 
the expensive northeastern market the only region posting 
increased purchases 
the median price jumped 138 percent to 135900 while the 
average price increased 112 percent to 160200 the median price 
means half of the homes cost more half less 
new home sales in the northeast gained 18 percent to 105000 
units after a 348 percent gain in march 
few economists believe the pace can be sustained however 
theres no reason for a rebound in the northeast seiders 
said interest rates are the same everywhere and employment is 
weak there i dont expect any continuation of the percentage 
increases we saw in march and april 
sales were down 64 percent in the west to 146000 units down 
6 percent in the south to 203000 units and down 21 percent in 
the midwest to 92000 units 
for the first four months of 1990 sales have fallen 68 
percent to 206000 units

railroad crews pumped jet and diesel 
fuel off beaver ponds today after draining 10 of the derailed 
tanker cars that spewed 120000 gallons into an area with wildlife 
and newly spawned fish 
using suction machines they had siphoned about onetenth of the 
spill by morning said chuck kleeschulte a spokesman for the state 
department of environmental conservation 
they should be pumping fairly furiously this morning and this 
afternoon to get the product off the surfaces of the two ponds 
he said 
the biggest concern right now is going to be with our 
waterborne furbearers beavers muskrat otters said mac 
mclean a habitat biologist with the state department of fish and 
game 
he said oil had been carried at least eight miles by goldstream 
creek and officials were concerned about northern pike and 
whitefish that had just finished spawning 
the eggs could hatch any time and thats a pretty sensitive 
life stage mclean said 
the refined fuel is more toxic than crude oil but also 
dissipates faster officials said 
the jet and diesel fuel spilled after an alaska railroad freight 
train derailed monday 40 miles south of fairbanks seven cars each 
holding 20000 gallons ripped open spilling fuel into beaver 
ponds on both sides of the track 
despite efforts to dam it one pond was draining fuel into the 
creek and the 500000acre minto flats wildlife refuge downstream 
said pete mcgee a regional supervisor for the state department of 
environmental conservation 
more fuel probably would have run into the creek if not for the 
beaver dams said al townsend a biologist for the state department 
of fish and game 
environmental officials had no immediate estimate of the threat 
to wildlife in the boggy conifercovered area a prime nesting 
area for waterfowl but when asked about the effect on the beavers 
townsend drew a finger across his throat 
the cause of the derailment wasnt immediately known 
the train with a crew of three was going about 40 mph 
carrying fuel to anchorage from the mapco alaska petroleum inc 
refinery in the town of north police said railroad spokeswoman 
vivian hamilton no one was injured in the accident

mikhail s gorbachev arrives tonight for 
summit talks with president bush that will focus on tough arms 
control and trade differences and search for common ground on the 
future of a unified germany 
the white house said bush was in a mood of anticipation and 
confidence as gorbachev wound up a brief visit to canada and 
headed for his second summit with bush and his first in washington 
since he conferred with president reagan in 1987 
the president sees a new horizon in this meeting a horizon 
of opportunity said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
after their discussions we should have a much better view of a 
new day in eastwest relations 
the soviet president in terms harsher than comments made the 
previous day reaffirmed his countrys opposition to a united 
germany belonging to nato 
i havent yet heard any alternative from the west gorbachev 
said after meeting with canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
it seems that it is just like an old record that seems to be 
playing the same note again and again i would like us to find 
a new melody 
bush was spending his second consecutive day closeted with 
advisers over strategy for three days of summit talks starting 
thursday he also spoke by telephone this morning with west german 
chancellor helmut kohl and tuesday night with canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney 
fitzwater said in a statement that bush brings to the summit 
talk the understandings and insights of many allied leaders 
including british prime minister margaret thatcher and french 
president francois mitterrand with whom he met recently 
bush was not prepared to offer a position for future 
negotiations on the size of a unified german military a major 
concern of the soviets fitzwater said 
the white house press secretary disputed news accounts 
suggesting bush would offer assurances on limiting german forces to 
bolster gorbachevs standing at home 
on prospects for a trade agreement during the summit fitzwater 
said i intentionally want to be vague he added i urge you 
not to rule out anything 
this is an issue that really will depend on gorbachev and 
bush he said the bush administration has held up the trade 
agreement to protest the soviet unions economic sanctions against 
lithuania and soviet failure to enact liberal emigration 
legislation 
in a move to resolve disputed arms control issues col gen 
labronislav omelichev first deputy on the soviet defense 
ministrys general staff headed for washington to enter talks on 
possible nuclear and conventional fores agreements for bush and 
gorbachev to announce 
on the question of german troop levels the united states still 
maintains such discussions should be held as part of future talks 
on reducing conventional forces in all of europe fitzwater said 
we are opposed to any proposal which would single out germany 
for special limits he said 
however fitzwater said the summit would include discussions 
on the general question we want to hear their concerns and their 
interests well express our policy 
this is not an issue which is linked in any way to german 
unity nor to the renunciation of fourpower rights fitzwater 
said referring to control of germanys destiny by world war ii 
victors britain france the united states and the soviet union 
president bush will be exploring the subject with president 
gorbachev from the standpoint of exploring mutually acceptable 
options and positions again these issues are not going to be 
decided here he said 
however an administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said bush hopes to nudge gorbachev into accelerating the 
first round of conventional arms talks under way in vienna 
austria so a treaty can be completed by years end 
bush was described as firmly opposed to a soviet proposal that a 
united germany be excluded from natos military structure while 
remaining within its political framework 
gorbachev was upbeat about the german issue as he spoke to 
reporters tuesday outside mulroneys residence in ottawa gorbachev 
said he was confident that he and bush will find a way to preserve 
the balance of power in europe after east and west germany are 
unified 
asked if he was optimistic about agreement on germany and its 
membership in nato the soviet leader replied i am sure of that 
and tell that to the american people 
us officials disclosed that gorbachev would meet with south 
korean president roh taewoo in san francisco after the washington 
summit ends with a bushgorbachev news conference on sunday the 
soviet leaders plan to meet roh was viewed as a further warming in 
relations between the two countries which recently established 
consular departments in trade offices in each others capitals 
before flying to washington gorbachev acknowledged the 
emergence of a new domestic worry the election of political 
maverick boris n yeltsin as president of the russian republic as 
a major earthquake struck eastern europe 
gorbachev told reporters that everything is ok in the soviet 
union despite the quake that struck romania this morning killing 
eight people injuring 260 and causing widespread damage tremors 
were felt in moscow and leningrad and a soviet lawmaker said 
initial reports from the republic of moldavia indicated there were 
an unspecified number of deaths 
the soviet leader said he saw no reason to break off his trip 
and return home a major earthquake in soviet armenia in december 
1988 forced gorbachev to cut short a visit to the united nations in 
new york where he also met with president reagan 
in advance of the soviet leaders early evening arrival it was 
announced that vice president dan quayle will meet gorbachev 
briefly on friday at the soviet embassy to discuss cooperation on 
space exploration 
arms control negotiators for the two countries meanwhile 
wrangled for more than two hours tuesday over us and soviet 
conventional forces in europe as well as their nuclear arsenals 
including bombers and submarines 
meeting in secrecy at the state department they made some 
progress toward reductions in both areas they agreed for example 
on definitions for such conventional weapons as tanks and armored 
personnel carriers which will make it easier to verify that treaty 
terms are carried out an official told the associated press on 
condition of anonymity 
although secretary of state james a baker iiis recent trip to 
moscow led to agreement on sea and airlaunched missiles a handful 
of tough strategic weapons issues remained unsettled 
arms control issues still in dispute include whether to ban 
ballistic missiles with multiple warheads and the number of flight 
tests the soviets could conduct of their heavy ss18 missiles the 
arsenal of such missiles is to be halved from 308 to 154 but 
there is no agreement restricting improvement in the missiles that 
remain 
bush and gorbachev still are expected to issue a joint 
declaration of progress toward a major reduction in nuclear 
arsenals officials said but they cautioned that longrange 
nuclear weapon issues still disputed may be excluded from that 
declaration 
on the economic front state department spokeswoman margaret d 
tutwiler said tuesday that a new commercial air travel agreement 
has been initialed officials said it will be ready for signing at 
the summit

democrats narrowed the competition for their 
1992 convention site to new orleans and new york on wednesday and 
party chairman ronald h brown said the final choice remained 
wide open 
after receiving the dual recommendation from the partys 
siteselection committee brown said he would visit both cities and 
that he anticipated tough negotiations before making his 
decision in midjune 
the democratic chairman is on track to settle on the convention 
city at the earliest date in recent memory hoping to get behind 
us housekeeping details the democratic convention is scheduled 
to run from july 16 through july 19 1992 
the republicans have just begun their selection process and are 
expected to complete it next january 
in new york mayor david dinkins said we will redouble our 
efforts from this point on to host the convention because no one 
can do it better than new york city 
were very pleased at this news of course he said should 
we lose to new orleans we will all go forth and support new orleans 
as we anticipate new orleans would support us 
brown and other party officials were determinedly positive in 
their assessments of the four cities that bid for the convention 
the chairman dismissed speculation he was concerned about the 
potential for embarrassing demonstrations in either new orleans or 
new york 
i am not one of those that believes the site of the convention 
sends a major political message said brown 
the two losers at this stage in the competition were houston and 
cleveland 
members of the selection committee went out of their way to 
praise clevelands bid 
i would not be surprised to find us in cleveland in 1996 as we 
renominate our democratic president said anne campbell 
in cleveland mayor michael r white said the citys effort 
would be useful in preparing a bid for the 1996 democratic 
convention and the 1992 republican national convention 
theres nothing to be ashamed of here white said at a news 
conference 
houston was not considered a serious contender because of its 
inability to guarantee the democrats the longterm access they 
required to the hall in that case the astrodome where the houston 
astros baseball team plays its home games 
new orleans the site of the 1988 republican national 
convention has the superdome a huge stadium that could easily 
accommodate the 5500 delegates and alternates and additional 
thousands of spectators 
madison square garden in new york presents size problems but 
city officials have assured the democrats they can make adjustments 
to provide for additional seating 
asked about the difference in the halls brown said i dont 
know that that is going to be a major factor in the decision 
supporters of new orleans argued that the louisiana city would 
prove far more affordable than new york for most delegates brown 
insisted that new york where he grew up also has an abundance of 
affordable hotels and restaurants 
of far greater concern to many party officials was the potential 
for street demonstrations racial tensions have been extremely high 
in new york in recent weeks while new orleans is in an area 
considered a stronghold of the antiabortion movement 
once again brown dismissed suggestions that negative factors 
would weigh heavily in his decision 
we are the party of choice on abortion he said it is 
not where the convention is held but what is said from the 
podium he added

a zoo keeper who screamed help me help 
me after a 70pound persian leopard bit his neck was up and 
about wednesday a day after the attack a hospital spokeswoman 
said 
alan feinberg 41 was in fair condition at san francisco 
general hospital where doctors stitched up his wounds said the 
spokeswoman gloria rodriquez 
it was the second attack by an animal at the zoo this year 
zoo officials were investigating why the female leopard named 
fatima attacked feinberg a zoo keeper for 18 years zoo director 
david anderson said the 14yearold leopard may have attacked as 
the keeper reached into the cage for a bone 
feinberg was standing in the keepers area of the cage when the 
attack occurred he had apparently opened the gate that separates 
the keepers area from the exhibit area anderson said making it 
possible for the animal to attack the gate to the exhibit area is 
supposed to remain closed 
keepers are never supposed to be in there he said maybe 
he thought the animals werent in there 
the mauling took place as a group of schoolchildren watched 
the leopard had him by the neck and wouldnt let go until the 
other keeper came and poked him said berry accius 15 of san 
rafael 
i thought the leopard was going to kill him said othon 
franco also 15 and from san rafael he was screaming help me 
help me get him off get him off 
senior zoo keeper tony colonese alerted by a visitor ran to 
the cage and poked the leopard with a shovel until the animal 
released feinberg other keepers pulled the injured man from the 
cage 
a spokesman for the zoo said it was investigating the attack 
veterinarians examining fatima found only superficial wounds 
probably caused by the shovel 
contacted at the hospital feinberg refused to comment 
in february a keepers back was fractured when he was knocked 
into a moat by a 7000pound elephant

president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev open their summit meeting with no clear answer to the 
german question how does a united german nation fit into a europe 
still haunted by the memories of nazi aggression 
bush has made it clear he favors a united germany as a full 
member of the usled nato alliance but he is also said to be 
prepared to explore options and positions on the size of 
germanys armed forces 
gorbachev is portrayed by soviet officials as unlikely to be 
convinced by bush that the new germany should be a fullfledged 
nato member indeed he said wednesday in canada before flying to 
washington for the summit that such an idea was just like an old 
record that seems to be playing the same note again and again 
in washington georgi arbatov director of the soviet institute 
for us and canada studies said a military alliance against 
the soviet union thats the way we see nato its an ominous 
question for us 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said wednesday 
we are opposed to any proposal which would single out germany for 
special limits however he added president bush will be 
exploring the subject with president gorbachev from the standpoint 
of exploring mutually acceptable options and positions 
the soviet union suffered heavy losses at the hands of the 
germans in world war ii and feelings about that time still run 
deep half a century later 
the size of the bundeswehr is of obvious concern to the 
soviets and we understand that said a us official who 
commented on condition he not be identified by name 
the west german armed forces currently number some 494000 the 
east german military stood at 173000 last year but may have been 
cut somewhat since it is unclear how many of east germans might be 
absorbed into the unified german military 
at present there are 380000 soviet troops stationed in east 
germany and 250000 us troops in west germany 
in december the two superpowers agreed to slash their central 
european forces to 195000 each with the united states allowed to 
keep an additional 30000 troops in britain and southern europe 
with actual cuts yet to be made there are now 305000 us troops 
and an estimated 565000 soviet troops in europe 
gorbachev told reporters in ottawa on tuesday he is confident 
that he and bush will find a way to preserve the balance of power 
in europe 
asked if he was optimistic about agreement on germany and 
whether it should be a nato member the soviet leader replied i 
am sure of that and tell that to the american people 
bush has made his own position clear 
i want to convince mr gorbachev that a us presence in 
europe a unified germany a germany in nato not only is no threat 
to the soviet union but preserves the kind of stable europe that 
the soviets should welcome bush said in an interview broadcast 
last weekend to the soviet union 
i believe in president bushs eloquence but it is hard for me 
to believe that he could manage to do this arbatov told a news 
conference on tuesday 
assistant secretary of state raymond seitz speaking with 
reporters wednesday said a soviet attempt to define the terms of 
german membership in nato is unacceptable to us 
the united states he said wants rapid unification in an 
orderly fashion with germany enjoying the privileges and 
responsibilities of all other nations in europe 
that doesnt seem to be the soviet approach he said 
the soviets have a lot of legitimate concerns which the 
united states and its allies must address but not at the cost of 
a fully sovereign germany seitz said 
the goal should be a europe in which everyone will feel 
safe including the soviet union arbatov said

reached their targets and that 11 guerrillas escaped and rocketed 
the coast at tel aviv and nearby towns 
the group said the attacks were in retaliation for the killing 
of seven palestinians by an israeli civilian last week and for the 
assassination of a palestinian military leader two years ago 
the israeli army said the guerrillas planned to attack 
beachfront hotels filled with people celebrating shavuot which 
marks the giving of the ten commandments the six small speedboats 
were sent from a mothership that sailed from libya the army 
alleged 
no israelis were killed or injured the army said although one 
guerrilla speedboat outran an israeli patrol boat and splashed 
ashore near a crowded mediterranean beach club 
police evacuated a 30mile stretch of coast south of tel aviv 
jammed with people on holiday 
of the six guerrilla vessels only two got near shore 
authorities said 
one carried 11 palestinians it was attacked by helicopters and 
troops as it sliced into an almost empty beach near nizzanim 18 
miles south of tel aviv four guerrillas were killed there and 
seven captured the army said 
zvi amitai a resident of the nizzanim communal farm said he 
was collecting driftwood when he saw the speedboat and heard 
gunfire the guerrillas landed 20 yards away from him 
they jumped from the boat and didnt shoot as if they didnt 
see us he said they just ran for the dunes i certainly feel 
like i won the lottery 
five other guerrillas surrendered aboard another boat that was 
intercepted by israeli vessels near a beach north of tel aviv the 
other vessels broke down or were abandonded at sea the army said 
the armed forces chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said the 
attack boats were armed with rockets machine guns and 
antiaircraft missiles 
the security forces were able to frustrate today an 
operation that if it was carried out successfully would have 
caused a great many casualties to israeli citizens he told a 
news conference in tel aviv 
army intelligence chief maj gen amnon shahak told the same 
news conference the goal was to attack the hotels in the tel 
aviv region to conduct a massacre 
deputy foreign minister benjamin netanyahu claimed the plo 
violated its pledge not to engage in terrorism and was responsible 
for an act that could have plunged this whole region into 
bloodshed and a broad war 
it was unclear whether the attack had the endorsement of plo 
chief yasser arafat who pledged in december 1988 to abandon 
terrorism 
the faction that claimed responsibility is the palestine 
liberation front a proarafat faction its leader is mohammed 
abbas whose nom de guerre is abul abbas an italian court 
convicted him in absentia of masterminding the 1985 hijacking of 
the italian cruise ship achille lauro during which american leon 
klinghoffer was killed 
abbas was sentenced to life in prison but his whereabouts is 
not known a plf spokesman said abbas was not in iraq where arab 
leaders wednesday concluded a threeday summit with a sharp 
denunciation of us policies toward israel 
foreign minister moshe arens said he hoped the incident would 
convince washington of the need to abandon its dialogue with the 
plo 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in 
washington the united states is horrified at this terrorist 
attack she added that if it is determined the attackers had plo 
connections we would view this as a very serious matter 
in baghdad plf representative hussein elabed said the attack 
was aimed at teaching the enemy a new lesson on the road to 
liberating palestine 
he said the attack was in revenge for the killing of plo 
military chief khalil alwazir whose death in tunis in april 1988 
was widely blamed on israel 
the front in statements issued in lebanon and iraq said the 
raid also was in retaliation for the killing of seven palestinians 
by an israeli civilian last week 
it said 15 guerrillas not 16 as israeli officials reported 
attacked points near tel aviv 
all the boats succeeded in reaching their specified targets 
it said 
alabed confirmed that four guerrillas were killed but denied 
the others were captured 
the israeli army said the mothership fled toward port said in 
egypt and that egyptian authorities were notified 
sundays attack also came amid a cycle of violence set off by 
the may 20 massacre of the palestinian laborers 
the slaying touched off riots in the occupied territories that 
left 15 palestinians dead a pipe bomb explosion in a crowded 
market killed an elderly israeli man 
wednesdays raid was the largest palestinian infiltration 
attempt by sea since march 11 1978 when a dozen guerrillas from 
arafats fatah plo faction came ashore north of tel aviv and 
hijacked a bus the bus headed for tel aviv and 33 people died in a 
shootout between the guerrillas and israeli forced 
the last infiltration was on march 8 1988 when another fatah 
squad infiltrated from egypt and hijacked a bus near tel aviv 
three passengers were killed and eight wounded

delegates to the annual convention of the 
presbyterian church usa today elected a 67yearold layman to 
lead the 29 millionmember denomination for the next year 
price h gwynn iii of charlotte nc captured almost 53 
percent of the votes on the second ballot at the denominations 
202nd general assembly gwynn immediately took office as 
moderator replacing the rev joan salmoncampbell of philadelphia 
gwynn became the eighth moderator since factions of the church 
reunited in 1983 healing a civil warera split over slavery he 
was one of six men seeking the position 
during his nomination speech gwynn said presbyterians were more 
concerned about a perceived malaise in leadership than whether 
homosexuals should be ordained an issue the 10day assembly may 
address 
the question im asked is do we have our act together up 
here can we put aside our differences to get our act together in 
the world gwynn told the assembly 
the first meeting of the protestant denomination in 
predominantly mormon utah began tuesday night with a worship 
service where salmoncampbell urged partipants to be humble and 
gentle with each other 
the denomination was planning to take action on its first 
statement of faith since the 1983 merger the proposed statement 
mixes traditional christian beliefs with more modern concerns for 
the environment and sexual equality resolutions on the 
environment uscuban relations and northern ireland also were on 
the agenda 
no official dialogue is planned between the presbyterians and 
the mormon church although private meetings are scheduled between 
mormon leaders and the presbyterian interfaith office further 
the conference will consider a paper on healthy relations between 
mormons and presbyterians in utah 
while 70 percent of utahs 17 million people are mormons the 
next largest denomination is roman catholic with an estimated 5 
percent or 80000 members the presbyterians have 5000 members 
or about sixtenths of 1 percent 
church officials acknowledge it is unusual to hold its annual 
assembly where there are so few presbyterians but say the salt 
lake meetings are in response to local presbyterians seeking 
recognition in utah 
during tuesday nights service delegates were urged to fill out 
prayer cards some of which were used during the service 
participants were asked to take a card and pray for the request 
throughout the convention 
the service focused on children with childrens choirs and 
dancers and a special prayer of the children written by richard 
wunder of salt lake 
salmoncampbell told commissioners and visitors to be mindful of 
their behavior in thought word and action she urged them to 
work together in humility and to be gentle with one another 
positive in christs love 
she told commissioners that in such a democratic body they can 
expect conflict and disagreement but to remember the life death 
and resurrection of the savior the presence of the spirit waits 
to assist each of us in doing gods work she said

doonesbury protest stamps are starting to 
zonk their way into the mail the postal service said wednesday 
cartoonist garry trudeau included a sheet of mock stamps 
featuring zonker harris of the doonesbury comic strip in sunday 
papers may 20 
the stamps carry the legend mad as heck and ticked off 
and show a value of 5 which the comic strip indicates is 5 
cents the stamps were intended to protest the coming increase in 
postal rates from 25 cents to 30 cents 
postal service spokesman lou eberhardt said an empty envelope 
from california bearing two of the stamps arrived at postmaster 
anthony franks office and that a few others have also been 
delivered 
but eberhardt said he did not know how many of the stamps were 
used 
he said many envelopes with the stamps may have ended up in dead 
letters offices for lack of postage some may have gotten through 
because of the large volume of mail postal workers handle 
eberhardt said frank finds trudeaus work funny and takes the 
stamps in the manner in which they were intended as a protest 
eberhardt said letterwriters should have no problem if they put 
the cartoon stamps in addition to valid 25cent stamps on their 
mail 
but if the doonesbury stamps are the only postage on a 
letter thats not legal postage if the letters appear to be of 
value they would then either be returned to the sender marked 
insufficient postage or to the addressee marked postage due 
officials said

lithuanian leaders appealed to presidents bush 
and gorbachev wednesday to solve at their summit the question 
of the breakaway baltic republic where oil shortages threaten to 
shut down heating systems 
the soviet economic blockade of lithuania could also force the 
shutdown of a nuclear power station that relies on electricity to 
function lithuanian prime minister kazimiera prunskiene said in a 
videotaped appearance broadcast in the united states 
prunskiene and lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis made 
their comments together in vilnius on tuesday 
the session was beamed by satellite to the united states on the 
day soviet president mikhail gorbachev was arriving for a fourday 
summit with president bush 
lithuania is likely to be a topic of contention between the two 
superpower leaders the united states has urged the soviet union to 
negotiate with lithuanians about their future 
we still hope that the negotiations taking place in washington 
will be in accordance with the attitudes of the american public and 
will help solve the lithuanian question prunskiene said 
she said the economic situation in lithuania is dire gorbachev 
imposed the sanctions after lithuania declared its independence 
march 11 
during this week if there is no repeal of the restrictions in 
furnishing lithuania with a variety of products especially oil 
then the situation becomes essentially critical prunskiene said 
the nuclear power plant the lithuanians say might have to close 
supplies power to the region of kaliningrad which houses several 
soviet military bases 
landsbergis said it would be impossible for lithuanians to 
return to the status they had before they declared independence 
is it really possible to turn back the clock of history even 
by three months he asked besides why should it be turned 
back what are the arguments

demonstration organizers say their efforts will be peaceful 
during soviet president mikhail gorbachevs visits to 
minneapolisst paul and san francisco but city state and federal 
agencies are beefing up security anyway 
protest groups and police shared one problem gorbachevs 
changing schedule 
the bad part is it doesnt give us much time to plan how to 
protect him said richard mcdrew agent in charge of the secret 
service in san francisco the good part is it doesnt give a 
potential assassin time to plan either if we dont know exactly 
what he is going to do neither does anyone else 
the flags of the baltic republics will fly sunday in minneapolis 
to show gorbachev that emigrants in minnesota support the push for 
independence by the soviet republics of lithuania latvia and 
estonia 
we will be demonstrating for baltic independence not against 
gorbachev coming here said karin berkholtz a latvianamerican 
member of the governors commission on eastern europe 
our ultimate goal is to show gorbachev that everywhere you go 
there will be people who feel the same way that they do back in 
eastern europe berkholtz said 
between 500 and 1000 people of eastern european descent are 
expected to participate in nondisruptive demonstrations during the 
six hours the soviet president is in minnesota 
after minnesota gorbachev will go on to san francisco and then 
leave the united states on monday 
the planned minnesota demonstrations are not meant to offend 
anyone said walter anastas the ukrainian representative on the 
governors commission on eastern europe we want to express to 
gorbachev and to our fellow minnesotans that we have concerns about 
the human right of national selfdetermination 
were planning a peaceful demonstration in keeping with the 
peaceful revolution in the baltics said joe sidas spokesman for 
the baltic alliance in san francisco 
security will be tight 
sharpshooters will be posted on buildings at every location the 
gorbachevs will visit in california dozens of highway patrol cars 
will line the 35 miles between san francisco and stanford 
university during their drive monday to the campus 
mcdrew said the secret service will have hundreds of agents in 
san francisco from around the country leading a security operation 
that will involve thousands of officers 
the san francisco police department will have 1775 officers and 
the stanford university police will have 30 officers bolstered by 
santa clara county sheriffs deputies to deal with demonstrations 
planned by armenians estonians lithuanians latvians soviet jews 
and eritreans from ethiopia 
minnesota state patrol chief kevin kittridge said tentative 
plans are for 150 to 200 state troopers from around the state to be 
brought into st paul for sundays visit weve canceled 
everyones day off he said 
but in minneapolis police sgt keith oldfather said theres 
been no blanket prohibition on officers taking a scheduled day off 
sunday and that he doesnt expect one although he said plans are 
not firm because gorbachevs itinerary is not set 
its very likely we wont know until the last minute or last 
day exactly what we are going to do in which case all our planning 
and worrying was for nothing said minneapolis police lt jim 
heimerl 
if gorbachev ventures into crowds to talk with protesters as he 
has in the past it will present a risk said mcdrew but one that 
the secret service is preparing to handle 
extemporaneous visits and unplanned movements are things weve 
handled before he said its pretty difficult sometimes john 
f kennedy didnt want a bulletproof top on his car in dallas wed 
like to have the best security at all times but we have to adapt 
to the circumstances

anglican church envoy terry waite turns 
51 thursday more than three years after he disappeared in beirut 
while trying to negotiate the freedom of other western captives 
no group has claimed it holds him and there has been no word on 
his fate but western and lebanese intelligence officials are 
convinced he is held by a moslem group known as islamic jihad 
he marks his 51st birthday a day after a moslem shiite cleric 
with ties to kidnap groups said british hostages in lebanon could 
be released sooner if britain expels author salman rushdie 
rushdie who is in hiding under the protection of british 
authorities wrote the satanic verses the novel offended many 
moslems and prompted the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of iran 
to issue a death threat against the author in february 1989 
moslem fundamentalist leader hussein musawi said wednesday the 
deportation of rushdie would greatly facilitate the release of 
some british hostages 
musawi who heads the prosyrian faction within the 
iranianbacked hezbollah did not provide names of the hostages he 
had in mind 
british official have said they will not deport rushdie 
waites brother david waite said wednesday that no events were 
planned in britain to mark the birthday 
we think of terry every day since he has been taken and 
tomorrow will be just the same and well all be thinking about 
him he told the associated press 
weve been very encouraged by freed us hostage frank 
reeds account of seeing british hostages john mccarthy and brian 
keenan waites brother added 
reed and a second us hostage robert polehill were freed last 
month with the help of iran and syria 
waite said that while he supported the british governments 
refusal to make deals for hostages he believed britain should talk 
directly to iran he suggested that britain mend its fences with 
iran now that it has been proved that iran has direct influence 
over the hostagetakers 
waite is one of 16 westerners missing in lebanon they are six 
americans four britons two west germans two swiss an irishman 
and an italian 
besides waite the british captives are mccarthy a journalist

last seen leaving his seaside hotel to meet with kidnappers holding 
anderson and educator thomas sutherland 
waite a policemans son who became personal emissary of

the government said wednesday that 
east german property expropriated by the former communist 
leadership should be returned to its original owners some of whom 
now live in west germany 
the statement signaled a possible dispute with the east berlin 
government over how to handle west german claims on houses 
apartments and businesses in east germany 
berlin officials insist that instead of getting their property 
back former owners should be paid some sort of compensation east 
germany also says its own citizens should have first option on 
property that was formerly stateowned 
west german experts say up to 1 million people will lay claim to 
property they left behind when fleeing to the west after world war 
ii or during east germanys 40 years of communist rule 
how to handle such claims is a sensitive issue because in many 
cases the property is occupied the issue was excluded from a 
treaty on merging the german economies to buy time for reaching a 
mutually agreeable solution 
the economic merger is to occur july 2 on that date east 
germany has said it will begin dismantling state ownership without 
any decision on what to do about west german claims on east german 
property 
chancellor helmut kohls coalition government met wednesday to 
discuss the fastapproaching economic merger according to kohls 
chief spokesman hans klein the issue of private ownership came up 
klein said the bonn government expressed certain expectation 
that private property will be guaranteed and that a socially 
bearable solution will be found in the short term to the stillopen 
property questions 
expropriated property is in principle to be handed back 
only in exceptional cases should compensation solutions be found 
klein said 
west germany is apparently also waiting to hear from east

dozens of police showed up to deal with an 
expected crowd of summit protesters near the white house wednesday 
but the only demonstrators on hand were a soviet rock band 
promoting aids research 
lafayette park across pennsylvania avenue from the presidential 
residence normally is protest central for meetings such as the 
summit this week between soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and 
president bush 
and up to 2000 demonstrators had been expected wednesday 
according to reservations issued by the us park police to groups 
representing the interests of lithuanians cubans vietnamese 
south koreans and aids victims 
but cure aids now was the only organization that showed up 
bringing along the soviet rock band gaza to blast out some tunes 
it was the most visible and audible presence in the park 
other demonstrators said one us park police officer 
probably figured out that gorbachevs not even in town yet 
instead of protesters the park hosted the usual groups of 
homeless chess players tourists and office workers seeking a 
sunny respite from their desks 
at two previous summits in 1985 in geneva and in 1987 in 
washington when gorbachev met with thenpresident ronald reagan 
cure aids now had demanded that each side devote the monetary 
equivalent of 10 missiles to eradicate the deadly disease and care 
for its victims said the organizations leader bob kunst 
the ante is up this year 
we want the value of 1000 missiles now said kunst 47 
we see aids as as catastrophic as nuclear war he estimated 
that each missile costs 180 million 
as for the timing of his demonstration he said this is a 
little teaser an appetizer to take advantage of the press here 
we hope gorby sees us when he comes in on television 
also in the park wednesday was concepcion picciotto 45 but 
then shes been there since 1981 as part of the antinuclear peace 
vigil 
i want to do something for humanity she said handing out a 
leaflet that reads every gun that is made every warship 
launched ever rocket fired signifies a theft from those who are 
hungry and are not fed from those who are cold and are not 
clothed 
misha knight who emigrated from the soviet union in 1978 
because he did not see a future there said he came to this 
summit to show support for the growing friendship between the 
united states and his homeland 
he also was selling gorbachev tshirts 15 each and an 8 
cassette tape featuring himself singing i am a gorby man and 
give peace a hand among other tunes

its been a long dry spring at some of chicagos 
outdoor beer gardens because of a lengthy new licensing process 
but a court order temporarily turned on the taps wednesday 
neighbors complaints prompted the city to make taverns get 
permission if they wanted to serve outdoors but a judge ruled the 
city was trying to do with licensing regulations what its police 
could not adequately monitor the burgeoning number of outside 
bars 
its good news for people who want to sit on dicks dock and 
drink jeremy deblieux manager of dicks last resort rejoiced 
wednesday as he readied his beer garden along a slip by the chicago 
river 
we lost the entire month of may deblieux said there is 
no catching up but were very very happy that the beer will once 
again flow 
on tuesday cook county circuit judge kenneth gillis temporarily 
prohibited enforcement of the new law until june 7 when he will 
hear arguments on whether the ordinance should be tossed out two 
tavern owners are challenging the law 
gillis said the city apparently jeopardized financial 
interests of the owners as a substitute for effective police 
enforcement 
the city adopted the new licensing procedure last fall 
previously taverns with liquor licenses could open a garden without 
further review 
but tavern owners say the licensing requirements are a maze from 
which there seems to be no exit 
of an estimated 125 taverns that previously served beer and 
other libations outdoors only 21 had obtained the citys stamp of 
approval to open their beer gardens for business by tuesday 
two were denied permission for gardens because of strong 
objections from neighbors said john holden of the citys 
department of revenue which handles the licenses he said about 
110 are going through the application process 
these bar owners brought it on themselves said david 
hartsell who led a neighborhood group opposing a beer garden 
this is not little european cafes were talking about the beer 
garden behind my house is like animal house its like having a 
frat party in my back yard every night 
that bar kincades withdrew its application but planned to 
take advantage of the judges ruling and open its garden said 
owner kevin killerman 
the ordinance requires barkeepers to head for the citys maps 
bureau where a circle representing 250 feet is drawn around the 
beer garden 
then the building department determines what addresses fall 
within the circle next the board of elections gives the owner a 
list of voters living within the circle 
the voters are notified by registered mail of the taverns 
intent and have 30 days to respond owners then post notices of 
intent and wait at least another 21 days for city inspections of 
the property 
with anything thats starting up you expect to learn from 
your experience holden said we dont think the process is 
terribly complicated 
mayor richard m daley also stands behind the new requirements 
were going to go back to court to defend the citys 
position mayoral spokeswoman carolyn grisko said we think the 
law is important 
hartsell agrees 
we hope the city vigourously defends this he said we 
dont think its a burden or unfair that for the first time the 
neighbors have some input

the state department condemned the abortive 
terrorist attack on a crowded beach area in israel on wednesday 
and left open the possibility that the incident could derail the 
us dialogue with the palestine liberation organization 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said if israeli allegations that 
the plo was behind the attack are true we would view this as a 
very serious matter 
asked whether the united states would suspend its dialogue with 
the plo if a faction of the organization were found to be 
responsible she said our policy has not changed but i do not 
want to rule anything in or anything out 
the attack prompted calls by the israeli government and the 
antidefamation league for a suspension of the usplo dialogue 
which began in december 1988 in the waning days of the reagan 
administration 
the conference of presidents of major jewish organizations 
called on the administration to reassess its policy of talking with 
the plo 
president reagan agreed to open the dialogue after plo chairman 
yasser arafat gave forceful assurances that the group had renounced 
terrorism 
lt gen dan shomron the armed forces chief of staff said 
wednesday the raid was carried out by the palestine liberation 
front a plo faction headed by abul alabbas who masterminded the 
achille lauro cruise ship hijacking in 1985 a western news agency 
in israel said the plf claimed responsibility for the wednesday 
attack by speedboats near tel aviv 
but ms tutwiler said us officials were still gathering facts 
about the incident and were unable to assess responsibility for it 
she said the us ambassador to tunisia robert pelletreau was 
trying to contact plo officials in tunis in washington assistant 
secretary of state for near east and south asian affairs john kelly 
spoke with israeli ambassador moshe arad 
the united states is horrified at this terrorist attack ms 
tutwiler said the us government is pleased that all terrorists 
were apprehended or killed in action and that no innocent victims 
were harmed 
in march the state department issued a report asserting the plo 
had complied with arafats 1988 pledge not to engage in terrorism 
it stated there was no evidence any of nine attacks directed 
against israel since then were approved by arafat or any of the 
groups under the plo umbrella 
kelly ran into a storm of criticism last week from some house 
members when he testified on the report 
rep lawrence j smith dfla called the report a sham and a 
fraud and said the administration ought to be ashamed of 
itself

the agriculture department forecast wednesday 
that american agricultural exports for the fiscal year ending in 
september would total 40 billion an increase of 15 billion from 
the previous estimate 
the department revised the estimated volume of us agricultural 
exports upward by 15 million metric tons from the february 
forecast to 150 million metric tons 
much of the increase however is the result of a change in the 
way shipments between the united states and canada are reported 
the department said in its report 
it said the alteration was designed to eliminate underreporting 
of exports by both countries 
the department added however that the prospects for exports of 
us corn soybeans and cotton have improved since february in both 
volume and price 
meanwhile usda raised the forecast for us agricultural 
imports from 215 billion to 22 billion 
it said the main reason was an upswing in fruit and vegetable 
imports from latin america in the wake of decembers freeze in 
florida and texas 
the department forecast the us agricultural surplus for the 
year at 18 billion only a shade below that for fiscal 1989 
the surplus had been rising steadily since fiscal 1986 when it 
skidded to 54 billion in terms of volume the estimate of 150 
million tons is up from last years total of 1464 million

president bush wants india and pakistan to 
stop preparing for war and hold talks about kashmir where the 
indian government has cracked down on a militant islamic 
secessionist movement 
i urge you to seek negotiation and conciliation rather than 
confrontation bush said tuesday as newly arrived ambassador abid 
hussain presented his credentials at a white house ceremony 
the indian embassy later released the statements by bush and 
hussain 
more than 400 people have been killed since january when the 
indian crack down began kashmir is the only predominantly moslem 
state in hindudominated india pakistan is a moslem country 
us assistant secretary of state raymond seitz told foreign 
correspondents wednesday that bush and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev will discuss the kashmir dispute at their washington 
summit that begins thursday 
kashmir has turned into a flash point on the international 
scene seitz said other us officials have referred to it as 
one of the worlds most worrisome regional crises 
india and pakistan have fought three wars since independence 
from britain in 1947 two over kashmir both india and pakistan are 
regarded as capable of producing atomic weapons 
bush told the indian ambassador the united states believes the 
1972 simla agreement is the best framework for a peaceful 
resolution of the dispute and we call on both india and pakistan 
to begin bilateral talks without preconditions 
pakistan accusing indian security forces of wanton killing and 
repression in kashmir has maintained that the simla pact doesnt 
preclude thirdparty mediation pakistani officials reportedly have 
approached the un security council 
hussain did not name kashmir in his statement but referred 
indirectly to the dispute 
terrorism and fundamentalism are direct threats to the secular 
and representative character of our political system he said 
we cannot condone the activities of those who espouse violence 
for political ends and take up arms to undermine the unity and 
integrity of the state

firefighters at a chemical plant worked 
wednesday to contain a gas leak aboard a ship and prevent an 
explosion from the mixture of two chemicals officials said 
freeports 12000 residents were urged to stay inside and to 
close all windows 
about 20000 gallons of amino ethyl ethanolamine were in the 
marine chemists tank tuesday night when about 5000 gallons of 
13dichloropropene were accidentally added said margaret gaspard 
a dow chemical co spokeswoman 
the flow of dichloropropene was stopped when employees realized 
a reaction was occurring and heat was increasing within the tank 
she said 
the venting of the gases has decreased and the temperature of 
the reaction has decreased by half and thats a good sign dow 
spokeswoman cindy suggs said wednesday afternoon 
firefighters were pouring water on the ship moored at the 
plants dock and the coast guard closed traffic on the intracoastal 
waterway police chief charles bankston said 
no injuries were reported but plant employees were evacuated 
as were a few residents downwind and students from three schools 
authorities said 
dow officials said breathing high concentrations of the gas 
could cause lung irritation but said levels being released should

consumers are being coerced by car rental 
companies into purchasing unneeded damage coverage an advocacy 
group charged wednesday 
an industry organization claimed however that only about one 
in five renters purchases the socalled collision damage waiver 
which pays for a wrecked or stolen car 
a lot of people dont need it at all but are buying it out of 
fear said lucinda sikes a staff attorney for the us public 
interest research group its just a way for rental companies 
to make a lot of profit the product itself is inherently a fraud 
on consumers 
sikes also claimed the coverage which can add as much as 48 
percent to the rental price costs too much for those who do need 
it 
it really should be only a few dollars a day she said 
in a 23page report entitled taking consumers for a ride a 
report on collision damage waivers the group said the waivers 
are often sold under coercive circumstances at excessive prices 
and with deceptive statements about coverage the report was 
compiled from a survey of 10 washingtonarea companies 
sikes claimed consumers often arent told about exceptions to 
the waivers which may be voided for reasons ranging from travel on 
a gravel road to driving after having o available for objects 
older than that 
in the new work the researchers dated coral samples with both 
carbon14 dating and a second method which depends on the constant 
radioactive transformation of uranium234 into thorium230 
the second method like the tree rings provided an independent 
measure for calibrating the carbon14 data 
in a telephone interview zindler said the newfound accuracy 
cleared up an inconsistency in a climate theory 
scientists had theorized that subtle changes in earths orbit 
affected growth and melting of glaciers by changing the amount of 
solar energy to reach the surface he said 
but previous carbon14 dating of ancient coral clashed with that 
theory by suggesting the last peak of glaciation was about 18000 
years ago he said 
the corrected date from the new study was 21500 years ago 
which fits with that theory very well zindler said

georgias slow system of recording license plates 
is blamed for a fourday delay in the search for the killer of a 
high school student the latest case in which police say the system 
is helping criminals get away 
georgia issued new plates this year the first since 1983 but 
hasnt entered them on the national law enforcement computer 
network after the new tags went on some residents traveling out 
of state found themselves jailed on stolen car charges because of 
the unlisted plates 
and police say criminals stand a better chance of escape 
when a law enforcement officer cannot give his all to his job 
the citizens of the state are losing said appling county sheriff 
lewis parker when it takes hours to find out the tags and when 
we know that somewhere the tag is on file its also dangerous to 
the citizens 
jeff davis county sheriff mark hall said the slow process of 
tracing license numbers added four days to the search for the 
killer of rhonda sue coleman a jeff davis high school senior slain 
two weeks ago in hazelhurst 
information on a partial license number was received thursday 
from a man who said he saw a dark truck the night miss coleman 
disappeared 
but 84 georgia counties have issued license plates containing 
the sequence of numbers the man described hall said officers have 
started calling all 84 county license plate offices 
a legislator who thinks funds for a new computer system is 
overdue worries that it will take a disaster to spur the state to 
action 
whats going to happen is some drunk will run a school bus off 
the road and kill a bunch of kids and everybody will get up in arms 
and not be able to find the person who did it said state rep 
jerry d jackson chairman of the house motor vehicles committee 
division of motor vehicles officials estimate that it will take 
up to five months to record information on license plates purchased 
this year because georgia lacks a network that would link computers 
in each county to the state processing center 
the state has clerks working late into the night six days a week 
to computerize the data in some weeks they process 180000 of the 
6 million records which must be updated

a lebanese shiite moslem leader with close 
ties to groups holding hostages said efforts to release six 
americans held in lebanon remain frozen because of negative us 
positions 
hussein musawi head of the islamic amal faction based in east 
lebanon spoke a day after the bush administration announced it had 
provided iran with information on iranians missing in lebanon as a 
gesture of goodwill 
in an interview on the lebanese voice of the people radio 
station he said those concerned in iran and syria are dismayed 
by the negative american stands 
at a may 3 news conference president bush said he hoped that 
providing iran with information on the fate of the four missing 
iranians would satisfy irans request for a gesture of thanks for 
its role in freeing two us hostages bush also said he remained 
firmly opposed to negotiating for the release of the remaining six 
american hostages in lebanon 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said tuesday in 
washington that the united states had concluded that the iranian 
were dead he said the information was passed to tehran via the 
swiss government 
musawis islamic amal is a prosyrian faction within the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god hezbollah is believed to 
be the umbrella for extremist factions holding most of the 16 
westerners missing in lebanon 
iranian leaders said on wednesday they had evidence their four 
missing countrymen were still alive 
following the islamic republics inquiry into the fate of 
iranian hostages in lebanon we have got information from reliable 
sources over the past few days that our hostages are alive said 
foreign ministry spokesman morteza sarmadi he was quoted by the 
islamic republic news agency 
the islamic republic will continue efforts to obtain more 
detailed information about the situation of its hostages he said 
sarmadi gave no more details on the fate of the iranians 
iran has repeatedly said that information on the fate of the 
four iranians is one condition for helping gain the release of the 
16 western hostages held in lebanon most by proiranian factions 
the four iranians were seized in july 1982 at a lebanese forces 
checkpoint at badara the northernmost point in the christian 
enclave 25 miles north of beirut 
the kidnapped men included ahmad motevaselian the commander of 
a contingent of iranian revolutionary guards based in the bekaa 
valley of east lebanon a diplomat a photographer and their driver 
sources in the lebanese forces have said the iranian prisoners 
were killed in artillery battles between the militia and moslem 
factions including the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
but there have been unconfirmed reports that three of the 
iranians are alive and the fourth was shot trying to escape 
of the 16 westerners held hostage the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
also held is anglican church envoy terry waite who turns 51 on 
thursday more than three years after he disappeared in beirut 
while trying to negotiate the freedom of other western captives 
musawi on wednesday reiterated earlier remarks that the 
deportation by britain of writer salman rushdie would greatly 
facilitate the release of at least some of the british hostages 
in lebanon 
rushdie an indianborn naturalized briton was sentenced to 
death feb 14 1989 by irans late revolutionary leader ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini for allegedly blaspheming islam in his novel 
the satanic verses 
rushdie has been in hiding under british protection ever since

sen david durenberger already the subject of 
an ethics probe said wednesday he failed to report an earlier gift 
and loan while senate colleagues disclosed they talked wrote 
invested and even fiddled to raise their incomes last year 
durenberger rminn amended his financial reports for five 
years to acknowledge a friends gift of 35 days of lodging in 
florida and a 484000 loan to buy a house he is being 
investigated by the senate ethics committee because of a 100000 
bookpromotion deal that was not listed on past disclosure reports 
the figures on income speaking fees and gifts for senators were 
included in financial disclosure reports that were made public on 
wednesday 
although there is growing concern about the practice of 
accepting fees for speaking to special interests a compilation by 
the common cause lobbying organization showed 74 senators spoke for 
pay last year by next year the report said 34 senators will no 
longer keep such fees compared with 19 in 1988 
the 74 collected 27 million donated 685449 to charity and 
kept the rest common cause said 
although democrats control the senate the top two republicans 
earned more in speaking fees in 1989 republican leader bob dole of 
kansas picked up 108900 in honoraria his deputy alan simpson of 
wyoming got 90600 sen orrin hatch of utah senior republican 
on the labor and human resources committee was paid 92499 in 
fees 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine was paid 39000 for 
speeches but his deputy alan cranston dcalif no longer 
accepts honoraria 
one of the wealthiest senators john heinz rpa whose family 
started the food company reported assets that could exceed 17 
million his income for the year may have topped 25 million sen 
john c danforth rmo whose family founded ralston purina 
disclosed holdings that could be in the 15million range 
sen claiborne pell dri may have made 28 million or more 
last year his assets were in the 8 million range also among the 
richer senators are edward m kennedy dmass whose assets are 
hidden in a trust dennis deconcini dariz with vast real estate 
holdings and herbert kohl dwis owner of the milwaukee bucks 
basketball team kohls 1989 income could have topped 20 million 
on the other hand sens jim jeffords rvt and conrad burns 
rmont could be on the brink of insolvency with more liabilities 
than assets sen joseph r biden jr ddel reported little in 
the way of assets except his home and liabilities that include 
loans to pay for a sons college education 
the law requires most highlevel federal officials to report 
annually on their assets liabilities financial transactions and 
gifts received house members reports were made public tuesday 
all but a few senators who were granted 30day extensions made 
their reports wednesday 
because the forms are so vague it is impossible in most cases 
to discern an officials true financial status for example a 10 
million piece of real estate may be listed on the forms as worth 
over 250000 some senators had dozens of holdings valued at 
that level 
durenbergers troubles with the ethics committee are traceable 
in part to his failure to disclose some transactions as required by 
law his office said wednesday that the florida lodging was 
inadvertently left off a past form and that the loan was omitted by 
someone who didnt understand the form 
sen robert c byrd dwva included in his income 12080 in 
royalties on a record of fiddle music he recorded several years 
ago sen daniel patrick moynihan dny reported 167 royalties 
on two past books and a 5000 advance for another he is writing 
for harvard university press 
mitchell and his republican colleague from maine william cohen 
shared royalties from a book they wrote after serving on the 
committee that investigated the irancontra scandal 
sen orrin hatch rutah received 5058 in royalties for a 
tape cassette in the living scriptures series 
simpson listed 40000 he was paid for debating kennedy in the 
mutual radio series face off kennedys report did not include 
his share 
sen bennett johnston dla chairman of the senate energy 
committee received about 3000 of royalties on oil and gas 
investments sen tim wirth dcolo shares with his wife a blind 
trust valued at more than 250000 which generated as much s 
50000 income last year 
in 1989 most senators were paid at the annual rate of 89500 
leaders earned 99500 senators could keep honoraria equivalent to 
40 percent of their salaries and give the rest to charity 
house members voted to give up their honoraria starting next 
year in exchange for higher government salaries but senators 
insisted on keeping those fees and taking a smaller check from the 
treasury 
sen john breaux dla a firstterm senator who chairs the 
democratic senate campaign committee picked up 53000 for 
speaking and gave 17200 of it to charity biden who heads the 
judiciary committee was paid 35548 in honoraria and kept it all 
this years figures on speaking fees may not tell the whole 
story instead of accepting checks and turning them over to 
charity some senators have begun instructing groups they address 
to write the check directly to a designated charity dole and sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio acknowledged doing this in some cases 
sen paul simon dill accepted a long list of gifts 
including a lamp stand value unknown from the president of 
malawi sen john warner rva accepted four washington redskins 
season tickets freshman sen joseph lieberman dconn received 
several months of free lodging before his family joined him in 
washington 
political leanings are not forgotten in the financial reports 
sen barbara mikulski dmd pointedly noted a fund in which she 
invests has no holdings in south africa

the seabrook nuclear plant has quietly 
generated electricity and fed it to commercial customers for the 
first time after almost two decades of regulatory delays financial 
woes and mass protests 
the plant that became a symbol of the nations antinuclear 
movement in the late 1970s and 1980s generated 65 megawatts of 
electricity that was fed into the new england power grid tuesday 
night 
on wednesday the reactor was operating at 23 percent of 
capacity generating 216 megawatts which plant spokesman rob 
williams said could supply electricity to 185000 homes 
williams said the power would be reduced for more testing and 
brought up again to 30 percent in the next few days 
the milestone was reached during tests to ready the 
1150megawatt 65 billion reactor for full power commercial 
operation expected this summer until tuesday lowpower testing 
had not generated any electricity plant officials said 
ed brown president of plant operator new hampshire yankee 
called the step an extremely significant moment while plant 
opponents said nothing had changed 
the notion that 10 years behind schedule they generate a few 
kilowatts of power and that all is fine and there are no problems 
is ludicrous said roy morrison spokesman for the clamshell 
alliance 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon and an 
environmental group filed briefs tuesday in washington on appeals 
of seabrooks commercial license granted march 1 arguments are 
scheduled for sept 18 
opponents contend the seaside plant is unsafe and the evacuation 
plan for the surrounding area is inadequate especially for crowded 
beaches plant operators say it is safe in all respects 
seabrook had been shut down for a month for modifications on its 
nonnuclear side after problems cropped up during the startup 
process 
no protesters greeted plant workers arriving for their shifts 
wednesday morning sandra gavutis director of citizens within the 
tenmile radius said the battle against seabrook has taken on 
different dimensions 
the fight is by no way waning said gavutis were 
definitely working in other arenas were working in the political 
arena 
gavutis said her group lobbied for the congressional 
investigations of the nuclear regulatory commission and subsequent 
seabrookrelated allegations filed with the commissions inspector 
general 
sen john kerry dmass on wednesday called the nrcs actions 
on seabrook one slap in the face after another 
this past weekend as the official beach season opened miles 
and miles of cars lined the trafficfilled streets surrounding the 
seabrook nuclear plant kerry said you dont have to be a 
nuclear physicist to imagine the problems that would arise if there 
were even a minor incident during beach traffic hours 
ground was broken for seabrook in 1976 but the plant was not 
finished for 10 years the long delay led to soaring costs 
original projections called for two reactors costing less than 1 
billion and forced its lead owner public service co of new 
hampshire into bankruptcy reorganization 
connecticutbased northeast utilities has won preliminary 
approval to take over public service

graduates of the us naval academy are 
the best and brightest in the country the superintendent said 
wednesday at commencement he made only a brief mention of reports 
of sexual harassment and abuse of middies 
graduates drew praise from rear adm virgil l hill jr and vice 
president dan quayle at a ceremony unmarred by the controversy that 
has swirled around the campus since a female middie resigned 
because she was handcuffed in a mens bathroom taunted and 
photographed 
the brigade of midshipmen is literally the best and brightest 
the nation has to offer hill told the 990 graduates they are 
part of a chain of excellence in leadership unmatched by any 
other institution the chain has never been stronger 
five military and congressional panels are investigating 
complaints that women have been sexually harassed and freshmen have 
been mentally and physically abused during plebe indoctrination 
and some professors have complained that academic standards are 
declining and that they are being pressured to give passing grades 
to students who have failed exams 
the only mention of the criticism on wednesday came from hill 
who was warmly applauded when he mentioned telling a local 
newspaper editor that he was just a little upset that most of the 
coverage has been a little less than productive 
quayle did not mention the controversy although he devoted much 
of his speech to praising midshipmen for their academic and 
athletic achievements and their record of public service in 
annapolis 
the vice president touched only briefly on national and 
international affairs telling graduates that they are beginning 
their careers at a remarkable time 
but he said that even in times of worldwide change america 
will need its strong global navy to preserve our liberty and our 
way of life 
gwen dreyer a 19yearold freshman from encinitas calif 
resigned earlier this month because of hazing she said dated to 
december when she was handcuffed to a urinal taunted and 
photographed 
other current and former women midshipmen have complained that 
many male midshipmen resent women at the academy 
complaints about academic standards surfaced after a department 
head was demoted because he refused to raise grades for thirdyear 
midshipmen students in an electrical engineering course 
not all women at the academy agree that females are subjected to 
unfair hazing 
its not a matter of gender its a part of life here 
midshipman susan slaven said as she argued with members of the 
national organization for women who picketed outside the graduation 
ball on campus monday night 
some people just dont belong in a military academy she 
said 
hill announced general orders tuesday designed to end physical 
and mental harassment of freshmen 
under the new rules any midshipmen found guilty of physical 
abuse of plebes during indoctrination could be subject to 
dismissal even if the act falls short of what is considered hazing 
there were 96 women among the 990 naval academy graduates 
receiving diplomas and commissions as military officers wednesday 
the ratio is similar to that at the two other service academies 
at the us air force academy in colorado 100 women were among 
the 971 cadets who received degrees wednesday 
there will be 89 women including the first female brigade 
commander among about 900 graduates of the us military academy 
at west point ny at thursdays commencement

a rooster strutting his stuff too early in 
the day will leave his owner with little to crow about 
bird owners face a 500 fine under a new town ordinance intended 
to put a damper on early morning clucks and crowing 
a flock of cries of fowl play prompted the town council to 
unanimously approve the ordinance earlier this month 
people who knowingly or intentionally permit fowl to make 
unreasonable noise after being asked to make the fowl stop can be 
charged under the new law council president fred feiock said this 
week 
personally i always liked to wake up and hear a rooster 
crowing but then i dont live next to someone who has a lot of 
chickens or roosters feiock said 
police say they will enforce the ordinance i dont know what 
youre going to do though said officer ron shrout dogs will 
bark and chickens will make noise 
one person has been warned so far but no one has been fined 
police chief lawrence dalton said wednesday 
dalton said he hasnt heard any roosters crowing and doubts 
that very many people keep them within the city limits of this town 
of 3900 
ive been to two worlds fairs and a bull fight but this is 
the first time ive heard of a chicken ordinance dalton said 
officials have been plagued with clucks and squawks about rowdy 
roosters and chickens for more than 1 years feiock said at 
first it seemed more or less a joke 
other than having their vocal chords operated on feiock 
said he had no useful tips for quieting the bothersome birds 
feiock said officials dont want to outlaw roosters although 
they may be the prime offenders 
every chicken ought to have a rooster my mother used to raise 
chickens and i know what its like feiock said but times are 
changing and we have to have rules to protect people

president mikhail s gorbachev during a state luncheon attended by 
prime minister brian mulroney 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
first of all i would like to express my sincere gratitude for 
the invitation to visit your country and for your warm hospitality 
it is highly symbolic that as we are once again discovering 
america we begin in canada 
precisely seven years ago in may 1983 i was here with a 
delegation of the ussr supreme soviet i have retained very vivid 
memories of that first encounter with canada and canadians i am 
glad to be able to greet again my old acquaintances whom i see here 
in this room i hope to meet new people 
the ussr and canada are natural partners in the international 
community they know each other fairly well particularly since 
there are many people in canada with roots in russia 
however in this day and age we should always replenish and 
sometimes adjust our knowledge it is good though that some 
things never change such as the feeling of sympathy which erasing 
the ideological prejudices and fears of the cold war has enabled 
us to forge new sovietcanadian relations they are gaining 
momentum in the spirit of the coming new age over the past seven 
years sovietcanadian political dialogue has also emerged as the 
leading instrument in our interaction 
at a time of turbulent change and of a breakdown of established 
views and stereotypes contacts and mutual understanding between 
states acquire special value particularly between those that have 
special responsibilities to the world community 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
today at a watershed in world history and politics the 
friendly feelings and creative aspirations of our two peoples can 
serve as the northern pillar of the bridge of confidence and 
security between the east and the west of new dramatic 
international relations which mankind will take with it into the 
21st century 
i can say that the challence of our time has not taken the 
soviet union and canada by surprise indeed in their relations 
with each other and with the rest of the world they have shown 
foresight in times of tensions they did not exacerbate the 
situation but tried to use any opportunity to improve it 
we and you were able to cooperate at the dawn of the helsinki 
process and now we will be drawing the final line under the 
horrible war of tyranny and darkness we are against looking back 
to the past all the time however without its lessons it is 
impossible to bring closer a free and secure future a future in 
which there is no room for hatred and revanchism a future built on 
voluntary and humane principles we regard the sovietcanadian 
interaction as an integral and vital support structure of a future 
common european home

the arctic the roof of the world and a source of life on our 
planet has been and remains an area of special cooperation between 
our two countries neighbors across the arctic ocean at last but 
of course not least we work together to curb the arms race and 
participate in the process of disarmament 
these are the main parameters in the trajectory of 
sovietcanadian dialogue 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
let me make a special point on sovietcanadian trade and 
economic relations it should be emphasized that neither the soviet 
union nor canada have ever tried to politicize them or questioned 
the need to develop them on the basis of equality and mutual 
advantage the scope and consistency of our cooperation in this 
area and the solid legal groundwork on which it is built hold out 
the hope that as we radicalize the economic reform in the ussr 
these relations will grow even more dynamic with an understanding 
of the special aspects and difficulties of the period of transition 
to a new system in the soviet union 
we are pleased to note the strong support that the canadian 
government has been giving to the businesses that want to cooperate 
with the soviet union and to their initiatives that help integrate 
our economy in the world economic system we say very clearly that 
what we want is not western help but cooperation on a mutually 
advantageous basis in shaping a new economy for our country which 
is a vast and rich part of the worlds potential reintegrating it 
fully in the world economic context is we believe necessary and 
advantageous to all at the same time economic interdependence 
lends longterm stability to bilateral and multilateral interaction 
in this context we would hope that the emergence of new modern 
types of cooperation the establishment of joint ventures will be a 
continuous process

i told the prime minister in moscow that we reject economic 
isolation and are ready to depend on other countries to the 
extent or course that they are prepared to depend on us i dont 
think canada has any reason to fear such interdependence it is a 
must in our time in this new age that links all mankind in a 
common destiny

a state official promised wednesday that a 
proposed toxic waste incinerator at the dioxincontaminated and 
abandoned town of times beach would not become a permanent fixture 
tracy mehan head of the state department of natural resources 
outlined a plan he said provided multiple safeguards to ensure that 
the proposed incinerator would be used only to burn dioxintainted 
soil from times beach and 26 other sites in eastern missouri 
i am committing to the citizens of st louis county here and 
now that the department of natural resources will not allow times 
beach to become the dioxin dumping ground of the nation mehan 
said at a news conference 
but some times beach neighbors who have opposed the incinerator 
said mehans pledge did nothing to ease their fears 
as far as im concerned it means absolutely nothing its 
just another promise that we dont believe said eureka mayor 
otis nelson 
the federal environmental protection agency plans to build a 
huge incinerator at times beach about 20 miles southwest of st 
louis to burn all the soil that was contaminated there and at the 
other sites in the 1970s by dioxintainted oil sprayed to control 
road dust 
after the highly toxic chemical was detected the federal 
government bought out residents seven years ago and the town was 
abandoned 
nelson and other opponents fear that once the incinerator is 
built officials could decide to use it to burn toxic wastes from 
across the country they also oppose it because it is to be built 
alongside the meramec river and would be vulnerable to flooding 
the epa says the incinerator would be protected from flooding by 
a levee 
what if they have a malfunction and pump a lot of toxic 
dangerous runoffs or whatever into the meramec then what are they 
going to say whoops we made a mistake nelson said 
one of the points in mehans plan was a guarantee that the 
department would not issue permits for the times beach facility 
that allowed any other waste to be brought in 
the epa has said the entire cleanup would cost about 118 
million and could take up to 10 years

president bush met with top advisers and 
consulted by phone with west german chancellor helmut kohl on 
wednesday as he made lastminute preparations for his summit with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
hes upbeat hes confident he knows what he wants to talk to 
gorbachev about said vice president dan quayle 
bush met with quayle and senior advisers in a final session to 
run down the range of issues expected to come up at the fourday 
summit that begins thursday 
the president did not watch on television as gorbachev and 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney talked at an ottawa news 
conference about germanys future white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said 
at the news conference gorbachev gave sometimes testy responses 
to questions on soviet policy on german reunification and lithuania 
earlier wednesday bush talked with kohl on german unity and 
other summit issues fitzwater said and he had talked the day 
before to mulroney 
on the eve of his second summit with gorbachev bush in 
contrast to his soviet counterpart was completely out of public 
view 
concluding a short stay in canada gorbachev was highly visible 
breaking with his formal schedule at one point to stroll toward 
ottawas parliament hill for discussions with mulroney 
fitzwater said bush brings to his meetings with gorbachev the 
understandings and insights of many allied leaders bush earlier 
had consulted with british prime minister margaret thatcher and 
french president francois mitterrand the spokesman told reporters 
fitzwater said that kohl and mulroney initiated the respective 
calls 
bushs mood on the eve of the summit was one of anticipation 
and confidence that democratic values are sustaining positive 
change in the world order fitzwater said he said bush looked 
forward to frank penetrating discussions 
the president approaches this summit as a very serious meeting 
in which very specific and meaningful agreements will be 
achieved fitzwater said 
it was the second consecutive day that bush remained out of 
sight and behind closed doors meeting with senior advisors and 
poring over summit briefing books 
within sight of bushs oval office windows a military band 
rehearsed on the south lawn and workers put the finishing touches 
on scaffolding and a threetier viewing stand for thursdays 
official morning welcoming ceremonies 
enormous us and soviet flags were draped over the entrance to 
the old executive office building next door and smaller flags 
decorated lamp posts surrounding the white house complex 
across the street a rock band made up of soviet youths bearing 
tshirts declaring rock not rockets played in lafayette park 
sparsely populated on wednesday but expected to be crammed with 
demonstrators on thursday 
bush had no plans to leave the white house nor was he expected 
to speak to gorbachev arriving in washington in early evening 
after his stopover in canada before thursdays arrival ceremony 
fitzwater said 
however since both leaders have in the past demonstrated a 
degree of unpredictability fitzwater declined to be pinned down 
when asked to say for certain that bush would not contact gorbachev 
on wednesday night 
i dont rule anything out the spokesman said 
bush attended two briefings from advisors in the morning one 
dealing with economic and trade issues and the second with arms 
control 
in the afternoon he held a final briefing session with key 
advisors to consider overview questions the general tone and 
texture of the summit fitzwater said 
while not detailing what bush and kohl talked about in their 
wednesday morning phone call fitzwater said the president does not 
plan to unveil any new proposal at the summit to limit the military 
forces of a unified germany 
he said that bush still shares kohls views that a reunified 
germany should be a full member of nato we are opposed to any 
proposal which would single out germany for special limits 
fitzwater said 
at the same time fitzwater said the issue of force levels 
within germany was a proper subject for followon conventional 
arms control negotiations once a treaty to reduce troops and 
tanks throughout europe is reached 
the issue of the size of the german army is of obvious 
concern to the soviets we understand that fitzwater said 
however he added that it was not an issue that could be resolved 
at this weeks summit 
fitzwater said germany unity would likely be discussed in 
greater depth at the morerelaxed talks expected to take place on 
saturday between bush and gorbachev at the us presidential 
retreat at camp david md 
as it stood wednesday bush and gorbachev at their white house 
sessions on thursday and friday planned to deal primarily with arms 
control conventional arms chemical weapons trade and other 
issues that could lead to various specific agreements 
fitzwater said 
there are a lot of floating parts at this moment the white 
house spokesman said and trying to put order in that process is 
really what saturdays discussions are all about

president bush will cut no deal with mikhail 
s gorbachev at this weeks summit to limit german troops but he 
is prepared to discuss a formula that might eventually scale down 
those forces along with the red army us officials said wednesday 
the issue of german unification and its impact on arms control 
loomed as the potential spoiler at the fourday summit and 
gorbachev signaled his determination to press the matter before 
leaving canada for washington 
there are different scenarios that might not be exactly what 
the west would propose he told reporters before leaving ottawa 
there should be no attempt to dictate a solution 
gorbachevs reservations about the more powerful nation that 
will emerge from the merger of east germany with west germany have 
contributed to a slowdown in negotiations to cut us and soviet 
troops tanks aircraft helicopters and other nonnuclear weapons 
in europe 
american and soviet negotiators held a fourth day of presummit 
talks at the state department to try to overcome the slump and to 
expand on the kinds of longrange nuclear weapons to be reduced in 
another treaty 
they met for an hour and a half in the morning and did not 
resume in the afternoon everybody would like to see things 
progress but there isnt a lot of progress a us official 
said they are waiting for the rest of the team 
meanwhile secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze arranged to meet separately 
friday at the white house while bush and gorbachev hold their first 
session 
in 11thhour drive to forge agreements the kremlin assigned 
col gen labronislav omelichev first deputy on the soviet defense 
ministrys general staff to the talks there was no immediate word 
of his arrival from moscow 
the move was viewed by us officials as a positive step 
omelichev a specialist on strategic nuclear weapons was 
considered instrumental in the headway the two superpowers made in 
negotiations here in february 
before leaving ottawa for the summit in washington gorbachev 
referred to us insistence on full nato membership for a more 
powerful german neighbor saying i would like us to find a new 
melody 
bush administration officials here said the president was 
determined to have a successful meeting with gorbachev and to try 
to ease the soviet leaders concerns without backing away from 
having germany in the western alliance 
they said any settlement would require the participation and 
consent of west germany and the other partners in the 16nation 
military group 
we are opposed to any proposal which would single out germany 
for special limits marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman 
said 
however bush and gorbachev will discuss the general 
question of german unification and we want to hear their 
concerns and interests fitzwater said 
the formula other us officials said bush was ready to take up 
with gorbachev involved a tradeoff to be negotiated by nato and 
the warsaw pact in vienna after a treaty to reduce us and soviet 
troops and nonnuclear forces in europe is finished 
the western allies would consider imposing limitations on the 
size of the german army but in exchange the soviets would have to 
agree to cut down the red army proportionally within the soviet 
union said the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
and in a concession to gorbachev who finds the buffer provided 
by the warsaw pact crumbling nato troops would keep out of what is 
now east germany while some red army troops could stay there for 
a transitional period the official said 
spokesman fitzwater hinting at the arrangement said bush was 
prepared to explore mutually acceptable options and positions 
he stressed there would be no bargaining though over unifying 
germany 
assistant secretary of state raymond gh seitz told reporters 
that the united states wants rapid unification in an orderly 
fashion and with the new germany enjoying the privileges and 
responsibilities of all other nations in europe 
that doesnt seem to be the soviet approach he said 
seitz said the soviets have a lot of legitimate concern 
which the united states and its allies must address but not at 
the cost of a fully sovereign germany 
as for the arms talks margaret d tutwiler the state 
department spokeswoman said there are still a lot of questions 
to be answered i can tell you there has been some progress 
but there has not been a definite resolution 
the current negotiations got a presummit boost on tuesday with 
an agreement on how to define tanks and armored personnel carriers 
this will help in carrying out cutbacks in us and soviet arsenals 
in europe and also in verifying compliance with an eventual arms 
reduction treaty 
but us officials disclosing omelichevs imminent arrival 
said there was no breakthrough on a halfdozen strategic nuclear 
weapons issues nor he said have the negotiators settled on a 
definition of combat aircraft the key sticking point in the 
conventional arms arena despite the presence at the table of the 
top soviet negotiator oleg a grinevsky 
there is ample agreement on enough strategic weapons reductions 
to enable bush and gorbachev to issue a declaration during the 
summit pledging to reduce their arsenals of nuclear missiles 
bombers and submarines by 30 to 35 percent

preliminary plea bargaining has begun between 
mayor marion barrys attorney and federal prosecutors over the 
mayors drug and perjury case a source familiar with the mayors 
legal situation said wednesday 
the source a longtime confidant of barrys who spoke only on 
condition of anonymity said us attorney jay b stephens and 
defense lawyer r kenneth mundy held their first discussion last 
week 
barry has pleaded innocent to all charges and lawyers on both 
sides of the case have consistently denied any plea bargain 
discussions were taking place 
the mayor is scheduled to stand trial on 14 charges beginning 
june 4 
in an interview published in wednesdays editions of the 
washington post barry acknowledged smoking crack cocaine just 
prior to his jan 18 arrest at a downtown washington hotel in an 
fbi sting operation 
but he said federal authorities had tried to kill him by 
allowing him access to potent drugs he also dismissed earlier 
reports that he was considering a plea bargain 
i think the prosecutors know that in this town all it takes is 
one juror saying im not going to convict marion barry i dont 
care what you say barry told the newspaper 
however barry added im not saying that never in life that 
one doesnt reexamine ones position later he added my ego 
is not such that im going to go crazy if im not the mayor 
the source who disclosed the discussions between mundy and 
stephens said these are preliminary talks sort of a feelingout 
process but theyre still talking 
of course these are plea bargain discussions the source 
added 
the source said stephens and mundy have had at least four 
conversations since last friday when us district court judge 
thomas penfield jackson denied mundys motion to dismiss the case 
theyre still talking but they are a long way off the 
source said they are not making a great deal of progress but it 
would be wrong to say they cannot ultimately reach a settlement 
barry who faces three felony counts of lying to a grand jury 
about his alleged drug use would be barred from office and 
prohibited from running for reelection if convicted of any of 
those charges 
he would not plead to that the source said the thinking 
is he would rather take his chances in court 
the 54yearold mayor also faces 10 misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charges and one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge 
neither mundy nor stephens could immediately be reached for 
comment several telephone calls to each were not returned 
barry has not publicly revealed his political plans but has been 
making a series of campaignstyle appearances around the city in 
recent weeks anita bonds barrys campaign manager said in a 
statement tuesday that her staff is very hopeful that we will 
have a candidate for mayor in mayor marion barry later this 
season 
bonds told the associated press that she intends to pick up 
candidate petitions from the citys board of elections later this 
week such a move would mark barrys first formal step toward a 
candidacy

space shuttle columbia will not take 
off until next week at the earliest after a fuel leak scrubbed 
wednesdays launch nasa officials said 
columbia had been scheduled to lift off at 1238 am edt with a 
150 million observatory called astro but it was called off about 
six hours before launch time when hydrogen began leaking while 
columbias external fuel tank was being loaded 
workers were expected to enter columbias rear engine 
compartment early thursday to search for the leak and assess the 
problem but first all the hydrogen must be vented from the 
external tank and the system must be purged with nonflammable 
helium 
its hard to believe at the rate of leak weve seen that we 
missed it said bascom murrah a nasa official in charge of 
prelaunch operations for columbia something gave but its a 
guessing game until we get in there 
it was the first time a shuttle launch had been scrubbed during 
fueling more than a halfmillion gallons of supercold liquid 
hydrogen and liquid oxygen were being pumped into columbias 
external tank 
the system was tight going into launch count and it passed 
all of our standard leak tests we felt good about it said nasa 
launch director bob sieck the problem did not manifest itself 
until we saw cold cryogenic temperatures of course it is our hope 
that it is still there under ambient conditions when we go into our 
troubleshooting 
columbias seven astronauts returned to their home base at 
johnson space center in houston on wednesday they planned to 
practice liftoffs and landings in a shuttle mission simulator while 
awaiting a new launch date 
engineers for the national aeronautics and space administration 
spent hours opening and closing valves and watching a network of 
sensors before finding the general area of the leaks late tuesday 
a 17inch valve in a pipe that carries fuel from the external 
tank to the shuttles main engines was believed to have a leak the 
size of a pinhole sieck said 
sieck said hydrogen leaked for fewer than five minutes before 
the fueling was halted readings showed hydrogen inside the aft end 
of columbia as well as outside the orbiter 
hydrogen also leaked from equipment on the launch platform but 
that was minor and would not have prevented nasa from proceeding 
with the launch murrah said 
if the problem is something obvious that we can repair on the 
pad then well do that and fly murrah said 
sieck said given those circumstances the middle of next week 
would be the earliest another launch could be attempted 
a worsecase scenario would mean rolling columbia back to its 
hangar which likely would mean a delay of about a month murrah 
said 
there is still maybe some unknown that we can check or test 
every aspect of the valve between the orbiter and the external 
tank in the current configuration at that pad sieck said 
however its a technical problem and with technical problems 
we can find them we will find it and we will fix it and we will 
get on with the mission theres just a schedule uncertainty as 
to when well be there 
in either case nasa plans to open columbias payload bay on 
friday and replenish the argon supply of astros xray telescope 
sieck said the telescope constantly needs argon so its instruments 
remain cold the job is expected to take more than two days but 
could be done in conjunction with other work 
nasa said wednesday it would proceed as planned with fridays 
scheduled launch of a german xray observatory known as rosat the 
observatory will be boosted into orbit by an unmanned delta rocket 
columbias nine to 10day mission with astro will be the 36th 
shuttle flight and the first one in five years devoted entirely to 
scientific research the observatorys four telescopes will examine 
ultraviolet light and xrays emitted from extremely hot stars and 
galaxies such radiation is invisible from the ground

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said 
wednesday the wests insistence on keeping a united germany in nato 
sounds like an old record and indicated he would offer new 
ideas to break the impasse 
we do have some leeway to find an accommodation there are 
different scenarios that might not be exactly what the west would 
propose he told reporters before he flew to washington for his 
summit with president bush 
western leaders are trying to dictate to a certain degree 
gorbachev said there should be no attempt to dictate a 
solution 
gorbachev said he and prime minister brian mulroney spent a 
considerable part of our time discussing german unification but 
said they had not resolved a disagreement over whether a united 
germany could belong to nato 
in spite of all that i think we can say we had an exchange 
which was positive and very constructive he said it was a 
short visit but a very intense visit 
mulroney like bush and the other western allies supports 
keeping germany within nato west germany currently belongs to the 
western military alliance east germany belongs to the sovietled 
warsaw pact 
the soviet union has suggested that a united germany could 
belong to both military alliances or a new security system but 
has opposed suggestions that it belong only to nato 
gorbachev has said failure to somehow neutralize germany or 
prevent it from ever again threatening the soviet union could stall 
the soviet military withdrawal from eastern europe 
we have to find a course of action that will support rather 
than do damage to those very important changes that are happening 
in europe and in the world he said it has to be a course of 
action that we find together 
i have not yet heard any alternative from the west it seems 
that it is just like an old record that keeps playing the same 
notes again and again i would like us to find a new melody 
at an airport news conference before leaving for washington 
gorbachev said that the nations discussing german unification must 
carefully consider the consequences as well as the views and 
interests of all sides 
this is not just a 30second basketball match he said 
you have to ask what does the other side want maybe we have to 
take a time out 
in addition he said german leaders have much work to do before 
achieving unification 
they have to get rid of euphoria and get down to business 
because they have enough problems he said 
gorbachev also spoke of a changing europe changing for the 
better instead of confrontation we are getting to know each other 
better we are even getting to trust each other 
mulroney was conciliatory saying he believes there has been an 
inadvertent insensitivity to the legitimate security 
apprehensions of the soviet union 
he told reporters that no country suffered more than the soviet 
union in world war ii 
mulroney urged the united states and the soviet union to pursue 
a compromise course to avoid dealing a lethal blow to the 
progress that has been made in eastwest relations 
gorbachev also answered questions about his problems with the 
three secessionist baltic republics he noted there has been 
pressure to use very hard measures to resolve this question 
lithuania latvia and estonia were forcibly annexed in 1940 and 
have been seeking to secede from the soviet union gorbachev 
imposed economic sanctions against lithuania after it declared 
independence on march 11 
he became very animated when he discussed lithuanias 
declaration which he said was done in a dishonest thieflike 
manner on the eve of an important meeting of the soviet 
parliament and he said those lithuanians seeking immediate 
independence are adventurists 
gorbachev has said the republics can only win their independence 
by following the soviet constitution which requires the republics 
to get the approval of soviet lawmakers 
on a conciliatory note he said our federation does require 
some fundamental changes to give republics greater sovereignty 
and the ability to preserve their languages and cultures 
i think this is a progressive movement and i think this 
should be reflected in modern politics he said but he warned 
that fears are raised when separatism rears its head 
canada announced during the visit it will extend a 500 million 
line of credit to the soviet union over the next two years the aid 
is about 425 million in us dollars 
earlier after a wreathlaying ceremony at a war memorial 
gorbachev and mulroney surprised their escorts by walking part of 
the short distance to parliament hill to continue their talks 
as they strolled toward the ornate stone parliament building 
they smiled and occasionally paused to speak to the crowd that 
gathered behind police barriers 
they then got in their cars to drive the final stretch and 
avoided an encounter with a group of several hundred demonstrators 
who protested gorbachevs refusal to grant independence to the 
baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia

nathan erb 13 an eighth grader from lapeer mich agreed 
saying that keeping yourself awake between words was also a 
challenge the first two words thrown at him were not much of a 
challenge however he handled both casserole and then 
belomancy 
margaret rhine 10 a fifth grader from lexington sc and one 
of the younger competitors had not competed before this year but

a chinese group won the right wednesday to 
use a buffalo park to commemorate last years tiananmen square 
crackdown but was promptly warned not to expect any help from city 
hall 
the group june 4 memorial fund persuaded a judge to block 
enforcement of a city ordinance that forbids any speech oration 
or harangue in a city park without written permission from the 
parks commissioner the judge said the ordinance was probably 
unconstitutional 
in the absence of narrowly drawn reasons and definite 
standards for officials to follow the ordinance must be invalid 
said state supreme court justice leo j fallon 
parks commissioner stanley buczkowski rejected the groups bid 
to use delaware park buffalos major park this sunday but 
offered instead to close a downtown square to traffic so the 
ceremony could be held there instead 
russell sciandra the citys lawyer said he would not recommend 
an appeal but warned the group it can expect no special services 
from the city 
we were attempting to assist them by creating special 
arrangements for them in terms of police fire streets 
sanitation et cetera sciandra said they dont feel they need 
it if they have the unfettered right to use the park so be it 
eva koepsell the groups secretary said she found the citys 
attitude appalling 
every other major city in the united states is sponsoring a 
ceremony to remember the students who died in the june 4 military 
crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing she said 
weihsung lin the groups president said the citys cold 
shoulder would force organizers to look elsewhere for a stage and 
electricity but he said the experience was instructive 
it taught me a lot about the constitutional rights of freedom 
of speech and freedom of assembly said lin a graduate student

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev seeking 
to broaden moscows links to the capitalist world will meet with 
south koreas president next week in san francisco us officials 
said wednesday 
moscow and seoul have no formal diplomatic relations and 
gorbachevs decision to hold the meeting represents the strongest 
soviet gesture yet toward south korea 
the korea announcement came hours before gorbachev arrived in 
washington for four days of summitry with president bush 
at a redcarpet welcoming ceremony at andrews air force base 
md gorbachev said his meeting with bush stands out in its 
importance for an expected ussoviet agreement on the outlines 
of a strategic nuclear weapons treaty 
he also alluded to his desire to improve soviet relations with 
the noncommunist world 
referring to the global importance of the washington 
discussions gorbachev said a lot will depend on their results 
in determining how things will work out not only between you 
americans and us but also on a larger scale 
gorbachev was greeted by secretary of state james a baker iii 
and the pair traveled together to the soviet embassy for tea 
soviet television broadcast tidbits from the embassy reception 
about 1000 people both sightseers and protesters were kept a 
block and a half from the embassy and as the motorcade drove by 
the applause drowned out the boos 
among the protesters were about 30 people chanting stop 
killing armenians and another group with lithuanian flags and 
signs saying such things as no tanks in lithuania 
gorbachev is scheduled to meet with south korean president roh 
taewoo on monday in san francisco where he also will see ronald 
reagan and former secretary of state george shultz 
us officials said they played no role in arranging the meeting 
but were pleased to see it happen 
gorbachev flew to washington from ottawa where he said after a 
day of talks with canadian prime minister brian mulroney that he 
was waiting for the western allies to sing a new melody on the 
contentious issue of a united germanys membership in nato 
conflicting us and soviet views on the military alignment of a 
reunified germany and on the future role of nato itself was 
expected to be a major topic of gorbachevs three days of meetings 
with president bush starting thursday morning 
the united states has strongly supported seouls efforts to 
establish normal relations with the soviet union said margaret 
tutwiler a state department spokeswoman 
shortly before gorbachev headed for washington the president 
and the prime minister of lithuania issued a joint statement on the 
summit stressing their desire for an early end to moscows 
economic sanctions 
in a videotaped message broadcast via satellite from vilnius 
the lithuanian capital kazimiera prunskiene prime minister of the 
breakaway baltic republic said the energy situation there would 
reach an essentially critical stage this week unless gorbachev 
agreed to end his cutoff of oil and other fuel shipments 
we will be forced to stop not only the functioning of heating 
systems but also the nuclear power station which is our primary 
source of electricity in order to avoid a disaster similar to 
chernobyl prunskiene said in reference to the 1986 nuclear power 
plant accident that killed at least 31 people 
while hoping to pressure gorbachev into opening negotiations 
with lithuania on a transition to independence the bush 
administration also is concerned that a mounting number of domestic 
soviet crises could break gorbachevs grip on power 
administration officials sought thursday to accentuate the 
positive 
he is a man of great political strength clearly in control of 
the political apparatus said raymond seitz assistant secretary 
of state for european and canadian affairs 
it would be foolish to think he doesnt have problems but 
lots of political leaders have lots of political problems seitz 
told reporters in a presummit briefing 
during at least part of his stay in washington gorbachev may be 
able to set aside his worries at least four us organizations are 
planning to present the soviet president with special awards at a 
ceremony friday at the soviet embassy 
the franklin and eleanor roosevelt institute said it would give 
gorbachev its franklin delano roosevelt international four freedoms 
award for his extraordinary contributions in creating the 
possibility of the united states and the soviet union once again 
becoming allies 
also on friday afternoon gorbachev is to receive a man of 
history award from the appeal of conscience foundation a group 
of religious and business leaders the dr martin luther king jr

an american and two citizens of the soviet 
union won 10000 prizes wednesday for their proposals on how to 
make the soviet ruble convertible into dollars and other 
international currencies 
the winners were giuzel anulova of the moscow institute of world 
economy k panov a soviet citizen who works for the united 
nations commission for africa in addis ababa ethiopia and franklyn 
holzman of tufts university in medford mass near boston 
the prizes were awarded by a private san francisco foundation 
these papers have in common the underlying assumption that the 
only effective path to ruble convertibility is through the creation 
of a market economy said a statement signed by six jurors in the 
competition three signers were from the soviet union and three 
from the united states 
the soviet union needs dollars and other western or hard 
currencies to buy essential imports like grain and certain 
machinery to get hard currencies it sells oil natural gas 
diamonds furs arms vodka and other exports 
ordinary people and most soviet government enterprises cannot 
simply go to world currency markets and offer rubles for dollars 
as citizens of other countries can trade their currencies few 
people will buy rubles because the ruble can buy very little on 
world markets many joint ventures involve awkward barter 
arrangements to get around the lack of currency convertibility 
the soviet central government sets the rules for currency 
conversions including rates and amounts to conserve its limited 
stock of foreign currencies and it controls the allocation of that 
inventory 
major cities have lively black markets but these work only on a 
small scale for individuals who for instance may be willing to 
spend the rubles they get in sightseeing and other tourist 
activities the black market cannot be used for the big 
transactions of world trade 
officially the ruble is worth about 156064 rubles per 
dollar in fact soviet importers reportedly got only 80 cents 
125 rubles per dollar for each ruble last year travelers get 16 
cents per ruble 626 rubles per dollar and on the black market 
the ruble can go for as little as 67 cents 15 rubles per dollar 
after two days of intense discussion the jury came away 
impressed with the difficulties involved in devising a workable 
strategy for achieving a convertible ruble and also with the 
immense importance of making headway on this issue the jury 
statement said 
one of the soviet judges was ivan d ivanov deputy chairman of 
the soviet foreign economic commission he suggested at a news 
conference that convertibility might be achieved by the end of the 
century 
one of the american judges was ed a hewett a senior fellow at 
the brookings institution a leading washingtonbased research 
institute he said the judges deliberately refrained from 
distinguishing publicly among the ideas of the three winners 
another american judge anne o krueger a professor of 
economics at duke university and former vice president of the world 
bank said all the winners agreed that a first step would have to 
be stabilization of prices within the soviet union 
stabilization would have to be followed by a freeing of prices 
for all kinds of goods now regulated by the state and finally 
links between the soviet domestic economy and the international 
economy that she did not detail 
the differences among the papers were small she added and 
concerned such matters as the relative time and importance given to 
the successive stages 
prices in the soviet union are highly controlled and 
inflationary pressures typically show up as shortages many prices 
are to increase drastically on july 1 as the government hopes to 
ease shortages 
a second prize of 4000 was awarded to each of three other 
contestants 
saltan dzarasov chairman of the department of political 
economy as the soviet academy of sciences 
zsuzsa kelen of the hungarian ministry of finance 
kurosch shafei of frankfurt west germany 
their plans called for the soviets to introduce a new kind of 
money parallel with the existing ruble as a step toward 
convertibility the jury said it was not convinced a parallel 
currency would necessarily work but recognized that a large body of 
expert opinion supports the idea 
there were 584 entries from 23 countries according to 
organizers of the prizes there will be a conference in moscow in 
october where the winners and others will be asked to present their 
ideas 
the 42000 in prize money came from the furth foundation of san 
francisco calif which has previously spent much of its effort on 
helping young americans get educations

at a presummit news conference in ottawa gorbachev punctuated 
the issue of german unity by complaining that the west was trying 
to dictate the future of the new nation this will not suit 
us he warned 
yet the soviet leader did not mention the dispute when he 
arrived in washington 
a lot will depend on our results gorbachev said this 
summit stands out in its importance first of all for the promise 
it holds as the first major step to reduce strategic nuclear arms 
the two leaders were ready to sign longsought agreements to 
reduce nuclear and chemical weapons but their differences on 
germany pushed to the top of the agenda on the eve of the fourday 
meeting gorbachev emphasized his opposition to a united germany 
belonging to the wests nato alliance and challenged bush to offer 
another solution 
it seems that it is just like an old record that seems to be 
playing the same note again and again i would like us to find 
a new melody gorbachev said in ottawa 
the white house said bush was sympathetic to soviet anxieties 
about the military might of a combined germany and said it would 
pursue an answer that was politically acceptable and reasonable 
gorbachev also voiced hopes for compromise we do have some 
leeway to find an accommodation there are different scenarios that 
might not be exactly what the west would propose 
in a reminder of gorbachevs domestic troubles lithuanian 
leaders sent a televised appeal via satellite to washington for a 
lifting of moscows economic blockade they said oil shortages 
threaten to shut down heating systems in the breakaway baltic 
republic a few hours later yeltsin the newly elected president 
of russia said he would seek sovereignty for the soviet unions 
largest republic 
the summit opening thursday was the biggest show in town 
red soviet flags snapped in the wind alongside american flags in 
front of 1600 pennsylvania avenue vendors hawked summit tshirts 
and television cameras staked out building tops within eyesight of 
the white house 
thousands of demonstrators were poised to raise their voices in 
lafayette park in protest of soviet pressure against the baltic 
states and other issues 
gorbachev comes to washington as a leader besieged by growing 
domestic woes ranging from an economic crisis to fractures within 
the soviet communist party 
bush enjoys strong political support but stands accused by 
conservative critics of giving away too much in arms deals to a 
weakened soviet leader 
bush closeted with advisers in a final day of preparations 
gave the presummit limelight to gorbachev 
the president spoke by telephone with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl who is trying to accelerate the move of east germany 
to the west into a single nation outside of soviet influence 
bush also talked with canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
who was gorbachevs host during an overnight visit in ottawa 
us and soviet negotiators were wrapping up a dozen agreements 
ranging from nuclear and chemical weapons to air travel and grain 
sales for the leaders to sign at a formal ceremony friday evening 
as we move from conflict to cooperation the agreements 
reached on thursday and friday will provide for a realistic 
foundation for the growing and changing ussoviet relationship 
said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
he hinted bush might be willing to sign a trade agreement with 
gorbachev despite differences over lithuanias struggle for 
independence the treaty would be a step short of giving moscow 
coveted mostfavorednation trade status which would lower tariffs 
on soviet goods 
i intentionally want to be vague about prospects for a trade 
pact said fitzwater i urge you not to rule out anything 
describing bushs mood as one of anticipation and 
confidence fitzwater said the president sees a new horizon in 
this meeting a horizon of opportunity and after these discussions 
we should have a much better view of a new day in eastwest 
relations 
the sharp differences over germany threatened to mar summit 
harmony 
the united states insists that a united germany be a full 
partner in nato politically and militarily 
gorbachev has been reluctant to let the world war ii prize of 
germany slip away he has proposed that it be a member of both nato 
and the warsaw pact or that both alliances be isbanded 
fitzwater said bush would explore the subject with gorbachev 
from the standpoint of seeking mutually acceptable options and 
positions 
these issues are not going to be decided here he said 
fitzwater said the size of german forces are of obvious 
concern to the soviets we understand that 
he said the problem could be addressed within the context of 
europeanwide troop reductions in future talks following an 
expected firststage agreement this year 
we are opposed to any proposal which would single out germany 
for special military limits he said 
assistant secretary of state raymond seitz briefing reporters 
described the german question as an area of real conceptual 
differences between the superpowers 
he said the united states wants rapid unification in an 
orderly fashion with germany enjoying the privileges and 
responsibilities of all other nations in europe 
that doesnt seem to be the soviet approach he said 
there were lastminute jitters over a pact to slash longrange 
nuclear missiles and hopes for progress to cut troops and tanks in 
europe us officials said there was an impasse on a halfdozen 
issues for a strategic weapons accord 
the soviets called in col gen labronislav omelichev a nuclear 
arms expert in what was viewed by us officials as a move to 
settle some of the issues that have eluded negotiators over four 
days of talks

gen saw maung said wedneday that his 
military regime was willing to lawfully hand over power to a 
civilian government but he warned that threats to national unity 
could disrupt the process 
in remarks to top government officials reported on state radio 
and television saw maung said the military would yield power to a 
government formed by the parliament elected in sundays general 
elections 
official results indicate that parliament would be heavily 
dominated by the party most critical of saw maungs rule the 
national league for democracy some western diplomats and other 
analysts have expressed skepticism over whether the military would 
actually hand over power 
saw maung told government employees to serve loyally any 
government that comes to power 
but he said the military government would continue attending 
to the countrys need for security transportation and food he 
did not elaborate 
whoever interferes in our carrying out our tasks of preventing 
disintegration of the union perpetuating national sovereignty and 
protecting national unity will not be tolerated saw maung said 
it was the first public statement on the elections by saw maung 
who led a brutal suppression of prodemocracy demonstrations in 
september 1988 and established martial law 
the military government called for general elections after the 
crackdown and for a time allowed relatively free political activity 
but when opposition leader aung san suu kyi the charismatic 
daughter of independence hero aung san criticized the military and 
gathered mass support last summer she was put under house arrest 
the coleader of her national league for democracy tin oo was 
also jailed former prime minster nu also remains under house 
arrest 
sources in the national league for democracy said their partys 
unofficial vote tally showed they had gained 391 of the 485 seats 
contested in the election the latest official vote tally showed 
the league had won 76 out of 82 seats 
the official count apparently lags behind unofficial tallies 
because signed certificates must be sent from polling stations to 
the election commission in rangoon which has become a time 
consuming process 
the official working peoples daily newspaper said 76 percent of 
eligible voters turned out for the election burmas first 
multiparty polls in 30 years 
the military government which still rules under a martial law 
decree has promised to turn power over to civilians once a new 
constitution is completed and a strong government is in place 
the election has proved a massive defeat for the promilitary 
national unity party which wielded unchallenged power when it 
ruled under another name from 1962 to 1988

amnesty international complained wednesday that 
attacks are increasing on human rights defenders and investigators 
in latin america and urged the organization of american states to 
take steps to stop the violations 
in a letter to the oas the world human rights group cited 
examples of obstruction threats and harassment torture 
disappearances and extrajudicial executions in brazil colombia el 
salvador guatemala honduras and peru 
it identified 16 clergymen priests lawyers politicians and 
others who it said were threatened tortured abducted or killed in 
the past 12 months 
one case cited was that of elizabeth suarez giraldo a human 
rights worker in cali colombia who reported being detained by the 
army march 2 when she inquired about trade unionists in custody 
she said she was kept blindfolded and was tortured and raped before 
being released april 19 after she was acquitted on charges of 
violating an antiterrorist law 
the letter said that luis tenderini president of the brazilian 
justice and peace commission in recife was abducted and tortured 
in march 1989 for demanding that death squads be investigated 
it expressed concern over lack of substantial progress in 
proceedings in the investigation of eight el salvador soldiers in 
last novembers murders of six jesuit priests and two others 
in guatemala at least 77 members or sympathizers of the council 
of ethnic communities received death threats during the past year 
four were abducted and four others murdered the letter said 
it said violatons continued at an alarming level in the past 
year against human rights defenders in honduras while in peru 
the lima offices of the andean commission of jurists and of amnesty 
were bombed feb 18 and march 4 
the oas general assembly begins its 20th session monday meeting 
in asuncion paraguay 9 an amnesty international delegation will 
attend as a special guest the human rights group which is based 
in london hopes its letter will be considered there 
there was no specific incident that prompted us to send the 
letter but an accumulation of reports in our files spokeswoman 
anita tieson said 
the letter sent to the ambassadors of the 32 oas member states 
said those responsible for the violations were generally the police 
and military in uniform and plainclothes acting as death squads 
and also civilian representatives of the army and citizens 
militias operating under military control 
official investigations of the abuses have been slow and 
inefficient and almost invariably have not produced concrete 
results the letter said 
judicial authorities who tried to investigate reported 
violations were sometimes threatened or attacked it added

the layman son of a presbyterian minister 
was elected head of the presbyterian church wednesday saying he 
hopes to teach the love of christ and a sense of community to a 
church divided 
price h gwynn iii of charlotte nc described himself as a 
longshot candidate who nevertheless sensed he might eventually win 
leadership of the presbyterian church usa 
he won on a second ballot cast by the 605 commissioners meeting 
in the faiths 202nd general assembly to pick a successor to the 
rev joan salmoncampbell gwynn 67 received 322 votes or almost 
53 percent 
im not a renegade said gwynn who earlier had roused the 
general assembly with a speech critical of church bureaucracy 
he said a belief in the divinity of jesus christ and his 
resurrection is all that is needed to heal rifts and a membership 
malaise affecting the 29 millionmember church 
the churchs membership has steadily declined over the past two 
decades losing more than 120000 in the past three years and 30 
percent of its membership since 1970 
gwynn said the cure lies not in the general assembly but in the 
churchs individual members and local congregations 
if you are warm and inviting and the love of god is visible 
then im not concerned he said rising water lifts all boats 
the new moderator who will serve for a year said the church 
leadership needs to do a better job keeping abreast of the times 
change is driven by belief and faith and conviction it is no 
longer driven by technology if we shoot ourselves in the foot 
were going to have to answer for that he said this could be 
a five millionmember denomination by the year 2000 
gwynn is the eighth moderator since factions of the church 
reunited in 1983 healing a civil warera split over slavery the 
moderator presides over the general assembly and represents the 
church for the remainder of the year 
gwynn said he believes leadership may be out of touch with the 
churchgoer who worries more about the church itself than issues 
such as whether homosexuals should be ordained as ministers a 
topic the general assembly likely will take up next week 
the question im asked is do we have our act together up 
here can we put aside our differences to get our act together 
in the world gwynn told the assembly which meets through june 
6 
but emphasizing unity does not mean there is no place for 
dissension he said 
were going to disagree said gwynn who pointed out 
presbyterians have a history of factionalism dating back to the 
civil war nobody should be shocked but we dont have to agree 
to work together 
gwynn is a semiretired president of a charlotte packing company 
and chairman of the board of presbyterian hospital and presbyterian 
health services corp 
an elder in the steele creek church in charlotte and father of 
three gwynn said he is not an activist and has no plans for 
radical changes he said he could not support ordination of 
homosexuals who he said are sinners deserving of gods love but 
not of the ministry 
gwynn said he supports responsible choice in dealing with 
abortion he said his experience with hospitals has taught him that 
those who suffer when abortions are unavailable are the poor the 
powerless and the unwanted child 
about 750 presbyterians from around the us are attending the 
10day conference in salt lake city the first meeting of the 
protestant denomination in predominantly mormon utah

albanian communist party leader ramiz alia on 
wednesday told the first us official delegation to visit his 
country since 1939 that albania wants to reestablish full 
diplomatic relations with washington as soon as possible 
rep tom lantos dcalif said he had an extremely 
longlively constructive meeting wednesday evening with alia 
whose hardline communist country has recently shown signs of 
easing its extreme isolationist policies 
alia asked me to convey to president bush and secretary of 
state james a baker their desire to establish full diplomatic 
relations as early as possible and i certainly feel the time is 
right lantos said in a telephone interview 
it is in the interest of both the united states and albania 
to reestablish relations lantos said we hope to have an 
embassy in tirana by september or october 
lantos said albanians have a long way to go in improving 
their human rights record but said that should not stop the united 
states from resuming relations 
another member of the us delegation joe dioguardi a former 
republican congressman from new york quoted alia as saying that 
albania is interested in becoming a party to the helsinki accords 
on human rights 
the official albanian news agency ata said alia and lantos had 
warm and friendly talks but gave no other details of the 
meeting that was held in the peoples assembly in tirana 
the united states has long accused albania the sole remaining 
hardline communist state in eastern europe following a wave of 
prodemocracy uprisings last year of human rights violations for 
denying freedom of worship and emigration and other rights 
the united states and albania broke relations before world war 
ii 
lantos said albania was also extremely eager to pursue joint 
ventures with us companies 
albania severed ties with the soviet union in 1961 due to an 
ideological dispute but has recently expressed interest in 
restoring ties with moscow 
while albania is reforming its political and economic system it 
has avoided any promises of instituting sweeping reforms similar to 
those implemented by the other eastern european nations

new york republicans on wednesday 
nominated a political unknown to challenge democratic gov mario 
cuomos expected reelection bid this year 
im going into this thing to win economist pierre rinfret 
said in his acceptance speech 
the cuomo years have become a disaster said rinfret who 
was nominated by acclamation the people of our state have twice 
put their faith in mario cuomo unfortunately he seems to have 
lost faith in the people 
it had taken new york republicans nearly a year to find a 
candidate to challenge cuomo state gop chairman j patrick barrett 
had been turned down by one bigname republican after another 
including us sen alfonse damato 
cuomo is expected to announce his plans to seek a third 
fouryear term within days 
considered a potential 1992 democratic presidential contender 
cuomo is generally viewed as a big favorite for reelection even 
by republicans 
rinfrets acceptance speech was his first public appearance 
since his name surfaced early last week as a possible candidate 
the canadianborn rinfret 66 has never run for public office 
before but he did serve as an unpaid adviser to presidents 
kennedy johnson and nixon he currently heads a new york 
citybased economics consulting firm and he lives in manhattan 
rinfret said he was running because im a lucky and successful 
american dream 
he promised that if elected he would cut tax rates and tax 
burdens to restore economic growth and he pledged to enact the 
death penalty and get tough on drug dealers 
cuomo has presided over two consecutive years of 1 billionplus 
tax increases including a record 18 billion in tax and fee 
increases this year the tax increases have become necessary 
because of continuing budget deficits and economic problems in new 
york 
cuomo has vetoed death penalty legislation every year since he 
became governor in january 1983 
rinfrets lack of experience in politics and his abortionrights 
stance have prompted the state conservative party to reject him as 
its nominee 
instead the conservatives plan to nominate new york university 
professor herbert london on saturday as their gubernatorial 
candidate london could not convince gop leaders to choose him as 
their candidate he then rejected an offer to be rinfrets running 
mate 
a split between republicans and conservatives would divide the 
anticuomo vote and make the governors reelection even more 
likely

in more than 50 years on wednesday elected a retired army general 
and former political prisoner as president of yugoslavias 
secondlargest republic 
thousands of flagwaving people gathered on a square outside of 
parliament in zagrebs old quarter to greet franjo tudjman leader 
of the croatian democratic union the party won a landslide victory 
in elections for the regional legislature earlier this month

and particularly the united states and western europe to create a 
pluralistic political system 
in an attack on the rival republic of serbia where the 
communist leadership is firmly entrenched tudjman said parts of 
yugoslavia where democracy had not taken hold would find communist 
rule represents a barren historical anachronism

youngest general spent almost five years in jail in the 1970s for 
croatian nationalism and hostile activities against the state

was really curious about who killed laura theyd have to pick up 
the show 
our sole strategy was survival by withholding the identity of 
the killer we thought we were down to our last coin 
an abc spokesman told the press early this month that the 
mystery would be solved in the last show but on wednesday 
spokesman bob wright changed his tune 
i was always under the assumption that the central part of the 
story pertaining to the murder would be resolved wright said 
i was wrong from now on i will not make any promises about 
twin peaks 
so twin peaks will be back in the fall along with it 
appears disappointed viewers who charted every dizzying turn of 
the shows nine hours trying to figure out who murdered the sleepy 
northwest lumber towns homecoming queen 
on april 8 television was introduced to a world out of kilter 
confected by frost and film director david lynch who made blue 
velvet 
the ratings were only mediocre but diehard fans threw twin 
peaks parties and more was written about the program than any 
other in recent memory 
so with much ballyhoo twin peaks hurtled toward its season 
finale with viewers waiting for the solution to lauras murder as 
promised by abc 
there were a lot of people who were disappointed that they 
didnt learn the identity of lauras killer frost said i just 
think there was a misunderstanding somewhere 
i cant give anything away but when viewers come back and 
were coming back with a twohour premiere i think their 
curiosity will be satisfied 
what about the dancing dwarf who spoke backwards and series 
star kyle maclachlan who had three bullets pumped into him at 
pointblank range in the last episode 
there are a lot of different ways that that can go frost 
said i think that when you see the show next year youll 
understand why we left it that way with scrutiny everything so 
far will come together

soviet legislator ilmars bishers said initial reports indicated 
some soviet deaths occurred but he gave no details 
richter scale readings ranged from 65 to 75 uppsala 
seismological center in sweden said the quake was felt so widely 
because it was about 63 miles deep 
i think it was this deafening sound of cracking walls that 
scared people said clerical worker sica burcea 52 the 
building was swinging horizontally and vertically we were lucky 
only to have some cracks in the walls i shivered when i realized 
1977 was coming back

quake as measured by the ground motion recorded by seismographs a 
quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage one of magnitude 7 is 
reckoned as a major earthquake 
the national earthquake center in golden colo registered the 
initial quake at 65 and thursdays aftershock at 59 
weve had no reports of injuries or damages but certainly a 
59 is capable of that especially when people are asleep said

railroad crews worked wednesday to 
collect 120000 gallons of jet and diesel fuel spilled just 
upstream from a wildlife refuge when 19 tanker cars derailed 
soggy terrain and the remote location hampered cleanup workers 
but officials said more fuel would have seeped into a creek running 
into the refuge if not for beaver dams on both sides of the alaska 
railroad tracks 
i would have to give the railroad a good grade on first 
response and the beavers even a better grade said al townsend a 
biologist for the state department of fish and game 
the last of the derailed tankers were dragged away wednesday and 
the alaska railroad reopened with trains moving at reduced speed 
said dale nelson environmental engineer for the railroad 
a 68car train was transporting more than a million gallons of 
jet and diesel fuel from a refinery at north pole to anchorage on 
memorial day when 19 cars jumped the track about 40 miles south of 
fairbanks seven tankers tore open dumping fuel into beaver ponds 
on both sides of the tracks 
some fuel was seeping into goldstream creek and the 500000acre 
minto flats wildlife refuge a prime waterfowl nesting area 
one of our concerns is the fairly substantial number of pike 
and whitefish that just finished spawning said mac mclean of the 
fish and game department the eggs could hatch anytime and 
thats a pretty sensitive life stage 
he also said beaver muskrat and otters were particularly 
threatened 
suction machines had skimmed an estimated 10000 gallons of the 
spilled fuel by late wednesday work had been slowed however 
because the pumps were mounted on rail cars and couldnt get past 
the tangled pile of derailed tankers officials said 
an oily sheen extended at least eight miles down goldstream 
creek despite the beaver dams and plywood dams and absorbent booms 
laid by crews 
the refined fuel is more toxic than crude oil but can evaporate 
more quickly if exposed to air and sunlight state environmental 
officials planned to have the creek water tested to determine 
underwater levels of toxicity 
representatives of local state and federal agencies met 
wednesday to discuss a longterm cleanup plan which the railroad 
must submit by monday to the state 
railroad investigators took routine blood tests for alcohol and 
drugs from the three crew members on the train and brought the 
trains speed indicator to anchorage for inspection 
tests showed the train was moving within the 44 mph limit posted 
for the area when it derailed said railroad spokeswoman vivian 
hamilton

an artists use of an alleged ethnic slur in 
the inscription of a steelworker statue is being attacked by 
croatians the united steelworkers union and other ethnic and labor 
groups 
the 12foot fiberglass statue in the middle of a downtown park 
is inscribed with the title and signature hunky steelworker 
luis jimenez 90 
the sculptors choice of words has touched a raw nerve among 
our members across a wide range of ethnic backgrounds said 
andrew v lefty palm director of the union district that 
covers pittsburgh steelworkers 
its a blatant insult said edward verlich of the croatian 
fraternal union we arent trying to deny anyone freedoms but we 
dont want this emblazoned on a statue where a halfmillion people 
will see it 
the term hunky originated in the late 1800s as a term to 
describe people of hungarian descent but its use was expanded 
quickly as an insult toward anyone whose ancestors came from 
central europe said sarah thomason a professor of linguistics at 
the university of pittsburgh 
its also of the same origin as the word honky which some 
blacks use to describe whites ms thomason said wednesday 
the citys controller tom flaherty noticed the inscription on 
the back of the statue while jogging past it last week he held a 
press conference at its base to decry what he called a slur against 
eastern europeans 
the statue was erected as a tribute to steelworkers 
jimenez the artist expressed surprise at the criticism of his 
work 
i certainly didnt think there would be a problem with this 
he told the pittsburgh postgazette i was trying to pay tribute 
to the contributions steelworkers have made to this country 
jimenez 49 of hondo nm said he researched steelworkers at 
pittsburghs carnegie library 
i came across the term millhunk or hunky as a way that 
steelworkers referred to themselves he said i used it as a 
term that was part of the popular culture i didnt mean it as any 
kind of derogatory term 
verlich the son of a croatian father and czechoslovakian 
mother said he didnt fault jiminez but would like to see the 
title changed 
he thought he was using a term of endearment but the term is 
derogatory and inflammatory and has no business on a statue in the 
city of pittsburgh verlich said 
the citys croatians and other ethnic and labor groups have 
suggested that covering up the y in hunky forming hunk 
steelworker would be appropriate the new title could work 
they said because the steelworker depicted is disproportionally 
stout in a hunk of fiberglass 
they can cover that with plastic verlich said 
the organizers of the three rivers art festival which brought 
the statue to the city have said theyll meet with people who 
dont like the statue but wont remove it from the parks most 
prominent part 
the festival director wasnt available immediately wednesday 
the festival opens friday

shaking she said

and porvenir two villages located about 12 miles from moyobamba

reported there were no reports on damage or injuries 
the institute said the epicenters of the quakes were located in 
the pacific ocean near the peruvian coast

earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph a quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage

prime minister benazir bhutto called 
out the army on wednesday to stop the bloodshed in her embattled 
home province where ethnicrelated violence has killed more than 
300 people in the past two weeks 
enough is enough she told a news conference we will not 
tolerate terrorism we will be dealing with a strong hand 
ms bhutto said the army would work with the civilian government 
of sind province where karachi and her political power base lie 
to stop the sniper shootings kidnappings and violent clashes 
between rival ethnic groups and security forces 
while she spoke police said gunfire killed 20 people and 
wounded 25 in karachi pakistans largest city with a population of 
more than 51 million officials said that brought the death toll 
since sunday to 109 
despite widespread 24hour curfews sniper shootings broke out 
in other parts of karachi police said they said three victims 
were shot in clifton the posh neighborhood where the prime 
minister maintains a home they said 
the bloodshed has prompted daylong strikes in other cities 
across pakistan and led to mounting criticism of ms bhutto and 
appeals from all quarters for her to act to stop the violence 
police blame current violence on a militant faction of the 
mohajir qami movement a small political party representing moslem 
indians who emigrated to pakistan during the 1947 partition of the 
subcontinent the movement demands recognition as pakistans fifth 
nationality along with the pathans punjabis baluch and sindhis 
ethnic tensions between the refugee mohajirs and native sindhis 
have faded and flared for five years claiming more than 2000 
lives 
fighting began anew on may 15 
heavily armed soldiers already patrol parts of karachi and 
hyderabad a city of 3 million people that was once considered 
sinds paradise 
when the army chief of staff gen mirza aslam beg visited 
hyderabad on tuesday an estimated 100000 people greeted him 
pleading that he guarantee their protection witnesses said 
one fear is that handing sind to the army would be the first 
step toward returning the entire country to military rule pakistan 
has spent 25 years of its 43year history under military 
dictatorship

as his domestic troubles multiply mikhail s 
gorbachev heads for washington expressing confidence that he and 
president bush will find a way to permit german unification without 
upsetting the balance of power in europe 
asked tuesday if he was optimistic about reaching agreement over 
germany and its membership in nato gorbachev replied i am sure 
of that and tell that to the american people 
his comment marked a sharp turn from the gloomy assessments of 
bush and his top advisers in recent days and gorbachevs own 
warning that us insistence on nato membership for a united 
germany could stall the withdrawal of soviet troops from eastern 
europe 
the soviet union has moved progressively from outright 
opposition to german reunification to acceptance of the concept 
under some formula that would provide assurances a new german giant 
would never again pose a military threat to its neighbors

the kgb apparently isnt all that concerned 
about washingtons reputation as the nations murder capital but a 
myriad of demonstrations promise to hold the attention of mikhail 
s gorbachevs protectors described by one soviet official as a 
big bunch of people with big guns 
richard adams of the secret service said tuesday the kgb didnt 
ask about dangerous sections of town and no such information was 
volunteered the two agencies are chiefly responsible for keeping 
gorbachev safe during the summit 
gorbachev will be staying at the soviet embassy just a few 
blocks from the white house a relatively safe part of the city 
and most of his planned schedule revolves around the embassy and 
the white house 
there have been no slayings in the embassys neighborhood in 
recent memory to ensure gorbachevs tranquility the entire block 
of 16th street in front of the embassy will be closed to traffic 
throughout the week said metropolitan police spokeswoman shannon

mtvs most popular executive caused a bit of 
a stir when he abruptly quit last fall 
lee masters adored by the music industry and credited with 
making the cable network solvent walked out because he said 
the new structure didnt give me much room for growth or 
authority 
translation mtvs new owners wouldnt let masters run the show 
now he does for a different brandnew cable network that he 
predicts will become mtv for adults 
on friday the e entertainment network will become the first 
24hour allentertainment cable channel on television bankrolled 
for the most part by home box office e will transmit celebrity 
news interviews movie picks television features fashion tips 
and just about anything and everything related to hollywood 
people watch this kind of stuff masters said theyre 
certainly not going to watch it every day but the idea is to have 
something for adults to watch the way youngsters and kids watch 
mtv 
isnt that what entertainment tonight is for or 
lifestyles of the rich and famous or better yet the 
movietime channel which e replaces 
yep said masters but theres plenty to go around because 
americans have insatiable appetites for inside glimpses of 
beautiful people and their seemingly beautiful lives 
and movietime with its own version of 24hour entertainment 
programming obviously never had lee masters at the helm or a huge 
infusion of capital 
e already has interviews with mel gibson michelle pfeiffer and 
darryl hannah in the can the roundtheclock programming will be 
divided into twohour segments hosted by a male and female 
anchor 
complementing the glitz of hollywood is a media blitz of es 
own at the recent national cable television association convention 
in atlanta es lavish display long on bells and whistles 
according to one attendee wowed many 
no expense has been spared on extravagant press kits or on the 
network itself according to masters e has a 43 million war 
chest most of it from hbo 
although hbo is only one of 10 equity partners in e it is the 
managing partner and chief financial backer other equity partners 
include comcast corp one of the countrys biggest cable 
operators warner cable cox cable and continental cablevision 
many of these same backers were behind movetime before it was 
replaced with e 
masters whose programming ideas helped bring game shows to mtv 
is quick to point out that managing partner or no hbo doesnt run 
e masters does 
they dont really run the show he said there are a lot 
of players and a lot of conflicting interests meaning the 
number of equity partners 
although he does not shape programming which made his name at 
mtv masters said he is much happier with his lot at e 
basically i run the whole business he said which is why 
i left mtv 
thus far e which will be part of basic cable service has 
spent 10 million to get the network up and running masters said 
and has signed on cable operators representing 145 million viewers 
by the end of the year masters estimated that number will be 
20 million but to do battle with the big cable networks such as 
espn and the usa network hell need more like 50 million viewers 
the real key to us masters said is that when we did our 
research we found there were two segments the celebrity 
personalitydriven viewers and the solid information segment 
what were trying to do is meld the two

anthony tarracino a 73yearold former 
saloonkeeper and boat skipper better known as capt tony says 
this island city is not your normal town in the us 
that could be an explanation of his qualifications to lead it 
tarracino has fathered 13 children with five women been 
portrayed in a hollywood movie and claims to have spent much of his 
life flouting the mafia fidel castro various neutrality laws and 
the establishment in general 
since last november hes been mayor of key west and by many 
accounts hes not doing badly at it 
i tell you what he aint doing he aint doing anything 
crazy says pritam singh the young multimillionaire developer 
transforming the former navy base here into a 250 million upscale 
community 
that might sound like an unusual way of grading a mayors 
performance but people werent quite sure what to expect after 
tarracinos slim runoff election victory last november his 
unofficial campaign slogan all you need is a tremendous sex 
drive 
over three decades as the proprietor of capt tonys saloon a 
former hangout of ernest hemingway tarracinos reputation was not 
for municipal acumen but for being a character who stood out on an 
island full of them 
no one knows for sure how much of tarracinos selfrecited 
history is true possibly not even he after nearly 30 years of 
retelling that began with his desire to give visiting journalists a 
colorful feature story they often came away describing tarracino 
as a character out of a hemingway novel 
the story goes something like this 
he was born in elizabeth nj became a teamsters organizer 
then fled when mobsters discovered he was placing bets with their 
bookies on horse races that already had been run 
he came to key west and became a boat captain in 1948 besides 
charter fishing he skippered gunrunning and mercenary expeditions 
and sneaked refugees out of cuba and cia agents back in 
he bought his bar in 1962 and began perfecting his stories some 
of which were depicted with stuart whitman playing capt tony in a 
1980 lowbudget dud called cuba crossing 
he ran for mayor four to seven times he doesnt count some of 
them because he wasnt running seriously he says along the way 
he fathered children ranging in age today from 53 to 4 years by 
three wives and two other of the 10 women hes lived with 
he lost a 1985 runoff election for mayor then came back to win 
last year in a rematch with banker tom sawyer 3049 votes to 3017 
opinions vary on why tarracino was elected his opponents 
grumble that people felt sorry for him after so many defeats 
supporters say tarracino represents a reaction against the 
direction key west is heading 
the 27000 people of the southernmost city in the continental 
united states face costly problems stemming from living on an 
island in an era when florida is enforcing environmental protection 
sewage treatment costs residents 600 a year and garbage nearly 
300 property taxes are six mills and other costs from rent to 
the water that must be piped in from the mainland also are 
skyrocketing 
tensions are high among developers who see demand for more 
condominiums businesspeople who say the city must increase its tax 
base and the little people for whom tarracino claims a mandate 
as expected tarracino has focused his mayorship on fighting 
developers 
hes helped the city commission overcome business interests to 
slash rents for vendors who ply their trades at the popular nightly 
sunset festival on mallory square docks and has led protests 
against navy plans to build military housing on peary court a 
27acre green space in the islands middle popular for picnics 
softball and frisbeetossing 
tarracino admits getting confused sometimes by statistics and 
procedures but he relies on a broad range of friendly advisers 
in the mayors office early one day after a commission meeting 
the night before that lasted to 11 pm tarracino expounds on the 
struggle he sees going on in key west 
people came here looking for their utopia he says 
theyre dreamers artists people with high iqs whether its 
making beads or painting or fishing they came here for their 
little paradise in the sun 
then look at all these big hotels its all built on paper 
and when they stop making money theyll pull out and leave the 
stake holes 
these are the people who are going to tell us what the rules 
are how to live here theyre strangers 
although one of his campaign selling points was the news media 
attention he would attract as mayor tarracino has no intention of 
being a laughable figurehead he got a copy of roberts rules of 
order after his election and rehearsed commission meetings with 
friends 
he dons a navy blue blazer for meetings and usually restrains 
himself from injecting his own rhetoric into debates 
although the 10000ayear post is meant to be only part time 
tarracino usually spends six to eight hours a day in his office he 
sold his bar but goes there regularly to chat and sign posters for 
tourists 
many other times the mayor is available at the dog track 
im like ann landers he says people know they can come 
in and ill listen to them 
tarracino who says he loves every minute of his job 
already is talking about running for reelection in 1991 
but richard heyman a twotime mayor who runs an art gallery 
expects people concerned about the tax base problems and other such 
issues to be more active behind their own candidates in the next 
election 
i think tonys intentions are good but hes totally offbase 
in his directions heyman says noting he only won by 32 
votes

with the approach of summer comes the peak 
season in the sun for a special breed among american investments 
the vacation home 
whether the property of your dreams is a waterfront villa or a 
modest cabin in the woods vacation realestate boasts many virtues 
with enduring appeal 
there arent many other ways to combine in a single package the 
pursuit of leisure with the business of trying to build a financial 
nest egg and make it grow 
the idea is simplicity itself or at least it was until the 
architects of the nations tax system went to work on it 
thanks in large measure to their regular efforts at additions 
alterations and redesign owners of vacation properties in the 
world of the 1990s need to be pretty fair hands at tax planning if 
they want to maximize both the psychic and the financial rewards of 
their investments 
the key distinction to be made is how to classify the place as 
a personal residence a rental property or a combination of the 
two 
if you never rent it to anybody else it logically qualifies as 
a personal residence making mortgage interest within limits and 
property taxes eligible under ordinary circumstances as deductions 
on your tax return 
with a property in this category expenses such as upkeep and 
repairs cannot be deducted 
when you can rent a property out for less than 15 days a year 
its status as a personal residence still applies 
at the other end of the spectrum a place that is continuously 
occupied by paying tenants and never used by the owner is a rental 
property subject to a completely different set of rules 
owning and operating a rental residence is a type of business 
venture known as a passive activity in which all expenses can 
be deducted from income when you are settling up accounts with 
uncle sam 
in some cases expenses exceeding your passive income can 
also be deducted one rule for example allows a tax loss of up to 
25000 for people who are primary owners and managers of 
properties and who have adjusted gross income from all sources of 
100000 or less 
a property is still a rental if your personal use of it 
doesnt exceed either 14 days or 10 percent of the number of days 
it is rented to others 
and what if you say live in a home for two months in the 
summer and rent it out the rest of the year thats a personal 
residence notes the accounting firm of deloitte amp touche 
the portion of expenses allocable to rental use of the home 
will be deductible only to the extent of rental income the firm 
points out 
it concludes decisions regarding the best tax posture for a 
vacation home should be accompanied by a comprehensive assessment 
of each individuals personal tax circumstances 
in a good many areas of the country vacationhome owners have 
lately had a complaint that they share with other realestate 
investors prices just arent going up the way they did a few years 
ago and making money on a property isnt as easy as it used to 
look 
will those good old days come back maybe suggests john t reed 
in his newsletter real estate investors monthly but then again 
maybe not 
i know of no law of economics which says real estate will 
appreciate for extended periods in the future he says buying 
real estate and waiting for marketwide appreciation is 
speculation 
to invest rather than speculate in real estate reed advocates 
looking diligently for properties selling at bargain prices or 
susceptible to upgrading strategies that can increase their value

the winds of change have forced reform 
on communists throughout europe but veteran leader alvaro cunhal 
is keeping his portugese party firmly to the traditional course 
our party continues to declare itself a marxistleninist 
party he told 2000 delegates to the groups congress last month 
in loures a communist bastion 12 miles from lisbon 
few of our comrades have expressed the opinion that the pcp 
should follow the path that other communist parties have trod 
cunhal said 
delegates raised clenched fists in salute and cheered their 
leader who is 76 and has led the party since 1961 they reelected 
him unanimously despite hints earlier this year that he might 
retire 
cunhals decision to stay on may worry the growing reform 
movement but the congress also chose carlos carvalhas a 
48yearold economist and member of the european parliament for 
the new post of assistant general secretary 
the combination of cunhal and carvalhas who is more pragmatic 
but not a member of the reformist wing may be an attempt to mend 
the rift between dissidents and the old guard 
reformers want the party to adapt its political program to 
reflect the new situation in eastern europe where the soviet bloc 
has collapsed and portugals position as a stable democracy within 
the 12nation european community they also demand greater 
democracy and openness in party operations 
party leaders have dealt firmly with dissenters 
zita seabra a leading campaigner for womens rights was 
expelled from the ranks in january after arguing for cunhals 
resignation a change in the party name and abandonment of 
traditional ideology 
jose luis judas a trade union official and leading critic of 
cunhal was barred from the loures congress other critics have 
been dismissed from the party central committee 
at the congress cunhal accused reformers of forming factions 
that act in a conspiratorial and organized way within the party 
and carrying out a media campaign that places their action in a 
wider anticommunist campaign against the party 
this will not be permitted he declared 
dissidents say only reform can halt a decline that has seen the 
partys share of the national vote drop from 21 percent in 1979 to 
14 percent in december when local elections were held 
some change has resulted from the fall of communist regimes in 
eastern europe cunhal acknowledges his former comrades commited 
serious errors and isolated themselves from their people 
he has paid lip service to the reforms of mikhail s gorbachev 
the soviet president but also said anticommunist forces backed by 
the west could compromise the building of socialism 
cunhals party supported the sovietled invasion of 
czechoslovakia in 1968 and the kremlins intervention in 
afghanistan which lasted nearly a decade it was silent on the 
brutal repression of chinas prodemocracy movement a year ago and 
sent delegates to the romanian communist party congress before 
nicolae ceausescus downfall in december 
despite media reports of poor health cunhal demonstrated in two 
lengthy speeches to the congress that he had lost none of his fiery 
speaking style delegates in the loures hall of peace and 
friendship interrupted frequently with applause and chants of 
pcp pcp 
cunhal spent 12 years in prison under the rightwing 
dictatorship that governed portugal for nearly half a century 
before a coup in 1974 opened the way for democracy 
his 40 years of resistance to the dictatorship years in jail 
and torture by the secret police earned cunhal legendary status 
among followers and the respect of political opponents 
judas said recently that cunhal would continue running the party 
even after retirement 
its a bit like deng xiaoping the senior chinese leader 
judas said even when he leaves the leadership its he who 
commands 
he said the party must change because in the future being a 
communist wont be the same thing as being a communist in 1917 
if the communist parties dont change adapt then theyll 
disappear

a boxy apartmentoffice building on 
concrete stilts surmounts ruins of the 2000yearold roman temple 
of jupiter dramatizing the clash of old and new in this teeming 
ancient city 
a modern marbleclad temple of commerce with jewelry shops and 
clothing boutiques is next door opposite the ancient islamic 
medressah or school of nur eddin 
its a bad integration of the old and the new said nazih 
kawakibi a professor of architecture at damascus university who 
serves on several restoration committees they could have done it 
much better 
like many cities in the middle east damascus is bulging at the 
seams trying to provide housing and services to a population 
estimated at 2 million 
damascus is considered one of the worlds oldest continuously 
inhabited cities the arameans nomads from the arabian peninsula 
settled here in 1200 bc eventually building a city that became 
an important commercial center 
greeks romans byzantines arabs and ottomans have occupied 
damascus a treasure trove of monuments reflect the cultural tides 
that have swept over the city 
some ancient sites like the famed ummayyad mosque were 
venerated by all the occupiers 
the mosque site originally was a temple to haddad the aramean 
god of thunder and lightning 
it later became the roman temple of jupiter the byzantines 
built a cathedral there but the arabs transformed it into the 
mosque named for the islamic dynasty 
only limited resources are available to preserve the the ancient 
sites 
kawakibi pointed to the medressah just on the edge of a 
straight europeanstyle avenue cut through the city by french 
colonizers in the 1930s 
they stopped here they didnt go further thanks be to god 
said the architect who has devoted his life to preserving old 
damascus 
a 14th century tomb of the mamelukes has been rented to a cloth 
merchant who destroyed the original lintel and cut a door through 
an ancient wall to allow access to his shop 
unless we propose a solution to blend those monuments with the 
commercial life of the old city of damascus this is the way it all 
will go kawakibi said 
these buildings shouldnt function as commercial buildings 
but as museums or cultural centers theyre all registered as 
historical monuments but the law hasnt been able to prevent them 
from being transgressed 
in one old mosque the antique wooden minbar or preachers 
stand was ripped out and left in the entrance to be replaced by a 
concrete one 
an architectural gem the 11th century nur eddin hospital is 
sandwiched between a modern shop selling shwarma thinly sliced 
meat wrapped in arabic bread and a jewelry store it was restored 
in the late 1970s 
parasitic buildings accumulated around it but theyre now 
just part of the ambience said kawakibi who was instrumental in 
the renovation 
only one of the original stonelattice windows carved in 
intricate geometric designs had survived master craftsment copied 
it faithfully 
a few painted koranic inscriptions remained on the domed 
ceilings instead of repainting them restorers gently penciled in 
missing portions of the holy books text 
in a display case are ancient herbal medicines including one 
called aphrodisiac radish diuretic activates the functions of 
the genital glands 
the hospital and dozens of other old buildings are tranquil 
havens in a bustling noisy city as are the 11th century baths 
reached through a small door in the midst of the bazaar 
the baths saw hard times even becoming a soap factory at one 
point 
now men swaddled in towels sip at glasses of boilinghot tea 
after a searing bath and massage they read their newspapers 
beneath a dome painted with complicated flowery designs 
renovation is not always popular 
when youre trying to renovate these buildings theres a lot 
of protest because they dont understand what is meant by 
renovation kawakibi said they think you mean destroying the 
old buildings and putting up new ones 
at the masjid almadrassah alumariyah mosque and school 
complex which dates from the time of the first crusade in the 11th 
century dozens of squatters who built concrete huts on the grounds 
are being evicted 
in deciding how to proceed restorers rely on old drawings 
their knowledge of the architectural practices of the time and 
sometimes photographs from the 19th and early 20th centuries 
in the 1960s the government and experts drew up a master plan 
for the city which included providing modern services and 
preserving the old city it has become hopelessly outdated 
even a devoted restorationist like kawakibi acknowledges that 
attention should be paid to modern problems more than old ones 
we need infrastructure telephones transportation

ragtag children marched around a burnedout 
truck stopping now and then to point through locked gates at huge 
portraits of che guevara in a derelict camp where hundreds of cuban 
soldiers once lived 
soldiers gone pedro said shouldering a gnarled stick to 
imitate the cubans united nations observers say 33000 of the 
50000 cuban soldiers in camps like viana have left for home since 
angola and cuba signed usbrokered accords with south africa in 
december 1988 
unfortunately for children like pedro and his friends not only 
the soldiers are leaving 
deprived of their military protectors hundreds of cuban 
doctors nurses and teachers stationed in this southern african 
nation are leaving hospitals health centers and schools already 
crippled by 15 years of civil war 
western sources expect the last cuban civilians to leave angola 
by the end of next year six months after all the soldiers have 
gone 
unicef the united nations childrens fund says the war between 
the marxist government and jonas savimbis ussupported rebels 
has taken the lives of more than 100000 angolans and maimed at 
least 20000 
about 15 million people onesixth of the population have been 
displaced most of the refugees are women children and old people 
savimbis national union for the total independence of angola 
known as unita claims more than 200000 have died since fighting 
began shortly after the 300000 portuguese colonials went home in 
1975 leaving behind virtually no trained medical staff or skilled 
workers 
of the 738 qualified doctors now in angola 509 are foreigners 
including 170 cubans who have worked primarily in poorly equipped 
provincial health stations isidro diez cubas economic counselor 
in luanda the capital said those isolated centers often were 
targets of rebel attack 
diez said more than 500 cuban teachers also were leaving 
as our troops move north the civilian workers go with them 
he said its normal no country would leave their civilians 
unprotected 
the un development program hopes to bring 24 doctors and 
paramedics to angola in the next 18 months mostly from brazil 
where portuguese also is the national language otto essien who 
represents the agency said a maximum of six doctors would arrive 
this year and more than 700 were needed 
the problem is the cubans have gone to regions where others 
dont go said francine matthys luanda coordinator for doctors 
without frontiers a private european group that is helping manage 
health centers and hospitals 
she said the cubans dont do much training they have enough 
to do filling the shoes of missing angolan doctors and that has 
created a sort of dependence 
drugs also are short in the provinces medicines distributed by 
the inefficient centrally planned system often are lost stolen or 
destroyed in rebel ambushes 
another problem is a 4yearold drought which the united 
nations says affects 800000 people in four province of central and 
southern angola secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar has 
appealed for emergency food medicine and funds 
bie a wartorn province in the central highlands has only one 
doctor for each 49714 inhabitants and neighboring huambo has one 
midwife for every 123527 people according to health ministry 
figures 
luanda has grown from 350000 people at the start of the war to 
more than 15 million many of whom live in shantytowns and has 
only one civilian hospital the other americo boavida is the 
countys largest but is undergoing a twoyear renovation 
morale among overworked angolan medical personnel is low 
leading doctors earn the equivalent of 860 a month at the 
official exchange rate but that equals only 14 on the black 
market during a cholera outbreak last year doctors treated up to 
100 cases a day in luanda alone 
at the kwzola orphanage home to 163 of angolas estimated 
40000 war orphans 9yearold raul was playing with a toy truck in 
a greenandwhite fleet made from oil cans by dani the homes 
12yearold resident engineer 
raul who chattered happily with visitors wants to become a 
pilot and fly to namibia dani kept to himself staring silently at 
the mig jet fighters landing at nearby luanda airport 
conceicao almeida dias assistant director of the orphanage 
said dani was brought in by soldiers last year from uige a 
northern province where the rebels are strong 
his parents were killed in the war but we havent been able 
to get anything else out of him she said 
francisca 3 fled in tears when strangers approached 
she had some sort of trauma and is already psychologically 
disturbed said paula francisca a teacher at the home which was 
built with italian aid 
stephen johnson emergency projects officer for unicef said 
only 3500 or so orphans were in such homes the rest are out in 
the community but we dont know exactly where and theres no 
proper followup care he said

here are some facts and figures on angola 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the land angola covers 481350 square miles stretching about 
800 miles from zaire in the north to the desert frontier of 
namibia the atlantic ocean is on the west and zambia on the eastern of 
the soviets fitzwater said 
the white house press secretary disputed news accounts 
suggesting bush would offer assurances on limiting german forces to 
bolster gorbachevs standing at home 
on prospects for a trade agreement during the summit fitzwater 
said i intentionally want to be vague he added i urge you 
not to rule out anything 
this is an issue that really will depend on gorbachev and 
bush he said the bush administration has held up the trade 
agreement to protest the soviet unions economic sanctions against 
lithuania and soviet failure to enact liberal emigration 
legislation 
in a move to resolve disputed arms control issues col gen 
labronislav omelichev first deputy on the soviet defense 
ministrys general staff headed for washington to enter talks on 
possible nuclear and conventional fores agreements for bush and 
gorbachev to announce 
on the question of german troop levels the united states still 
maintains such discussions should be held as part of future talks 
on reducing conventional forces in all of europe fitzwater said 
we are opposed to any proposal which would single out germany 
for special limits he said 
however fitzwater said the summit would include discussions 
on the general question we want to hear their concerns and their 
interests well express our policy 
this is not an issue which is linked in any way to german 
unity nor to the renunciation of fourpower rights fitzwater 
said referring to control of germanys destiny by world war ii 
victors britain france the united states and the soviet union 
president bush will be exploring the subject with president 
gorbachev from the standpoint of exploring mutually acceptable 
options and positions again these issues are not going to be 
decided here he said 
however an administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said bush hopes to nudge gorbachev into accelerating the 
first round of conventional arms talks under way in vienna 
austria so a treaty can be completed by years end 
bush was described as firmly opposed to a soviet proposal that a 
united germany be excluded from natos military structure while 
remaining within its political framework 
gorbachev was upbeat about the german issue as he spoke to 
reporters tuesday outside mulroneys residence in ottawa gorbachev 
said he was confident that he and bush will find a way to preserve 
the balance of power in europe after east and west germany are 
unified 
asked if he was optimistic about agreement on germany and its 
membership in nato the soviet leader replied i am sure of that 
and tell that to the american people 
us officials disclosed that gorbachev would meet with south 
korean president roh taewoo in san francisco after the washington 
summit ends with a bushgorbachev news conference on sunday the 
soviet leaders plan to meet roh was viewed as a further warming in 
relations between the two countries which recently established 
consular departments in trade offices in each others capitals 
before flying to washington gorbachev acknowledged the 
emergence of a new domestic worry the election of political 
maverick boris n yeltsin as president of the russian republic as 
a major earthquake struck eastern europe 
gorbachev told reporters that everything is ok in the soviet 
union despite the quake that struck romania this morning killing 
eight people injuring 260 and causing widespread damage tremors 
were felt in moscow and leningrad and a soviet lawmaker said 
initial reports from the republic of moldavia indicated there were 
an unspecified number of deaths 
the soviet leader said he saw no reason to break off his trip 
and return home a major earthquake in soviet armenia in december 
1988 forced gorbachev to cut short a visit to the united nations in 
new york where he also met with president reagan 
in advance of the soviet leaders early evening arrival it was 
announced that vice president dan quayle will meet gorbachev 
briefly on friday at the soviet embassy to discuss cooperation on 
space exploration 
arms control negotiators for the two countries meanwhile 
wrangled for more than two hours tuesday over us and soviet 
conventional forces in europe as well as their nuclear arsenals 
including bombers and submarines 
meeting in secrecy at the state department they made some 
progress toward reductions in both areas they agreed for example 
on definitions for such conventional weapons as tanks and armored 
personnel carriers which will make it easier to verify that treaty 
terms are carried out an official told the associated press on 
condition of anonymity 
although secretary of state james a baker iiis recent trip to 
moscow led to agreement on sea and airlaunched missiles a handful 
of tough strategic weapons issues remained unsettled 
arms control issues still in dispute include whether to ban 
ballistic missiles with multiple warheads and the number of flight 
tests the soviets could conduct of their heavy ss18 missiles the 
arsenal of such missiles is to be halved from 308 to 154 but 
there is no agreement restricting improvement in the missiles that 
remain 
bush and gorbachev still are expected to issue a joint 
declaration of progress toward a major reduction in nuclear 
arsenals officials said but they cautioned that longrange 
nuclear weapon issues still disputed may be excluded from that 
declaration 
on the economic front state department spokeswoman margaret d 
tutwiler said tuesday that a new commercial air travel agreement 
has been initialed officials said it will be ready for signing at 
the summit 
it would more than triple air service between the two countries 
and would vastly increase soviet visits to the united states 
tutwiler said 
in addition officials said the two presidents will sign a new 
fiveyear grain agreement virtually settled in march a pact that 
would make it easier for us and soviet commercial vessels to 
deliver goods in each others countries also was ready for signing

milwaukees roman catholic archbishop rembert 
g weakland says the latest draft of the proposed us bishops 
pastoral letter on women is so unsatisfactory that it might as well 
be abandoned 
in a column in the archdiocesan weekly catholic herald he said 
the very credibility of the document comes into question in 
treating the issue of womens ordination 
he said that the document emphasizes womens equality but fails 
to deal with the traditional link between church authority and 
ordination a role the document rejects for women as does the pope 
it is easy to see the bind the authors are in weakland 
wrote however since the letter avoids a basic question involved 
he suggested dropping the effort

pollster george gallup jr says 
that years of research by his polling organization have found gaps 
between what americans say they believe and how they live 
we want the fruits of religion but not the obligations he 
told the evangelical press associations annual convention 
gallup said most americans say they believe in god and jesus and 
trust the bible but he said statistics show americans are ignorant 
of the doctrines and history of their chosen faiths and half of 
the nations christians do not know who delivered the sermon on the 
mount 
we revere the bible but dont read it he said we 
believe the ten commandments to be valid rules for living although 
we cant name them we believe in god but this god is often a 
totally affirming one not a demanding one he does not command our 
total allegiance

religion may play a vital role in saving the 
soviet union from collapse but greater personal freedom under 
perestroika means potential difficulties for some groups us 
religious leaders say 
president mikhail gorbachevs policy of greater openness has 
created opportunities for spiritual development in the soviet union 
that were unimaginable just five years ago said the rev v bruce 
rigdon of grosse pointe mich 
but the challenges facing soviet church leaders are immense 
because they lack the resources to deal with a myriad of problems 
said rigdon chairman of the national council of churches 
ussoviet working group 
for more than 70 years the communists used systematic 
oppression to stifle religion and that resulted in a flat and 
boring culture in which alcoholism became prevalent rigdon said 
in a telephone interview 
they religious leaders are up against the greatest challenge 
since those faced in 10thcentury russia when christianity first 
appeared in that country they now have to christianize the 
population all over again 
a strong religious tradition will greatly facilitate the 
revival but attending to the spiritual needs of the populations is 
only part of the problem for churches 
if gorbachev introduces economic reforms that cause high 
inflation and unemployment the role of the churches and welfare 
organizations will become crucial rigdon said 
rigdon pastor of grosse pointes memorial presbyterian church 
added the church may find itself overwhelmed because it doesnt 
have the infrastructure ability or experience 
the orthodox church in leningrad already has received government 
permission to open a hospital but finding trained personnel so far 
has been a problem he said 
foreign help will be required to help churches through the 
initial crisis us church leaders agreed 
rigdon said the best thing that people in the united states can 
do is listen 
its sort of an american curse to think that we know whats 
best and we shouldnt make that mistake again he said rather 
than what we think should happen we should respect how churches 
already there feel 
bishop herbert w chilstrom of chicago head of the evangelical 
lutheran church in america said a way to better understand soviet 
needs is through exchange programs 
if we had more grassroots contacts it would improve the 
situation said chilstrom who has visited the soviet union three 
times in the past three years 
they dont really want handouts but they do want help in 
setting up a freeenterprise system and establishing a democratic 
system chilstrom said 
fostering democracy and free speech has a down side for some 
soviet religious groups particularly jews said rabbi arthur 
schneier of new york city president of the interfaith appeal of 
conscious foundation which works to promote religious freedom 
there are some dark feelings that are emerging as a result of 
the newfound freedoms in the soviet union schneier said there 
are nationalist forces who in a demagogic fashion are trying to 
scapegoat jews for all the shortages in the soviet union 
it will take a collective effort from the intelligentsia 
government and church to make sure the situation doesnt get out of 
hand

under a new air travel agreement slated to be 
signed at the bushgorbachev summit americans would be able to 
sample glasnost and local delights in some of the more exotic 
soviet cities 
americans longing to see the ancient golden gate in kiev or 
diamond mines in magadan siberia would finally get their wish 
they also would be able to fly to minsk tbilisi khabarovsk 
another siberian city and riga the capital of latvia 
new flights to those places from the united states are sure to 
be filled alexey mesiatsev a spokesman for intourist the soviet 
tourism organization said tuesday 
demand is very big right now the soviet union is one of the 
hottest tourist destinations mesiatsev said from his office in 
new york 
he said some 150000 americans visited the soviet union last 
year up from 125000 in 1988 110000 in 1987 and 25000 in 1980 
when relations between the two countries hit a low point 
nearly all arrived by air commercial flights between the two 
countries now serve new york washington moscow and leningrad 
so far at least ussoviet travel has been mostly a oneway 
street only 460 soviet citizens visited the united states last 
year most of them officials on tours organized around glasnost 
themes 
under the new agreement concluded on sunday air travel between 
the two superpowers will be greatly expanded possibly quadrupled 
and the two countries also will inaugurate regular cargo flights 
the air agreement represents closer ties as soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev tries to get a grip on his troubled economy 
he will meet with president bush beginning thursday 
the air travel accord will add four us cities anchorage 
alaska chicago san francisco and miami and the six new soviet 
cities to current airline routes 
six additional us airlines will be allowed to fly between the 
two countries and a planned new soviet airline will be able to 
participate in ussoviet service 
currently only pan american world airways and the soviet 
national airline aeroflot fly ussoviet routes aeroflot launched 
its first major marketing campaign in the united states last spring 
a number of us carriers have expressed interest including 
delta air lines united airlines alaska airlines and northwest 
airlines 
a pan am spokesman was skeptical about a new wave of us 
tourists hitting the soviet union and whether there would be enough 
passengers to fill new flights to that country 
we do believe that the market is still rather thin and the 
additional airline capacity is not warranted by the demand 
said jeff kriendler 
delta spokesman neil monroe said his airline plans to apply to 
the transportation department for permission to fly between deltas 
base of atlanta and moscow and possibly leningrad and tbilisi the 
latter the capital of the soviet republic of georgia is the 
sister city of another georgia town atlanta 
were very interested in the soviet union monroe said 
united has expressed interest in operating a chicagomoscow 
route said spokesman rob doughty 
under the new ussoviet accord the two sides also agreed to 
allow at least 100 annual charter flights over the north atlantic 
route and to consider as many as 100 charters across the pacific 
american tourists venturing beyond moscow and leningrad will 
find wo historical museums in minsk the capital of the 
byelorussian republic mesiatsev said kiev capital of the 
ukraine offers monuments parks and museums and the remains of 
the golden gate part of the old citys fortifications built in the 
11th century 
the intourist official said kievs cuisine which includes 
borscht and galushky dumplings is not to be missed he 
described tbilisi as an industrial and cultural city full of old 
churches 
for the truly adventurous there are the two siberian cities 
khabarovsk in the southeast is the final point on the 
transsiberian railroad with mongolia and china beyond magadan 
like khabarovsk an industrial city has diamond mines 
riga the latvian capital on the baltic has a distinctive 
culture and architecture mesiatsev noted like its fellow baltic 
republics of lithuania and estonia latvia has recently been 
buffeted by nationalist stirrings 
pan am charges 1725 for a normal roundtrip coach fare between 
washington and moscow 
the average intourist package costs around 3500 for a 12 to 
14day trip

a group seeking to replace the air line pilots 
association as the representative of eastern air lines pilots in 
collective bargaining is pressing for an election to decide the 
issue 
the eastern pilots association filed an application tuesday with 
the national mediation board in washington and said it was seeking 
immediate action on its request 
our organization better represents the real interests of the 
men and women who are flying easterns planes every day thomas 
cooper chairman of the epa steering committee said in a statement 
the fairest way for the pilots of eastern to determine the 
destiny of their own careers and the future of eastern is to have 
an election he said 
miamibased eastern officially recognizes alpa as the pilots 
bargaining agent the groups membership includes an estimated 
1200 to 1400 eastern pilots who not now working 
but cooper said apla has lost touch with easterns working 
pilots epa claims to represent 93 percent of the airlines 1775 
flying pilots 
last year alpa called a sympathy strike against eastern 
management to back striking members of the machinists union some 
eastern pilots continued to fly and the airline hired replacements 
for striking pilots 
in a statement alpa spokesman lou baldwin said under the 
railway labor act alpa is the legal bargaining agent for all 
eastern pilots and the actions taken today by the epa do not in 
any way affect that representation 
the airline had no comment an eastern spokesman said

after years of delay japanese electronics 
companies received government approval today to sell digital audio 
tape decks that can make virtually perfect copies of compact discs 
the new decks ability to make direct digital recordings of cds 
is expected to boost sales for the longdormant and muchdebated 
recording medium 
the approval from the ministry of international trade and 
industry was timed to allow manufacturers to introduce the machines 
at the chicago consumer electronics show which opens saturday the 
officials said 
company officials said they were unsure until todays decision 
whether they would be able to announce prices and marketing plans 
for their dat recorders at the show 
opposition to the technology continues in the united states 
among song writers and record manufacturers concerned about 
copyright protection however a bill pending in congress that 
would limit the number of copies that dat recorders can make would 
ease those concerns 
unlike analog tape recordings digital recordings deteriorate 
very little from generation to generation record manufacturers 
therefore had feared dat machines would result in a virtually 
endless stream of highquality copies of cds that would cut into 
their sales 
matsushita electric industrial co spokesman akira nagano said 
his company which makes panasonic equipment might begin marketing 
in the united states before the legislation is approved if 
congressional action is delayed since current laws do not prohibit 
dats 
dat decks have been sold in japan and some parts of europe since 
1987 but in a concession to record companies the equipment 
currently on the market cannot make direct digital recordings of 
cds 
instead they convert the highquality digital signals on cds to 
analog signals and then reconvert them to digital form before 
recording them resulting in a slight loss in sound quality 
that combined with the high price of blank dat tapes which 
cost almost as much as cds has held dat sales far below initial 
expectations 
the biggest discord remaining in dats future may be its 
stillhigh prices dat decks are expected to begin selling in the 
united states for about 1200

genentech inc hopes to win 
government approval for human tests of a genetically engineered 
drug intended to clear the lungs of the deadly mucus produced by 
cystic fibrosis 
about 30000 american children have cystic fibrosis a 
hereditary disease in which the lungs secrete large amounts of 
thick mucus that impairs breathing and makes patients vulnerable to 
infection most victims die by age 30 
the genentech drug dnase is a massproduced version of a 
natural human enzyme lab tests indicated that dnase which will be 
given in aerosol form loosens lung secretions said dr steven 
shak leader of the research team 
genentech also hopes dnase will let antibiotics reach and 
destroy infectioncausing bacteria and fight less serious but more 
common lung diseases like chronic bronchitis shak said 
shak said tuesday that genentech has asked the food and drug 
administration to approve human testing of the drug approval could 
come this year animal testing is not possible because no animal 
has a disease like cystic fibrosis 
several years of testing may be required before the drug can go 
into general use the first stage of human testing will determine 
its safety and give a preliminary indication of whether it works

us treasury secretary nicholas brady said 
wednesday that excess concern about inflation could hurt chances 
for continued economic growth 
but britains finance chief john major said inflation remained 
the main risk to continued growth and prosperity in our 
economies 
the officials commented at the annual meeting of the 
organization for economic cooperation and development which brings 
together two dozen industrialized nations 
the twoday meeting was expected to be dominated by efforts to 
break a deadlock in the uruguay round trade talks a fouryear 
drive to revamp the world trading system 
however brady major and other finance chiefs offered a rundown 
on the outlook for their economies at the meetings opening session 
brady predicted the american economy would expand at a moderate 
pace this year but pick up in 1991 he said that the price picture 
will require continued vigilance 
but he cautioned at the same time we need to maintain a 
balanced view of the inflation risk and not allow excess concern to 
undermine the prospects for continued economic expansion 
inflation has become a worry in the industrialized world where 
some fear it could bring to an end eight consecutive years of 
economic expansion 
in particular some fear that priceconscious west germany could 
become the victim of higher inflation once it merges with east 
germany a surge in consumer demand in east germay could put upward 
pressure on prices some economists say 
but west german economics minister helmut haussmann insisted his 
countrys influential central bank the bundesbank would be solely 
in charge of deciding monetary policy he said the government 
intended to keep the annual inflation rate at about 3 percent 
major britains chancellor of the exchequer acknowledged that 
rising prices remain a persistent problem for the british economy 
the fact remains that inflation is too high and accordingly 
bringing it down must be and is the absolute priority of 
policy he told his colleagues at oecd headquarters in the 
western part of paris 
he said the british government maintained a tight grip on 
monetary policy and warned that interest rates could climb higher 
the oecd as part of the annual meeting estimated economic 
growth in its 24 member nations at a seasonally adjusted 29 
percent this year and next it was 36 percent last year

us trade representative carla hills today made a 
fresh pitch for progress in stalled trade talks but european 
officials resisted her call for immediate bargaining 
the americans made a serious mistake by trying to negotiate 
here said frans andriessen the top trade official for the 
12nation european community 
mrs hills wanted trade officials attending the annual meeting 
of the organization for economic cooperation and development to 
give a push to the stalled uruguay round trade talks a fouryear 
effort to revamp the world trading system 
but andriessen said this is not the negotiating place 
other countries not attending the oecd meeting have an interest 
in the discussions he said 
mrs hills reminded her colleagues in a speech to the opening 
session of the oecd meeting that time was running short on reaching 
agreement on new trading rules the negotiations began in uruguay 
in 1986 and are due to conclude in brussels in december 
but a stubborn dispute between the united states and the 
european community over government payments to farmers has stalled 
the talks 
agriculture is the linchpin of negotiations mrs hills said 
in her speech 
shortly before todays meeting began west german economics 
minister helmut haussmann said the united states must ease its 
demand that european officials scrap their costly subsidy programs 
for farmers 
the bush administration wants the european community to bring an 
end to import barriers and export and domestic farm subsidies that 
distort trade the community has said it is cutting back on farm 
payments but cannot eliminate them completely 
the dispute has raised concern that the international trade 
talks could end in failure 
its very important that the united states and the european 
community find a sort of mechanism that insures an overall 
reduction of support prices haussmann told a breakfast meeting 
of the angloamerican press association in paris that means the 
united states will have to depart somehwat from its position 
he said the community will certainly agree to a substantial 
reduction of support measures 
the negotiations involve some 100 nations and are attempting to 
reduce barriers to trade in 15 areas they include agriculture 
textiles and other manufactured goods and services such as banking 
and investment 
negotiators want to bring commerce in some of these areas under 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade for the first time 
gatt a forum and an agreement for promoting freer trade works to 
curb unfair trading practices and lower trade barriers 
the community provides assistance to its farmers through 
guaranteed prices for many of their crops it also gives exporters 
help so more expensive european farm products can compete with 
lower prices on the world market 
community officials argue that they have cut subsidies but say 
they cannot get rid of their farm program entirely because many 
small farmers depend on it for their livelihood 
american officials also have run into trouble trying to get 
third world countries to back their ideas for tough rules to 
prevent patent and copyright piracy 
poorer countries also are unhappy with a us proposal to expand 
gatts marketopening rules to cover trade in services such as 
banking investment and insurance american companies do well in 
those fields and poor countries fear their infant industries would 
be hurt 
for their part third world countries want to tear down barriers 
to trade in textile products the united states under pressure 
from american textile groups is pushing for a less comprehensive 
reduction of existing tariffs and quotas trade in textiles isnt 
covered by gatt rules but instead is regulated by the multifiber 
agreement an accord of some 80 nations 
mrs hills and other officials want to advance the trade talks 
so a preliminary agreement can be reached in some areas at a july 
23 session in geneva 
oecd members are australia austria belgium britain canada 
denmark finland france greece iceland ireland italy japan

the governments main economic forecasting 
gauge slipped 02 percent in april its second loss in four months 
and another indication of the nations sluggish economy the 
commerce department said today 
the index of leading economic indicators designed to forecast 
economic activity six to nine months in advance had risen 10 
percent in march to regain februarys 10 percent loss the index 
was unchanged in january 
a slight increase in the average workweek caused the department 
to revise the march figure up from 09 percent 
analysts had said in advance of the report that the economy had 
started the second quarter at the same weak pace that it ran in the 
first quarter and would improve only slightly in the second half of 
the year 
the economy grew at a 13 percent annual rate in the first 
quarter and many economists expect it to advance only 20 percent 
for the entire year down from 30 percent last year and 44 
percent in 1988 
in a second report today illustrating the economic sluggishness 
the department said new home sales fell 16 percent in april their 
fifth consecutive monthly decline to their lowest level since the 
recession year of 1982 
the national association of realtors which monitors existing 
home sales said last friday that resales of singlefamily homes 
slipped 21 percent in april their third drop in four months 
although sales were unchanged in march 
bush administration and congressional budget negotiators had 
their eyes on the reports since continued growth would be required 
for any reduction in the federal deficit 
a recession would mean a loss of jobs and lower personal 
incomes diminished corporate profits and thus a drop in tax 
revenues at the same time the government would be called on to 
spend more on benefits 
analysts had expected a slight dip in todays leading indicators 
report in part because of a continuing decline in the number of 
building permits in april permits have fallen each month since 
january when builders sought to take advantage of record warm 
weather and to beat a deadline for meeting expensive new building 
standards 
many analysts foresee no immediate improvement in the 
construction industry in view of high interest rates and tighter 
restrictions on credit 
in addition to building permits five more of the 11 
forwardlooking statistics were negative 
they included a drop in new plant and equipment orders a 
decline in the average workweek a decrease in orders for consumer 
goods a drop in manufacturers unfilled orders and an increase in 
weekly unemployment claims four of the components were positive 
an increase in the price of raw materials an index measuring 
consumer confidence slower business delivery times and an increase 
in the money supply 
stock prices were unchanged 
the various changes left the index at 1449 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 and down 06 percent from its level a year ago 
economists bruce steinberg and laurie allen contended in advance 
of todays report that the latest batch of indicators provided 
further evidence of a lackluster economy 
writing in merrill lynch capital markets weekly economic amp 
financial commentary they pointed to reports last week showing 
continued sluggishness in the automobile industry and flat orders 
since the first of the year for durable goods usually expensive 
products expected to last at least three years 
steinberg and allen also pointed out that the firstquarter 
gross national product the broadest measure of the nations 
economic health was sharply revised downward from 21 percent 
originally estimated to just 13 percent in last weeks report 
like other indicators released during the past month the 
latest set of data probably understate economic momentum they 
added but they amply illustrate that the economy is going 
nowhere fast 
while the gnp grew at its slowest pace since 1986 from january 
through march it contained what robert g dederick chief 
economist with the northern trust co in chicago described as 
the seeds of a pickup 
the downward revision was attributed almost solely to a 
reduction in inventories dederick explained which could provide 
for expanded secondquarter growth as businesses begin to refill 
their shelves and backlots 
allen sinai chief economist with the boston co said 
secondquarter economic information so far depicts a soft 
economy 
but if sales and demand stay up the economy will continue to 
expand closer to 2 percent 
three recent surveys show other analysts also expect the economy 
to grow 2 percent this year down from 3 percent last year and 44 
percent in 1988 they were conducted by the business council the 
national association of business economists and blue chip economic 
indicators of sedona ariz

four years after it was completed and 14 
years after construction began the seabrook plant has supplied 
nucleargenerated electricity to new england customers for the 
first time 
the plant was operating at 15 percent capacity and producing 
enough electricity to supply 65000 homes when it was hooked into 
the new england power grid tuesday night officials said 
the milestone occurred during tests to ready the 65 billion 
plant for full commercial operation by midsummer at full power 
seabrook will generate 1150 megawatts enough for 1 million homes 
spokesman rob williams said today power had been increased to 
about 20 percent producing about 120 megawatts 
after increasing to about 215 megawatts and producing power into 
midafternoon williams said the plant would be disconnected from 
the new england power grid so equipment could be tested then it 
will be reconnected to the grid and the reactor brought to about 30 
percent capacity 
seabrook has become a symbol of the nuclear industrys troubles 
and a target of antinuclear activists construction began in 1976 
and took 10 years even the the plant was unable to get an 
operating license until march 
because of delays costs soared from less than 1 billion and 
forced the plants lead owner public service company of new 
hampshire into bankruptcy court in 1988 
oponents contend the plant is unsafe and the evacuation plan for 
the surrounding area inadequate 
the plant produced electricity during tests in 1985 but that 
was nonnuclear power generated by using the systems heater and 
pumps

ford motor co will offer big incentives later 
this year to make room for 1991 models an automotive journal says 
this weeks editions of automotive news said ford has told 
dealers it plans to offer incentives up to 1500 on selected 1990 
cars once the 1991 models get into showrooms in force 
ford already has begun selling some 1991 cars and trucks 
including the ford escort subcompact and the ford explorer 
sportutility vehicle yearend sales arent unusual in the auto 
industry but such early word of how they may be conducted is 
early word of the incentive plan may torpedo some sales now 
since consumers may wait for bigger incentives later 
ford spokesman bill carroll was in a today and unavailable for 
immediate comment 
earlier this month fords financial vice president david 
mccammon said the automaker spent about 1000 per vehicle or 
about 4 billion overall on incentives last year he said the 
company was trimming that cost this year 
he also said new car and truck inventories were in good shape at 
between 60 to 65 selling days ford general motors corp and 
chrysler corp have scheduled production increases in the third 
quarter 
some industry observers have said the manufacturing boost is a 
hedge against a possible united auto workers strike uaw contracts 
with each of the big three automakers expire sept 14 if there is 
no strike inventories of late 1990 and early 1991 cars and trucks 
could swell

the nations toughest newspaper recycling 
law has been approved in suffolk county on long island where all 
major papers will be required to use 40 percent recycled newsprint 
in their editions by the end of 1996 
the measure which was approved tuesday by a 12 to 6 vote in the 
county legislature was criticized by a group representing 64 daily 
papers in the state the supporters of the bill would be able to 
override a veto by county executive patrick halpin 
any use of recycled paper should be market driven said john 
kutzer executive director of the new york newspaper publishers 
association we feel local government is perhaps going overboard 
with these requirements 
the law would apply to all daily and weekly newspapers printed 
sold or distributed in suffolk county provided their suffolk 
circulation is 20000 or more a week advertising circulars are 
included if they meet the same circulation requirement 
the bill would require that newspapers be printed on stock 
containing at least 40 percent recycled paper by dec 31 1996 
compliance would be phased in in yearly steps 
papers which did not comply would face a 500 fine each day 
legislator maxine postal damityville sponsored the bill 
saying the measure would ease the pressure on long island landfills 
and incinerators 
if the country does not move to resolve this problem our most 
famous product next to the f14 is going to be garbage said ms 
postal 
publishers complained there is just a single plant in the 
northeast which supplies recycled paper and the next one is not 
due to open until 1993 
but postal said paper manufacturers would retool to provide 
adequate supplies of recycled paper once publishers were willing to 
commit to longterm contracts 
the publisher of newsday the largest circulation daily on long 
island was opposed to the suffolk plan and plans to challenge the 
law in court said spokesman sam ruinsky newsday presently uses 17 
percent recycled paper for printing 
william k adler manager of corporate relations for the new 
york times cited a voluntary agreement approved by the publishers 
association in which they agreed to gradually increase the use of 
recycled paper that plan set a goal of 40 percent by the year 2000 
since the state has initiated a coordinated program attempts 
by individual counties to legislate their own timetables for 
recycled newsprint are counterproductive said adler 
the times is currently using 8 percent recycled fiber he said

charles pistor who serves on the boards of some 
of americas largest corporations has resigned as chairman of a 
small dallas bank a post he had taken after leaving the huge first 
republicbank corp shortly before it failed 
pistor a former vice chairman of first republicbank corp and 
past president of the american bankers association said tuesday 
that he decided to leave northpark national bank because of the 
banks past financial difficulties and texas slumping economy have 
prevented the expansion planned when he took the helm in april 1988 
the reasons i was hired were obvious to enhance the franchise 
in the sense of making a much bigger organization with acquisitions 
and to increase private banking those opportunities are still 
in front of the bank but i dont expect them to happen right 
away pistor said 
northpark is a retail and commercial bank owned by dallas 
developer raymond nasher although serving mainly upscale north 
dallas neighborhoods northpark has had its share of problem loans 
the 700 million bank posted an 82 million loss in 1988 and a 
61 million loss in 1989 but the bank which received a 10 
million injection of capital from nasher last year was profitable 
in the first quarter of 1990 
pistor also serves on the boards of southern methodist 
university the meadows foundation and dallasbased centex corp 
and oryx energy co fort worthbased amr corp and new yorkbased 
american brands 
pistor left first republicbank just months before its banks were 
seized by regulators in july 1988 and sold to ncnb texas national 
bank

some economic analysts view events by the month 
others by the year and a very few by the decade which is probably 
the least publicized but most revealing study of all 
a decade review puts into perspective all those little blips on 
the trend line that cause excitement for a day or so or at most a 
week what is revealed may be the true underlying direction of 
change 
following those longer trend lines f thomas juster research 
scientist at the university of michigans survey research center 
traces lifestyle patterns during the 1980s and follows them through 
some unusual twists and turns 
example real hourly earnings during the 1980s fell from growth 
rates of around 3 percent a year in the 1950s and 1960s to less 
than 1 percent in the 1970s and 1980s 
that decline however cant be demonstrated by certain other 
sets of data why not because says juster while earnings per 
hour of work have almost stagnated for close to 20 years total 
earnings have grown substantially 
what seems to be a contradiction however is readily explained 
what occurred says juster in a paper is that total earnings 
have grown substantially because total hours of work have grown 
especially for women 
but doesnt that seem to be at odds with a popular belief that 
americans have become more leisure oriented not so says juster 
who explains while total work hours in the market have grown 
work hours in total have declined 
just a minute you say that doesnt make sense but it does 
after juster explains that while people might have spent more time 
on the job that is working for money they spent less time 
working at home 
well the women did anyway it was a slightly different story 
for men 
juster found that for most people especially those between ages 
25 and 44 the amount of time spent working for pay in the market 
and that spent at unpaid household work moved in different 
directions for men and women 
women spent less time at home and more in the marketplace men 
spent less time in the market and more time at home 
if thats so was the muchtouted leisure generation a myth no 
it wasnt 
leisure time for both men and women has increased during the 
1980s compared to earlier decades and has in fact shown a steady 
increase since the 1960s says juster 
and where did this leisure time come from if women went to work 
in the marketplace and men had to do more chores at home 
the answer apparently is that while the time spent on 
household chores by women especially young women diminished 
sharply the added time men spent on household tasks rose only 
modestly 
the added leisure time that is came right out of the home and 
that leaves some puzzling questions 
are men more efficient than women at household chores did 
household chores not get done was the need for less attention to 
household chores a result of more efficient houses and equipment to 
run them 
the answers werent in justers research paper

contracts for new construction declined 6 
percent in april reaching a fouryear low and resuming a slide 
that began late last year the fw dodge division of mcgrawhill 
inc reported wednesday 
the decline was blamed on a credit crunch affecting commercial 
and residential builders 
events of the past six months have changed the character of 
the construction sector from stable to vulnerable said george a 
christie chief economist at fw dodge 
he said tight credit for builders had become a bigger problem 
than mortgage rates which he described as workable 
the current rate of contracting which is only about 85 
percent of what it was last fall seems to bear out the concern 
that weve been getting an overreaction by bankers to the 
regulatory clampdown on highrisk real estate lending practices 
christie said 
that clampdown was precipitated by the crisis in the savings and 
loan industry 
the dodge index which uses 1982 as its base of 100 dropped to 
146 in april from 156 in march the last time the index was lower 
than 146 was in january 1986 when it reached 145 with the 
exception of a 3 percent increase in march the index has been 
declining since it peaked at 181 in september 
the yearly pace of total contracting was 2302 million last 
month down from marchs 2455 million 
nonresidential building set the pace with a 12 percent drop in 
april homebuilding construction dropped 4 percent in april while

aetna life and casualty co which 
earlier this month announced it would pull out of pennsylvanias 
carinsurance market has suspended its departure pending the 
outcome of a rate case before the state insurance department 
under an agreement with the casey administration which was 
announced tuesday the company also said it will rescind notices 
sent to customers notifying them their policies would not be 
renewed 
as its part of the agreement the state agreed to rule within 
two weeks on aetnas request to sidestep rate rollbacks in the 
states new car insurance law which takes effect july 1 and 
requires premium cuts of at least 10 percent for all drivers 
if approved the companys proposal would result in rate 
increases for the majority of its 200000 policyholders aetna 
spokesman john c hawkins said the company would not rule out any 
options including withdrawal from the state if the department 
rejects its request 
aetna the states fifth largest car insurer announced may 9 
its intent to leave the state claiming the new law would preclude 
its ability to make a profit the law calls for rate cuts of 10 
percent for all drivers and at least 22 percent for drivers who 
give up their right to sue in most cases 
gov robert p casey and hawkins said the agreement signaled a 
lessening of hostilities between the company and the state aetna 
had filed suit against the law the state later named aetna in a 
suit the agreement will not affect the pending litigation 
casey said the agreement was another step toward getting the new 
law in place by july 1 he said 155 of the states 223 car 
insurance companies or about twothirds had filed rates in 
compliance with the law although 41 of those are seeking 
exemptions from mandatory rate rollbacks 
its good news its real progress casey said referring to 
the agreement with aetna 
some of the states largest insurers allstate state farm and 
erie have yet to file reduced rates under the law 
last week the state granted exemptions to keystone insurance 
co and colonial penn insurance co for keystone customers that 
retain their full right to sue rates will be boosted by 3 percent 
other customers would see cuts of about 11 percent colonial penns 
rates would be cut by an average of 54 percent for those who 
retain the right to sue and cut 18 percent for others 
casey said those rulings recognized that the new law would have 
taken too large a chunk out of the companies profit margin he 
said that in the vast majority of cases drivers in 
pennsylvania could expect the full 10 percent or 22 percent cuts

allow many farmers to finish remaining corn planting 
the corn market rallied last week on a dismal weather

the state department opposes an american 
telephone amp telegraph co plan to use the soviet intersputnik 
satellite system to increase longdistance calls between the united 
states and the soviet union 
the department in a letter to federal communications commission 
chairman alfred sikes said there was insufficient reason to 
deviate from existing us policy that requires most satellite 
telephone traffic between the two countries to be carried by the 
119nation intelsat satellite cooperative 
in december atampt asked the fcc for permission to use an 
intersputnik satellite located above the west coast of africa to 
try to keep pace with a large increase in ussoviet phone traffic 
atampt said in a letter to president bush that calling between the 
two countries increased by more than 140 percent in the past two 
years as eastwest relations improved 
the company said demand still far exceeded capacity and it 
sought fcc permission to nearly triple telecommunications capacity 
between the two nations 
but deputy secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger said there 
were insufficient foreign policy reasons to give atampt permission to 
shift some future traffic away from intelsat 
eagleburger however in his may 14 letter to the fcc said the 
state department would support use of intersputnik for services not 
interconnected with the public switched phone network such as 
data transmission 
an fcc decision is pending 
intelsat spokesman tony trujillo said thursday it wasnt true 
that intelsat didnt have the capacity to meet the demand for 
ussoviet calling 
however charles miller atampt vice president for federal 
government affairs said the issue wasnt intelsats capacity but 
the soviet unions problem of buying additional space on intelsat 
because the ruble isnt traded officially in international money 
markets 
the principal concern was the hard currency problem he 
said 
miller said the united states has 56 circuits to the soviet 
union about the same as for iceland a country with about 01 
percent of the soviet population 
atampt which handles more than 80 percent of all us 
international telephone calling has the only western phone 
facilities to the soviet union the traffic is carried on undersea 
cable land lines and by intelsat other longdistance companies 
lease space on the atampt circuits 
atampt said it would need to build a new satellite earth station 
near catawissa pa to connect with the intersputnik satellite

an inventor said wednesday he has developed 
threedimensional television beating the worlds electronics 
giants 
we think that just as black and white was converted into 
color so will color be converted into 3d said the 33yearold 
british inventor james ashbey 
the technology does not require special glasses or screens it 
can convert all new and existing black and white and color films 
into 3d along with live broadcasts animation and computer 
graphics said his company delta group 
ashbey displayed his invention at a london studio showing color 
films in what he calls full natural perspective 
the effect appears three dimensional but it loses some 
resolution compared with a standard tv image and is very blurry 
ashbey did not display the 3d and normal television versions of 
the same film sidebyside for comparison 
ashbey said he has applied for an international patent for his 
invention which he calls deep vision 
he said he developed the technology with financial support from 
rcacolumbia pictures international which he said provided 
245000 and the british entertainment group brent walker holdings 
plc which he said provided 642200 
deep vision electronically stimulates the brain into creating an 
illusion he said 
the technology takes a normal film makes a digital version and 
inserts what ashbey calls stereo cues a digital decoder added to 
an ordinary television set then uses these cues to send slightly 
different images to each eye and that creates the experience of 
depth he said

businessmen dont get no respect in britain 
sir john harveyjones has turned himself into a national 
celebrity by trying to do something about that 
i think we have an antiindustrial bias in this country and 
have had for many years said the former chairman of imperial 
chemical industries plc one of the largest british manufacturers 
people think that business is just about money and figures and 
that management is about administration and bureaucracy he said 
i actually think that business is about the totality of life and 
finally about people 
since before the time charles dickens created ebenezer scrooge 
ordinary britons often have regarded businessmen as moneygrubbing 
exploiters the strength of britains socialist opposition labor 
party partly reflects an enduring contempt for capitalist role 
models 
harveyjones 66 has bucked the stereotype he is widely 
admired for turning imperial chemical into a multinational giant 
with products that range from artificial carpet fiber to household 
paints 
contrary to the arrogance and aloofness commonly ascribed to 
many british business types harveyjones looks like a friendly 
buccaneer with collarlength hair shaggy mustache and beefy frame 
he goes for loud expensive ties drives a donkey trap around 
his 13th century manor house and boasts a flare for cooking curry 
perhaps another reason harveyjones defies the british executive 
image is his political leaning hes not enamored with conservative 
prime minister margaret thatcher who has alienated many working 
people with her strident free enterprise strategies that have 
reshaped britains economy this past decade 
i believe that our society has become more divisive in the 
past 10 years rather than less harveyjones said 
thatcher doesnt much care for harveyjones either the british 
press says hes her least favorite industrialist 
but the independent newspaper has called him the field marshal 
montgomery of manufacturing referring to britains world war ii 
hero viscount montgomery he runs on the same mixture of surface 
flamboyance and underlying caution the newspaper said 
harveyjones latest effort to win britons over to the 
industrialists side was a sixpart bbctv series called 
troubleshooter in it he called on businesses ranging from a 
pottery to a carmaker helping solve problems 
although the documentarystyle program looked like a course on 
basic management it was a surprise hit attracting between 2 
million and 3 million viewers each week 
i hoped in the series that we would be able to give a 
different perspective on what businessmen actually do the sort of 
problems they are trying to deal with and the reasons why 
management is i think a very worthwhile career and a very 
important career harveyjones said 
a wellorganized wellfunctioning efficient factory gives me 
the same pleasure albeit in a different way as when i go into a 
very nicely tended garden he said 
harveyjones is the only child of an army captain who later 
served as a hired prime minister to underage maharajahs in india 
he led a pampered childhood and once had his own ceremonial 
elephant 
he was wrenched away at age 6 and sent to the tormore boarding 
school in kent england attended the royal naval college at 
dartmouth when he was 13 and served in the navy during world war 
ii he spent a dozen years in navy intelligence doing secret work 
that won him the order of the british empire 
at age 32 he joined imperial chemical industries as trainee 
rose through management for nearly four decades and became chairman 
in 1982 
the company had just reported its first quarterly loss 
harveyjones funneled money into the companys growth areas and cut 
back on the poorly performing plastics fiber and petrochemicals 
business 
imperial chemical turned profitable again within two years the 
reversal became part of the reason harveyjones was awarded with 
knighthood in 1985 
he retired from imperial chemical in 1987 and has taken on 
about 32 parttime paid and unpaid jobs since ranging from charity 
events to his bbc series 
harveyjones is a director of several major british companies as 
well as the economist magazine and he is chancellor of bradford 
university 
i think the day when you stop doing anything and you just lie 
back in your deck chair youre ready for your box harveyjones 
said during a recent interview at the mayfair a posh london hotel 
favored by rock stars 
his accessibility is unusual in a country where most executives 
are tightlipped and publicity shy 
im probably better known than most harveyjones said but 
if the best you can do is to have a sort of oldage pensioner as 
a business hero i think were in trouble 
harveyjones blamed britains antibusiness attitudes partly on 
what he called the bias of the national education system which 
exalts professions such as medicine and dramatic arts but seems to 
steer students clear of business careers few of britains managers 
are trained he said 
there is still a very considerable degree of snobbery in this 
country people are judged by their birth and are judged by the 
type of career they follow certainly business success in this 
country doesnt open doors for you he said 
harveyjones lives in rossonwye in herefordshire in central 
west england with his wife daughter and 17yearold 
granddaughter he has a reputation for cooking ferocious curries a 
talent he picked up in india 
i enjoy it because its a creative thing he said i tend 
to be a big man with the onion and the garlic

a hypocrite and say its ok to take mr milkens money and then not 
allow the gentleman into the building

referred to the district superintendent bertrand brown brown who 
the post said approved milkens visits to the school did not 
respond immediately to a call for comment

in market sentiment toward the us currency rather the dollar 
buying chiefly was a byproduct of mark selling

bank in new york said the west german currency has been under 
pressure due to persistent concerns about possibly negative 
consequences of german unification 
the pound got a boost from expectations that chancellor of the 
exchequer john major soon would indicate when britain would enter 
into the european monetary systems exchange rate accord 
the pound peaked in europe at 17071 after comments by major 
from paris where he was meeting with his french counterpart pierre 
beregovoy but sterling pulled back from its highs when it became 
clear that major was not going to disclose anything significant for 
the time being

the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks picked up 807 to 
finish at 287856 and eclipse the previous high close of 287049

nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with

computergenerated sell orders eroded gains at several points 
during wednesdays session and took the dow jones average briefly 
into minus territory 
ac moore an analyst with argus research corp said prices

than 3 for each 1000 in face amount by late afternoon 
including wednesdays results the dow jones industrials have 
had eight new closing highs this month but analysts shied away

investors may begin to view stocks as overbought

cautious prior to the governments release friday of may employment

greyhound lines inc searching for ways to save 
money and entice new financing said wednesday it would rebuild its 
fleet of 3949 buses instead of buying new models 
president frank schmieder estimated the strikebound busline 
would save 3185 million over the cost of replacing the buses in 
2 years greyhound plans to rebuild 728 buses annually finishing 
the fleet in a little more than five years 
greyhound which operates the only nationwide bus system has 
been experimenting with remanufacturing buses for more than a year 
and had begun streamlining its maintenance operation even before 
bus drivers went on strike march 2 
the company has operated a reduced schedule since the 6300 
drivers walked out and lower revenue and resulting losses have 
hurt the companys balance sheet 
greyhound will remanufacture its buses at an expanded garage in 
jackson miss and at a second yettobedetermined site 
a new bus is a quality piece of heavy equipment made to last 
25 years schmieder said in remarks prepared for delivery in 
jackson it doesnt make sense to get rid of it just because its 
engine transmission and air conditioning systems have failed 
those things can be replaced 
schmieder said it costs greyhound about 25000 to remanufacture 
a bus compared to 200000 for a new one 
engines and transmissions will be replaced as will key 
components such as brakes and shock absorbers other parts will be 
replaced or repaired as needed then the bus will get new 
upholstery side panels glass and paint 
were not doing this to scrimp spokesman george gravley 
said we expect the quality of our buses to be better 
resulting in less downtime and a better product for the 
customer 
greyhound already has missed more than 14 million in lease and 
interest payments putting it in violation of agreements with its 
creditors 
the next deadline comes friday when the company owes a 25 
million payment on a 40 million loan gravley said a decision on 
making the payment had not been made greyhound also has a 28 
million interest payment due in midjuly 
in an effort to avoid bankruptcy greyhound has offered to 
repurchase a majority of its 225 million in junk bonds for about 
90 million greyhound must borrow the money to buy back the bonds 
however and analysts have questioned whether the company can find 
the financing under current market conditions 
gravley said negotiations are continuing with possible lenders 
but no announcement is imminent the repurchase offer is set to 
expire june 18 but could be extended 
greyhound bought 476 new buses in 1987 and 1988 the first two 
years after investors bought the company in a leveraged buyout no 
new buses were purchased last year and schmieder said the 
remanufacturing program assumes the company will not buy any new 
buses until at least 1993

ford motor co plans to offer customer incentives 
instead of a discount to dealers this fall to help spur sales at 
the end of the 1990 model year a company spokesman said wednesday 
the minimum possible incentives outlined in a letter to ford 
dealers are lower than those in the automakers current incentive 
program but go higher if demanded by market conditions 
the incentives would be in lieu of carryover credits 
effectively a discount to dealers that ford used to offer to help 
spur sales of prioryear vehicles when new model years began its 
the second straight year that ford has eliminated the 5 percent 
carryover credit 
the carryover allowance applied to cars on a dealers lot when 
the new model year began dealers used the allowances for customer 
incentives to pay for salesperson contests to buy advertising or 
simply pad their own profits 
ford spokesman bill carroll said wednesday that the letter to 
dealrs outlined some yearend plans including the list of minimum 
possible incentives on 1990 cars and trucks and a plea for more car 
and truck orders 
fords current incentive program is due to expire july 9 the 
yearend incentives will be offered between sept 28 and the end of 
the calendar year automotive model years typically begin oct 1 
in our letter to dealers were mainly pointing out that weve 
eliminated for the second straight year the 5 percent 
carryover carroll said we feel that its better to eliminate 
that and let it go by what the market is and what the incentive 
programs are rather than the carryover program 
fords move did not sit well with the national automobile 
dealers association which represents about 20000 us car and 
truck retailers 
its still our longstanding belief that we are better local 
marketers than the manufacturers nada spokesman jake kelderman 
said wednesday 
from the dealers perspective when it comes to yearend 
marketing they would like to have more control than under a 
program such as this he said we just have a general problem 
with all this stuff of going over our heads with our consumers 
it creates a lot of confusion in the marketplace 
automakers are offering a wide array of incentives directly to 
customers including cash rebates ranging from 200 to 5000 or 
financing with interest rates as low as 29 percent 
the companies also offer some other incentives to dealers keyed 
to car sales those incentives are used for advertising contests 
or are passed along to car buyers 
general motors corp will give dealers 5 percent of the sticker 
price of 1990 model cars they sell after the start of the 1991 
model year in october until dec 31 
chrysler corp spokesman tom jakobowski declined to say what 
kind of deal if any his company would offer dealers at the end of 
the model year 
ford also used its letter to seek more orders for 1990 model 
cars 
we reminded them dealers that you could be in short supply 
of certain cars and you should figure out what you need and put 
orders in during this buildout period carroll said 
a buildout period is the time when factory production is 
indexed heavily to dealer orders while manufacturers try to limit 
production to expected demand recently ford temporarily shut down 
its chicago and atlanta factories which make the companys popular 
ford taurus and mercury sable sedans ford said each closing was 
prompted by a shortage of dealer orders

big macs wowed moscow so perhaps it 
should come as no surprise but the walt disney co says muscovites 
gobbled up all 200000 russianlanguage mickey mouse comics 
magazines the first day of release 
the 32page magazine designed as the first in a quarterly 
series was released may 16 and sold for 15 rubles a copy 240 
or so it contains five comics of various lengths already published 
in other countries with dialogue in the word balloons 
translated into russian 
disneys familiar menagerie is on display goofy and mickey fly 
a kite from an airplane on the front cover goofy and some little 
green men sail past planets in a bubbletop spaceship on the back 
how universal can entertainment get 
in fact disney is part of a number of western comics publishers 
whose sales have risen in western europe in recent years and now 
are eyeing untapped markets in a part of the world where officials 
once looked askance at capitalists like scrooge mcduck 
disney for example has sold mickey mouse comics in hungary for 
about 2 years with recent sales reaching 125000 a month eastern 
europe is still a tiny fragment of disneys annual 15 billion in 
consumer product sales but the idea is to get the franchise in 
early as the trade doors open wider 
the moscow comic sales numbers reported by disney are strong 
other publishers said 
two hundred thousand copies in a day im impressed said 
james e galton the president of new yorks marvel comics home to 
spiderman xmen fantastic four captain america and the 
incredible hulk 
marvel the largest us comics producer publishes in 15 
languages and 25 countries their conan the barbarian has invaded 
hungary and they publish four titles in yugoslavia galton said 
right now ive got a guy in moscow checking out the 
possibilities of publishing there he said in a telephone 
interview we also have german publishers shipping copies from 
west germany to east germany thats been going on since they 
knocked down the berlin wall 
the disney publication is a joint venture between the 
disneylicensed danish publisher gutenberghus and soviet publisher 
fizkultura i sport the partnership was managed by disneys 
consumer products subsidiary in west germany 
the comic book was distributed at hundreds of moscow magazine 
kiosks and the publishers reported the singleday sellout 
according to disneys senior vice president in europe dennis 
hightower 
in a telephone interview from milan italy hightower said the 
publishers estimated that soviet demand was strong enough to have 
sold 15 million copies nationwide the major criticism weve 
gotten is why werent there more copies and thats unfortunately a 
problem with the paper allocation 
to put the numbers in perspective marvel expects to set a 
singleissue record with a new soontobe released spiderman 
comic about 2 million copies have been presold in the united 
states and canada and total sales should be 23 million or more 
said marvel spokeswoman pamela rutt 
issue no 2 of the russian mickey mouse comic book series is 
scheduled for july it is expected the press run again will be 
limited to 200000 copies reflecting the amount of printing paper 
allocated to the magazine 
in most countries of the world us comics are produced by 
licensed publishers in spain for example disney produces comics 
in a joint venture with brazilian publisher abril all of marvels 
overseas deals are licensed except in england where marvel has a 
subsidiary 
however disney itself recently began publishing topolino 
mickey mouse comics in italy selling as many as 700000 copies 
each week 
disney also began publishing its own series of eight monthly 
comics in the united states in april 
its not just big publishers who are moving into europe for 
example eclipse comics of forestville calif had revenue of 
about 35 million last year with 5 percent of that from european 
publishing up from 2 percent three years ago publisher dean 
mullaney said 
comics are a luxury he said but what seems to be 
happening is that they really want our entertainment because they 
havent had access to it for so long

ivan boeskys chief trader testified wednesday 
that john mulheren jr temporarily held large blocks of securities 
for boesky in 1985 in an alleged scheme to help his former friend 
avoid taxes and securities rules 
michael davidoff testifying at mulherens trial in us 
district court offered a tradebytrade breakdown of an alleged 
pact with boeskys seemala corp that forms the heart of 
governments case against mulheren 
the government has said mulheren entered into the trades with 
boesky in exchange for information about pending corporate 
takeovers mulheren 40 of rumson nj is charged with 41 counts 
of conspiracy mail and securities fraud and recordkeeping 
violations 
davidoff has pleaded guilty to one felony charge and agreed to 
cooperate with the government boesky testified for three days last 
week in his first appearance as a witness since he pleaded guilty 
in wall streets insider trading scandal in 1986 
during daylong testimony wednesday davidoff said boesky turned 
to mulheren in mid1985 to buy large blocks of securities and sell 
them back after 31 days in a parking arrangement to create 
phony trading losses for tax purposes 
assistant us attorney alfred pavlis presented more than a 
dozen trading records indicating that boesky sold mulheren the 
securities one date and in most cases bought them back shortly 
thereafter 
the evidence and testimony marked the first substantive accounts 
backing the governments allegations in illegal stock parking 
ownership of securities is concealed to avoid disclosure or other 
federal guidelines 
under the deal mulheren bought 330000 shares or 10 million 
worth of unical corp stock from boesky through a third party 
broker in july 1985 a month later davidoff told mulheren that 
boesky didnt want to buy back the stock and mulheren agreed to 
keep the shares 
davidoff also cited alleged parking arrangements involving 
securities known as options in boise cascade corp warner 
communications inc american hospital supply inc storer 
communications inc and rh macy amp co 
davidoff did not directly say that mulheren knew the purchases 
and sales were designed to break the law he did say he drew up an 
agreement that seemala would be responsible for all profits and 
losses in the transactions 
by the end of 1985 jamie securities mulherens nowdefunct 
trading firm owed boesky close to 2 million from trading profits 
davidoff said 
he testified that mulheren suggested jamie securities inflate 
brokerage fee bills and pay off the money gradually the government 
has alleged the money was paid back in 1986 
davidoff said leonard destefano a trading assistant at jamie 
securities and mulherens codefendant was designated as his 
contact during monthly payment of the alleged brokerage bills 
destefano 34 is charged with two counts of conspiracy and fraud 
in the case 
boeskys threeyear prison sentence ended last month he had 
pleaded guilty to one felony count paid 100 million in penalties 
and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors 
once one of wall streets most successful stock traders boesky 
provided the government information used against several prominent 
figures including drexel burnham lambert inc and its former junk 
bond executive michael milken 
mulheren is the only one of those directly named by boesky to go 
to trial others including boesky and milken have pleaded guilty 
to violating securities laws and other crimes

for almost two years ron dinsmore 
has scoured want ads sifted resumes and combed a nationwide job 
bank to find work for some of the 2500 people laid off when 
volkswagen closed its us assembly plant 
the state employment counselor thought salvation may have come 
when sony corp another foreign industrial giant announced in 
april that it would convert the sprawling facility near this rural 
western pennsylvania town into a hightech television tube factory 
everybody wants to know how to apply said dinsmore 43 who 
once was a fulltime union representative at the vw plant and will 
be seeking work himself in a few months when grant funding expires 
for his own position 
the japanese electronics maker undoubtedly will give the area a 
needed economic boost but it remains unclear whether local vw 
veterans who once learned from scratch how to assemble cars will 
be rehired to build a product far more complex some experts doubt 
it 
i really think that sony will recruit a new work force said 
richard florida a management professor at carnegie mellon 
university in pittsburgh who has studied japanese industries 
transplanted to the united states most of the jobs in that sony 
plant are going to be higherskilled than auto work 
sony said one reason it chose this area was the relatively high 
level of education among students for example it looked at such 
measures of student achivement as scholastic aptitute test scores 
to determine the quality of area schools in educating future 
employees 
but kunitake ando president of sony engineering and 
manufacturing of america hinted the company may not hire many 
former vw workers 
we are heavily recruiting engineering types rather than 
simple assemblyline workers he said when the announcement was 
made 
the plant that sony will occupy built in a former cornfield 
stands like a monument to the frustration stories of the two other 
manufacturers responsible for creating it 
chrysler corp began building it as an auto factory in 1968 but 
never finished volkswagen of america took over and opened the 
factory a decade later employment peaked at 5700 in 1980 and 
more than 1 million vehicles were built by the time vw closed shop 
in 1988 because of declining demand 
pennsylvania is forgiving 40 million of the 70 million it 
loaned volkswagen to start operations sony will lease the plant 
from the state 
although more than half of those laid off two years ago have 
found work dinsmore said he counsels about 150 unemployed or 
underemployed exvw workers weekly from his desk in a corner 
cubicle at a statefunded employment training center in the county 
seat of greensburg 
dinsmore said hes had little information to share about sonys 
hiring plans except that it expects to recruit about 1000 people 
in the next three years he said hes still trying to find out what 
type of workers sony needs 
ive read all different things in the paper they want people 
with dexterity skills they want people with math skills they want 
people with electronic skills he said everyones waiting to 
see what they need 
among those waiting is calvin tomanda 43 who had worked in 
vws supply store for more than 10 years tomanda issued equipment 
throughout the 22 million squarefoot factory built along a 
winding stretch of twolane highway 
since his layoff fulltime work has eluded him he entered an 
18month physical therapy training program but that closed when he 
was halffinished 
tomanda now works parttime as a nurses aide and is looking for 
a job in a warehouse 
like everyone else we all hoped that sony would take the 
facility he said whether former vw workers will be able to be 
in there in sufficient numbers remains to be seen 
phil davis 50 who worked 10 years as general supervisor of 
material and production control is unemployed and studying 
business management he said sonys announcement interested him 
but only in a passing way 
its good for the area he said i dont know if itll 
have a direct impact on me 
davis said hed like to find a job before sony begins production 
in about 18 months 
im not banking on this for salvation for my employment he 
said 
even if sony is not the answer to the problems of unemployed 
autoworkers the reopened plant will strengthen the economic base 
of westmoreland county and local municipalities where the primary 
source of income is farming 
that plant sitting idly as a dinosaur what was once a very 
fastpaced very fastmoving production facility was doing nobody 
any good said terry marolt chairman of the county board of 
commissioners 
its obvious that theres the big clout benefit immediately of 
a plant the size of sony coming in he said in addition to 
that theres a rippling effect that flows throughout the business 
world in the area 
although a tax package has not been worked out sony has agreed 
to at least match the 75000 in property taxes paid by volkswagen 
said howard j keefer an east huntingdon township supervisor 
keefer said hes eager to use the money to provide some longneeded 
repairs to roads bridges water lines and sewers 
local merchants also are optimistic about the arrival of a 
sizable regular payroll 
when volkswagen first came in it definitely had an impact 
said basil hawanchak controller of levin furniture co in mount 
pleasant were expecting the same type of impact from sony 
sony has said it hopes to build complete televisions at the 
plant and has an option to purchase additional acreage for 
businesses such as glass and cabinet makers 
former vw workers wont be written off completely as potential 
sony employees said florida they might be hired for appearances 
and taught the necessary skills he said 
i think the japanese can train anyone to do anything he 
said 
dinsmore said the former autoworkers are not deterred by the 
prospect of learning how to do hightech work 
let me say this in 1977 there wasnt a person in westmoreland 
county that built cars in 1985 we won car of the year he said 
motor trend magazine gave the award to vws gti model 
manufactured at the plant along with the rabbit golf and jetta 
no one knew how to build a car never built one in this 
county before or in the state he said they trained them 
they sent people to germany they sent a bunch of germans in here 
and did some training 
so you know we can build televisions we can build anything 
if we get the proper training

ashland oil inc was ordered wednesday 
to pay 103 million to four neighbors of its catlettsburg ky 
refinery who said emissions from the plant hurt their health and 
damaged their property 
residents of ceredo and kenova wva and catlettsburg ky 
brought suit against ashland in kanawha county circuit court after 
they found a white substance on their cars and homes the substance 
was not easily removed and damaged their property they alleged 
the verdict recognizes the magnitude of the problem that 
people have been living with for a number of years said dl 
hamilton an attorney for the residents i hope ashland oil got 
the message 
hundreds of other kenovaarea residents have brought similar 
suits against ashland 
dan lacy vice president of corporate communications for 
ashland said the company would appeal 
the companys appeal to the state supreme court will be based on 
kanawha circuit judge tod kaufmans decision to block testimony and 
evidence ashland attorneys believed vital to their case lacy said 
the court blocked testimony from a former environmental 
protection agency official who would have testified about air 
quality standards lacy said it also prevented jurors from hearing 
about evidence collected by the companys air quality monitoring 
units in the kenova area 
had we been able to bring that information to the jury we 
honestly believe the jurys verdict would be different lacy said 
ashland attorneys did argue that neighbors of the refinery 
feared it because they didnt understand it they also said the 
residents lacked concrete evidence of illness or property damage 
such as medical or repair bills 
wednesdays verdict was the first part of the trial in the 
second part the court will determine whether ashland must pay the 
tab for periodic health tests of the residents
