alexander junior stevens traveled seven 
miles across the bronx every morning to alfred e smith high 
school an allboys vocational school with a reputation as a quiet 
place a safe school 
junior was shot to death outside the school cafeteria nov 
14 a 15yearold classmate was charged the two were playing with 
a 22caliber pistol when it accidentally went off police said 
there are plenty of safe schools all over the city where kids 
are sitting there with guns in their bookbags they just havent 
decided to shoot yet said ed muir of the united federation of 
teachers the teachers union 
juniors was the first killing in a city school since 1978 
but in a system where violence is routine it caused little uproar 
among students 
the thing that everyone was taken aback by is that the kids 
seem to be taking this so calmly its just another kid whacked 
said muir 
bruce irushalmi director of the board of education office of 
school safety said students bring guns to school because they 
dont feel safe going to and from school they say they need 
them to create a balance of power 
muir is more cynical some kids feel they actually need it for 
protection and some are businessmen who have large quantities of 
cash and thought it the prudent thing not to apply for a pistol 
permit 
from september 1988 to june 1989 1854 weapons were seized at 
schools ranging from razoredged box cutters to automatic weapons 
at 15 schools where roving teams of security guards used metal 
detectors five guns and 815 other weapons were confiscated during 
the 19881989 school year a year that saw 1356 students 
assaulted 183 robbed 78 sexually assaulted and 105 caught using 
controlled substances figures for this year were unavailable 
to balance the arms race new york city spent 62 million on 
security in 1988 about 1 percent of the 7 billion budget metal 
detectors accounted for about 4 million of that the rest 
supported 2450 uniformed but unarmed security guards who police 
a system with just under a million students 
if we were a police force we would be the 10th largest police 
force in the country irushalmi said 
to muir it isnt enough he cites the increase in gun incidents 
twice a week last year 19 in the first 34 school days of this 
year as evidence that the citys schools are dangerous places to 
be figures kept by his union show a 5 percent increase in crime 
inside schools during the 198889 school year 
preliminary figures for 1989 showed an 11 percent increase in 
school crime in september and muir said 44 teachers were assaulted 
during the first month of school this fall compared to 27 during 
september 1988 
but irushalmi whose two children attend public schools says 
the problem is not inside the buildings reports of violence inside 
schools have fallen from 15000 a year in 1981 to 9000 in 198889 
outside is another story 
for anyone under 18 this is dodge city and you have to carry a 
piece he said unfortunately we dont have miss kitty at the 
long branch to make sure you check your piece at the door 
in one corner of this dodge city outside prospect heights high 
school in brooklyn a student was shot on the very first day of 
school 
theres no safety in prospect heights despite spot checks 
with metal detectors said bob brother abu 15 if they dont 
come on monday they put the weapons in their lockers so when the 
weapon detectors come on wednesday they have their weapons in the 
school already 
there aint no safety said his 17yearold friend who 
identified himself as carl or shrapnel insepticon a senior at 
erasmus hall high school in brooklyn he wore a blue bandana over 
his lower face jesse james style and said he was a member of the 
decepticons a teenage street gang named after evil characters in 
the transformers a cartoon show 
the loosely knit gang which has taken to bandanas as 
identification has been accused of taking part in halloween 
rampages on manhattans east side as well as in wolfpacktype 
attacks on students at bus and subway stations 
more than 100000 students stayed away from school on halloween 
apparently out of fear more than 250 high schoolage youths were 
arrested as they roamed the city robbing intimidating and 
assaulting pedestrians and merchants 
muir and the uft have proposed some remedies metal detectors in 
every school a police liaison for junior high schools stiffer 
penalties for anyone caught with guns but these steps all agree 
will not solve the underlying problems that lead to school violence 
the schools are a mirror of society irushalmi said citing 
drugs and crime the easy availability of weapons the diminution 
of values 
these kids dont distinguish between the schools and the 
streets muir said they dont see any difference 
we really think its related to drugs part of it has to do 
with the sales but another part is a lot of the kids parents are 
using drugs and the kids are acting out said gretchen rausch 
an assistant commissioner of the probation department who began her 
career as a probation officer in 1967 
arrests of kids ages 7 to 16 jumped 27 percent from 1987 to 
1988 she said 
but the kids say there is no simple reason why they prey upon 
each other and their teachers 
sean chittick 17 is a senior at murry bergtraum high school 
located across from police headquarters and regarded by many as one 
of the citys safer schools still he sees violence all around 
him and he is mystified 
it just be happening for no type of reason he said now 
they just be killing them for gold jewelry or you lookin at my 
girl

it begins with a male actor recounting a 
romantic date dinner by candlelight conversation by the 
fireplace 
finally we kissed the actor says then he asked if i 
enjoyed safer sex i have never felt so good about saying yes 
the city unveiled the 30second television spot which ends with 
the line rubber up for safety with much fanfare last summer as 
part of its latest aids education campaign 
months later viewers of latenight programming on a local cable 
channel are about the only ones who have seen it 
to avoid acquired immune deficiency syndrome the surgeon 
general recommended that people learn how the disease is 
transmitted and how it can be prevented through use of condoms 
the sloganeering has changed from safe sex to safer sex 
acknowledging that no sex practice including condoms offers 
foolproof protection against aids 
but getting the message to some of the people most at risk such 
as homosexual men or innercity youths without offending the 
masses is difficult at best say the people charged with creating 
the ads 
critics of explicit aids education campaigns warn they could 
backfire on health professionals and erode public support 
i think theyre turning people off said dr elizabeth m 
whelan president of the american council on science and health a 
consortium of more than 200 physicians and scientists active in 
consumer education 
reed v tuckson the public health commissioner in washington 
dc announced in 1987 that he wanted a sophisticated multimedia 
campaign similar to those that sell nike tennis shoes to poor 
black youths 
the department then argued with city officials and community 
groups for more than a year over wording on posters it negotiated 
with local news outlets and the public transit system which would 
not display placards with the word condom 
i did not anticipate significant opposition at so many 
different levels tuckson said 
reaction was negative in some boston quarters when a social 
service group action for boston community development unveiled 
its aids poster it shows four young men three with hats and one 
holding a condom over his head with the caption be cool wear 
your jimmy hat 
the group received complaints that by using the term jimmy 
hat slang for condom and also the title of a rap music hit 
the posters spoke specifically to young people and encouraged them 
to have sex 
people who are dying of aids and are in their 20s obviously 
contracted the disease while in their teens laura palmer an 
abcd spokeswoman said in reaction 
nevertheless the posters ready in march didnt make it onto 
city buses and subways until june held up by massachusetts bay 
transportation authority review 
new yorks rubber up for safety campaign includes two 
television spots the one so widely rejected and a second ad that 
features a talking head health commissioner stephen joseph two 
television stations including the local cbs affiliate have aired 
the joseph spot 
nancy davies vice president at capriello amp chabrowe the agency 
that designed the campaign said her people went back and forth 
with local tv stations on the more controversial ad changing it 
each time but the stations still said no 
they wouldnt have anything to do with them she said 
the citys newspapers have refused to run the campaigns print 
ads but they have shown up in subway cars and on station 
billboards one uses the headline mantoman with the letter 
o represented by a rolledup condom 
part of the goal davies said was to reach men who engage in 
sex with other men but do not consider themselves part of the gay 
community and thus do not frequent bars or organizations where they 
would see other aids education messages 
the bulk of the campaign when it comes right down to it is 
in the subway said davies 
whelan of the american council on science and health said she 
objected to advocating condom use not for moral or prudish 
reasons but because condoms are not 100 percent failsafe even when 
used correctly 
in addition she said the ads appear to condone at least 
unintentionally homosexuality or sex outside a monogamous 
relationship behavior that many people oppose 
if theyre meant for homosexual men i think they should be 
targeted at them and not at everybody else she said i think 
you end up turning people off and making them less sympathetic 
as head of the national aids information and education program 
at the centers for disease control in atlanta dr fred kroger is 
responsible for creating aids education materials for the public 
the first campaign in 1987 offered promotions on the use of 
condoms for sexually active people 
in general those were not played by anybody he said 
kroger said he had since refocused the message of the tv ads 
avoiding the word condom but including a telephone number 
people can call for information 
rather than putting lots of money into messages that would not 
be seen by anybody we opted to do less explicit messages he 
said 
public health officials and the ad agencies say they realize 
their work is controversial and they take pains not to be 
unnecessarily provocative 
but tuckson the district of columbia health commissioner says 
he feels they have a responsibility to get information on reducing 
the risk of aids to the people who need it 
this is a society that advertises feminine hygiene deodorant 
spray and depicts explicit sexual behavior in prime time he 
said what is offensive and insulting is not to give people 
information that can help save their lives

glad tidings and signs of peace on 
earth are scant among the bullet and rocketpocked facades of the 
humble homes of conacaste 
the family of elpidio verdugo set up a 3foot artificial 
christmas tree and draped it with a string of tiny lights that 
hardly ever twinkle because the electricity is on only a couple 
hours a day 
there are no presents beneath the tree and verdugos wife 
gloria doubts there will be 
the country is in mourning verdugo said 
the 45yearold bank teller his wife and their four teenage 
children spent the better part of three days last month huddled 
beneath mattresses draped over tables in the kitchenliving room of 
their cinderblock house 
outside the crack of fire from assault rifles and machineguns 
filled alley 6 an acrid gauze of gunsmoke reduced visibility to 15 
feet streamed through the shattered windows and seeped through 
cracks where the mattresses overlapped stinging eyes and giving 
the terrified family even more reason to cry 
the verdugos neighborhood of conacaste in soyapango just east 
of san salvador was the most devastated of several workingclass 
districts ravaged by fierce combat last month in and around the 
nations capital 
a guerrilla offensive launched nov 11 killed up to 2000 people 
and was the biggest push of a 10yearold civil war between leftist 
rebels and a succession of usbacked governments 
the verdugos finally were able to evacuate by climbing over the 
rear wall on nov 15 they returned after a week of refuge at the 
nearby psychiatric hospital to find their home a shambles 
the roof of the bedroom of 16yearold son stanley was blown 
to bits by either a rocketpropelled grenade or a rocket fired by a 
helicopter a crater surrounded by a whorl of black marks the point 
of impact on the white wall 
the corrugated synthetic tile roofing sheet has been replaced 
with cardboard the same material covering stanleys bedsprings 
the mattresses were burned up or torn to shreds said mrs 
verdugo 
the yellow refrigerator has a bullet hole in the side patched 
with cloth and tape so the refrigerant doesnt leak two kitchen 
chairs sprout foam rubber stuffing where bullets ripped through 
them 
verdugo estimated the damage at about 600 six months of his 
salary the family has no savings 
officials of a government housing fund visited to evaluate 
damage they promised money to help reconstruct 
but they also promised help to repair damages from the 1986 
earthquake and that never came said the father 
well do what we can to celebrate the arrival of the christ 
child said mrs verdugo she plans to prepare turkey or chicken 
pastries and homemade candies for visits of friends and relatives 
on christmas eve and christmas day 
even amid so much poverty theres always the joy of 
christmas weve always got faith and the hope that this wont 
happen again she said 
xiomara the 13yearold daughter said she had been hoping to 
receive a new dress or some other gift at christmas but i 
understand why there wont be presents this year and it doesnt 
matter really 
mrs verdugo said she does not entertain illusions that the 
christmas spirit of good will toward men might somehow foster peace 
in a moment of anguish like in the middle of the battle 
people accept christ in their heart but then when things calm 
down they forget for there to be peace christ has to be in 
peoples hearts all the time she said

when five people were indicted on charges 
of sexually abusing children at a daycare center the news 
reverberated through this town of 5800 seemingly touching 
everyone 
in the months since the first allegations were made against 
little rascals day care center last january wave after wave of 
indictments have been handed up court documents listing 202 
charges say daycare workers had intercourse in front of children 
and performed oral and anal sex with them from september 1988 to 
january 1989 
the initial reports were based on evidence from 21 children who 
were allegedly molested but prosecutors say all of the 
approximately 70 children who attended the center are potential 
witnesses the center lost its license in june and was closed 
nearly everyone here knows someone who has been indicted or the 
family of a child involved in the case 
ive watched some of the parents of victims grow up said 
alton elmore owner of edenton furniture and a chowan county 
commissioner and ive watched some of them whove been charged 
grow up 
that sense of community makes it doubly difficult for residents 
to deal with the sudden onslaught of news media and curiosity 
seekers 
a clerk at a childrens clothing store shied away from 
discussing the case with a stranger the manager of the stores 
little girl is involved in it so i dont think i should say 
anything she said 
other people offered similar responses 
its just a bad situation some are very upset said john 
smith owner of edenton floral co a block away from the choppy 
waters of the albemarle sound 
but while people are reluctant to talk about the case to 
outsiders they are freer among themselves rumors grew so abundant 
at one point that district attorney hp williams issued a 
statement warning residents that they could jeopardize the states 
case 
townspeople are beginning to tire of the lengthy pretrial 
hearings sometimes grumbling that williams has been dragging his 
feet since the first hearing april 14 when the first arrest 
occurred 
williams up for reelection next november has sometimes found 
himself in an unkind public spotlight and appeared reluctant to 
discuss even tangential issues 
public outrage and a concern for the children may have prompted 
bonds ranging from 375000 to 15 million so high that only one 
defendant has been released 
all but one of the defendants is charged with the same four 
crimes engaging in sex with a child under 13 taking indecent 
liberties with a minor crimes against nature and conspiracy to 
commit indecent liberties with a child 
the fifth former little rascals employee shelley stone is 
charged with all but crimes against nature 
all five defendants have pleaded innocent 
robert kelly jr 41 who operated little rascals with his wife 
elizabeth kelly 34 is in jail on 15 million bond he is charged 
with 152 counts involving at least 21 boys and girls under age 13 
mrs kelly is charged with 19 counts involving eight children 
and faces a 1 million bond a friend of the kellys willard scott 
privott 40 has been charged with 13 counts involving six 
children plus kidnapping and terrorizing one girl he is being 
held on 1 million bond 
kathryn dawn wilson 23 another employee is charged with 19 
counts involving eight children 
ms stone who is accused of nine counts is the only one of the 
five to post bond 375000 in her case however her lawyer said 
he was worried that she might be named in new indictments and 
arrested without warning 
joe cheshire the raleigh attorney representing kelly called it 
an incredible case he contended that much of the childrens 
testimony would show that nothing wrong had taken place and would 
exonerate his client 
its very strange to me cheshire said you have a couple 
of kids make some statements and months later you have some more 
and now we hear there are some more id just like to find out how 
that process happened 
but assistant attorney general bill hart said there is no 
mystery about the process 
we have had continuing disclosure just like the defense has 
been getting he said children dont just come running out of 
their houses screaming ive been molested 
elmore said each new revelation rocks the community in a way 
hes never experienced a lot of good people and the families of 
good people have gotten hurt he said

president corazon aquinos 
relationship with the press is a love affair gone sour 
once she praised the media for helping her take power now she 
threatens legal action against those news outlets deemed to be 
aiding the forces bent on toppling her 
seeking to repair the damage wrought by the recent failed coup 
mrs aquino on monday told reporters that the government would 
revoke the franchise of broadcasters who violate regulations 
against airing subversive propaganda 
with regard to print media its an entirely different 
matter mrs aquino said we will base this on any article that 
will incite to rebellion if such an article does appear in any of 
the newspapers then we will go to court to file charges against 
the erring individual or the publication 
she gave no indication what standards would be used in 
determining whether reports incite rebellion 
a senior us official speaking on condition he not be named 
defended government plans in the wake of the dec 19 coup attempt 
the most serious of six in her nearly 4 years in power he said 
there had been examples in american history when presidents imposed 
controls during grave national emergencies 
but media controls of any sort are a sensitive issue in a 
country emerging from years of strongman rule under the late 
president ferdinand marco a country uncertain of the strength of 
its democratic institutions 
the government assault on press freedom has begun said the 
newspaper malaya what is frightening is the mere thought that 
the aquino government swept into power on the promise of rigid 
observance of the citizens rights and liberties would entertain 
the idea of muzzling the press 
since marcos was ousted more than 20 english tagalog and 
chineselanguage newspapers have appeared in the capital and the 
manila press has become one of the most freewheeling in asia 
the governments move clearly aims to limit access to media 
particularly radio for rebels still at large ironically some of 
mrs aquinos stalwarts complained of stringent measures undertaken 
to limit access to opposition groups under marcos 
during the february 1986 uprising that toppled marcos mrs 
aquinos allies carefully cultivated foreign reporters and local 
journalists bold enough to challenge the governments version of 
events on the first anniversary of the marcos ouster the 
government awarded certificates of thanks to foreign journalists 
who covered the 1986 uprising 
so far the national telecommunications commission has closed 
just two radio stations a promarcos outlet in manila and another 
broadcaster in cebu the cebu station was later allowed to reopen 
after an august 1987 coup attempt some independent stations 
aired taped interviews with renegade lt col gregorio gringo 
honasan also believed to have been a leader of the recent putsch 
no statements from rebels have been broadcast since they gave up 
their last position dec 9 
newspaper executives say they have received no directives 
telling them what to print but several speaking on condition of 
anonymity say they fear such a move in the future if the political 
situation worsens 
on monday the philippine daily globe reported that military 
chief of staff gen renato de villa asked that another newspaper 
the philippine daily inquirer be closed for inaccurate 
reporting during the coup attempt but that de villa was overruled 
by the administration 
neither de villa nor the presidential palace has commented on 
the report in a frontpage editorial today the inquirer suggested 
de villa stick to soldiering and leave newspapering to those who 
understand its mission and operation 
even before the coup attempt mrs aquinos relations with the 
manila press had deteriorated columnists regularly lambasted the 
administration for inefficiency alleged corruption and favoritism 
of presidential relatives 
reporters covering the president often complain that access is 
limited to weekly minipress conferences in which mrs aquino 
answers a limited number of questions often with vague standard 
responses

in a benefit concert to help rebuild decaying 
east german city centers sir yehudi menuhin conducted the renowned 
east german state orchestra as it performed for the first time in 
west berlin 
the opening of east germanys borders nov 9 allowed east 
germanys famous orchestra to travel easily to the great hall of 
the sender freies berlin radio station for mondays hastily 
arranged concert 
for more than four decades the 73yearold violinist has taken 
his music around the world to play benefits first for the allied 
forces in world war ii for fellow jews who had survived the 
holocaust and much later for germanjewish reconciliation 
in an interview during the intermission of the concert which 
was broadcast live and could be heard in east berlin menuhin said 
the time was past to think badly of communists and that all should 
now focus on eastwest cooperation 
the classical program included works by ludwig van beethoven and 
wolfgang amadeus mozart 
speaking german in the interview menuhin said he had last 
played in berlin in 1929 as a teenager at the berlin philharmonic 
with the legendary conductor bruno walter 
he said that the opening of the wall was a phenomenon which is 
very moving and unbelievable 
music has managed to get over the wall he said that is 
not possible everywhere but you feel when you go to countries 
where people suffer or cant say what they want that music has a 
value that is hard to imagine in other countries 
the centers of many historic german cities like leipzig weimar 
and jena have been ravaged by pollution poor city planning and 
shoddy postwar construction 
menuhin joins other famous musicians such as mstislav 
rostropovich and daniel barenboim in staging benefits for east 
germany since the wall was opened

if vincent van gogh had the 
marketing pizazz of the entrepreneurs cashing in on his centennial 
he probably wouldnt have died a penniless suicide 
as the van gogh 1990 foundation prepares a multimedia 
extravaganza here marking the 100th anniversary of the artists 
death merchandisers are capitalizing on the event with everything 
from wine to ties bearing his name or image 
the commercialization has not pleased either the foundation or 
van goghs family 
it is not to our taste grandnephew johan van gogh told the 
associated press 
the governmentbacked foundation is preparing the biggestever 
van gogh show with almost 200 works loaned from more than 50 
countries for an exhibition opening on his birthday march 30 
the official commemoration has the support of the van gogh 
family 
we are going to give vincent van gogh a high quality 
commemoration said foundation spokeswoman madeleine a 
wardenaar we want him to be respected as a dutch artist 
were not doing this as a business added foundation 
financial advisor j rooyackers 
but many others are 
chief among them is amsterdam dentist jacob g dekker whose van 
gogh international has registered the name vincent van gogh as a 
trademark in just about every country you can think of except 
timbuktu for a variety of products 
his flagship line of vincent van gogh perfumes and colognes 
has a floral fragrance to remind buyers of works like the 
sunflowers series and irises which holds the art auction 
record of 53 million 
other commemmorative products dekker has licensed include pen 
sets watches compact discs of music composed by van gogh 
contemporaries debussy ravel and chausson and tshirts scarves 
and ties decorated with van gogh scenes 
dekker projects total centennial year sales of about 75 million 
worldwide he says he registered the trademark five years ago 
without a thought to the centennial 
the idea was to find a product name that everyone knows 
worldwide so you dont have to spend millions establishing a 
name dekker told the ap 
for those who take van gogh slightly more seriously than to dab 
him behind their ears or tie him around their necks the usbased 
franklin mint is issuing a limited edition bronze commemorative 
medallion for 150 
american express netherlands is offering an 8inch bronze bust 
of van gogh for 488 its manufacturer barcelonabased vincent 
fine art is also hawking van gogh reproductions and commemorative 
bottles of spanish champagn 
the commercial hoopla has created frictions between the 
entrepreneurs and organizations like the centennial foundation 
which see themselves as trying in vain to shield an artistic giant 
from crass commercialism 
when i offered my products to the gift shop of the van gogh 
museum they treated me like a stray dog said dekker 
the foundation has for example refused endorsements such as 
one for a line of curtains embossed with van gogh sunflowers 
we try to discourage people we dont like the publicity it 
gets but we cannot control it said ms wardenaar since both 
the artists name and his works are in the public domain 
they can do what they like we have not much to say about 
it said johan van gogh grandson of the artists brother theo 
johan chairs the familyrun vincent van gogh foundation which 
owns more than one hundred works on permanent loan to the van gogh 
museum here the worlds largest single collection 
at issue is one of this nations greatest cultural icons a 
ministers son whose early works reflected the grinding poverty of 
19th century rural dutch life foremost among them is the potato 
eaters depicting a farming family with grotesquely pinched 
features gathered around their meager supper 
it was only during his later french period that van gogh bloomed 
with the vibrant colors that have gilded the auction gavel 
the irony is that the worlds bestselling artist sold only one 
single painting himself 
after his descent into mental illness van gogh fatally shot 
himself in july 1890 at the age of 37 
the centennial foundation is pushing ahead with events it claims 
will nurture interest in the artist without exploiting him 
a van gogh opera will premiere in amsterdam a commemorative 
medal will be issued a film festival screened and a poetry book 
published with the poems of 20 dutch and belgian poets commissioned 
in his honor 
commemorative posters by 20 contemporary artists including 
czechoslovak jiri kolar dutchman willem de kooning and american 
roy lichtenstein have been run off to help offset the 115 million 
exhibition cost

a woman who says she witnessed salvadoran 
soldiers moving towards the residence where six jesuit priests were 
murdered was so intimidated by fbi agents and a salvadoran colonel 
that she recanted her story a human rights official said sunday 
from nov 27 to nov 30 lucia barrera de cerna a cleaning 
woman at the jesuit university in san salvador and her husband 
jorge cerna were repeatedly asked by the agents and the colonel 
what they saw the night of the killings said martha doggett of the 
lawyers committee for human rights 
when they told of having seen salvadoran soldiers moving to and 
from the priests residences they were accused of lying and asked 
who put you up to this ms doggett said 
ms barrera was also told depending on what you say you may 
or may not have to go back to el salvador said ms doggett who 
coordinates latin american and caribbean affairs for the lawyers 
committee and was one of two representatives from the organization 
to interview ms barrera recently 
the salvadoran lt col manuel antonio rivas also yelled at 
ms barrera im ashamed of you youre a salvadoran youre a 
liar said ms doggett 
rivas is head of the ustrained special investigative unit 
which was designed to handle human rights cases 
after three days of interrogation ms barrera couldnt take 
it anymore she wanted to be left in peace said ms doggett 
on nov 30 when she was asked by rivas to tell us again what 
you saw from the window ms barrera replied i didnt see 
anything from the window ms doggett said 
that night she told her husband what she had done and the next 
day he too recanted 
both of them failed lie detector tests when they repeated their 
story that they had not seen the soldiers 
the state department then turned them over to the custody of the 
association of jesuit colleges and universities which contacted 
the lawyers committee for human rights 
its a mystery to me why they would treat her this way said 
ms doggett she was treated as one would streat a suspect in a 
crime and not a witness she was already terrified shed lost some 
of the people she was most close to the priests and then she was 
uprooted from her home 
she added these hostile people they sort of ensured that she 
wouldnt cooperate 
duty officers at the fbi and the state department in washington 
said there was no one available to comment on the matter sunday 
night however the new york times reported in its monday editions 
that officials with the fbi and state department had said there was 
no evidence to support the cernas allegations 
ms barrera told ms doggett she was awakened some time after 
midnight nov 16 by the sound of gunfire and from a window saw five 
men two wearing camouflage uniforms with visored caps and guns 
walking toward a passageway leading to the priests residence 
according to ms doggett she heard a priest whom she was very 
close to father martinbaro say this is an injustice a 
short time later she and her husband heard gunfire constantly 
the next morning with security guards who worked for the 
jesuits ms barrera and her husband found the bodies of two 
housekeepers who had worked for the priests she also saw the body 
of martinbaro and her husband saw the bodies of four of the six 
priests who had been murdered 
a human rights official of the archdiocese learned what they had 
witnessed and told them to take sanctuary in a foreign embassy 
they first went to the spanish embassy where a salvadoran judge 
took a statement from them then to the french embassy and then 
they were brought by a us embassy official and an fbi agent to a 
miami hotel on nov 23 
ms barrera and her family lived in a suburb of san salvador 
but had spent the night the priests were killed in a cottage near 
the priests residence because of heavy fighting in their own 
neighborhood 
she told ms doggett she was sure the soldiers who came to the 
priests residence were government soldiers because the entire area 
was held by the government forces

rescuers on sunday evacuated a family 
that had been trapped at a lodge in the shadow of redoubt volcano 
as it continued to belch ash and steam over much of southcentral 
alaska 
the volcano which had been fuming and sputtering in a 
continuous lowlevel eruption since saturday afternoon erupted 
with greater force sunday afternoon the us geological survey 
said an ash plume was spotted by an airline pilot at 27000 feet 
drifting northeast toward anchorage 
shortly before the eruption pilots of alaska helicopters inc 
evacuated nancy jones her husband and 2yearold son from tuwalaka 
lodge 10 miles south of the volcano for two days ash clouds and 
poor weather had stymied efforts to reach the joneses who are 
caretakers at the lodge 
mrs jones said sunday she and her family could see little of 
the volcano until saturday when fog and snow near the peak cleared 
we could see the big billow going up into the air she said 
we watched it all day the wind was blowing it away from us we 
didnt get too much ash 
it was a little bit worrisome she said we were worried 
the top might blow off our way and give us a bad time that way 
she said she was unsure whether her family would return to the 
lodge if the volcano quieted 
we really like it out there its beautiful she said 
its a perfect place to spend the winter barring the volcano 
the family was taken to drift river a petroleum facility 20 
miles southwest of the lodge said byron wallace of alaska 
helicopters theyre at drift river now but when theyll get 
back to town were not sure he said 
another caretaker couple mike and sandy coulter remained at 
big river lake lodge nearly 30 miles north of the volcano though 
they had reported hunks of pumice as large as softballs falling on 
their roof saturday 
they reported no serious problems and intended to stay said the 
lodges owner dennis branham 
the 10197foot volcano located about 115 miles southwest of 
anchorage and quiet since the 60s started erupting thursday ash 
drifted as far south as oregon it had been expected to reach 
california or arizona by sunday but officials said there were no 
reports of ash reaching those states 
the continents most notorious volcano mount st helens in 
washington state also showed signs of life on thursday after more 
than three years of silence the volcano issued a small burst of 
steam gas and ash but scientists said an eruption did not appear 
to be imminent 
alaska volcano observatory geologist steve brantley said two 
other pilots reported a strong sulfur smell between 15000 and 
19000 feet about 25 miles west of anchorage 
given the wind direction it is certainly possible well get 
some ash fallout here in anchorage brantley said but that 
depends on the volume of ash that erupted whether there is enough 
of it to be carried by the winds this far 
the earthquake activity at the mountain continues at 
significant levels and does not show a trend toward increasing or 
decreasing strength or vigor 
before sunday afternoons eruption the usgs described the 
amount of ash sent up this weekend as low to moderate 
significantly less than friday when redoubt had its largest 
eruption since emerging from a 23year dormancy 
haze from the volcano on saturday drifted across anchorage 
alaskas largest city with more than 200000 people triggering 
power outages health alerts and disrupting air traffic at midday 
sunday snow was falling with no ash apparent in the city 
prior to saturday fallout had been swept past anchorage but 
blanketed smaller communities such as talkeetna and delta junction 
to the north the kenai peninsula south of anchorage also had 
escaped the ash until saturday when the peninsula towns of 
soldotna and nikiski got hit 
the ask was disrupting life in a state heavily dependent on air 
travel daily deliveries of newspapers flown from anchorage and 
fairbanks were halted saturday and some teachers from schools in 
outlying villages found themselves stranded in barrow unable to 
get flights out for the start of christmas vacations 
the anchorage international airport was open sunday but service 
remained spotty with some airlines grounding their aircraft and 
others offering limited service some businesses covered sensitive 
equipment for fear ash would filter into buildings 
the ash in the sky over anchorage during the weekend came at a 
time when daylight is in short supply the city is so far north 
that it gets only about 5 hours of light at this time of year

optimists who hope defense cuts will produce 
piles of money that can be spent on education deficitcutting and 
other initiatives take heed thats not what happened after 
vietnam 
as the united states withdrew its forces from southeast asia 
the share of the federal budget devoted to military spending 
gradually shrank from nearly half to about onefourth but the 
money was largely swallowed by rapidly growing federal benefit 
programs like social security and medicare by inflation and by tax 
cuts 
there was a peace dividend but it was gobbled up 
automatically by the formulas of entitlement programs that 
provide welfare and other benefits to millions of americans said 
roy ash federal budget director from 1973 to 1975 under presidents 
nixon and ford 
it didnt produce any discretionary money the government 
could distribute among domestic programs of its choosing ash now 
a los angeles investor said in an interview last week 
the bush administration is expected to seek a 292 billion 
defense budget for fiscal 1991 which begins next october 1 when 
it introduces its spending plan on jan 22 because of deficit 
pressures and diminished eastwest tension military spending 
increases for future years are expected to be reduced 
in 1968 when president johnson announced that the united states 
would begin to pull out of vietnam the us military budget hit 
its wartime peak 3237 billion in 1990 dollars by 1975 when 
saigon fell to the north vietnamese and the last american personnel 
left the country that spending had dropped to 2093 billion 
during that same period something else was happening a slew of 
income support programs including social security and medicare 
began dramatic growth spurts as congress voted benefit increases 
and expanded eligibility and inflation spiraled upward 
accelerated by the arab oil embargo of 1973 
social security spending swelled from 894 billion in 1968 to 
1566 billion in 1975 in 1990 money 
medicare which provides health coverage to the elderly and 
disabled jumped from 172 billion in 1968 to 312 billion in 
1975 in 1990 dollars as benefits were liberalized and medical 
costs soared welfare programs ballooned from 441 billion in 1968 
to 1215 billion in 1975 in 1990 money 
there were no particular plans for the adjustment to lower 
defense spending director gordon adams of the defense budget 
project a nonprofit research group said in an interview we 
just kind of ran into the train wreck of the oil price increases 
and inflation 
the us pullout from vietnam coincided with a jump in consumer 
prices from 6 percent a year at the start of the 1970s to double 
digits by the middle of the decade that coupled with rising 
unemployment and a slowing economy prompted congress to enact tax 
cuts in 1969 1971 and 1975 stimulating the private sector but 
further preventing domestic federal agencies from reaping benefits 
from the defense reductions 
the defense savings did not go to reduce federal deficits which 
were minuscule by todays standards and of minor political 
significance 
the government actually ran a 32 billion surplus in 1969 the 
last time federal books were in the black thanks to a temporary 
10 percent income tax surcharge imposed to pay for the war it was 
not until 1975 when the shortfall hit 532 billion that the 
deficit began to attract much attention 
i was trying so hard to make it a political issue but i 
couldnt stir any interest ash said 
todays economic and political climate is so different from the 
vietnam years that it is difficult to draw many budget lessons from 
that experience 
in todays era of 150 billion deficits few people expect 
lawmakers to tack huge new benefit increases onto existing income 
support programs indeed the deficit is so important a 
consideration that president bush and many lawmakers including 
some democrats are already insisting that any defense savings be 
used to help balance the budget 
yet benefit programs remain evergrowing and costly drains on 
government coffers with social security due to hit 249 billion 
this year and medicare expected to cost another 99 billion the 
medicare bill is expected to grow by about 14 percent next year 
because of ballooning medical costs while social security expenses 
should rise 8 percent because of growing numbers of people covered 
by the program 
that means tough competition for advocates of improved 
education health care environmental initiatives child care 
antidrug efforts transportation public works projects and other 
initiatives

six months into its review of federal energy 
policy the bush administration has come to at least one clear 
conclusion the reaganera theme of just keep the oil flowing and 
keep it cheap is too simplistic for the 1990s 
energy secretary james d watkins says oil inevitably will be 
the dominant fuel well into the 21st century he has become 
convinced though that the federal government must do more now to 
begin curing the nation of its costly oil addiction 
its not yet clear how the new federal role will be written but 
almost certainly it will emphasize the virtues of conservation and 
renewable energy resources 
that alone would be a major change from the eight years of the 
reagan administration which tried to abolish the energy department 
and failing that consistently cut its budget for energy 
conservation the departments 1989 conservation budget was less 
than onethird its 1980 level adjusted for inflation 
there are at least three main reasons for the turnabout under 
watkins the exxon valdez oil spill which turned much of public 
opinion against the oil industry longerrange concerns about 
environmental damage from burning fossil fuels and fear that the 
united states is becoming overly reliant on middle eastern oil 
the reagan administration went too far in getting rid of 
many good programs in energy conservation and renewable energy 
research watkins told a hearing wednesday in washington on the 
link between energy and national security 
the hearing was one in a series that watkins and his chief 
deputies have held in cities across the nation this fall watkins 
says he is looking for ideas on how to devise a national energy 
strategy to last for the next four decades 
shortly after he took office last march watkins said he found 
the departments bookshelves contained plenty of good descriptions 
of the nations energy goals but no policy document that spelled 
out how it could reach those goals 
watkins also discovered that the departments credibility was 
low and still slipping so rather than piece together an energy 
plan on his own watkins decided take his policywriting show on 
the road to solicit advice from the public 
what he has heard so far after public sessions in 11 cities 
from coast to coast is that conservation with a bigger push from 
the federal government can help achieve many key energy goals 
holding down oil imports keeping prices steady limiting the need 
for new power plants and curbing air pollution 
at the washington hearing watkins made it clear he has gotten 
the message 
if the final energy plan that the administration submits to the 
congress a year from now does not put a major emphasis on 
conservation and renewable energy resources such as solar power 
then this thing is dead on arrival he said 
even some supporters of reagans conservationcutting moves are 
now singing a different tune 
i have been converted to a greater appreciation of 
conservation and renewable energy henson moore the deputy 
energy secretary said recently as a louisiana congressman during 
most of the reagan administration moore voted for repeated cuts in 
conservation funds and research on energy efficiency 
i know more about it now said moore who is fond of saying 
his roots are in the oil patch 
the big oil companies know a lot about conservation and they 
think its overrated the american petroleum institute the main 
oil trade association recently published a leaflet that said a 
greater federal role in promoting conservation would only give the 
public false hopes and sharply higher energy prices 
public opinion polls however indicate that americans want more 
emphasis on conservation and development of renewable energy 
sources and less on oil production 
a poll conducted in november for the union of concerned 
scientists asked people across the nation how best to meet future 
energy needs and reduce air pollution eight out of 10 said use 
more renewable sources and increase energy efficiency about one in 
10 said produce more oil natural gas and coal the rest didnt 
answer

cincinnati bengals football coach sam wyche 
said he was making a point when his team ran the score up to 617 
over the houston oilers 
we dont like this team wyche said after sundays national 
football league game we dont like their people when you get a 
chance to do it run up the score you do it i wish today this 
was a fivequarter game 
wyche had his bengals throw the football and even executed an 
onside kick with a 450 lead as cincinnati amassed enough points 
to gain the most lopsided victory in its history 
it was cincinnatis way of repaying the oilers for years of 
perceived snubs by houston players and coach jerry glanvilles 
freewheeling approach to football 
wyche noted his opponents penchant for inflicting personal 
fouls jerry is an unusual coach wyche said drop me a note 
if you find somebody who likes this guy will you 
said glanville they played excellent they did a great job 
there are no excuses its our job to stop them

a senior israeli diplomat is beginning 
preparations today for an opening round of mideast peace talks here 
next month but there is growing doubt the ussponsored meetings 
will get off the ground without delay 
diplomatic sources cited moves by the palestine liberation 
organization as the reason it is no longer certain the talks to be 
hosted by secretary of state james a baker iii will be held 
still israeli cabinet secretary eliakim rubinstein who played 
a leading role in negotiations that led to the 1979 
egyptianisraeli peace treaty was sent here sunday from jerusalem 
he is meeting at the state department with dennis ross head of 
the state departments policy planning staff and bakers closest 
adviser on the middle east and with richard haass and other 
national security council staffers 
ross broke away from bakers trip to europe last week to prepare 
for the meeting with rubinstein 
egypt meanwhile is sending no special representative from 
cairo to make preparations ambassador sayed el reedy is available 
as needed 
the threeway talks baker hopes to have with foreign ministers 
moshe arens of israel and esmat abdel meguid of egypt would be the 
first step toward palestinian elections on the israeliheld west 
bank and in gaza 
both israel and egypt have agreed to the meeting reserving some 
issues to be settled once arad and meguid saw baker 
but since the state department announced egypts qualified 
acceptance 12 days ago problems have arisen between the arab 
country and the plo they raise questions whether egypt would be 
speaking for yasser arafats organization 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir assured president bush and 
baker on a visit here in midnovember that he was committed to his 
plan for elections among the 14 million palestinian arabs in the 
territories 
the idea is to choose negotiators to work out limited selfrule 
with israel a plan that has the support of the bush administration 
but is challenged by the plo as a ploy to prevent establishment of 
a palestinian state 
when egypt agreed to bakers proposal for a planning meeting 
here in january it registered some reservations as israel had done 
earlier they were to be taken up at the meeting 
essentially egypt reserved the right to promote a role for the 
plo in selecting a palestinian delegation that would hold 
preelection talks with israel in cairo 
israel meanwhile reserved the right to try to exclude the plo 
from having any meaningful role 
on dec 6 margaret d tutwiler the state department 
spokeswoman announced that egypt had accepted bakers proposal 
she called it a step forward in the peace process 
but the plo asserted a more direct role by giving its qualified 
acceptance to robert pelletreau jr the us ambassador to tunisia 
who has been the us contact with the plo since a dialogue was 
opened a year ago 
and then arafat sent a private letter to bush indicating his 
willingness to make peace 
while the president did not reply the opening of a plo channel 
to the white house serves to undercut the idea that the united 
states is negotiating with egypt not the plo 
still shamir is standing by his commitment to proceed despite 
concerns by more conservative members of his likud coalition that 
the plos prestige and power might be enhanced 
within hours of receiving a summary but not the text of 
egypts acceptance of bakers proposal shamir and other members of 
the israel inner cabinet notified the state department it would 
go ahead with preparations the cabinet designated rubinstein for 
the job last sunday

a variety of business and consumer interest 
rates should head down over the next six months as the federal 
reserve continues its efforts to keep a sluggish economy from 
toppling into a recession many economists predict 
these analysts were forecasting that banks prime lending rate 
to which onethird of all business and consumer loans are tied and 
mortgage rates will decline in the wake of further credit easing on 
the part of the fed 
that was the prevalent view as federal reserve policymakers 
gathered today for a meeting of the federal open market committee 
the panel of fed board members and regional bank presidents who 
meet eight times a year to map monetary strategy 
while the meetings are held behind closed doors with the minutes 
of the sessions not released until six weeks later many analysts 
were expecting a clearcut signal of looser credit to emerge from 
the discussions perhaps before the end of the week 
these economists believe the central bank will decide to reduce 
a key interest rate the federal funds rate by another 025 
percentage point dropping it from 85 percent to 825 percent 
the federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other on 
overnight loans it is the primary lever the central bank uses to 
control shortterm interet rates 
when the next easing move occurs economists were predicting 
that banks will quickly follow suit by reducing their prime lending 
rates to 10 percent down from the current 105 percent analysts 
said they expected at least one more cut in the prime lending rate 
to 95 percent to occur before next summer in response to further 
fed easing moves 
analysts predicted that the credit easing would have a 
beneficial effect on mortgage rates as well 
david wyss an economist with drimcgraw hill predicted that 
fixedrate mortgages currently at a national average of 975 
percent will fall to around 925 percent by next summer 
economists say they are confident in their belief that the fed 
will ease further because economic growth has slowed significantly 
while at the same time inflationary pressures have moderated 
it will take additional easing steps to guarantee that we 
dont go into a recession said david jones an economist with 
aubrey g lanston amp co i think we will avoid a recession but 
just barely 
jones and other economists point to the fact that unemployment 
has begun rising as various manufacturing companies from autos to 
computer firms have announced layoffs in the face of slumping 
demand 
at the same time that growth is slowing inflationary pressures 
are easing the government announced friday that prices at the 
wholesale level fell in november for the third time in the past 
five months with the drop led by a big decline in gasoline costs 
inflation has decelerated enough so that the central bank has 
a margin of comfort to ease interest rates to boost economic 
growth said allen sinai chief economist of the boston co 
that assessment is far different from the view as 1989 began at 
that time the central bank was in the midst of a yearlong effort 
to drive interest rates higher to dampen demand and keep 
inflationary pressure in check 
however in may the fed switched course and began a series of 
gradual easing moves as signs mounted that economic growth was 
beginning to slow in response to the earlier credit tightening 
the bush administration has complained that the fed has been too 
timid in its credit loosening and has brought on an undue risk of a 
recession but most economists give federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan and his colleagues high marks for a delicate job of 
balancing the threats of inflation and recession 
wyss said he believed the economy will escape without a 
recession and that growth will begin rebounding in the second half 
of next year at which time he predicted that the declines in 
interest rates will come to an end

grapes and other fruit from chile are 
beginning to arrive in the united states and exporters are hoping 
for a banner year after last seasons disastrous cyanidepoisoning 
scare 
chilean fruit exporters have seen a substantial increase from 
previous years in early orders from us grocery chains said david 
holzworth a washington attorney who represents the chilean 
exporters association 
the biggest silver lining of the cyanide scare for the 
industry has been the recognition by retailers of how important 
chilean fruit was to their produce sales holzworth said 
he said produce sales for some of the large grocery chains were 
off as much as 25 percent last march and april as a result of the 
poisoning scare that kept chilean fruit off the shelves for several 
weeks 
the importance of the products to the retail industry has come 
home he said so were looking at a very good year so far as a 
result of that recognition 
the new season is proceeding under a cooperative agreement 
signed by chilean and us officials that formalizes emergency 
procedures to ensure the safety of fresh fruit exported from chile 
the memorandum of understanding outlines steps the two countries 
would take to handle an emergency like the cyanide scare should 
another occur 
several ships have arrived in us ports recently bringing 
early shipments from chile but the fda sees no need to institute 
special procedures for monitoring the produce officials said 
as far as chilean fruit is concerned we are in routine 
coverage of the fruit said richard davis fdas regional 
director in philadelphia 
we normally would collect samples of fruit to be analyzed for 
pesticides and we would also check for the presence of sulfites 
which is used as a preservative for grapes and only a certain 
amount of it is allowed 
he added that the fda is applying the same rules to chilean 
fruit as to any other fruit 
the scare began march 12 when the fda announced that it had 
found traces of cyanide in two grapes from chile earlier in the 
month an anonymous caller to the us embassy in the chilean 
capital of santiago had threatened to inject cyanide in export 
fruit 
the fda ordered chilean fruit held in ports where it was coming 
into the united states urged stores to remove the fruit from their 
shelves and began a series of special inspections to determine 
whether any more fruit was contaminated 
no other fruit was found to be tainted but millions of dollars 
worth of fruit had to be dumped because it had gone bad while it 
was withheld from the market during the inspections at the time 
chilean exporters and us importers said they lost about 240 
million because of the health scare 
the impact on the chilean fruit industry is still being felt 
holzworth said many small companies have gone out of business or 
have been bought out by larger companies 
grapes constitute about 70 percent of the fruit chile exports 
and virtually all of the fresh grapes sold in the united states 
during the winter months are from chile 
chile exported nearly 44 million crates of fruit to the united 
states and canada last winter and 6 million crates had to be 
dumped 
this year if the harvest continues to be good chilean 
exporters expect to send as much as 48 million crates of fruit to 
the united states and canada holzworth said and what youll see 
is the best of the best 
exporters will be sending to us markets the premium quality 
fruit to make sure the initial market acceptance will be 
high he said

twenty years after the united states put men on 
the moon the soviets have admitted they raced to get there first 
us scientists say 
the massachusetts institute of technology released photographs 
of a landing craft and a module built but never used to put 
cosmonauts on the moon and bring them back to earth 
the pictures were taken last month by one of a group of us 
aeronautics engineers who were shown the equipment while touring 
the moscow aviation institute 
we are almost positive that we are the first westerners to 
have seen this said edward f crawley of mit 
while many believed that the soviets wanted to reach the moon 
first they long denied that they were in the race 
whats newsworthy is they are just now admitting that they 
were trying to get to the moon they always denied it said lee 
saegesser archivist at the national aeronautics and space 
adminsitration in washington dc 
the soviets first acknowledged the lunar program in october 
when the newspaper pravda published an interview with vasily p 
mishin its chief designer 
the soviets told the american professors that the spacecraft was 
ready to fly the year before the us apollo 11 mission reached the 
moon in 1969 but the project was abandoned because of difficulty 
perfecting the rocket booster that would have carried some of the 
equipment into space 
the americans said the soviets were nonchalant about showing off 
the hardware 
it was off hand said jack l kerrebrock mits acting dean 
of engineering who snapped the pictures 
they took us into the room that houses this hardware to show 
it to us as part of their educational program indeed this is how 
its used by students they crawl around it and make drawings of 
it 
the americans said the equipment resembled the us landing 
craft except for two major details the soviet setup required two 
rockets rather than one to carry it into space and it would have 
have carried one man rather than two to the lunar surface 
the americans were shown the equipment by their moscow host 
professor oleg alifanov the americans five from mit and one from 
california institute of technology were in the soviet union to 
help set up an exchange program with the soviet aerospace institute 
crawley said the soviets showed a mixture of pride that they 
had built it and sorrow that they had never used it and concern 
that no one had ever heard about it 
americans neil armstrong and edwin aldrin were the first to set 
foot on the moon on july 20 1969 the era ended three years later 
when apollo 17 astronauts made the sixth and final lunar landing 
the americans said the soviets told them the lunar lander part 
of the mission was ready to go in 1968 and they were under 
pressure to hurry because of the apollo successes however 
setbacks in the development of the soviets n1 booster rocket 
delayed the mission 
they said the moon program was put on hold in 1972 and canceled 
two years later the soviets then gave priority to their space 
station project 
the americans saw the soviet equipment on nov 27 and mit 
released kerrebrocks photos sunday 
the n1 booster would have carried the lunar landing craft into 
space while a proton rocket would have lifted a spacecraft 
intended to bring the cosmonauts back to earth 
the americans said the soviet landing craft complete with 
extendable landing legs was designed much like the us version 
there is a lot of similarity due to form and function said 
crawley its the natural form that something that would land on 
the moon with men on it would have 
besides kerrebrock and crawley others who saw the equipment 
were lawrence r young leon trilling and daniel e hastings of mit 
and frank marble of caltech

an agriculture department study shows that 
most of the nations cotton is produced by a relatively small 
specialized group of operators whose main occupation is farming but 
who often dont live on their land 
based on a review of 1987 us farm census figures only 19 
percent of the nations cotton farm operators reported another 
principal occupation compared with 45 percent for us farm 
operators in general 
however only about half of the cotton farmers lived on the 
farms they operated in 1987 compared with 71 percent for farmers 
in general 
the study by leslie a meyer and scott sanford of the 
departments economic research service compared some of the 
characteristics of cotton farming with other types of agriculture 
and how those changed since 1982 
according to the census of agriculture which is taken every 
five years the typical cotton farm operator is male white and 
approximately 50 years old 
however female younger and certain minority operators are 
becoming more prevalent and one would expect them to play an 
increasing role in the future operations of cotton farms the 
report said 
women increased their share of cotton farming to 35 percent in 
1987 from 3 percent in 1982 with the largest number of female 
operators in texas and mississippi 
despite the gain women were still underrepresented relative 
to the 63 percent operating us farms of all kinds the report 
said 
although there is no definitive explanation for the gradual 
increase in femaleoperated farms the report speculated that the 
trend may be attributed to several factors 
the willingness of women to identify themselves as principal 
farm operators 
a possible increase in unwillingness among young widows to sell 
their farms or leave farming upon the death of a spouse 
a rise in the number of young women who feel the call and have 
the confidence to run a farm 
under a standard industrial classification definition used 
by the commerce department a cotton farm is one that derives at 
least 50 percent of its total annual sales value from cotton 
production 
although acknowledging there are many farms that produce 
cotton the study dealt only with those sic farms defined by 
commerce those totaled 27673 farms in 1987 up 32 percent from 
21041 counted in the 1982 farm census reflecting further emphasis 
on cotton among farm operators 
by comparison us farm numbers in general declined to fewer 
than 22 million in 1987 from about 24 million in 1982 
leading states for cotton farms were reported as texas 11741 
farms in 1987 and 9242 in 1982 mississippi 3176 and 2692 and 
louisiana 2223 and 1899 
the study showed that in 1987 about 69 percent of the socalled 
sic cotton farms contained 260 acres or more compared with less 
than 65 percent in 1982 
states with the largest percentage of cotton farms 260 acres or 
more were south carolina 76 percent arizona 741 texas 737 
and georgia 645 in addition 155 percent of south carolinas 
cotton farms were 2000 acres or more compared with 125 percent 
in mississippi and 98 percent in arizona 
at the opposite end small farms of fewer than 100 acres 
represented only 139 percent of the total sic cotton farms in 
1987 compared with 175 percent of the total in the 1982 census 
states with the highest percentages of small cotton farms 
included new mexico 338 percent tennessee 297 percent and 
north carolina 241 percent 
both censuses demonstrate that the preponderance of us 
cotton farmers are white the report said the proportion of 
minorities decreased from 5 percent to 3 percent between 1982 and 
1987 with all states except new mexico and north carolina showing 
declines 
however the report added the absolute number of minority 
cotton farm operators increased in arizona new mexico north 
carolina tennessee and texas mississippi had the largest number 
of minority operators in both 1982 and 1987 
minority cotton farm operators in both 1982 and 1987 were more 
likely than white to own the land they operated and somewhat less 
likely to be tenants the report said however by 1987 
minority operators as a group were more likely to be part owners or 
tenants and less likely to be full owners than they had been in 
1982 
the report added this shift toward more tenants and fewer 
full owners was also apparent among white operators although 
blacks and other minority operators exhibited a 
disproportionately large drop in their incidence of full 
ownership 
in 1982 and 1987 the age group of 55 to 64 was the largest for 
cotton farmers with an average age of 488 years in 1982 and 497 
in 1987 with the youngest in georgia 459 in 1987 and the oldest 
in oklahoma 519 
thus the average age of the us cotton farm operator 
increased only slightly the report said the slim advance can 
be attributed to the meager expansion of the average age range of 
operators in the producing states

president bush confesses only one 
complaint one regret about his seaside soiree with the president 
of france that we have to leave this beautiful paradise on such 
a short notice 
but its not exactly as if someone were about to order the 
president of the united states to leave this tropical caribbean 
island and return to the nations capital caught in the grips of 
subfreezing weather 
after all the french west indies is a bit of a trek just for 
lunch and a walk on the beach even for globetrotting diplomats 
like bush and francois mitterrand who jets about in a supersonic 
air france concorde 
in his more sedate air force one a 25yearold boeing 707 bush 
had to leave washington before dawn and fly for three and a half 
hours for saturdays brief francoamerican encounter 
their meetings lasted just over three hours and that included 
a beach walk lunch and a 45minute news conference 
then bush left this land of gentle trade winds palm trees and 
a temperature in the 80s to fly another three and a half hours back 
to washington where the temperature when he landed at snowcovered 
andrews air force base was 5 degrees 
im disappointed the meeting didnt break apart so we could 
have spent a week here said secretary of state james a baker 
iii shaking his head in mock dismay 
but nobody was about to tell bush to slow down not even baker 
why did bush travel so far for such a short meeting 
its not much different than going to houston for the 
weekend offered press secretary marlin fitzwater

it doesnt hurt just cant talk was how bush described his 
most recent bout with laryngitis french president mitterrand came 
to the rescue by dominating their joint news conference and 
giving bush plenty of time to rest his raspy voice 
not only did mitterrand the host on this french island for the 
weekend gettogether decide whom to call on but he also tended 
toward lengthy expansive answers 
several times as mitterrand droned on bush looked to us 
reporters sitting in the first row and shrugged his shoulders 
one of the few times bush called on a reporter he requested 
mitterrands permission to pick the man who thought he had been 
recognized for the previous question but the reporter bush 
selected turned out to have a question in french for mitterrand 
the two leaders had headphones so they could listen to 
translations of questions and answers into their respective 
languages 
bush who sometimes likes to blurt out phrases in highschool 
french decided to trust instead to the official translator and 
spent much of the news conference with one earpiece held tightly to 
his ear 
and for his part mitterrand seemed temporarily taken aback 
when questions turned to whether bushs special relationship 
with him was on a par with us friendship with britains margaret 
thatcher 
there is room enough for several friendships in life he 
said 
then he was asked if his response would have been the same 
before last jan 20 bushs inauguration day 
mitterrand looked confused and asked what was the significance 
of jan 20 to rising laughter it finally dawned on him i need 
a triple translation he joked 
then he said that he had gotten along just as well with former 
president reagan

tim mcbride bushs personal aide is seldom more than a few 
paces from the presidents side but he found some rare time on his 
hands during the bushmitterrand meeting 
so he went for a dip in the warm inviting caribbean however 
the beach had been closed because of the highlevel gathering and 
french security officers wasted little time in ordering mcbride out 
of the water 
clad only in a bathing suit the embarrassed aide had a hard 
time persuading the gendarmes he really worked at the white house 
he was briefly taken into custody until he could get the us 
secret service to vouch for him

doctors were trying to learn why a 2yearold 
boy died after twice receiving split livers in transplants 
mitchell wallace of hannibal ny died saturday of multiple 
systems failure said margie buczynski a spokeswoman for 
childrens hospital of pittsburgh she said doctors planned to 
perform tests to determine what caused the failure 
a lack of available donor organs led doctors to try the 
splitliver transplants which are possible because the organs 
regenerate themselves 
mitchell received his first split liver nov 29 but the liver 
did not function properly doctors said 
on wednesday doctors split one liver to transplant into 
mitchell and a 3yearold child whom the hospital did not identify 
at the parents request

federal antidrug coordinator william bennett 
says the argument that drugs should be legalized is fed by 
indifference to the fact that a large number of drug users are 
minorities 
i have to tell you ive heard in some circles well let them 
kill each other bennett said sunday on the abctv program 
this week with david brinkley 
that is not worthy of the american people said bennett he 
did not say who harbored that attitude 
bennett director of the office of national drug control policy 
has been a vocal opponent of calls to legalize illicit drugs 
advocates of legalization include baltimore mayor kurt l schmoke 
who is black economist milton friedman and us district judge 
robert sweet who last week became the first federal judge to 
publicly voice such an opinion 
friedman and sweet also appeared on the show but did not 
address bennetts comments 
bennett made his remarks in response to a question by 
conservative columnist george will 
do you think if the people disproportionately killing 
themselves off were white suburban high school students there would 
be a different kind of argument going on will asked im 
asking is there a certain racial indifference in this argument 
im afraid there is bennett responded

the world bank the biggest source of aid to

stanley fischer 
as far as the world bank is concerned we dont see how 
lending to eastern europe is going to detract from our lending to 
africa and latin america fischer the banks top economist said 
at a news conference friday 
world bank president barber w conable said the bank had 350 
million worth of loans prepared for projects in poland and might 
lend as much as 1 billion more in the coming year so far poland 
has not had any loans from the bank 
as poland stabilizes if it does its very likely that our 
lending program will increase fischer said 
hungary got 345 million in loans yugoslavia 198 million and 
china 13 billion in the year that ended june 30 there would have 
been more for china but conable cut off new loans when beijing 
violently crushed the movement for more democracy last june

a cat and mouse game played out for 
the past five years on georges bank is driving canadians toward a 
tougher stand against americans poaching on their rich fishing 
grounds officials said 
id equate it with a small boy teasing a dog the dog will go 
along with it for only so long and then hell bite says jeremy 
d conway chief of investigations for the canadian department of 
fisheries and oceans 
when the world court divided the territory about 120 miles off 
cape cod in 1984 american scallopers learned fast that their 
twothirds couldnt match the canadians rich portion periodic 
incursions became the norm 
but the raids have more than tripled in recent weeks according 
to canadian and us officials who report as many as 20 us boats 
now cluster at the international line each night 
last week a canadian navy destroyer tailed a fairhaven 
massbased scalloper for 12 hours during which a collision was 
reported and warning shots were fired 
canadian scallopers who have observed governmentimposed 
fishing quotas are near despair their industry is losing more 
than a 1 million a month to poachers even as 1500 factory workers 
in the outpost town of canso are losing their jobs and skippers are 
missing boat payments officials said 
we wouldnt allow american citizens to come up and raid our 
shopping malls or banks said carl goodwin chief of surveillance 
operations at the canadian fisheries department why let them 
raid our natural resources we have to stop this before someone 
gets hurt 
radar and patrol records indicate a clear pattern as soon as 
the lone naval destroyer patrolling the boundary starts moving out 
of sight intruders steam in and haul out as many scallops as 
possible when the patrol ship comes back into view the violators 
take off 
the incursions have become easier because nova scotias 
scallopers have been ashore since october when they filled their 
quotas at the same time canadas coast guard which usually 
patrols the hague line has been on strike 
robert prier the fishing departments director of conservation 
and protection said the flagrant disregard for canadian 
boundaries and authorities has worn very thin and warships have 
been more frequently giving chase 
they have been tolerant in the past but this latest action 
signifies a new direction in canadian policy said lt craig 
lloyd who is based at coast guard headquarters in boston we 
will not interfere with their law enforcement efforts in 
international waters 
lloyd said no canadians have been reported poaching in us 
waters but if we had canadian fishing vessels over on our side 
of the line we would take action to stop them 
the fairhavenbased concordias captain said his charts 
indicated he was in international waters he compared the hot 
pursuit to a wartime assault 
even if they see a boat fishing a halfmile over the line and 
chase them out isnt that good enough why do they want to start 
sinking boats william furey jr asked sunday 
youre talking about a small boat and a few scallops or a few 
fish is that serious enough to have 10 families burying their son 
or husband a christmas time 
but canadian officials and fishermen who note the high tech 
navigation equipment virtually all scallopers use rejected the 
scenario 
if you dont want war then dont break the rules goodwin 
said and if you want to take the risk then dont cry when 
the shots are fired or say were too aggressive 
for the canadian scallopers moored along these craggy shores 
the violations provoke a particularly bitter reaction they stuck 
to the government quotas imposed to protect against overfishing and 
tied up their boats more than two months ago 
now its christmas time their savings are stretched and the 
communitys frustration mounts daily with secondhand reports of 
how american poachers are illegally hauling in a hefty holiday 
catch 
our boats are tied up and men are out of work while these 
american guys are catching our scallops said albert eisner who 
started fishing as a teenager theyre making fools of us its 
an insult 
the story was different for the generations of scallopers from 
new england and canada who fished georges bank side by side but 
the brothers bound by sea have turned to battle since the hague 
line was drawn 
these guys have so many common bonds in the maritime 
environment theyve often helped each other out through the 
years said fred greene who runs several nova scotiaarea 
fishing enterprises but our fishermen are being pushed to 
desperation 
the problem defies easy solution canada lacks a treaty to 
extradite americans for fishing violations lloyd said the us 
coast guard planned to step up patrols and officials from both 
countries have been discussing stiffer penalties for us 
intruders but so far theyre still paying less than 1 percent of 
the 700000 fines canadian violators pay 
you cant go out and solve this with warships theres got to 
be a better way said paul allen who has been scalloping for 34 
years but we better do something soon because ive no doubt its 
going to get worse

people dressed as early colonists and american 
indians rushed aboard a ship and dumped boxes of tea into 
boston harbor on the 216th anniversary of the boston tea party 
the reenactment sunday evening of the colonials protest 
against british tariffs took on a modern twist as some of the 50 or 
so spectators wary of how the legislature might try to ease 
massachusetts budget problems shouted no new taxes 
under cover of night with temperatures in the low teens 15 to 
20 people hacked into tea boxes and threw the contents leaves 
instead of tea from the brig beaver ii into the harbor just as 
colonials did with 347 boxes in 1773 
nine redcoats then boarded the ship and escorted the 
colonials off to fife and drum music 
the tea party was a protest of british tariffs on the brew and 
englands practice of taxing colonial americans without allowing 
them representation in parliament the protest helped spark the

the rev bruce ritter has long been synonymous 
with covenant house the times square shelter that grew into a 
worldrenowned refuge for street kids through the franciscans 
vision savvy and tenaciousness 
now ritter is faced with allegations that threaten not only his 
reputation but also the very viability of the institution he 
created 
last week ritter was forced to call a news conference to deny 
reports that he had sex with a young man he had helped and that he 
improperly spent covenant house funds on the man 
its every organizations nightmare said e jeff baron 
executive director of emergency shelter which also helps runaway 
youths it basically strikes at the very heart of what youre 
trying to accomplish 
since 1968 when ritter took some runaways into his greenwich 
village apartment he has fought bureaucracy the limits of 
government aid and competition from other charities to make 
covenant house grow 
it is now an 85 millionayear operation that manages 17 
shelters with more than 2000 beds in the united states toronto 
and latin america and directly serves about 25000 kids a year 
critics have said covenant house is too big to be properly 
supervised and so good at raising money that it squeezes out 
smaller sophisticated programs but until last week ritters 
publicity had been almost all good 
presidents reagan and bush and their first ladies visited 
covenant house attorney general edwin meese iii appointed ritter 
to his commission on pornography reagan called him an unsung 
hero 
on wednesday the manhattan district attorney confirmed he is 
investigating charges of financial improprieties by ritter charges 
made by a 20yearold former male prostitute who also reportedly 
claimed he had a sexual relationship with the 62yearold priest 
cardinal john j oconnor said sunday he has complete trust in 
ritter 
in all of our dealings and in all of his work in this 
archdiocese he has demonstrated himself to be a soul of goodness 
and of integrity oconnor said during mass at st patricks 
cathedral certainly i have been given no reason to believe that 
that goodness or integrity has been violated 
baron and others noted the vulnerability of a charitable 
organization whose image is so closely identified with that of one 
person such as ritter a master of public relations covenant house 
depends on private sources for 95 percent of its funding 
people dont always hear the not guilty what they hear is 
the accusation said baron adding if something happens to 
covenant house theres a major void in the system and there are 
just not that many beds in the city 
more than 80 percent of covenant houses funds come via a 
sophisticated directmail operation from individual donors the 
rest from corporations and foundations ritters signed carefully 
targeted letters to donors tell stories of my kids in familiar 
tones and ask for financial help 
hours after the prosecutors statement supporters showed up at 
a glitzy fundraiser wednesday night 
youve got thousands of kids depending on covenant house for a 
roof for a bed for food and were not going to diminish our 
efforts to help these kids no matter what said jack shea 
president of spiegel inc which organized the event with artist 
peter max 
patrick kennedy a covenant house vice president said donors 
have voiced concern as well as support since the allegations 
surfaced in the new york post he said the agency whose weekly 
costs average about 14 million would be able to carry on even if 
a cloud legal or perceived were to persist over ritters name 
there might be a period when even more belttightening than 
usual might go on but i doubt very seriously that the agency 
itself would be in any danger of folding simply because it has 
been functioning as long as it has kennedy said 
under an existing plan for covenant house after ritter the 
national board would choose a new chief executive officer from 
among several franciscans who will have understudied kennedy 
said the board itself would be responsible for running the agency 
district attorney robert morgenthau said the investigation was 
in its earliest stages and that covenant house was cooperating 
ritter said thursday he doesnt plan to resign or temporarily 
step aside i am so identified with covenant house i think that 
without me presently in this leadership role the work we do would 
suffer very much he said

the dollar fell slightly against the japanese yen 
today while the key index on the tokyo stock exchange closed at a 
record high for the fourth consecutive trading day 
the dollar finished trading at 14422 yen down 008 yen from 
fridays close of 14430 yen after opening at 14430 yen its high 
for the day the us currency ranged as low as 14410 yen in quiet 
trading 
dealers said trading was mixed reflecting the markets usual 
slowdown at the end of the year 
they said market attention was focused on the dollar and the 
mark today because of the dollars early volatility against the 
west german currency 
a dealer at a major japanese bank said there was some 
dollarselling by trust banks but with most participants already 
having fixed their positions in advance of the new years holidays 
he said the us currency was likely to stay in a very narrow range 
participants said prospects for an interest rate reduction by 
the us federal reserve board this week were good after fridays 
reports showed us producer prices falling 01 percent in november 
after rising 04 percent in october but said the market had 
already largely discounted the expected move 
on the stock market the nikkei stock average of 225 selected 
issues which gained 9034 points for a recordhigh closing on 
friday added another 31514 points or 082 percent to close at 
3858618 
it was the sixth consecutive advance for the nikkei index which 
has set new highs for four straight days since wednesday 
securities dealers said the index continued to soar as the 
markets enthusiasm outpaced some profittaking by cautious 
investors 
while shares rose almost across the board the rises in 
construction and petroleum shares were particularly notable 
dealers said 
dealers attributed the nikkeis continuing rise to favorable 
economic and political conditions worldwide and the strong showing 
of the futures market 
i would not be surprised if this bullish trend lasts until the 
end of the year said a dealer at a major securites company 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
volume traded on the first section of the exchange where major 
shares are listed was estimated at 850 million shares

a salvadoran couple who witnessed the massacre 
of six jesuit priests described a night of terror they blame on 
their countrys military 
the couple later recanted the account but now say that was 
because they were intimidated under questioning by fbi agents and a 
salvadoran colonel the new york times reported today us 
officials including president bush have denied there was any 
intimidation 
the story of lucia barrera de cerna and her husband jorge 
cerna and their accusations of intimidation have been widely 
reported by church and humanrights groups today a brief 
firsthand account from the couple appeared in the times 
i felt terrible terrible when i changed my version but i 
changed it out of fear mrs cerna told the paper sunday 
the slaying of the priests their housekeeper and the 
housekeepers daughter in san salvador on nov 16 came at the 
height of an offensive by leftist rebels and provoked widespread 
anger among those who immediately suspected it was the work of 
death squads allied with the military 
the cernas took their story to foreign embassies and were 
brought to miami on nov 23 to be protected and interviewed by us 
authorities 
mrs cerna said she was awakened about 1 am the night of the 
massacre by gunfire and looked outside to see five men at least 
two in camouflage fatigues carrying rifles and wearing caps with 
visors 
they looked like the soldiers i have seen on the streets the 
ones with uniforms who patrol parts of the city she told the 
newspaper 
one of the priests was speaking as the men entered their 
building she said 
then the firing increased and the father stopped speaking 
she recalled 
cerna said he saw seven or eight men wearing soldiers uniforms 
with wide suspenders and belts 
i believed at that moment that they were soldiers of the 
army he said i believed that because the whole area we were 
in was controlled by the army and because no private citizen could 
walk around with the curfew and the patrols 
the cernas said they recanted that version of events under tough 
questioning and accusations by two fbi agents and a man they later 
learned was lt col manuel antonio rivas majia head of el 
salvadors usfinanced special investigative unit 
they have been granted humanitarian parole status by us 
immigration officials and given work permits good for a year

assassinated federal judge robert s 
vance was praised upon his death for helping blacks overcome the 
onetime segregationist politics of george wallace 
vance a 58yearold judge on the atlantabased us 11th 
circuit court of appeals was killed by a mail bomb that went off 
at his home saturday afternoon his wife was seriously injured 
bob vance led the fight to integrate the state democratic 
party we are very much saddened by his death said state rep 
alvin holmes of montgomery he was a great friend to the black 
people of this state 
vance a talladega native entered the university of alabama at 
age 15 when he was a senior he was elected student body 
president he graduated from the universitys law school in 1952 
spent two years in the army and in 1955 received a masters of law 
degree from george washington university law school in washington 
he then returned to birmingham 
vance first gained statewide attention with his efforts to get 
the legislature to redraw legislative districts to reflect changes 
in population in the early 1960s 
at that time the state democratic executive committee was 
controlled by a staunchly conservative coalition of states rights 
advocates and dixiecrats loyal to thengov wallace 
vance then a young lawyer became the champion for democrats 
who were afraid that wallaces growing influence would cause a 
split with the national democratic party 
he was elected state party chairman in 1966 and won reelection 
twice during the next 11 years he soon began the political 
wrangling necessary to fully integrate the allwhite democratic 
party 
he ushered in a new era said joe reed chairman of the 
state partys black political caucus bob vance was a healer and 
a builder for the democratic party and because he lived the 
democratic party is alive today 
under vances leadership reed and mobile attorney arthur d 
shores became the first blacks from alabama to attend a national 
democratic convention the 1968 chicago convention 
at that convention when wallace vance and john cashin of the 
nowdefunct national democratic party of alabama were trying to 
seat delegates the delegates chose vances integrated group 
one of vances first moves as state party chairman was to bring 
about the removal of the white rooster a symbol of white 
supremacy with the slogan for the right from atop the partys 
election ballots 
he felt like we had to move forward out of the racial unrest 
we were in said sen howell heflin dala who met vance more 
than 30 years ago when they were young trial lawyers he believed 
we ought to approach these things not draw a line in the dust 
wallace unsuccessfully challenged vances leadership many times 
he ran someone against him every year said executive director 
al lapierre 
vance had to be very courageous to take a stand against 
wallace said holmes who was appointed with other blacks by 
vance to the partys executive committee 
vance invited blacks to his home in the exclusive birmingham 
suburb of mountain brook during the 1960s and 70s when blacks 
werent allowed out in mountain brook unless they had on a maid 
uniform holmes said 
he understood the suffering and discrimination that black 
people had endured in the state of alabama

with massachusetts economy in a tailspin and 
hundreds of workers laid off in the christmas season charities are 
seeing scores of people who never before had problems paying 
mortgages or heating bills 
there is definitely people coming in and saying i lost my 
job i havent worked in two weeks i need help said jody zeek 
of the st vincent depaul society a volunteer organization 
operating out of the areas roman catholic parishes 
i can tell almost immediately by their body language that this 
is not their cup of tea but they are desperate said herbert 
hershey a social worker for the salvation army in framingham 
theyve had good jobs but they are so desperate now they come in 
here for food and fuel 
he said his chapter has helped 60 percent more people this year 
than the year before 
massachusetts has been struggling with an anticipated 825 
million budget deficit 
last week 706 state employees received layoff notices and the 
number laid off is expected to climb to more than 1200 by the end 
of december 
the slumping economy also has hurt some of the regions large 
employers such as wang laboratories inc general motors corp and 
prime computer inc all of which have trimmed their work forces 
considerably 
marcia countie executive director of united ways of 
massachusetts which funds the salvation army and the red cross and 
other large charities said the layoffs have created a tremendous 
crisis 
in our economy today all of us live one paycheck to another 
and when that gets interrupted for families its catastrophic 
she said 
one woman a framingham resident had a computer job that paid 
her about 40000 before she was laid off now she bags groceries 
for 650 an hour trying to meet her mortgage payments hershey 
said 
my heart goes out to those who are very reluctant very 
embarrassed he said how can we help them 
a natick widow with two children in college said her job lets 
her pay one bill at a time but her paycheck doesnt allow for 
emergencies 
in november she was faced with paying for her daughters knee 
surgery the surgery led her to the salvation army seeking help to 
pay for fuel 
i felt like i had no right to this because there are so many 
people with worse problems but then i see its a very thin line at 
this point and it probably wouldnt take much to put me there 
said the woman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the woman said she had taken a parttime retail job to 
supplement her income earning 5 an hour 
in natick a former bank vice president who lost his job came to 
the salvation army for food during thanksgiving spokesman steve 
copaccia said 
these are people who never knew what the salvation army did 
they didnt need us he said now they come in for help with 
paying for their heating bill 
charity volunteers said they also have seen an increase of 
people either on welfare or with lowpaying jobs because the state 
has cut government programs serving the needy 
weve had cutbacks before but ive never seen it this bad

a family living in the shadow of 
reawakened redoubt volcano was airlifted to safer ground and 
scientists warned that the mountain could go on launching ash and 
steam for some time 
the continents most notorious volcano mount st helens in 
washington state also showed signs of life after more than three 
years of silence 
in alaska the rescue came on the fourth day of intermittent ash 
and steam eruptions from the mountain which lies in a sparsely 
populated region 115 miles southwest of anchorage 
nancy and steve jones and their 13monthold son henry were 
evacuated from tuwalaka lodge 10 miles south of the volcano by a 
private helicopter company sunday for two days ash clouds and 
poor weather had stymied efforts to reach the joneses who are 
caretakers at the lodge 
the lodge wasnt damaged and no debris landed nearby but the 
family fretted through the first days of the eruption mrs jones 
said 
it was a little bit worrisome she said were real 
thankful that the wind was blowing the other way we were worried 
the top might blow off our way and give us a bad time that way 
the joneses werent sure if they would return once the volcano 
quiets 
we really like it out there its beautiful she said 
its a perfect place to spend the winter barring the volcano 
hunks of pumice the size of softballs rained on the roof of 
another isolated dwelling the big river lake lodge but caretakers 
mike and sandy coulter decided to stay said owner dennis branham 
that lodge is 30 miles north of the redoubt 
scientists at the alaska volcano observatory relished the 
opportunity to train modern instruments on the 10197foot mountain 
they hoped to reach the peak today by helicopter for a 
firsthand look said john richter a geologist at the observatory 
by correlating ground observations with instrument readings the 
scientists hope to gather information that could help anticipate 
eruptions or determine the importance of seismic activity on the 
mountain in lake clark national park we have no baseline data to 
judge it by now richter said this is the first time were 
getting good data on it 
he said scientists have no idea how long the volcano might spew 
ash and steam it could go on for quite a while at rate we sort 
of call it a phase five a long period of moderate explosive 
activity punctuated with some larger bursts 
the mountain sunday hurled ash and steam 30000 feet in the air 
no injuries have been reported in the eruptions but plumes of 
gritty sulfurous ash have disrupted aviation in this 
planedependent state 
the anchorage international airport was open sunday but service 
remained spotty with some airlines grounding aircraft and others 
offering limited service some businesses covered sensitive 
equipment for fear ash would filter into buildings 
the skies over anchorage were clear sunday after drifting ash 
caused power outages and prompted health warnings saturday 
in washington on thursday mount st helens issued a small burst 
of steam gas and ash but scientists said an eruption did not 
appear to be imminent

the labyrinthine passages of the wilberg 
mine their rich coal seams exhausted are mostly silent now but 
the harsh lessons of the inferno that claimed 27 lives five years 
ago have not been forgotten 
it changed the industry said j brett harvey vice 
president for fuel resources at mine owner utah power amp light co 
which has instituted sweeping changes in safety and technical 
procedures 
i think government as well as mine operators look at safety 
from a new angle mostly because of the tragedy 
but for rick boyle president of united mine workers local 2176 
even the strictest precautions cant mitigate the dangers of 
twoentry longwall mining in which two passages lead to and from 
the coal seam 
utah power and other western underground mine operators insist 
the system is the only way to support the weight of the mountain 
above as massive machines cut coal from panels hundreds of feet 
long 
the union counters that as in the case of the wilberg fire 
miners could be trapped without a third way out 
on dec 19 1984 extra workers had been summoned to one section 
of the mine the fifth right more than an mile underground to make 
a run at a 24hour production record there were 28 people where 13 
or 14 usually worked for emery mining co which operated utah 
powers mines at the time 
smoke first was spotted in the roof of the main tunnel system 
near fifth rights entrance and soon began snaking along a loop of 
ventilation up one passage and down the other 
boyle a diesel mechanic working elsewhere in the mine was 
among those who aimed extinguishers and water hoses at the hot spot 
until someone on the surface ordered the power killed cutting off 
the underground pumps for nearly two hours meantime nearly 80 
people in other areas were evacuated as firefighters and rescue 
teams assembled 
kenny blake the only miner to escape fifth right has said he 
and several others donned emergency breathing devices and groped 
through the darkness and smoke toward the main tunnel finally 
separated along the way blake emerged unharmed 
most of the others died of smoke inhalation or carbon monoxide 
poisoning in the two entries one man made his way thousands of 
feet deeper into the mine until he apparently was overcome by 
carbon monoxide three bodies were found in a connecting tunnel 
partially blocked by a cavein 
that passage was not designated an escapeway and an inspector 
with the federal mine safety and health administration had issued a 
variance allowing the blockage to remain 
within three days officials worried about explosions evacuated 
the mine and left the bodies behind to be retrieved nearly a year 
later with flames visible at the surface dec 26 the wilberg was 
sealed 
in october 1986 an msha investigation concluded the fire began 
at an air compressor rigged to operate with its heat sensor and 
onoff switch disconnected and left running all but unnoticed for 
nearly 70 hours 
the umw later issued its own report bitterly denouncing the 
twoentry system the variance on the blocked tunnel and the 
failure to provide escape routes that were safely ventilated and 
the failure to protect miners from a fire that killed them 
utah power was sued by most of the victims families and 
eventually reached a 22 million outofcourt settlement the 
utility took over operation of all its coal mines in 1986 and a 
year later it and emery were fined a record 113944 for 41 alleged 
violations including nine msha said directly contributed to the 
fire 
emery paid 7115 for 17 citations but utah power contested the 
rest a hearing is scheduled for march said msha spokeswoman 
katharine snyder also scheduled are trials involving insurance 
issues and product liability 
utah power has installed computerized air and equipment 
monitoring systems and aboveground highpower water pumps and 
revised ventilation practices in all its mines its 650 employees 
also are required to undergo annual handson training with 
breathing apparatus harvey said 
msha also analyzed twoentry longwall mining and ventilation 
systems and is using the results to revise federal regulations 
snyder said 
but for his opposition to the twoentry longwall system now in 
place in all utah powers coal mines boyle commends the utilitys 
innovations and its willingness to work with the union 
everybody that works up there lost somebody in that fire that 
was a good friend or a partner he said the consequence of 
what can happen becomes a vivid reality and that changes peoples 
attitudes

china and the united states said today they have 
opened talks on resuming the fulbright scholar exchange program a 
victim of the chill in relations after chinas crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators 
chinas state education commission and the us embassy said 
their representatives met for the first time last week just days 
after us national security adviser brent scowcrofts 
fencemending visit to beijing 
neither side linked the talks to scowcrofts visit but embassy 
spokesman ed loo acknowledged there wasnt much going on 
before 
he said the united states had been seeking a renewal of the 
governmentsponsored fulbright program for some time 
china announced this fall that it was halting the program for a 
year apparently because of anger over us condemnation of its 
june army attack on students protesting for democratic reform it 
also canceled plans to accept peace corps volunteers 
in other signs of a warming between the two countries since 
scowcroft visited with undersecretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger china has indicated it is open to a negotiated 
settlement for fang lizhi the chinese dissident who took refuge in 
the us embassy 
it has also said it will allow the us government radio 
station the voice of america to send a new bureau chief to 
beijing china expelled the former bureau chief al pessin in 
june accusing him of distorting facts and violating martial law 
imposed during the protests 
reception of voa chineselanguage broadcasts also has become 
much clearer in the past week although it is not clear if the 
chinese have halted all jamming englishlanguage broadcasts have 
not been jammed 
an official in the international department of the state 
education commission who did not give his name said china has not 
yet decided if it will resume fulbright exchanges he refused to 
say if china wants to change the terms of the program 
we are talking about both sides plans and conceptions he 
said we originally halted it for a year 1989 to 1990 now we 
are talking about restoring it for 199091 
under the program which exchanges american and foreign scholars 
worldwide two dozen american scholars lecture at chinese 
universities and a dozen chinese scholars and a dozen students 
visit the united states for research and studies china has taken 
part in the fulbright program since shortly after uschinese 
relations were established in 1979 
scowcrofts visit has been criticized by some congressmen and 
commentators in the united states as coming too soon after chinas 
bloody crackdown in which hundreds of unarmed civilians were 
killed 
the bush administration had halted all highlevel visits in june 
and imposed several other sanctions including halting military 
sales 
however it vetoed legislation that would have expanded the 
sanctions and required the president to report to congress before 
lifting them the administration has argued that bushs softer 
approach and his sending of scowcroft will encourage china to 
improve its human rights performance

for most of the decade this corner of 
south texas suffered the double whammy of drought and the oil bust 
but a new drilling technology has pumped up hopes of a new boomtime 
the technology involves horizontal drilling which industry 
observers say might make billions of barrels of additional oil 
reserves economical to bring to the surface 
its like a prairie fire it will expand through our industry 
its very exciting said philip crouse who heads a consulting 
company in dallas 
the promise of the technology can be seen in the south texas 
fields which are filled with rig after rig 
oryx oryx majestic weber oryx thats nine you can 
count from right here its unbelievable said petroleum engineer 
ed riddle listing the rigs by their company name 
a quartermile away is the leta glasscock no 10 which some 
call the hottest oil well in texas it is said to have a potential 
of 5470 barrels per day 
even at its current allowable rate of 1312 barrels per day the 
well would increase daily oil production for all of zavala county 
by about twothirds over last year 
i never thought id see flow rates like this domestically for 
this i thought id have to go to the middle east said riddle 
who works for charlie winn the owner of glasscock wells no 10 and 
no 12 
this region is known as the pearsall field part of a geological 
formation that runs northeast from above laredo past austin 
characterized by numerous small oil reservoirs that run 
vertically the pearsall field enjoyed its last heyday almost a 
decade ago more recently it was considered to be played out 
but in the last few months the newly refined technique of 
horizontal drilling has hit it big again 
shallow depleted oil reservoirs are prime targets for horizontal 
drilling which was updated in recent years to become more 
efficient 
the technique involves drilling vertically for about 1000 feet 
and then placing horizontal drills into oil reservoirs it works on 
shallow reservoirs that have little subterranean pressure left 
that was a dead field now its considered the best prospect 
in the lower 48 said bill fuqua president of dallasbased basin 
resources which is investing heavily in the pearsall field 
in all of last year the texas railroad commission issued 61 
drilling permits for the field in the first 11 months of this 
year the commission issued 175 permits 
prior to april or may you could have bought all the leases in 
this county for 30 to 50 an acre all you wanted now if there 
is any open it would go as high as 300 and the only thing left 
is small tracts or town lots in dilley said frio county clerk 
mona hoyle who has leased 240 acres of her own property 
in dilley drilling rigs are working north and south of town of 
2500 residents about 70 miles south of san antonio for the first 
time leases are being sold on city lots 
even local government is getting into the game two weeks ago 
the dilley city council voted to take lease bids on the city park 
and the city airport following the example of the dilley school 
district 
crouse says this is only the beginning 
early estimates say that probably 200 wells will be drilled 
horizontally for the year but i think that is a low estimate he 
said

a suspended judge says hell fight his 
bribery and corruption convictions for seeking money from an 
employee an attorney and a bank in the course of official business 
former cambria county judge joseph k okicki said he would 
appeal saturday nights jury verdict i expect eventually the 
justice system will allow truth to prevail 
prosecutors alleged that greed motivated the 59yearold judge 
to rule like a monarch in the elegant 19th century courthouse in 
the foothills of the southern allegheny mountains 
he was convicted of bribery in asking for 500 from a court 
employee for a job promotion never given for demanding a favorable 
loan from a bank with a guardianship case before him and for asking 
an attorney for a commission after a generous award to the 
lawyers clients he also was found guilty of official oppression 
a general charge incorporating elements of the other alleged 
violations 
okicki was acquitted of open lewdness for allegedly calling two 
former secretaries into his office while wearing only his underwear 
he also was acquitted on a charge that he bribed a johnstown 
strip mining company gave an unemployed coal miner inside 
information in a moneymaking scheme and used court employees to do 
personal chores for him 
okicki could be sentenced to a maximum of 26 years in prison 
and fined 57500 a sentencing hearing has yet to be scheduled 
he will lose his job 80000 salary and pension upon 
sentencing the prosecutor said 
jurors returned the verdict after 16 hours of deliberations 
over two days following a sevenweek trial in northampton county 
court 
defense attorney richard galloway argued for a mistrial because 
one juror appeared to disagree with the others when they were asked 
to stand individually and give their verdict on each count but 
judge richard grifo denied the motion saying he hadnt heard any 
disagreement and the galloway promised to appeal 
as the jury was polled james c miller appeared to say not 
guilty three times on the six guilty counts he also apparently 
replied guilty to one of the counts of which okicki was found 
innocent 
i think theres no question the verdict is nonunanimous and 
cant stand galloway said 
reached by telephone miller said he agreed with the other 
jurors 
i absolutely did he said 
jury foreman francis a bazyk said the jurors had been unanimous 
before going into the courtroom he was just overcome by 
nervousness bazyk said of miller 
okicki faces 16 other charges in a second trial focusing on his 
private business dealings that trial hasnt been scheduled 
in his testimony during the sevenweek trial okicki said he 
was joking with attorney richard j green jr about the commission 
the judge claimed he had been persecuted by the state after he 
drew the ire of johnstown millionaire we schonek a political 
power broker and lt gov mark singels fatherinlaw 
okicki said the millionaire was angry at him for encouraging 
schoneks brother rudolph to make a stock gift worth more than 
200000 to st francis college in loretto 
schonek and singel denied any involvement with the investigation 
okicki elected to the bench in 1971 was suspended by the 
state supreme court in june 1988 and was indicted in march

military recruiters are resorting to 
fraud as they try to meet quotas and sell the armed forces to a 
shrinking pool of applicants according to a published report 
interviews with former recruiters and documents and statistics 
obtained through the freedom of information act show that 
recruiters are luring prospects with promises that cannot be kept 
the hartford courant reported sunday 
the recruiters enlisted unqualified recruits by helping them 
fake educational credentials cheat on aptitude tests and conceal 
criminal records and medical problems that could otherwise 
disqualify them the newspaper said 
overall in the 1988 fiscal year the army navy air force and 
marines investigated a total of 4128 allegations of fraudulent 
recruiting the four services substantiated 701 of the allegations 
and disciplined 992 recruiters about 7 percent of the total 
recruiting force there are slightly more than 14000 recruiters 
according to figures supplied by the services 
in addition to attracting recruits the system is supposed to 
screen applicants requiring them to pass aptitude tests and 
physical examinations and to undergo police checks 
but one in seven recruits doesnt make it through the first year 
of service and one in three never finishes the term of enlistment 
the cost to taxpayers is hundreds of millions of dollars each year 
the newspaper said 
every time we recruit somebody that doesnt make it through a 
first term and we have to replace them it costs us 18000 said 
wayne s sellman the civilian director of the pentagon office 
responsible for recruiting policy 
more than 42000 of the 294000 volunteers recruited by the 
pentagon during 1988 were discharged before the end of their first 
year using sellmans 18000 figure the cost of replacing them 
would be more than 750 million

us rep george crockett joined a small group of 
public officials endorsing decriminalization of drugs saying money 
now being spent on enforcing drug laws should be shifted to social 
programs 
federal drug czar william bennett reacted angrily to the 
suggestion saying crockett and the others are undermining the bush 
administrations antidrug efforts 
decriminalization is the only solution crockett dmich 
told the detroit news in an interview published sunday our 
courts are burdened down with these drug cases and there is nothing 
they can do about it and here we are talking about spending 
additional billions to build jails and prisons to send people to 
money spent on enforcement should be shifted to job training for 
the urban poor education health care and day care said crockett 
whose 13th district includes detroits economically depressed east 
side 
crockett said he didnt have plans to immediately introduce 
legislation decriminalizing drugs because congress would reject 
such a move 
last week us district judge robert sweet of new york became 
the first federal judge to publicly support decriminalization also 
favoring decriminalization are baltimore mayor kurt l schmoke and 
economist milton friedman 
bennett director of the office of national drug control policy 
cursed when told of crocketts position the newspaper said 
here we go we were wondering who was going to be the first 
in congress to endorse decriminalization bennett said 
giving drugs the same legal status as alcohol could cause even 
greater social and economic problems bennett said 
alcohol has done quite enough damage thank you he said 
and if you want to see people using crack go from 1 million or 
2 million to 10 million make it as available as alcohol 
us district judge james churchill chief federal judge of 
michigans eastern district said the idea at least should be 
debated 
decriminalization is not a good answer churchill said 
but it is an answer what are we going to do once we get our 
prisons full and we still have as many drug dealers on the street

for the first time in the 2yearold 
palestinian uprising police have charged journalists with entering 
an area declared closed by the military police said today 
the charges were brought against three israeli reporters joel 
greenberg of the englishlanguage jerusalem post ori nir of 
haaretz and oren cohen of hadashot 
shaul naim police prosecutor said the three would not be 
jailed during legal proceedings but could be sentenced to up to two 
years in prison if convicted of the charges he said he was 
uncertain when the trial would be held 
the charges were presented sunday before the jerusalem 
magistrates court naim said 
during the uprising soldiers have regularly blocked reporters 
from entering troubled towns or villages by declaring them closed 
military areas while reporters have been detained several times 
for entering such areas no charges had been brought 
greenberg nir and cohen were found by army troops in the west 
bank city of nablus on nov 15 1988 after the city of 120000 had 
been closed by the army 
the incident occurred on the day that the plo declared an 
independent palestinian state to prevent trouble the army put the 
entire gaza strip under curfew and declared nablus and several 
other west bank towns and villages closed areas 
the jerusalem post quoted the charge sheet as saying the 
journalists stayed for a long time inside nablus after it was 
declared a closed area although they heard at 7 am on the 
radio that the area was declared closed 
greenberg claimed at the time that the three were unaware nablus 
had been closed when they entered the city 
we didnt know it was a closed military area because we left 
early in the morning and they didnt say anything about closure the 
day before he said 
the three were detained by soldiers in alittihad hospital and 
said they had remained there for fear of endangering themselves 
after the closure order was announced 
the hebrew daily hadashot whose reporter cohen was among those 
accused said in an editorial that the police charge is just 
another and exceptionally bitter expression of the decline of our 
democracy due to pressure from the uprising

thousands of villagers in the hometown 
of drug lord gonzalo rodriguez gacha turned out for his reburial 
after security forces killed him in a shootout and interred him in 
an unmarked grave 
police units in the town of pacho 25 miles from bogota 
remained on alert near the local cemetery during sundays funeral 
and no incidents were reported 
authorities had stalked rodriguez gacha for months before 
shooting and killing him his 17yearold son freddy and five 
bodyguards friday in a gunfight near the caribbean port of covenas 
authorities used public funds to bury the seven late saturday in 
a common grave in sincelejo 320 miles north of bogota 
the bodies of father and son were claimed by family members 
after being exhumed at their request they were then flown to 
bogota in a private plane and driven to pacho 
they were placed in luxurious wooden coffins reportedly paid 
for by a brother of rodriguez gacha 
rodriguez gacha a 42yearold billionaire was the most 
celebrated son of pacho hated or loved by most of its population 
of 20000 he lavishly provided residents with money personal 
favors and jobs but demanded unquestioning cooperation in his drug 
dealings 
sucre state gov arturo martinez said on caracol radio network 
that freddys mother claimed her sons body from the common grave 
he identified her as luz dari celades reportedly one of rodriguez 
gachas mistresses 
two of rodriguez gachas brothers claimed the drug traffickers 
body martinez said he did not give their names 
the judge in charge of the burial bienvenido zuniga agreed to 
open the common grave and give family members a chance to claim the 
bodies he told the el espectador newspaper that the only request 
for the bodies prior to the burial came from a funeral home in the 
city of medellin the hub of the countrys cocaine trade he denied 
that request el espectador said 
rodriguez gacha who had set up private armies to protect both 
his cocaine business and his vast stretches of land in the country 
was initially buried in a wooden coffin at a cost of 700 in public 
funds 
with the killing president virgilio barcos government appeared 
strengthened in its antidrug offensive critics had said colombian 
cocaine chiefs were impervious to attack 
the governments success in tracking down rodriguez gacha drew 
praise from colombian newspapers which a week ago suggested barco 
had all but lost his struggle against the traffickers 
the administration has extradited 10 middlelevel traffickers to 
the united states as part of its crackdown but had failed to track 
down any of the 12 traffickers most wanted by us authorities 
then came the raid on rodriguez gachas hideout police said the 
operation by more than 1000 security force members supported by 
seven helicopters was the result of weeks of intelligence work 
enrique santos calderon a columnist for bogotas leading daily 
el tiempo wrote that until rodriguez gachas death the war 
against the drug traffickers was viewed as going from bad to 
worse 
all of this changed with the death of rodriguez santos 
wrote the invulnerable image of the cartel chiefs has been 
shattered while that of the publics force has been strengthened

innercity church and community activists are 
offering a 10000 reward for the names of gang members believed to 
have put a 5000 bounty on the head of an antidrug activist 
georgette watson a founder of the dropadime hotline for 
fielding tips on drug pushers has been under 24hour police 
protection since last week gang members also allegedly offered 
1000 to anyone wounding the mother of three 
we are extremely concerned about the threats made against the 
life of georgette watson said the rev ew jackson who joined 
about 15 church and community leaders sunday in asking citizens to 
contribute to the reward 
it shows the gangs are not the only ones who can put out 
bounties deputy police superintendent william celester said 
the community now is fighting back what the gangs have done is 
wake up a sleeping giant that is going to step on them 
celester insisted on roundtheclock protection for watson after 
detectives verified informant reports that watsons life was at 
risk through jan 1 the deadline allegedly set by gang members who 
want her dead

four million transportation workers face the 
prospect of being required to give urine samples on short notice as 
random drug testing begins today 
in some cases computers are selecting pilots flight attendants 
and other employees to be tested rules in the airline industry 
take effect first with maritime railroad trucking transit and 
pipeline companies to follow over the next several weeks 
some airlines indicate they will delay random testing until 
early next year but others say employees could be subject to 
unannounced tests beginning today for marijuana cocaine opiates 
amphetamines and phencyclidine also known as pcp 
transportation secretary samuel skinner who is considering the 
addition of testing for alcohol has said he expects the drug tests 
to uncover alarming drug use by people responsible for 
travelers safety 
if the results that weve received with the military over the 
last five years are any indication well be able to reduce drug 
usage if in fact it occurs as much as 80 percent skinner said 
today on abctvs good morning america program 
he said the military began random drug testing five years ago 
and usage was about 10 percent across the board in the military 
and its down now to less than 2 percent 
but employee groups noting that 25000 random tests on 
transportation department employees resulted in a minuscule number 
of positive results about 05 percent say the random testing is 
a waste of time and money and an intrusion the rules also require 
preemployment postaccident reasonable cause and periodic tests 
we expect full compliance even though we still very much 
disagree with the concept of random testing said john mazor 
spokesman for the 40000member air line pilots association which 
has filed one of more than 20 lawsuits against the new rules 
the federal aviation administration denied a pilots petition to 
delay implementation of the testing a federal court in san 
francisco refused a move for an injunction but has not yet ruled on 
the testing 
skinner said government enforcers will not be out in the initial 
stages of the testing but all transportation companies are 
expected to set up programs companies with fewer than 50 employees 
have an extra year to comply 
testing in aviation will include pilots flight engineers 
flight navigators aircraft dispatchers mechanics repairmen 
flight attendants aviation security screeners ground security 
coordinators controllers and ground instructors private and 
corporate pilots are not included although pilots who fly 
commercial crop dusting planes tow banners or conduct training 
flights are 
transportation department officials eventually expect half of 
the work force in safetyrelated transportation jobs to be tested 
each year 
testing rules for mariners truckers and transit workers go 
into effect on thursday for railroad employees on jan 16 and for 
pipeline workers on april 20 
congress also is considering whether to enact legislation 
requiring drug and alcohol testing for transportation workers but 
the department is starting the program without legislation 
the national transportation safety board earlier this month 
criticized the departments postaccident testing rules calling 
for uniform rules for all types of transportation the board said 
the testing should also cover alcohol and require both urine and 
blood tests within four hours after any accident or serious 
incident 
department rules require that tests be performed by outside 
laboratories certified by the department of health and human 
services and that companies follow stringent procedures for 
collecting urine samples and preventing access to them prior to 
testing 
samples are tested twice those that test positive in an initial 
screening are scanned with what the department calls a virtually 
errorfree gas chromotography and mass spectrometry confirmatory 
test 
positive results are sent to a medical review officer who must 
discuss the results with the employee to determine whether there 
might be a legitimate explanation for the result 
jeff kriendler spokesman for pan american said the airline 
would begin the drug testing program today at all of its us 
stations employees in safetyrelated jobs as well as their 
supervisors would be included he said 
trans world airlines jim faulkner said about 17000 of twas 
31000 employees would be subjected to possible random testing to 
begin jan 15 under an faa waiver 
david messing of continental said random testing would begin 
jan 1 
uniteds sara dornacker said testing of pilots is to begin jan 
2 and other employees jan 12 
jim lundy spokesman for delta said the airlines testing plan 
was sent back by the faa for some minor adjustments and is awaiting 
final approval

parliament today debated on a wideranging 
package to transform the staterun economy to a market system 
taking up first the government budget that cuts off public 
subsidies for most goods and services 
the deputies in the sejm the lower house of parliament met for 
12 hours sunday and returned to work this morning with a further 
session planned tuesday and possibly wednesday 
the reform package proposed by the solidarityled government 
will be the most radical economic reform ever attempted in the east 
bloc and massive unemployment and steep price increases are 
initially expected as state subsidies to industry end forcing 
unprofitable enterprises to close 
summing up the first phase of debate the official pap news 
agency commented concern voiced in each of over 100 questions 
asked the government can be boiled down to one question how will 
individual citizens families social and professional groups and 
economic units survive the period of changes 
the warsaw pact country whose people led the way in forcing an 
end to four decades of communist domination now faces the daunting 
task of rebuilding a wrecked economy from the ground up 
finance minister leszek balcerowicz announced the program to a 
special sunday session of the sejm asking that it be approved in 
time to be implemented jan 1 
he said poland must leave behind a system based on 
19thcentury doctrines and embrace one based on market 
mechanisms where skills knowledge able hands talent and 
willingness to work all count 
balcerowicz who is also deputy prime minister said the new 
course would open new perspectives of proper living free 
development and fruitful and satisfying work 
it will be the biggest test of public support to date for a 
government formed in september after solidaritybacked candidates 
trounced communists in spring elections 
the plan backed by solidarity leader lech walesa is expected 
to meet some opposition from communist lawmakers and some in the 
solidarity bloc whose industrial worker constituency will be hard 
hit 
with prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki the east blocs first 
noncommunist head of government somberly looking on balcerowicz 
outlined a virtual dismantling 45 years of marxistleninist 
economic policy 
the plan includes 
instantly balancing the deficitridden state budget through 
strict austerity 
cutting off most state subsidies to businesses and 
institutions including the communist party 
freeing prices 
limiting wage increases 
turning the zloty into a convertible currency probably in 
january or february 
attacking monopolies and beginning an orderly selloff of state 
industries to the private sector probably in phases next year 
reforming the banking and tax systems 
establishing a social safety net for the poor and jobless 
whose ranks are expected to swell as a result of the new measures 
referring to the drop in output and inflation of 900 percent 
that have rocked the polish economy this year balcerowicz conceded 
poland is launching its reform in extremely unfavorable 
conditions 
the program meets requirements laid down by the international 
monetary fund which demanded fundamental reforms before it would 
authorize any loans to poland 
imf head michel camdessus has said a letter of intent for a 700 
million standby loan agreement with poland will be signed in the 
near future 
that in turn will open the way to up to 35 billion in 
additional loans and liberal rescheduling of polands 40 billion 
foreign debt by western nations which have lined up in recent 
months to back poland in its turn toward democracy 
public support of mazowieckis government has allowed him to ask 
the public to make public sacrifices that would have provoked 
massive unrest under the communists 
under the plan subsidies for goods and services which last 
year ate up 31 percent of public spending will be reduced to 14 
percent subsidies will remain at lower levels in only a few 
areas for housing public transport coal bread and lowfat milk 
and cheese 
price increases in the range of 25 percent to 50 percent a month 
are expected in the first stage of the program as enterprises lose 
their subsidies and raise prices to survive 
coal and energy prices alone are expected to up to sevenfold and 
enough companies will be forced to cease operating that the economy 
of this country of 38 million people may face an army of 400000 
unemployed officials have said 
the price increases and the limits on government spending and 
wage increases will cut real incomes by 20 percent next year with 
a projected 5 percent decrease in industrial output and a 2 percent 
to 3 percent dropoff in the gross national product 
but the governmentinduced recession should squeeze inflation 
down to a few percent a month by mid1990 planners say 
all the vested interests are against the plan foreign 
trade minister marcin swiecicki one of four communists in the 
government said after balcerowiczs speech but it will get 
through 
in one provision that strikes at the old power structure 
political and social organizations like the communist party which 
previously got billions of zlotys from the state treasury will no 
longer receive public funds and will be forced to rely on their 
supporters and enterprise to raise money 
but the most sensitive aspect of the program is whether the 
public at large already struggling after a decade of inflation 
lack of consumer goods stagnant growth and failed reform programs 
can survive a new bout of price increases coupled with the new 
threat of poverty and joblessless 
the finance minister emphasized that the government would be 
providing inflationindexed aid to the weakest members of society 
retirees the disabled lowincome families and displaced workers 
nobody should feel his existence is endangered balcerowicz 
said

east german communists and opposition 
factions today resumed talks on the nations future over the din of 
hundreds of protesters who banged on windows and demanded a part in 
the negotiations 
the forum brought together various political parties social 
organizations and fledgling prodemocracy movements into a council 
of more than 40 that is to advise the interim government until free 
elections in may 
after two hours of debate participants decided to allow five 
more groups including the official trade union federation to take 
part in the talks and granted observer status to four more 
the negotiators agreed to meet each monday to propose 
legislation and proposed that future discussions be carried live on 
television and radio 
hundreds of angry demonstrators disrupted the first hour of the 
session using bullhorns to shout their demands to be included and 
banging on windows of the groundfloor conference room of the 
lutheran church building where the talks were held 
anyone who tries to force his participation in this way is not 
acting in the interests of democracy president manfred gerlach 
said as the noise overwhelmed speakers 
the participants proposed a message of solidarity to premier 
hans modrow and west german chancellor helmut kohl who meet 
tuesday in dresden 
they said the germangerman summit expresses the will of both 
nations to improve relations but they warned against any moves 
that would damage the sovereignty of either state a call to leave 
the reunification issue off the agenda 
the meeting comes a day after the communist party concluded an 
emergency congress in which it embraced a multiparty system and 
changed its name to the socialist unity party of germanyparty of 
democratic socialism 
the long title reflects both a new orientation to democratic 
principles and an eagerness to divorce itself from the corruption 
and power abuses that tainted former communist leaders ousted in a 
prodemocracy movement that began in september 
new communist party leader gregor gysi and wolfgang berghofer 
his chief deputy opened the talks dec 7 
at that session may 6 was set as the date for the firstever 
competitive elections to seat a new parliament kicking off a 
volatile campaign season likely to result in a minority role for 
the communists 
the talks have spurred the discredited communists to consult 
with their broadening opposition on how to run the country until 
elections are held 
in his address sunday to the congress final session gysi set 
out a new course for the party that breaks with four decades of 
stalinism 
nearly 2700 delegates unanimously approved the draft of a new 
statute to serve as the party rulebook until its next regular 
congress as well as the outlines of a new program 
the communists were stripped of their constitutional mandate to 
rule during a parliamentary session dec 1 it reduced their status 
to that of any other political force though the premier and much 
of his cabinet are communist 
when a new parliament is seated after elections it in turn will 
name a new government 
the communists polled only 12 percent support in a public 
opinion survey conducted by major west german pollsters in early 
december and modrow himself has predicted his party could win no 
more than 20 percent of the vote if elections were held now 
two other political conventions were held over the weekend by 
the small christian democratic union of east germany that is aiming 
to win votes from the religious population and by the opposition 
group democratic awakening 
despite the communists opposition to reunification the theme 
has taken hold among some political groups 
delegates at the founding party congress of democratic awakening 
in leipzig voted 35035 with 21 abstentions that the right of 
german unity should be inscribed in the east german constitution 
the christian democratic unions leader lothar de maiziere 
told delegates he could envisage a single german state within a 
united europe

the european communitys executive body 
today said turkey should not be allowed to join the trading bloc in 
the near future saying it must improve its economy and human 
rights record 
it is impossible to begin immediate membership 
negotiations with turkey said abel matutes the ecs 
commissioner for mediterranean policy negotiations could not begin 
before 1993 he added 
but the commission recommended strengthening cooperation between 
the 12nation trade bloc and turkey in the next few years to pave 
the way for eventual membership 
the ecs executive body has been considering the economic and 
political implications of turkish membership since ankara 
officially applied to join the community on april 14 1987 
under ec rules the commission must give its opinion on 
membership applications but a final decision is up to the 12 
member states governments and the european parliament at any 
rate no new members can join until 1993 when the ec should have a 
single market 
austria is the only other country to have made an official 
membership request 
matutes said todays decision did not question the principle 
of turkeys eligibility for membership of the community sometime 
in the future 
he said the commission reached its decision after an exhaustive 
survey of turkeys economic and political situation undertaken 
with the help of the turkish government 
he said the commission had also looked at the effects of turkish 
membership in the context of developments within the ec which is 
working to abolish its internal barriers to the free movement of 
trade services capital and people by the end of 1992 the 
socalled single market 
between now and 1993 we must concentrate all our efforts on 
achieving the single market matutes said 
although the turkish economy had made really remarkable and 
encouraging progress there are still disparities and problems 
which we cannot ignore he said 
the commissioner said that on average turkish economic 
development was only onethird of the ec average 
unemployment is high social security is low and is far 
from the norms current in the community inflation remains a sharp 
problem he said 
although turkey is a parliamentary democracy matutes said 
there are still areas notably in the trade unions sector human 
rights and respect for minorities where progress is 
necessary 
turkey was under military rule from 1980 to 1983 
in addition to the human rights and trade unions problems 
matutes said the commission was concerned about turkeys 
relationship with greece 
the two mediterranean neighbors have long been at odds over 
cyprus and mineral rights in the aegean sea they almost went to 
war over the latter issue in early 1987 
greece said it would oppose turkish membership in the trading 
bloc for as long as turkey maintained 30000 troops on cyprus 
turkey invaded cyprus in 1974 saying it had to protect the 
islands turkish cypriot minority after a coup by progreek 
elements

communist party chief karel 
urbanek said his party probably will try to form a coalition with 
other parties before free elections planned next year an official 
newspaper reported today 
the state news agency ctk said foreign minister jiri dienstbier 
would begin negotiations in moscow on the possible withdrawal from 
czechoslovakia of about 80000 soviet troops the soldiers were 
installed here after the sovietled invasion that crushed a 1968 
reform movement 
and the communist party daily rude pravo today printed an 
extraordinary frontpage apology to all those who were hurt by 
its articles in the past 
previous articles that attacked vaclav havel alexander dubcek 
and other proponents of democracy did not reflect positions of 
the majority of the papers editors said the newspapers new 
editor zdenek porybny 
on sunday about 100000 marchers in prague commemorated the 
onemonth anniversary of their peaceful revolution which has 
toppled hardline communist leaders and has forced the communists 
to surrender their monopoly on power open borders and promise free 
elections 
the marchers also chanted their support for the election of 
havel as president 
urbanek was quoted in rude pravo as saying the party must renew 
itself to survive and be open to a possible coalition with other 
leftist parties 
it is more than probable already now that the communist party 
should go into the free elections in a coalition with other 
leftist parties which already exist as well as those to be 
established in the future he said 
officials have said free elections could be held in june or 
july they would be the nations first in 43 years 
urbanek did not specify which parties the communists might try 
to work with but he likely meant the socialist and peoples 
parties which have traditionally been allied with the communists 
but have recently exerted more independence 
a main item on the agenda of an extraordinary party congress 
later this week is to use the richness of ideas from 1968 
while cleansing the party on all levels urbanek said 
premier marian calfa and dienstbier are scheduled to visit 
moscow on wednesday to discuss the withdrawal of soviet troops and 
closer economic cooperation between prague and the kremlin 
government spokesman marcel jansen said 
the visit was at the invitation of soviet premier nikolai 
ryzhkov jansen said 
a meeting between soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
and dienstbier also is possible ministry spokesman vlastimil samek 
said 
dienstbier and other czechoslovak officials say the agreement 
allowing soviet troops to stay after crushing the 1968 prague 
spring reforms was made under pressure however government 
officials say any troop cuts should run parallel with superpower 
disarmament talks in vienna 
the latest communists to be purged from the party in the 
shakeup were slovak communist party boss ignac janak and six other 
officials whose memberships were suspended sunday during a slovak 
party congress in bratislava 
janak was expelled from the czechoslovak communist partys 
politburo last week 
sunday was the anniversary of the nov 17 police crackdown on 
peaceful student protesters in the capital that proved the spark 
for the popular revolt that has forced an end to 41 years of 
communist domination 
havel a playwright and former political prisoner has emerged 
as the main contender for the presidency 
the november crackdown galvanized czechoslovaks who began 
pouring into the streets by the hundreds of thousands to demand an 
end to authoritarian oneparty rule 
mass protests brought the resignation of hardline leaders 
including president gustav husak and lead to the creation of the 
countrys first noncommunist government since 1948 
participants in sundays march carried candles and held banners 
that proclaimed havel for president they chanted long live 
havel 
the students retraced the threemile path of the nov 17 
protest walking up to pragues vysehrad cemetery and cathedral and 
winding through pragues historic streets for a rally at wenceslas 
square 
the marchers paused for a moment of silence and to light candles 
at the site of the violent police charges against them in november 
the flagwaving marchers were greeted with cheers and applause 
by bystanders 
we are just so grateful to the students for what they did to 
bring about this change said an elderly woman who asked not to 
be identified its such a terrible shame that our generation was 
not able to do the same thing 
havel in a televised speech saturday night said we are all 
grateful to the students for having given the revolution its 
beautiful dignified peaceful and affectionate face that is 
now admired by the whole world 
under an agreement worked out last week between the communists 
and the opposition parliament will elect a president who is not 
affiliated with any party and is a czech 
that appeared to clear the way for the candidacy of havel 
dubcek leader of the crushed prague spring reforms also 
has been mentioned as a presidential candidate

scientists looking into ways of boosting 
milk production have discovered the sweet smell of success in anise 
oil 
dairy cows got along better when sprayed with the 
licoricescented fragrance and when cows feel at ease they give 
more milk say researchers keith cummins and lawrence myers of 
auburn university 
most people seem to find a little bit of humor in it 
cummins said last week i try to emphasize that this has a 
serious application but it makes me smile too 
cummins said dairy cows must be regrouped every two to four 
weeks to maximize production and feed efficiency forcing the 
animals to reestablish their pecking order that results in 
biting pushing and shoving cows become nervous and upset and 
milk production drops 
the loss for a 500cow dairy could amount to 500 to 700 pounds 
of milk a month or more cummins said at 14 per 100 pounds it 
adds up he added 
anise spray reduces aggression among cows cummins said as the 
smell wears off usually about the third day the pecking order 
is already being established 
does that mean cows like perfume 
it wasnt because the sprayed cows smelled good cummins 
said what we did was make it so the cows couldnt tell one from 
the other 
cummins said research in animal behavior is becoming more 
important because of the animal rights issue 
intensive farming methods are being challenged as to whether 
they are humane or not he said so we have to do more research 
to make these cows as happy and contented as possible

japanese and soviet negotiators trying to draft a 
treaty to formally end their world war ii hostilities wound up 
talks today with absolutely no new points of contact a foreign 
ministry official said 
although both governments have expressed a desire to improve 
their chilly relations the japanese official said neither was 
willing to compromise on a territorial dispute over several islands 
in the southern kurile chain held by the soviets since the end of 
the war in 1945 
there were absolutely no new points of contact said the 
official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity he said 
the soviet delegation called soviet possession of the islands a 
postwar reality and urged japan to assume a stance that 
recognizes the results of the war 
japan however renewed its claim to what it calls the 
northern territories a group of small islands off hokkaido 
japans northernmost main island 
the official said the soviet delegation proposed the exchange of 
draft treaties but that japan refused because of reservations 
regarding the validity of such drafts while the territorial 
dispute continues 
soviet deputy foreign minister igor rogachev head of the soviet 
delegation was scheduled to continue talks with his japanese 
counterpart hisashi owada on a less formal level tuesday the 
official said 
rogachev completing a tour of five asian nations is scheduled 
to fly back to moscow wednesday 
the apparent failure of the talks comes less than two weeks 
after prime minister toshiki kaifu prompted by rapid changes in 
eastern europe and the recent mood of eastwest detente called for 
a new era in bilateral relations 
exchanges between the two nations have recently increased and 
along with a scheduled visit of foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze next march soviet president mikhail gorbachev is 
expected to visit japan in 1991 if he does he will be the first 
soviet president to do so 
foreign ministry officials said their expectations for any new 
developments were low going into the talks but room for compromise 
had been indicated earlier by politburo member alexander yakovlev 
a close adviser to gorbachev who during a visit to tokyo last month 
spoke of a possibility of a third route toward improved 
relations 
however no progress toward opening up a new path was made in 
todays talks the official said adding that both countries 
continue to have a different approach 
what the japanese call the territorial problem we call the 
definition of borders he quoted a soviet official as saying 
he said most of the sevenhour talks dealt with the soviet claim 
to historical and legal jurisdiction over the islands which they 
say have belonged to russia since the late 18th century and were 
defined as soviet territory by the yalta conference in 1945 and the 
san francisco peace treaty of 1951 
japan disputes those claims countering that the islands have 
been an integral part of its territory since ancient times tokyo 
also claims a treaty signed in 1855 and a treaty ending the 
russojapanese war in 1905 give japan rightful ownership

a judge today overruled police 
investigators and ordered the release of a former policeman 
detained in the assassination of two white leftwing activists 
police had opposed the release of calla botha saying there was 
evidence linking him to a rightwing group responsible for 
political assassinations 
johannesburg supreme court justice jc kriegler granted an 
application filed by bothas father a retired police colonel 
seeking release of his son kriegler said there was insufficient 
evidence connecting botha to death squads 
botha was detained without charge on nov 30 as part of an 
investigation into the assassinations of david webster a 
university lecturer and human rights activist and anton lubowski 
the only white officeholder in namibias main independence 
movement the southwest africa peoples organization 
both were shot outside their homes webster in johannesburg on 
may 1 and lubowski in windhoek namibia on sept 12 
in a court affidavit last week police brig floris mostert 
described botha as the handler for donald acheson who is held 
in windhoek awaiting trial for lubowksis murder 
another former policeman ferdinand barnard remains detained in 
johannesburg in the case mostert said botha and barnard were held 
briefly in june after they were uncovered monitoring the movements 
of one of websters activist colleagues 
police say the websterlubowski case is not directly related to 
investigations of claims that death squads within the ranks of the 
national police force killed government opponents on the orders of 
highranking officers 
one black expoliceman has pleaded guilty to committing a murder 
as part of such a death squad and a white former captain dirk 
coetzee fled abroad after telling a newspaper he commanded a death 
squad 
in other developments today 
police headquarters reported five more deaths in factional 
fighting in black townships around the port city of durban 
authorities say more than 100 people have been killed in the area 
this month in violence related to a threeyear feud throughout 
natal province between inkatha a relatively conservative zulu 
political organization and supporters of militant antiapartheid 
groups 
police freed four black activists who staged a threeweek 
hunger strike after they were detained without charge while leading 
an unauthorized protest in alexandra an impoverished black 
township near johannesburg 
obed bapela a spokesman for the antiapartheid alexandra civic 
organization said the four had suspended their fast friday after 
police informed them they would soon be freed

conservative fernando collor de mello 
held a slim lead over his socialist adversary in brazils first 
popular presidential election since 1960 according to partial 
returns today 
sundays runoff was seen as a referendum on two decades of rapid 
but unequal growth that has brought 1500 percent annual inflation 
sinking real wages and corruption and the third worlds biggest 
foreign debt 110 billion 
voters could choose between two kinds of reform to attack the 
problems collor de mellos freemarket policies or the platform 
of luis inacio lula da silva that includes redistribution of land 
and wealth reform in education and health care and a moratorium on 
brazils foreign debt 
the supreme electoral court had collor de mello leading da silva 
by 1 percentage point after counting 338 percent of the returns 
globo tv the nations largest network had collor de mello 
ahead by 29 million votes or 49 percent of the total with 857 
percent of the votes counted in an unofficial tally 
the network which used its computers to tally the returns from 
individual states today projected collor de mello as the winner 
electoral court spokesman irineu tamanini said collor de mellos 
lead was expected to grow as returns came in from the candidates 
strongholds in remote central and northern regions the official 
count was slower because state returns were doublechecked to avoid 
error 
officials said the final tally would not be ready until 
wednesday 
brazilians went to the polls on a jubilant peaceful election 
day in a historic vote hailed as a huge step toward the return of 
civilian rule after a rightist military regime ruled from 1964 to 
1985 
many waved banners honked horns and sported tshirts and 
buttons favoring one or the other candidate for the fiveyear 
presidential term 
brazil with 150 million people is the worlds thirdmost 
populous democracy after india and the united states brazil has 
82 million registered voters but turnout was reported lower than 
expected in some regions 
two exit polls predicted collor de mello an athletic 
40yearold former governor from a wealthy and powerful political 
clan would win by between 3 percent and 4 percent 
one survey by the brazilian institute of public opinion and 
statistics the countrys biggest private polling company gave 
collor de mello 52 percent of the vote and da silva 48 percent 
a second exit poll by the respected datafolha polling 
institute gave collor de mello 515 percent of the electorate it 
forecast 485 percent for da silva a bearded gravelvoiced labor 
leader who grew up in poverty 
the surveys buoyed officials of the collor de mello camp 
we are not celebrating yet but we are relieved because the 
polls are confirming our expectations of victory claudio 
humberto rosa e silva spokesman for collor de mellos rightist 
national reconstruction party said sunday 
officials of the 44yearold da silvas workers party said it 
was too early to concede defeat 
collor de mello a former governor of alagoas who advocates 
freemarket policies and battling corruption in government is 
backed by brazils business military and media establishments 
the coalition behind da silva called the brazil popular front 
includes marxists unionists top singers soap opera stars former 
leftist guerillas and the dominant liberal wing of brazils 
powerful roman catholic church 
the new president is to replace lameduck president jose sarney 
on march 15 however there is growing sentiment for sarney to 
resign before then two of sarneys cabinet ministers said sunday 
the presidentelect should take office soon to save brazils ailing 
economy 
heavy rains in central northeastern and far southern brazil 
reduced voter turnout on sunday 
a number of voters wrote personal messages to the candidates on 
the ballots which nullified their votes 
one voter in belem capital of the northern amazon state of 
para wrote on a ballot please do something to help the young 
people in brazil who are taking drugs 
collor de mello and da silva were the top votegetters in a 
field of 21 candidates in firstround balloting nov 15 neither 
obtained a majority needed to win and the two went to a runoff 
election 
the last popularly elected president of brazil was janio 
quadros he resigned in 1961 after seven months in office citing 
occult forces a rightwing military regime overthrew quadros

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze told belgian officials today that the soviet union 
wants to establish close economic ties with western europe and 
switch to a market economy 
shevardnadze is on the first day of a twoday visit to brussels 
where he will sign a new trade and economic cooperation agreement 
with the 12nation european community trading bloc 
he also will make an unprecedented visit to nato military 
headquarters underscoring the rapidly changing eastwest climate 
i never said integration of the soviet economy with the west 
would be easy but we are taking the first step laying the first 
stone shevardnadze said in reference to the trade agreement 
negotiated with the ec 
shevardnadze who met briefly with reporters after talks with 
foreign minister mark eyskens of belgium was asked about soviet 
promises to withdraw all its troops from eastern europe by the 
start of the next century 
we must find a reciprocal solution he said im thinking 
of the us presence we must have serious negotiations we have 
a mutual interest in stability in europe 
eyskens said after meeting with shevardnadze that the soviets 
want to break with their past 
they have concluded that the centrally planned economy is no 
good he said 
shevardnaze met with prime minister wilfried martens and was to 
sign a trade and economic cooperation agreement at european 
community headquarters 
on tuesday shevardnaze will meet with nato secretary general 
manfred woerner and the ambassadors of the 16 nato nations at the 
headquarters of the western alliance 
community and soviet negotiators concluded a trade and economic 
accord nov 27 that provides for a gradual lifting of import quotas 
on soviet industrial goods and cites a dozen areas in which the two 
sides may establish economic cooperation 
these include science and technology banking transport 
agriculture environmental protection energy raw materials and 
mining 
the accord excludes trade in goods that are considered 
militarily sensitive according to ec sources 
the pact is the fourth between the community and an east 
european country since the ec and the moscowled comecon trade 
group signed a mutual recognition accord june 25 1988 comecon 
stands for council for mutual and economic assistance 
the ec has also concluded trade and economic cooperation accords 
with hungary poland and czechoslovakia 
these accords plus the ones the european communitys executive 
commission is currently negotiating with bulgaria and east germany 
are bound to dramatically boost economic relations between 
eastern and western europe 
the mutual recognition agreement the community signed with the 
10nation comecon group in 1988 ended a 30yearperiod in which 
moscow and its allies routinely viewed it as an extension of the 
nato alliance 
moscows partners in comecon are east germany poland 
czechoslovakia hungary bulgaria romania vietnam mongolia and 
cuba 
speaking to reporters after a twoday nato foreign ministers 
meeting woerner sought to dispel any notion he and shevardnaze 
would engage in indepth negotiations on tuesday 
he and other officials stressed the meeting would be on the 
order of a courtesy call 
woerner said he and shevardnaze would simply discuss matters 
of common interest this is a first contact we will have an 
exchange of views 
even so foreign secretary douglas hurd of braitain described 
the visit to nato as a symbol of whats been happening in east 
west relations

flames from 23110 candles illuminated 
snowy antietam battlefield flickering in a holiday tribute to each 
soldier killed wounded or missing on the bloodiest day of the 
civil war 
the candles burning inside sandfilled brown paper bags 
emitted faint light at dusk sunday when darkness fell a trumpeter 
played taps and 2826 automobiles began a slow procession through 
45 miles of the battlefield of rolling hills 70 miles west of 
baltimore 
you actually had a sense of beings spirits john gress a 
waynesboro pa retiree said in one place someone placed a 
candle so somehow it glistened on a tree covered with ice it was 
unbelievable 
more men were killed or wounded at antietam on sept 17 1862 
than on any other single day in american military history union 
casualties were 12410 and confederate 10700 
its a memorial and christmas is the season of lights we just 
thought it would be a good time to stop and reflect said richard 
rambur superintendent of the national battlefield 
when you were placing the candles youd wonder who might have 
fallen on the spot where you were putting one said dan weiss of 
sharpsburg one of an estimated 400 volunteers who distributed and 
lit the candles 
it took at least 30 minutes to drive through the park to see the 
candles glowing under a starless sky four cannons black 
silhouettes against the sky were embraced by the lights many 
standing in rows like the headstones at arlington national cemetery 
neither side gained a decisive victory in the battle of 
antietam which was the climax of the first of gen robert e lees 
two attempts to carry the war into the north the battle also gave 
president lincoln an opportunity to issue the emancipation 
proclamation which freed the slaves in 1863 
i was a medical officer in vietnam where the american casualty 
count was in the mid50000 range and that was over a long period 
of time national park service director james m ridenour said 
when you stand here and realize 23000plus within eyesight in 
one day its breathtaking 
the rev richard hembrock a lutheran minister in sharpsburg 
said people will be able to see how more than 23000 candles 
relate to lives out here it will be a chance to reflect what we 
fought for and what we believe in

premier ante markovic today proposed 
a new convertible currency unit in yugoslavia as part of a sweeping 
reform plan to save the communist nation from its worst economic 
crisis 
about 160000 workers staged a halfhour warning strike in 
the republic of montenegro today to pressure the government into 
adopting urgent measures to contain hyperinflation hovering at 
2000 percent 
the strike coincided with the start of a threeday parliament 
meeting at which markovic unveiled his proposals 
a solution to the problems is not possible without a 
completely new economic and political system that would ensure 
economic efficiency and political democracy with full freedoms and 
human rights markovic said 
markovic said one new convertible dinar would be worth 
10000 old dinars yugoslavs should from now on be able to freely 
purchase foreign currencies with dinars in local banks he said 
the exchange rate would be fixed at seven dinars for one west 
german mark and remain unchanged until june 30 1990 markovic said 
until now the dinar rate was adjusted daily compared to foreign 
currencies and has lost value rapidly as inflation has soared 
one us dollar would be worth 12 new dinars instead of the 
current 120000 dinars markovic said 
the dinar was pegged to the west german mark because of its 
greatest stability on world money markets markovic said 
he specified the changeover would take place jan 1 1990 if 
parliament approves the package 
markovics government which took over in march has threatened 
to resign if the plan is rejected 
legislators have moved quickly to introduce market mechanisms as 
a way out of yugoslavias economic crisis which includes a 17 
billion foreign debt and 17 percent inflation 
yugoslavias last reevaluation of the dinar occurred in 1965 
at todays meeting markovic also announced tight monetary and 
budgetary controls free formation of interest rates which in the 
past have been set by the countrys national bank and government 
control of prices on electricity gasoline rail transport rents 
postal services and medicines 
the central bank would for the first time become fully 
autonomous in conducting monetary policies in accordance with 
market mechanisms and will no longer be allowed to print money in 
order to cover state deficits markovic said 
the government also proposed to parliament changes in the 
countrys criminal code including dropping the socalled verbal 
offenses under which thousands of people have been prosecuted for 
privately or publicly criticizing the communist regime 
the state tanjug news agency said the last warning to the 
government was staged in the underdeveloped republic because its 
policy has brought a large part of montenegros population to the 
edge of famine and social misery 
similar strikes were expected to take place in the countrys 
largest republic of serbia on wednesday and in the poorest region 
macedonia on thursday 
the staterun trade union of montenegro reportedly said in a 
proclamation that unless markovic introduces urgent measures to 
raise living standards a much longer general strike will ensue

human rights champion andrei d sakharov was 
buried today in the cold earth of the russia he tried so hard to 
change mourned by tens of thousands of countrymen and praised by 
the leadership that once reviled him 
its over sakharovs wife and dissident comradeinarms 
yelena bonner said as she turned to a companion during the 
twilight burial in a moscow cemetery 
before sakharovs crimson and blacktrimmed coffin was lowered 
into the ground at vostryakovskoye cemetery its cover was removed 
to allow bonner to bid a final farewell she removed the shroud 
from his face and bent to kiss him on the forehead 
sakharov who died thursday of an apparent heart attack at the 
age of 68 he was buried alongside bonners mother ruth a 
stalinera political prisoner who died in 1987 at age 87 
top party brass riding sleek black limousines and tens of 
thousands of common people trudging through the slush joined in 
paying their last respects to the nobel laureate 
president mikhail s gorbachev and other ruling politburo 
members stood in icy morning rain to view the body outside the 
academy of sciences to which sakharov a creator of the soviet 
hydrogen bomb belonged gorbachev spoke at length with bonner 
now it is clear that he deserved the nobel prize gorbachev 
told reporters sakharov was denied permission to travel to norway 
to accept the 1975 prize for his human rights campaign he was 
hounded for years and finally banished into internal exile by past 
soviet leaders 
some marchers carried protest signs demanding democratic 
elections echoing the final cause of sakharov before he died last 
week others hoisted the blueredwhite flag of czarist russia now 
the symbol of the grassroots prodemocracy russian peoples front 
more than 8000 grieving soviets followed sakharovs body 
transported in an openended bus that also carried bonner along 
lenin prospekt to outdoor funeral ceremonies at luzhniki sports 
complex the southern moscow facility is a favorite site for 
rallies by human rights activists 
in the kremlin the 2250member soviet congress to which 
sakharov belonged adjourned at midday so its members could attend 
the ceremony 
staterun television showed excerpts of the service in a special 
broadcast of the kind usually reserved for the deaths of major 
government figures 
at the outdoor service the crowd surged dangerously forward 
toward sakharovs coffin and bonner had to plead for order the 
coffin was then transported nine miles in a bus along slushfilled 
streets to the cemetery 
in the afternoon tens of thousands of mourners gathered at the 
luzhniki stadium parking lot for a memorial service 
sakharov did all he could said ilya zaslavsky a moscow 
member of the soviet congress now only his ideas can change 
things and only we can fulfill his ideas 
other parliamentarians pledged to heed sakharovs call to create 
a fullfledged opposition in the congress and to push for victory 
for progressives in local elections 
the best wreath for andrei dmitrievich sakharov is to win over 
conservatives in the march elections said economist and deputy 
gavriil popov 
lech walesa the leader of polands solidarity movement and 
winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize had been expected to attend 
the funeral but polands official pap news agency reported that 
his plane had to land in leningrad because of bad weather 
gorbachev and other top soviet officials including politburo 
members premier nikolai i ryzhkov vitaly i vorotnikov alexander 
n yakovlev and vadim a medvedev arrived at the academy of 
sciences building in moscow in the morning to view sakharovs body 
from another direction buses escorted by police cars arrived 
some 20 people bore a closed casket on their shoulders from a bus 
and placed it on a platform in front of the academy bonner also 
emerged accompanied by her son alexei semenov 
the coffin was opened in the frigid rain and an umbrella opened 
to shield sakharovs face 
gorbachev walked to the foot of the casket and stood for awhile 
in silence he then nodded and the huddle of people around the 
casket broke up 
sakharovs body was placed back on the bus and taken to the 
lebedev physics institute where sakharov worked 
his only wish was for the state to have a human face 
academician yevgeny l feynberg said of his fellow physicist as 
colleagues at the institute filed past the casket 
outside the academy of sciences gorbachev and bonner spoke 
animatedly with bonner smiling at one point gorbachev and his 
entourage entered the academy building to sign an official book of 
condolences the soviet leader simply wrote ms gorbachev 
he emerged and talked briefly with repoters the relations 
between myself and sakharov were always those of mutual respect 
gorbachev said now it is clear that he deserved the nobel 
prize 
it was gorbachev who allowed sakharov to return to moscow in 
december 1986 after nearly seven years of internal exile in the 
city of gorky the two men had clashed however over the speed and 
sweep of gorbachevs political reform program with sakharov 
demanding the communist party that gorbachev heads renounce its 
constitutional monopoly on power 
moscow news an organ of the official press which once branded 
sakharov an utterly ignorant person took the rare step sunday 
of publishing a special edition devoted to the activist 
it included a text of sakharovs last public remarks a speech 
he delivered hours before his death in which he said the soviet 
hierarchy was leading the country to a catastrophe

has helped ceausescu the longestserving soviet bloc leader to 
silence virtually all dissent

president bush today called the weekend 
slaying of an american officer in panama an enormous outrage 
and said he is reviewing a range of options in response he 
pointedly did not rule out military action 
i think a president all presidents have options but they 
dont discuss what they might be bush said he repeated the 
answer when asked if military action was among the options 
available 
he said the us failure to drive gen manuel antonio noriega 
from power in panama was an enormous frustration of his first 
year in office 
the president made his comments in an oval office interview with 
reporters from the associated press and three other news agencies 
his remarks followed the shooting saturday night of a us military 
officer who was in a car with other americans trying to flee a 
crowd of panamanian troopers and civilians 
bushs voice was raspy showing signs of the laryngitis that 
forced him to cancel a speechmaking trip to new york last friday 
on other topics the president 
defended anew his decision to send two top aides to china to 
rekindle relations for the first time since the bloody suppression 
of prodemocracy demonstrators last june he said he does not know 
when chinese dissident fang lizhi would be able to leave the us 
embassy in beijing where he has taken refuge since the crackdown 
said the administration is undertaking a massive 
reevaluation of intentions as well as military threat by the 
soviet bloc in light of the radical political changes sweeping 
eastern europe 
said as far as im concerned his 1988 campaign pledge 
against new taxes still stands 
shrugged off a published report that colombian drug lords have 
placed a 30 million price on his head there is nothing to it 
he said and added he was confident the secret service could protect 
him when he attends a regional drug summit in colombia on feb 15 
the administration was quick to blame noriega for the weekend 
violence in panama white house spokesman marlin fitzwater today 
condemned a climate of aggression there and said noriega seems 
to have granted a license for harassment against americans 
in the interview bush said of the fatal shooting of the 
american officer its an enormous outrage and a matter of 
enormous concern to this president 
he also defended his decision to send the highlevel delegation 
to china 10 days ago even though chinese leaders remain 
unrepentant about the massacre of prodemocracy students 
speaking of his gesture he said i dont think its a 
salute to the hardline leaders i beijing he spoke of it as a 
decision to end the isolation of a country of more than 1 billion 
people 
bush said the criticism of his move was not a good rap but 
that a president has to be willing to take a little heat from 
time to time it hasnt been that much 
on another foreign policy front the president said that signs 
of moderation in iran after the death this year of ayatollah 
ruhollah khomeini have not been backed up by concrete action 
bush said he feels a personal frustration that the american 
hostages in lebanon remain in captivity adding its on my mind 
an awful lot he said he wrote a personal note recently to the 
relatives of the hostages 
fielding a question on the domestic agenda the president 
renewed his pledge against any new taxes asked if the vow he took 
for 1989 would remain in effect next year he said as far as im 
concerned it is 
bush appeared unswayed by arguments in congress that the massive 
political changes in the soviet union and eastern europe should 
translate into big spending cuts for the pentagon 
i will not take any naive unilateral action and i am 
determined to move forward on a sensible program of evaluation and 
a sensible program of arms reduction which includes conventional 
forces he said 
bush said he and gorbachev should push ahead on a range of arms 
control steps including chemical weapons and conventional forces 
in europe 
so lets go forward with our eyes open and do that bush 
said and i think thats exactly what mr gorbachev wants to do 
in an opening statement the president said he and gorbachev 
both want to wrap up a treaty before their scheduled summit in june 
1990 to cut strategic nuclear weapons arsenals nearly in half 
he also pledged that the united states would take an active 
and appropriate role in encouraging democratic changes in eastern 
europe 
on his overture to china bush refused to say whether he won any 
concession from beijing in return for the united states taking the 
first step to renew contact 
im not going to discuss what i did or didnt get he 
said you see i still believe that sometimes to affect change you 
talk in confidence 
defending his decision to go first bush said you do what you 
think is correct if you screw something up you say hey i was 
wrong if youre right you dont get instant credit for it so 
you just try to do your best

the prechristmas travel rush caused long lines 
and delays at heathrow airport where security has been tightened 
in the last six weeks an airport spokeswoman said monday 
the operators of heathrow and six other british airports 
appealed to passengers to leave christmas gifts unwrapped minimize 
electronic items they pack and limit themselves to one piece of 
hand baggage to speed up security checks 
there was a lot of congestion this morning due to heavy 
christmas traffic the heathrow spokeswoman said speaking 
anonymously in keeping with british custom 
more than 250000 passengers passed through heathrow the 
worlds busiest international airport during the weekend she said 
tighter security measures ordered by the transport department in 
october did not contribute to the delays of up to two hours for 
checkins she said 
however some travel agents were issuing airplane tickets 
stamped with the warning to check in early in view of the 
increased security precautions at british airports 
those measures include the hiring of 350 additional security 
staff and stricter checks on airport staff with access to aircraft 
the heathrow spokeswoman said the tightened security was not 
related to fridays warning by the us state department about a 
possible terrorist attack on a us target in western europe or 
west africa 
heathrow is spending 8 million to upgrade security following 
the bombing of pan am flight 103 one year ago thursday the flight 
originated in frankfurt but baggage and passengers were 
transferred to a larger plane during a stop at heathrow all 259 
people on board died and 11 people on the ground in lockerbie 
scotland were killed by the falling wreckage 
staff are aware that the spotlight will be on us this week and 
everyone is anxious that there should be no slipups said one 
pan am worker at heathrow requesting anonymity 
transport secretary cecil parkinson described airport security 
as satisfactory for the perceived level of threat he said 
airports are more secure now than a year ago particularly for us 
aircraft which are regarded as a higher risk than ours 
heathrows managing director alan proctor said particular 
attention will be given to the examination of electronic goods 
including radios computers cameras and battery powered equipment 
and this will take longer 
the bomb that brought down flight 103 was made of plastic 
explosives concealed in a radiocassette player 
to avoid queues and congestion at security checkpoints i urge 
all departing passengers to help us to help them by traveling with 
a minimum of electronic items and hand baggage this christmas 
proctor said

nelson mandelas talks with 
government officials are not a bid by the jailed black leader to 
open powersharing negotiations singlehandedly a church leader 
said monday after visiting mandela 
the rev frank chikane general secretary of the south african 
council of churches said he conferred with mandela for three hours 
at the victor verster prison farm near cape town 
one of the topics chikane said were the meetings between 
mandela and government leaders including last weeks unprecedented 
talks with president fw de klerk 
there has been press speculation but no firm corroboration 
that some members and supporters of mandelas african national 
congress guerrilla movement are worried the 71yearold prisoner is 
opening talks with the government before it meets the ancs 
preconditions these preconditions include release of all political 
prisoners lifting of the state of emergency and removing a ban on 
the anc 
chikane said mandela emphasized that he was not negotiating 
with the government but merely trying to act as a facilitator to 
create conditions conducive for meaningful negotiations 
chikane said mandela looked very well he was vibrant alert 
and applied his mind carefully on every matter we discussed 
mandela the most popular leader among south africas black 
majority has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence 
for plotting an antigovernment sabotage campaign virtually all 
prominent black leaders have said they will not enter negotiations 
until he is freed and there is strong speculation he will be 
released next month 
de klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution in five 
years that would extend political rights to blacks he says he 
wont accept a oneperson onevote system and wants whites to 
maintain a veto power over major policy decisions

government security officers said monday they 
are increasingly worried that violence will break out at detention 
centers filled with vietnamese protesting their forced repatriation 
the daily demonstrations which started when 51 people were sent 
back to vietnam on dec 12 continued monday with thousands of 
vietnamese marching and staging sitins at three detention centers 
in this british colony 
the protests have been peaceful although prison officers were 
threatened sunday by vietnamese wielding homemade weapons at one 
camp 
junior officers of the corrections services department which 
runs the camps said they feared for their lives because of the 
growing numbers of weapons being uncovered the governmentrun 
radio reported 
they also said the demonstrations increased worries the weapons 
would be used against prison officers and urged the government to 
fill hundreds of staff vacancies to increase security 
robert van leeuwen the head of the local office of the united 
nations high commissioner for refugees said he did not believe the 
forced repatriation would greatly deter more vietnamese from 
sailing to hong kong from their communist homeland 
about 56000 vietnamese are languishing in camps in hong kong 
about 12000 who arrived before june 1988 are considered refugees 
eligible for resettlement abroad the rest arrived after a new 
screening program took effect and face repatriation to vietnam 
unless they can prove they fled persecution 
van leeuwen has said forced repatriation is premature and 
efforts should concentrate on the unmonitored program of sending 
home vietnamese who volunteer to go back

the bush administration said today that 
panamanian gen manuel antonio noriegas declaration of war seems 
to have become a license for harassment against americans 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater citing the weekend 
killing of a us officer in panama and other incidents of 
violence condemned a climate of aggression that is very 
disturbing 
and president bush in an interview today with reporters from 
the associated press and three other news agencies called the 
slaying an enormous outrage 
bush said he is reviewing a range of options in response and 
pointedly did not rule out military action 
i think a president all presidents have options but they 
dont discuss what they might be bush said he repeated the 
answer when asked if military action was among the options 
available 
the defense department said four american servicemen were trying 
to flee a crowd of panamanian troopers and civilians saturday night 
when the panamanian soldiers opened fire fatally wounding one 
american 
another us officers ankle was grazed with a bullet the 
statement said the americans were traveling in a private car and 
were offduty and unarmed it added 
the weekend violence came after noriega had himself installed as 
the countrys supreme ruler on friday and declared his country in a 
state of war with the united states 
we are monitoring the situation there on a continung basis 
but we are very concerned that the declaration of war that was 
stated may have been a license for harassment and threats and in 
this case murder fitzwater said 
other members of the us military were detained their 
weapons and radios taken away from them after questioning and then 
released the attack on the naval officers wife certainly goes 
beyond any previous experience and the murder is outrageous in 
itself fitzwater said 
the defense department said a navy lieutenant and his wife had 
been stopped at the same roadblock as the four servicemen 
panamanian soldiers blindfolded the navy officer and his wife and 
took them to a different location where they were interrogated for 
about four hours the department said 
during the interrogation the navy officer was repeatedly beaten 
and kicked in the groin the statement said his wife was slammed 
against a wall and sexually threatened it said 
fitzwater defended his characterization of the slaying as 
murder saying the us officer was unarmed and he was 
killed 
he said most us dependents have left the country or have been 
moved onto the us military base there a 950 pm curfew had 
been imposed over the weekend on us military personnel and the 
base put on a high state of alert 
theres no question that its a dangerous situation 
fitzwater said 
earlier deputy white house press secretary roman popadiuk said 
the noriega regime is isolated both domestically and 
internationally and has been using force and intimidation to thwart 
the will of the panamanian people acts such as those of last 
evening are the consequence of such a regime 
defense secretary dick cheney met sunday with senior officials 
at the pentagon and issued a statement afterward saying weve 
seen general noriega brutalize the people of panama crack down on 
his own civilians and military alike after the last coup attempt 
designate himself the leader of the country and declare a state of 
war with the united states 
these actions have created an atmosphere in which panamanian 
defense forces feel free to fire on unarmed americans we fully 
expect that those responsible will be brought to justice cheney 
said 
ultimately it is general noriega himself who has encouraged 
this kind of lawlessness his own conduct sets an example of 
cruelty and brutality the lack of discipline and control in the 
panamanian defense forces is further evidence that panama is a 
country without a government cheney said 
the names of americans involved in the panamanian violence were 
withheld pending notification of relatives 
the panamanian defense forces charged that the servicemen had 
fired several shots at noriegas military headquarters wounding 
three panamanians including a soldier and an infant 
noriega who is wanted in the united states on drug trafficking 
charges was declared panamas chief of government friday by a 
rubberstamp legislature which declared panama in a state of 
war with the united states 
the united states has imposed severe economic sanctions on 
panama in a bid to force the ouster of noriega it recently 
announced it is banning panamanianflag commercial vessels from 
entering us ports

jewish leaders from across the soviet union 
gathered monday for the first major conference since lenins time 
to create a national council and formally renew ties with the 
global jewish community 
as the conference opened about 60 jeering members of the 
russian nationalist pamyat society demonstrated across the street 
from the cinema center and jostled delegates as they attempted to 
enter the hall they waved signs saying zionists out of the 
ussr and jews get out of the union police stood by but 
did nothing to break up the demonstrators who dispersed after about 
an hour witnesses said 
the threeday meeting organized by more than 160 jewish 
organizations in 75 cities marked the first time since 1920 that 
jewish leaders were allowed to congregate openly to establish a 
national organization 
the countrys biggest jewish group the jewish bund was founded 
by jewish socialists in 1897 but disbanded in 1920 
jewish emigres deputies from the soviet parliament and about 
150 jewish leaders from the west were among the 650 people at the 
conference in the stateowned cinema center in central moscow 
i never thought i would be back in the soviet union or see 
jews meeting in the center of moscow in an official hall to create 
the first national jewish body said shmuel azarkh who emigrated 
in 1981 and lives in israel 
azarkh an aide to former dissident natan sharansky who was 
denied a soviet visa in israel to attend the conference said 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms have helped improve life 
for soviet jews but have not gone far enough 
when the leader of perestroika does not permit the visa it 
means the country is still far from real democracy he said 
but he added this kind of conference will lead the way for 
the beginning of a new jewish community which was destroyed 70 
years ago 
leonid shkolnik a member of the congress of peoples deputies 
and a former editor in chief of the jewish newspaper birobidzhan 
stern said the conference was an important milestone for the 
countrys estimated 2 million jews 
he said the conference with one stated goal of uniting soviet 
jews and firmly establishing their roots was long overdue 
shkolnik was one of 200 deputies who at the first congress of 
peoples deputies session last summer signed a letter to gorbachev 
demanding that antisemitism be put on the agenda of the congress 
so far he said there has been no reply 
grigory kanovich another national congress deputy said the 
demonstration outside the hall was deplorable but that hidden 
antisemitism was worse 
pamyat is not dangerous anonymous antisemitism is 
dangerous he said those who dont declare they are 
antisemites cannot be counted and cannot be controlled 
conference officials said they expect to adopt a resolution 
naming representatives to international jewish groups such as the 
world jewish congress 
antisemitism emigration and the development of jewish culture 
are on the agenda 
this conference will give a new push to jewish life in the 
ussr kanovich said it will let them realize their jewish 
roots 
among the delegates were two members of a group of 15 who have 
begun a weeklong hunger strike to press demands that israel issue 
them invitations so they can emigrate 
igor torick said he had been waiting more than a year for an 
invitation necessary before soviets can apply for an exit visa 
he said it was the right of every jew to return to his 
motherland anytime for his group he said no invitations were 
being issued they are refusing us our rights of life and 
return he said

at christmas it was a great movie but did people really want to 
say merry christmas lets go see the family get slaughtered 
others see the season differently 
paul mazursky whose enemies a love story has been touted 
as the movie to watch at oscar time says his interpretation of an 
isaac bashevis singer story about holocaust survivors in coney 
island was planned for a christmas release from the outset 
you cant expect movies like enemies to open like back to 
the future he said but its having very emotional responses 
and theres no reason it wont be popular 
enemies isnt the only christmas film with a 
holocaustrelated theme triumph of the spirit in which willem 
dafoe survives auschwitz by boxing to entertain his nazi 
tormentors has opened to plaudits and music box starring 
jessica lange as an attorney who defends her father against war 
crimes allegations opens in selected theaters on christmas day 
with wide distribution in january 
you find there is a much more mature audience going to films 
now than three or four years ago said irwin winkler who 
produced music box they dont want to see breakfast club 
or all those teenage movies i dont know why thats 
happening but im grateful 
there is a limited range of lighter fare available films like 
were no angels starring robert diniro and sean penn 
masquerading as priests and back to the future ii a 
continuation of michael j foxs fantasy adventure for kids young 
and old theres all dogs go to heaven the little mermaid 
and wizard 
hovering over all christmas releases is the specter of oscar 
many films are platformed this time of year meaning they are 
released briefly in a few theaters for oscar consideration 
if you look at the history of films that got nominated many 
of them came out at christmas said winkler who points to his 
own raging bull as an example 
one very tough movie that made it at christmas was the 
oscarwinning vietnam war saga platoon the same 
producingdirecting team of alex kitman ho and oliver stone brings 
us this seasons born on the fourth of july possibly the 
toughest movie of this year tom cruise stars as a decorated 
veteran who lost the use of his legs and came home to lead the 
antivietnam war movement as well as the crusade for veterans 
rights 
ho said a newly grownup audience helps such films succeed 
the babyboom generation has matured they are the core 
audience said ho citing the success of field of dreams and 
dead poets society as a harbinger of the changing american 
appetite for films 
serious movies do very well with the baby boomers they have 
grown up and they have more time to go to the movies 
even satires such as war of the roses and shedevil have 
a hard edge this season they are black comedies about bitter 
divorce and revenge 
perhaps the hardest sell of any christmas movie was driving 
miss daisy the adaptation of a pulitzer prizewinning play with 
jessica tandy as a jewish southern matron and morgan freeman as her 
black chauffeur 
nobody wanted to make this movie said lili zanuck who 
produced it with her husband richard we were turned down by 
everybody even warner bros which eventually took it on turned 
it down twice she said 
early reviews were positive and the national board of review a 
15member organization of the nations leading film critics named 
it best film of 1989 
glory the story of the first platoon of black civil war 
soldiers is being released on a limited basis with a larger run 
planned in january 
audiences now are more inclined to spend their time in a 
theater thinking rather than watching bubble gum movies said its 
producer freddie fields they are more sophisticated and theyre 
getting their fill of fluff you can only have so many cupcakes 
before you dont want another cupcake

police today removed a suspected bomb delivered 
to the 11th us circuit court of appeals building two days after 
a package bomb killed one of the courts judges at his home in 
alabama authorities said 
there could be a significant connection between the two 
packages said jim holland postal inspector at birmingham ala 
where authorities are investigating the blast saturday that killed 
judge robert s vance 
two flakjacketed police officers removed a package in a bomb 
disposal container from the court building today employees were 
evacuated from the building and sent home for the day 
maj ww holley said the device appeared to be a pipe bomb and 
was discovered during a random sample of the morning mail the 
package measured about 10 inches by 10 inches by 4 inches and was 
wrapped in brown paper he said 
in birmingham fbi agent allen whitaker said agents and postal 
inspectors were sent to atlanta because of the apparent 
similarity between the devices 
whitaker said the atlanta package was addressed to someone in 
the court system he would not give the name or say where the 
package was postmarked 
this is a fastbreaking lead he added 
the 11th circuit which has 12 judges plus six in 
semiretirement hears cases from florida georgia and alabama 
vance worked in birmingham 
federal judges around the country had been advised after vances 
death not to open packages received in the mail until they could be 
inspected 
the fbi said it was giving top priority to finding out who 
mailed the bomb that killed vance the third federal judge to be 
assassinated in 10 years the three are believed to be the only 
federal jurists killed this century 
fbi agents said the search for vances killer was aided by a 
hospital bed interview sunday with his wife helen who was listed 
today in serious but stable condition with wounds suffered in the 
explosion at his home in birminghams most exclusive suburb 
vance 58 who fought for racial moderation and progressive 
stands in alabama during 11 years as state chairman of the 
democratic party was killed instantly when the package shoe 
boxsize and wrapped in brown paper blew up police said 
authorities said vance had received no threats on his life 
before the explosion and hadnt requested protection 
on speculation of a possible connection to drug cases vance may 
have handled fbi spokesman tom moore said sunday it is not 
being ruled out but it is no more prominent than several other 
avenues we are following we are reviewing his full caseload 
the head of the federal drug enforcement administration office 
in miami discounted any link between the bombing and drug cartels 
its pretty farfetched if someone says its drug connected 
said tom cash 
vance was appointed to the federal appeals court in 1977 
as a member of the 11th circuit court of appeals they heard 
many appeal cases related to drugs from miami said sen howell 
heflin dala a longtime friend of vance theres speculation 
in that regard but nobody knows 
authorities said the 11th circuit caseload was varied although 
most cases were drug related vance took several controversial 
stances including 
in 1985 he told an attorney seeking to block the deportations 
of about 1500 cuban refugees that the government can keep the 
detainees in the atlanta pen until they die 
later that year he was on a panel that cleared the way for 
prosecution of ku klux klansmen in a bloody 1979 confrontation with 
black civil rights marchers in decatur 
but investigators said the attack might have been unrelated to 
his work in the nearby suburb of hoover about six pipe bombs were 
left in mailboxes of residents during the past year the new york 
times reported today citing unidentified fbi officials only one 
of the bombs detonated injuring the person thought to have planted 
it but authorities said they could have been lethal according to 
the newspaper 
one recipient chriss doss was a former associate of vance in 
the alabama democratic party the times said 
within 24 hours of vances death william m dempsey a 
spokesman for the us marshals service in washington said 
marshals around the country were notified by wire to contact each 
of the 1500 federal judges or magistrates in their jurisdiction 
moore said all members of the federal judiciary may request 
special security 
us district judge marvin shoob of atlanta said marshals 
advised him not to open packages unless he knew who was sending 
them he said they called later and advised him not to open any 
packages at all 
we all think this isnt going to happen to us when it does 
you realize everyone is exposed he said 
whitaker said all 50plus fbi agents in the area were involved 
in the case which was called the bureaus most important 
investigation 
mrs vance spoke with investigators and provided information 
that will be helpful whitaker said 
the bomb caused substantial damage to the kitchen area moore 
said indications are that it was delivered by regular us 
mail not special delivery moore added 
the two other federal judges slain were us district judge 
richard daronco 56 who was shot and killed at his suburban new 
york home in may 1988 and us district judge john h wood jr 
63 who was killed by a sniper outside his home in san antonio 
texas in 1979 
both assassinations were connected to cases the judges handled 
moore said mrs vance who received lacerations and internal 
injuries from the explosion and other members of her family are 
being guarded the couple married 36 years had two sons robert 
s jr a birmingham lawyer and charles a medical student and 
phd candidate in psychology at duke university

the us forest service will try using 
goats instead of herbicides to control vegetation in the ouachita 
national forest 
fifty billy goats will graze on 20 acres in the first year of 
the fouryear project on the north side of the blue ouachita 
mountain near the north fork of the ouachita river the goats will 
graze annually from april to october 
using goats has the connotation of being a little bit weird 
and offthewall idea said jerry ingersoll forester for the 
jessieville ranger district and its certainly got some risk 
involved we dont know whether or not it will work really 
among the unknown factors he said is whether the goats will 
eat only the hardwoods and leave the pines 
ingersoll is part of a forest service team that will oversee the 
project a joint effort with the american institute for goat 
research at langston university in oklahoma 
dogs will protect the goats all castrated adults from 
predators and an electric fence will keep them within the area

fernando collor de mello a young 
and wealthy state governor reared in a tradition of bloody 
political feuds ran for the national presidency on a platform of 
christian reform and clean government 
he was born aug 12 1949 into a powerful clan in alagoas a 
poor northeastern coastal state dominated by sugar barons and known 
for violent politics 
his father arnon de mello who served as governor and senator 
shot and killed a colleague in 1963 during a dispute on the senate 
floor his grandfather lindolfo collor was labor minister under 
dictator getulio vargas who ruled from the 1930s until the early 
1950s 
collor de mellow spent his childhood in rio de janeiro then the 
family moved to brasilia the new inland capital where he became 
city karate champion in 1969 
later he returned to alagoas to run the familys gazeta media 
group which includes a newspaper a television station three 
radio stations and a publishing house 
in 1975 he married rio heiress and socialite lilibeth monteiro 
de carvalho with whom he had two children they divorced and in 
1984 he married rosane malta from another wealthy alagoas family 
his political career began in the 1970s when he joined the 
arena party of the military regime that governed brazil from 1964 
to 1985 
largely because of his fathers connections collor de mello was 
appointed mayor of maceio capital of alagoas state in 1979 he 
was elected to congress three years later for the social democratic 
party the new name taken by arena 
he surprised party colleagues in 1984 by supporting a 
constitutional amendment for direct presidential elections after 
millions of brazilians demonstrated in favor of it the amendment 
lost 
collor de mello backed the military partys candidate for 
president paulo maluf in 1985 maluf lost to opposition candidate 
tancredo neves who died before taking office and vice president 
elect jose sarney became president 
in 1986 collor de mello switched to sarneys brazilian 
democratic movement party and was elected governor of alagoas he 
split with sarney last year quit the party and began his run for 
president after forming the national reconstruction party 
to describe himself collor de mello uses the terms christian 
reformer and ideologically left of center opponents call him 
the new face of the right and a testtube candidate 
manufactured by conservative media interests 
conservatives were attracted by collor de mellos probusiness 
ideas but he also captured the mass imagination 
while serving as governor he gained national attention by 
refusing to pay the high salaries of an elite group of civil 
servants popularly known as maharajahs although they seldom 
showed up for duty some had been collecting 10000 a month by 
holding two or three government jobs at once 
his decision struck a chord with brazilians most of whom were 
earned the equivalent of about 25 a week 
the cleangovernment crusade was the heart collor de mellos 
presidential campaign he also was a fierce critic of sarney whom 
many brazilians blame for corruption in high places and annual 
inflation of 1500 percent 
at one point collor de mello called sarney a corrupt 
secondrate politician 
as a candidate he made crowdpleasing promises to sell the 
limousines of high officials and brasilia mansions of government 
ministers and to close the feared national intelligence service 
on many issues however collor de mello was vague 
he described brazils 110 billion foreign debt largest in the 
third world is unpayable but said he would merely limit annual 
payments to foreign banks not stop them 
collor de mello said one way to bring the debt under control was 
to withdraw government guarantees on loans for staterun companies 
and state governments 
i dont intend to welsh or declare a moratorium he said 
i want to play within the rules withdrawing federal guarantees 
will send a signal to creditors that will promote a broad 
renegotiation 
critics say collor de mellos record belies his claims of 
fighting corruption 
as governor he made a settlement considered overly generous in 
a tax dispute with alagoas sugar barons and appointed thousands of 
people to state jobs just before resigning to run for president 
the justice ministry ordered federal police to investigate no 
progress in the case had been reported by election day

a record number of endangered whooping 
cranes 146 have made the 2500mile annual journey from canada to 
the national wildlife refuge 
yes we are ecstatic refuge manager brent giezentanner said 
recently 
the 5foot birds with snowwhite plumes flocked from wood 
buffalo national park in alberta canada to the austwell refuge 
along the texas coast last years flock consisted of 138 cranes 
the whooping crane population has increased almost tenfold since 
a low point in 1941 when 14 birds and two chicks were spotted on 
refuge land since then the population has slowly increased 
bird watchers and biologists credit public awareness and 
protection of natural habitats in canada and texas with helping to 
nurture the flock 
president franklin d roosevelt authorized creations of the 
aransas national wildlife refuge in 1936 when it was discovered 
only 14 adult cranes and four chicks were left in the species it 
also was discovered then that the texas peninsula covered with 
blackjack oaks was the birds only known winter feeding area

president bush scoffed monday at a published 
report that colombian drug lords are putting up 30 million to have 
him killed saying it wont keep him from attending a drug summit 
in colombia in february 
i wish they would bring the source in so we could take a look 
at it bush told reporters during a yearend interview theres 
nothing to it 
newsweek magazine in its dec 25 issue quotes an unidentified 
state department official as saying intelligence reports found the 
drug cartels tried to recruit mideast terrorists to kill the 
president 
ive got total confidence in our security people bush said 
im not going to do anything reckless weve got outstanding 
secret service people and let me take this opportunity to reassure 
the american people we will not unduly risk anyones life here 
as the questioning continued bush retorted 
nobody has to go but me im the only one thats invited so 
where do you get this we stuff 
a reporter asked if bush will be responsible if anyone is hurt 
many people including reporters and photographers travel with the 
president 
bush suggested that perhaps stringers local reporters who work 
parttime for outoftown media outlets should substitute for the 
white house press on the trip 
people are also concerned about you and they think theres no 
such thing as a guarantee in this life the reporter persisted 
but you cant walk out to the drug store with that approach 
said bush im not going to live in a cocoon 
reminded that there had been 250 bombings in colombia in three 
months the president said 
youre trying to send a message that we want to support the 
president of colombia virgilio barco he is a brave man he is 
fighting our fight for us as well as for his own people and i dont 
want to sent a timorous signal to him 
i have responsibilities not to do anything imprudent regarding 
the presidency and i will fulfill those but i also have 
responsibilities to try to support a courageous person who has 
risked a great deal to fight a fight in which we all have 
tremendous interest

after two decades of virulent 
attacks on dissidents and reformers the communist partys daily 
newspaper apologized monday to all those who were hurt on its 
pages 
over the past years our paper printed a number of stories 
which our editors cannot be proud of rude pravos new editor 
zdenek porybny wrote in a commentary 
he admitted that serious political debate was abandoned in 
favor of personal attacks and the scandalization of people whose 
opinions differed from those of the communist leadership 
the newspaper tried to discredit alexander dubcek the leader of 
the failed prague spring reforms of 1968 and former dissident 
vaclav havel now a leading presidential candidate 
stories like stool pigeon who is vaclav havel dubceks 
journey from tragedy to farce and others did not express the 
true attitudes of most of the papers editors according to the 
commentary 
in july rude pravo accused dubcek of naive blindness and 
of being a figure whose words were full of megalomania 
one frequent tactic by the newspaper was to imply that its 
targets had fascist links 
in one of its articles rude pravo recounted that a ballroom in 
central prague built by havels family was used by the nazis during 
the occupation in world war ii 
an apology to all those who were hurt on the pages of rude 
pravo is appropriate and on the behalf of the papers editors and 
myself i am doing just that porybny said 
porybny replaced zdenek horeni as editorinchief of the paper 
in a leadership reshuffle that followed a month of sweeping 
political change 
it is just one of several changes in czechoslovakias 
statecontrolled media a new editor has taken charge of the state 
news agency ctk former government spokesman miroslav pavel has 
moved to head state tv and a new editorinchief also has been 
appointed at state radio 
czechoslovakias opposition has forced an end to communist 
domination in the government and the reforms have swept through the 
media which now criticize the mistakes of the previous hardline 
communist leadership 
but a statement issued monday by rude pravo editors fired after 
the 1968 prague spring reforms said the changes are not enough 
as long as the paper does not say goodbye to people whose 
names have become symbols of an ignorant policy of force stupidity 
and total professional failure and as long as the paper is not 
credible it will do more harm than good to progressive forces in 
the communist party the statement concluded 
pavel who has overseen drastic changes at that have brought 
longbanned artists and exiled politicians and others back onto the 
tv screen after 20 years said last week he is also fighting 
demands for even more change particularly in the news department 
sources at state tv say its reporters are seeking the 
resignation of at least eight editors deemed to have been too 
active in pushing the old policies in the past

a moderate earthquake struck the 
hollister area monday but no damage or injuries were reported 
the quake at 907 am measured 41 on the richter scale and 
was centered in an area 13 miles southsoutheast of hollister the 
us geological survey in menlo park said 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in the strength of the shaking thus a reading of 75 reflects an 
earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 65 
on oct 17 a major quake measuring 71 on the richter scale 
struck northern california killing 67 people injuring about 3000 
and causing 7 billion in damage 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage

conservatives on monday tried to roll back 
political reform with an attempt to restore the communist partys 
100 guaranteed seats in the congress of peoples deputies 
the congress legislative arm the supreme soviet voted several 
months ago to remove a section of the constitution allocating 
onethird of the 2250 congressional seats to certain social 
organizations including the communist party and the young 
communist league known as the komsomol instead all deputies 
would have to face public election in a territorial district 
the constitutional change must be confirmed by the full 
congress however and that is where representatives of the 
organizations fought to keep their privileged position 
if the reform wins final approval president mikhail s 
gorbachev would have to run in his first election campaign in 1994 
if he wants to retain the presidency when his current fiveyear 
term expires 
he would have to run only in one local district like british 
prime minister margaret thatcher because the congress elects the 
president from among its members 
although a vote was taken on the issue monday many deputies 
were confused and they wound up sending the issue back to 
committee overnight some deputies apparently thought the 1740 to 
98 decision meant social organizations would lose their seats 
while other deputies thought it meant just the opposite 
the decision will affect both the national congress and the 
parliaments of the republics most republics chose direct 
territorial elections but byelorussia and kazakhstan already have 
begun nominations from social organizations 
deputy anatoly sobchak said the system of electing deputies from 
social organizations violated the most important principle of 
election rights the principle of one man one vote 
under this system for example a female communist scientist 
could vote for deputies representing the communist party the 
academy of sciences the national womens society and the district 
where she lives 
many deputies representing such organizations took the 
microphone to argue the system should remain in place many claimed 
it was necessary to guarantee representation of invalids the red 
cross and other relief organizations they did not mention that the 
primary beneficiary of the system is the communist party 
an exasperated sobchak responded dont make our country the 
laughingstock of the world i fear that if we take this decison 
arguing that it will help invalids then people will begin to call 
us an invalid state 
deputy ilya zaslavsky who walks with a cane and was elected on 
a program of invalids rights argued that many organizations were 
not even on the list guaranteed representation in the congress 
therefore he argued all organizations should compete for seats 
in territorialbased elections

the minnesota supreme court has agreed to 
hear the appeal of a landlord accused of discrimination for denying 
housing to an unmarried couple 
as i see it this is one of the most important first amendment 
issues in the country said james anderson attorney for landlord 
layle french 
anderson argues that some forms of discrimination are good 
im very encouraged by the supreme court agreeing to hear the 
case anderson said monday 
french 33 was fined 1048 in june by an administrative law 
judge who decided he violated the states antidiscrimination law 
when he reneged on an agreement he made in february 1988 to rent 
his house in marshall to sue parsons 
parsons had said she intended to live in the house with her 
fiance and french later decided that would be against his 
religion the couple now are married 
french is a member of the marshall evangelical free church an 
independent christian church 
the state court of appeals rejected frenchs appeal anderson 
said the appeals court panel ruled that the states compelling 
interest to eliminate discrimination was enough to override 
frenchs religious belief 
the court of appeals didnt go far enough anderson said 
you have to look at the sort of discrimination if its 
discrimination against race or women or a physical handicap then 
yes religion should not override those 
but other forms of discrimination are good layle is 
discriminating against what many people view as immoral 
stephen cooper the state commissioner of human rights said 
french overlooks the fact that his action violated parsons 
religious freedom 
the biggest threat here is mr french imposing his religious 
beliefs on tenants cooper said he stands for the lack of 
religious freedom thats exactly what we fled the rest of the 
world for 200 years ago

eleven years ago police shot to 
death two independence advocates on a desolate mountaintop 
sparking a case compared to the watergate scandal and an 
investigation that still goes on 
the islands governor at the time hailed the police as heroes 
but it was later determined the two young nationalists surrendered 
and were shot while pleading for mercy not in a shootout with 
officers 
the killings and subsequent coverup led to the imprisonment of 
10 police officers and contributed to the fall of a government 
the case known as cerro maravilla after the mountain in 
southern puerto rico where the killings occurred is the subject 
of a film to be released next year 
the movie which stars amy irving robert duvall and lou diamond 
phillips was filmed in puerto rico last summer 
samuel dash who was the chief counsel to the senate watergate 
committee said cerro maravilla ranks with watergate for its 
breach of basic rights for citizens and degree of official 
coverup 
dash a special adviser to the puerto rico senates 
investigation of the killings said in an interview from washington 
there is belief police had support all the way up 
investigations continue to this day into whether the previous 
island government and the us justice department conspired to 
suppress the truth 
sen marcos a rigau chairman of the puerto rico senate 
judiciary committee said he expects the case to be resolved in 
1990 with new evidence senate hearings are expected to resume in 
june or july 
carlos romero barcelo who was governor when the killings 
occurred has called the continuing investigation a political 
witch hunt spearheaded by gov rafael hernandez colon the 
governors procommonwealth popular democratic party controls the 
senate which is carrying out the inquiry 
police claimed the two nationalists carlos soto arrivi 18 and 
arnaldo dario rosado 24 went to cerro maravilla on july 25 1978 
to blow up a 400foot tv transmission tower they said the two 
refused to surrender and were killed in a shootout 
that account was upheld in two federal grand jury inquiries and 
two puerto rico justice department investigations spanning five 
years 
but questions raised by senate president miguel hernandez agosto 
and two reporters for the san juan star manuel suarez and tomas 
stella cast doubt on the official version 
taxi driver julio ortiz molina who was abducted by the 
nationalists on their way to the mountain revealed that the two 
men were captured after an exchange of gunfire he said he later 
heard a second volley of shots 
in 1983 three police officers who had turned states evidence 
provided a riveting account of the killings during televised senate 
hearings 
they said soto arrivi and dario rosado surrendered and were 
beaten and then shot by three police officers at close range while 
on the ground pleading for their lives 
the revelation was a key reason romero barcelo lost his 
reelection bid in 1984 he had maintained police acted in 
selfdefense and had been heroic 
the killings occurred during a turbulent period in which 
proindependence groups had carried out a flurry of bombings in 
their campaign to end puerto ricos status as a us commonwealth 
eventually 10 police officers were convicted on various 
charges including seconddegree murder conspiracy and perjury 
and sentenced to prison terms ranging from six to 30 years 
it remains unclear why soto arrivi and dario rosado went to 
cerro maravilla 
alejandro gonzalez malave a police agent who infiltrated the 
small band of reputed terrorists calling themselves the armed 
revolutionary forces notified police they were planning to blow up 
the tower but no explosives were found 
gonzalez malave was facing perjury charges in april 1986 when he 
was gunned down outside his mothers house the separatist group 
los macheteros claimed responsibility

local alumni of the depressionera 
civilian conservation corps are working to preserve the history of 
the group that built roads bridges dams and parks across the 
nation 
we want the nation to know from now to eternity what was done 
and show what a mark we made said james lynn of jacksonville he 
worked with the ccc in the ocala national forest and at fort clinch 
state park in fernandina beach from 1933 to 1938 
to make sure americans remember the work of the 3 million ccc 
members the local chapter of the ccc alumni will spend the next 
year compiling material for a book that will list and describe the 
work done by the organization 
the ccc formed by president franklin roosevelt directed an 
army of previously unemployed people who built parks roads dams 
and sewers and brought electricity and telephone service to 
millions 
kark busch program director of the local ccc alumni said no 
one has ever produced a complete listing of the corps works 
although various state and federal agencies have tried 
it will be a monumental task he said noting that in florida 
alone ccc members planted more than 18 million trees and built an 
estimated 2700 bridges 
the ccc did soil erosion control work on 23 million acres and 
strung 89000 miles of telephone line developed 80 parks and 
contributed 12 million mandays of work in fighting forest fires 
busch said 
it may take two books because we did so much he said 
making the task even more difficult busch said was that 
information on obscure projects may have to come from the people 
who worked on them 
lynn was a farm boy of 17 when he joined the ccc from the 
gainesville area busch then a 16yearold in new york city was 
sent to washington state for his ccc work 
it gave many boys a new start and changed their way of 
living said lynn 74 who became a diesel mechanic after leaving 
the ccc i wouldnt trade anything for my experiences in the ccc 
id give 1000 cash to work for a month and be back with the 
boys

four national education groups said monday 
that they support turner broadcasting cos commercialfree news 
program for classroom use denouncing rival channel one because it 
carries commercials 
exploitation of a captive audience in the classroom using the 
classroom and the curriculum as a marketplace for products rather 
than a marketplace for ideas and selling or trading students in a 
classroom for a satellite dish or a television monitor are 
outrageous breaches of ethical practice gary marx associate 
executive director of the american association of school 
administrators said about channel one 
marx joined representatives of the national pta the national 
association of secondary school principals and the national 
education association at a news conference with ted turner 
president of turner broadcasting 
channel one produced by whittle communications of knoxville 
tenn envisions making and installing up to 300000 television 
sets 16000 videocasette recorders and 8000 satellite dishes at 
participating schools the turner program does not and would be 
delivered at schools via cable or tape rather than satellite 
scott thompson executive director of the organization of 
principals said channel one producers are telling schools you 
are going to have to sell the time of your students in your 
classroom in order to get this 
we think this is ethically wrong thompson said 
thompson said his group had written to all of the companies that 
advertise on channel one explaining its objections he said some 
companies decided not to continue their sponsorship but he did not 
name them 
whittle spokesman david gerard disagreed with the criticism of 
the commercials 
we are not introducing advertising to schools gerard said 
arguing that newspapers and magazines that carry ads long have been 
used as teaching tools 
jeremiah floyd associate executive director of the national 
school boards association which announced its support of turner 
broadcastings cnn newsroom in april reaffirmed its backing but 
did not criticize channel one 
it is a local proposition and if thats the only game in town 
and the local people decide they want to go with that game then 
thats their prerogative lloyd said 
turner said cnn newsroom launched in august had an initial 
enrollment of 1000 schools that has risen to 5000 2 times the 
figure turner broadcasting had expected to have by now he said 
he said he expected to have 10000 schools by september 
whittle which plans to launch channel one nationally in march 
said in november that it had 1050 schools lined up the company 
has said it hoped to expand to 8000 schools by the end of 1990 
gerard said whittle will have raised about 200 million in 
advertising support for channel one by the end of the year 
we think the turner program is pretty good its pretty 
wellproduced but like the vast majority of great educational 
programming its not watched it goes unseen by most students in 
this country and the technology is not there to watch it gerard 
said 
when a school signs up for channel one they are committed to 
showing the program about 90 percent of the time in virtually every 
classroom every day he said 
turner said about 50 percent to 60 percent of high schools have 
cable television available and in those that dont teachers can 
tape the program at home when it is broadcast in the early morning 
hours

four entrepreneurs are leaving no stone 
unturned in their first business venture 
rocks of all shapes sizes and colors are on sale when the 
weathers nice and not during cartoons in this east central 
nebraska community of 480 its 25 cents for the small ones and 50 
cents for the big ones 
were going to make money to buy christmas presents said 
greg bader 7 
greg and his sister steph 8 and neighbors apryl and daniel 
gay were digging for gold in the the gays backyard one day 
this fall but they found no gold no dinosaur bones only rocks 
he said 
then we decided to sell the rocks said steph a 
thirdgrader 
the four children have what looks to greg like a thousand 
billion rocks for sale 
some are so very very clear that you can see through them 
said 8yearold apryl with one rock up to her eye 
some look like bubble gum said daniel 6 of the ones 
painted pink 
when the weather isnt too cold the four sit at a table made 
from an electrical wire spool in the gays front yard displaying 
the loot 
after gathering the inventory the children decided it was time 
to advertise 
palmer journal publisher dale kirkpatrick said all four of the 
young entrepreneurs paid him a visit to ask if they could place an 
ad 
they were very businesslike very serious he said 
that businesslike demeanor inspired kirkpatrick to offer a 
fourcolumn ad free of charge 
he just told us hed try and get some customers for us 
steph said 
all they knew was that they had to put an ad in the paper in 
order to sell their rocks kirkpatrick said they had no idea 
they would normally have to pay for it 
when peg gay apryl and daniels mother heard the children had 
tried to place an ad she thought it would be a good lesson in 
economics 
i was going to teach them a lesson mrs gay said i was 
going to show them that it costs to put an ad in the paper and that 
people dont buy rocks i suppose they are learning a lesson but 
not the one i intended 
placing the ad has spurred the children to dwell on what theyll 
do with the profits even though theyve sold just two rocks in two 
weeks 
we might have to get more jars for our money steph said 
explaining that the blue plastic bear might not be sufficient 
we might have the whole house full of money and have to get a 
bigger one greg said

the biggest protests in two years were 
reported in romania where nicolae ceausescu runs the soviet blocs 
last hardline regime and a traveler said monday at least two 
people were killed including a child 
an unconfirmed report in the west german media said hundreds 
were killed 
romania virtually sealed its borders blocking or restricting 
travel from neighboring hungary yugoslavia and bulgaria and from 
other countries in an apparent effort to curtail reports of the 
unrest at timisoara western romania 
arriving flights were turned back around at the bucharest 
airport bulgarian tv said travelers were held in trains for hours 
before being sent back by romanian border guards 
in a late evening report the yugoslav news agency tanjug said 
romanian security forces took full control monday of timisoara 
just 30 miles from the yugoslav border ceausescu flew to iran 
earlier in the day for a threeday official visit 
premier miklos nemeth of hungary said there were unconfirmed 
reports of protests in other romanian cities and of soldiers being 
placed on alert 
a yugoslav returning from romania told the associated press 
police fired on the protesters and at least two people were killed 
he said other yugoslav travelers reported seeing more bodies in 
timisoara after security forces dispersed the largest 
antigovernment protests since a protest by 10000 workers at 
brasov in 1987 
in west germany william toetoek an ethnic german writer who 
immigrated from romania was interviewed on bremen radio and quoted 
witnesses in timisoara as saying 300400 protesters were killed and 
hundreds injured 
none of the reports of high death tolls could be confirmed 
bishop endre gyulay of the roman catholic diocese of szeged in 
hungary which includes timisoara told the church news agency 
kathpress based in vienna that 30 or 40 people fled across the 
border monday and reported two deaths of an old woman and a 
29yearold man 
police and troops moved in quickly the yugoslav traveler 
said but only police were seen firing on were seen shooting at the 
demonstrators 
i saw two dead including a child on the streets he said 
other yugoslav travelers said soldiers were seen threedeep at main 
intersections in timisoara on sunday the official hungarian news 
agency mti quoted a czechoslovak not identified as saying tanks 
were in the streets 
resentment has grown against ceausescu who has resisted the 
liberalization and reform sweeping through eastern europe he has 
been communist party chief since 1965 and with downfall of other 
old guard communists has become the longestserving leader in the 
soviet bloc 
ceausescus crash industrialization program and the domestic 
austerity he imposed to repay romanias 11 billion foreign debt 
have caused widespread shortages and food rationing the pervasive 
and feared secret police are the main agency used to keep the 
people under control 
mihnea berindei vice chairman of the parisbased romanian 
league for human rights said he had reports of police firing on 
the demonstrators in timisoara 
shots were heard and there were injuries ambulances were seen 
rushing to and fro he said quoting witnesses 
there are reports of deaths but we dont have any figures so 
far because the entire area has been virtually isolated by the 
security forces berindei said 
antigovernment protests apparently began after hundreds of 
ethnic hungarians formed a human chain friday night to prevent the 
eviction friday of the rev laszlo toekes a reformed church 
clergyman who has championed their rights berindei said 
toekes had been harassed for months by romanian authorities he 
and his wife who is pregnant had remained inside his church since 
masked assailants tried to attack him in his neighboring apartment 
nov 2 berindei said again quoting witnesses 
he said he did not know where toekes was monday night 
several thousand people most of them ethnic romanian students 
and workers protested in downtown timisoara on saturday and 
briefly occupied the communist party headquarters breaking windows 
and smashing furniture berindei said 
they also broke windows of bookstores and burned the works of 
ceausescu whose books are prominently displayed he said 
protest continued sunday then police and army units intervened 
and shots were fired berindei said 
other unrest preceded the weekend protests berindei said 
including a strike dec 8 at a truck plant in brasov north of 
bucharest and a student protest before that at hostels in 
bucharest 
in apparent response to the student action ceausescu ordered 
dec 5 that their monthly stipends be increased by 10 percent or 
about 5 a month 
official media did not mention the weekend unrest devoting 
themselves instead to ceausescus visit to iran 
emigres said bucharest radio warned citizens on sunday to remain 
orderly or face serious consequences which in romania can include 
long jail sentences or forced labor 
western diplomats reached by telephone monday in bucharest said 
the capital appeared calm but the international airport was heavily 
guarded 
thousands of yugoslavs normally cross each day to timisoara to 
sell goods to romanians but a yugoslav customs official said the 
borders were sealed to all but official traffic

gov bob martinez whose life has been 
threatened by colombian drug barons said monday he will consider 
wearing a bulletproof vest following the assassination of an 
alabama federal judge 
the florida department of law enforcement has urged the governor 
to wear a vest during some public appearances but martinez said he 
has never felt comfortable in one 
the governor said he would reevaluate that stance because of 
the weekend mail bombing that killed robert vance an 11th us 
circuit court of appeals judge in his home outside birmingham ala 
brian ballard martinezs director of operations said the 
governor probably would wear a bulletproof vest as a last 
resort 
if there was a specific threat i think maybe hed put one 
on ballard said he doesnt feel comfortable that the governor 
of the state of florida should have to wear one of those things 
martinez has taken a leading antidrug role in organizations 
such as the national governors association 
authorities have not linked drug dealers or the colombian 
cocaine cartels to vances killing saturday but martinez has been 
threatened previously by drug lords and the bombing drew attention 
to the governors security precautions 
we take into account events like that which just occurred in 
birmingham said fdle spokesman mike mchargue were interested 
in this incident 
earlier authorities disclosed that miami mayor xavier suarez is 
under roundtheclock police protection because of threats 
attributed to factions of the colombia cartel 
were received information indicating there might be a threat 
to several individuals including the mayor and governor said 
lew wilson agent in charge of the miami fdle office 
security for the governor has been increased twice in recent 
months because of the threats and the august arrest of a miami man 
suspected of involvement in a plot to assassinate martinez

the new parliament began its first 
session monday setting in motion the process for a crucial vote of 
confidence that prime minister vp singh must seek for his 
minority government 
president ramaswamy venkataraman set jan 1 as the deadline for 
singh to prove his majority in parliament when he invited him to 
form the government on dec 2 
former prime minister rajiv gandhis congress party won more 
seats than any single party in the nov 2226 elections 193 but 
fell far short of the 263 needed for an absolute majority 
singhs national front got only 144 but its pledges of 
postelection support from rightwing hindu fundamentalists and a 
leftist array of communists and socialists give it 283 votes more 
than enough to carry the motion which is likely to come up for vote 
thursday 
singh was the first of the 525 members of the lok sabha or 
house of the people to take the oath of allegiance to the 
constitution and sign the roll of legislators 
across the floor members of the congress party sat in the 
opposition benches for only the second time in indian parliamentary 
history 
singhs supporters cheered and slapped the palms of their hands 
on their tables as he was sworn in he then walked across and shook 
hands with gandhi 
as soon as singhs cabinet ministers took their oaths gandhi 
was sworn in to a new burst of cheers 
gandhi was surrounded by supporters as he entered the parliament 
building long live rajiv gandhi they chanted as a red and 
yellow roses bouquet was thrust into his hands 
singh entered the building well ahead of others and before 
crowds could gather 
after he was sworn in he said he would continue the dialogue 
initiated sunday to find a political solution to sikh separatism 
that has claimed more than 7000 lives in punjab in the past eight 
years 
sikh militants elected to the new parliament did not take the 
oath monday but a militant spokesman said they will do so thursday 
spokesman gurtej singh brar said in punjabs capital of 
chandigarh that sikh militant members will vote for singh when the 
motion seeking confidence in singhs government is put to vote 
we shall not let the government fall he said 
for the first time sikh militants who are campaigning for an 
independent homeland in punjab state have entered the national 
political mainstream by winning parliament seats in the election 
militants won six of the 13 seats in punjab three independents 
backed by the militants also were elected 
singh ousted gandhi from the prime ministers job on a platform 
of clean government and vows to repair the cracks in the countrys 
religious harmony

the soviet union appears to have begun 
cutting its defense expenditures including in the critical area of 
conventional forces according to a new nato study released monday 
the analysis by the north atlantic treaty organization offers 
new evidence that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev is trying 
to pare the nations massive military industry 
while nato remains highly skeptical regarding soviet claims 
for their defense expenditures it appears that the soviet union is 
indeed beginning to trim its defense outlays said the study a 
copy of which was approved last month by the ambassadors of the 16 
alliance nations it was made available by the us mission to nato 
a year ago gorbachev went before the united nations and 
promised to cut unilaterally soviet military forces by 500000 
troops and reduce conventional arms substantially a month later 
he called for a 142 percent cut in military spending and a 195 
percent reduction in military production 
the nations of the north atlantic treaty organization and those 
of the sovietled warsaw pact are negotiating in vienna to reduce 
tanks armored personnel carriers and other conventional weapons in 
europe the west wants to slash what it sees as the soviets 
enormous superiority in these arms 
in the report nato analysts said that in line with gorbachevs 
un speech the soviet union is reducing the size of its 
conventional forces 
a number of major procurement programs particularly in the 
land armaments area are being scaled back it said it added 
however that it was too early to tell whether all of gorbachevs 
promises would be carried out 
the report did not give specific figures for defense cutbacks 
soviet officials say their military budget for next year will be 
1148 billion off 82 percent from 1989s reported spending plan 
the nato report based on defense spending through 1988 said 
the budget outlays reported this year by the kremlin appeared too 
low to cover the cost of soviet military activities 
it estimated that the kremlin spent 210 billion to 258 billion 
in 1988 
that sum it said would amount to about 15 percent to 18 
percent of the soviet economys total output in comparison nato 
estimates that us defense spending last year accounted for about 
61 percent of the gross national product 
most of the differences in budget estimates was due to 
artificially low prices the soviets maintain for some defense 
efforts the report said it also said the soviets do not appear to 
include some costs added to western budgets 
defense spending grew at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
about 2 percent to 3 percent in the 198588 period a bit ahead of 
the pace in the first half of the decade the report said 
underlying the estimate of defense spending growth is a fairly 
rapid increase in procurement expenditures which approach 40 
percent of total outlays the report said 
this increase in growth has been driven by the production of 
several new generations of weapon systems the development of which 
predates gorbachev it said 
it said expenditures on operations and maintenance grew by about 
2 percent annually spending on research and development gained but 
little rise was found in personnel expenditures 
the report noted gorbachevs drive to restructure the economy so 
that some of the money spent for defense would be channeled into 
consumer goods but it said the conversion campaign still appears 
to lack an integrated plan 
it said it would be difficult to estimate soviet defense 
spending in the next decade because of the dramatic political 
economic and military changes likely to take place 
although pressure to reduce military spending will continue 
the soviet leadership will remain determined not to let soviet 
military capability fall below the level that it judges necessary 
to protect the security of the state the report concluded

nearly 8900 supplemental benefit checks 
totalling 273 million were mailed last week to vietnam war 
veterans disabled by the chemical defoliant agent orange the 
lawyer administering the payment program said monday 
during the next several days 500 more checks will be sent to 
veterans or their survivors said the attorney deborah greenspan 
the payments ranged from 256 to 8100 she said 
us district judge jack b weinstein of brooklyn who is 
overseeing the agent orange benefit program last month ordered 
that the additional payments be sent before christmas 
the payments wont significantly change the total award an 
eligible veteran will receive but will provide a large share of 
the compensation in a lumpsum payment 
veterans receiving the supplemental checks will continue to 
receive annual benefit payments until 1994 but the amount of the 
yearly payments will be reduced somewhat to account for the 
lumpsum payment 
weinstein created the agent orange settlement fund in 1984 when 
seven chemical companies without admitting guilt agreed to pay 
180 million to settle a classaction lawsuit brought by vietnam 
veterans and their families who alleged injuries because of 
exposure to the chemical during the war 
agent orange widely used by american forces during the vietnam 
war contained the highly toxic chemical dioxin in their lawsuit 
veterans said exposure to the defoliant caused cancer and other 
illnesses as well as birth defects in their children

gov rose mofford underwent surgery monday to 
have her infected gallbladder removed and to clear blockages 
believed to have been caused by gallstones 
surgery began at 1220 pm and was expected to last two hours 
said debra gelbart a spokeswoman for st josephs hospital and 
medical center 
we think that surgery is the best option at this time 
robert bullington a cardiologist and mrs moffords primary 
physician said shortly before surgery began she feels herself 
that surgery is the best option 
the operations chief surgeon victor zannis said that there 
was over a 90 percent chance that shes going to be just fine 
mrs mofford probably will have to remain in the hospital for 
seven to 10 days after surgery but should be able to work from her 
bed and could recover to deliver her state of the state address 
jan 8 the doctors said 
mrs mofford 67 checked herself into st josephs on sunday 
complaining of chest pains tests showed that the pain came from an 
infected gallbladder and irritated pancreas said michael altman a 
gastroenterologist 
tests suggest that mrs mofford was suffering from gall stones 
and that one or more of them had made its way from the gallbladder 
through the cystic duct and into the common bile duct where it 
blocked the pancreatic duct long enough to irritate the pancreas 
altman said 
mrs moffords doctors said her family had a history of 
gallbladder and heart problems the hospital said monday that the 
governor was in stable condition and was not in pain

after a kiss from his widow andrei d sakharov 
was buried monday in a snowy cemetery where kremlin elite joined 
with common people in mourning the human rights advocate once 
treated as an outlaw 
to the baleful strains of robert schumanns traumerai 
sakharovs coffin was carried along a path strewn with evergreen 
boughs to the freshly dug grave at vostryakovskoye cemetery 
its over sakharovs wife and dissident comradeinarms 
yelena bonner said as she turned to a companion during the 
twilight burial under pines dripping with rain 
sakharov died thursday of an apparent heart attack at the age of 
68 he was buried alongside bonners mother ruth a stalinera 
political prisoner who died in 1987 at age 87 
before the crimson and blacktrimmed coffin was lowered into 
the cold land sakharov tried so hard to change its lid was removed 
to allow bonner a last farewell she took the shroud from his face 
and bent to kiss him on the forehead 
as the procession wound its way through moscow some mourners 
marched alongside with signs demanding democratic elections one of 
sakharovs final causes 
others hoisted the blue red and white flag of czarist russia 
now the symbol of the grassroots prodemocracy russian peoples 
front 
top communist party brass riding sleek black limousines and tens 
of thousands of common people trudging through the slush joined in 
paying their last respects to the nobel peace laureate who once 
was pilloried as an ignoramus and dupe of the west 
in the morning president mikhail s gorbachev and other members 
of the ruling politburo stood in the rain to view the body outside 
the academy of sciences sakharov a creator of the soviet hydrogen 
bomb was a member of the academy 
gorbachev spoke at length there with bonner and later told 
reporters now it is clear that he deserved the nobel prize 
sakharov won the prize in 1975 for his human rights campaign 
but the soviet leadership at the time refused to let him go to 
norway to accept it he was hounded for years and finally sent into 
internal exile in gorky for nearly seven years 
an openended bus followed by thousands of mourners carried 
sakharovs body and bonner along lenin prospekt to outdoor funeral 
ceremonies in the parking lot of the luzhniki sports complex a 
favorite site for rallies by human rights activists 
more than 30000 people surged forward toward sakharovs 
carnationbedecked coffin and bonner had to plead for order 
sakharov did all he could ilya zaslavsky a moscow member 
of the congress of peoples deputies told the crowd now only 
his ideas can change things and only we can fulfill his ideas 
the academy of sciences is guilty before him we were passive 
in our defense of him sakharovs fellow academician and congress 
member dmitri likhachev said in a quavering voice now we say 
andrei dmitrievich forgive us 
staterun tv showed excerpts of the luzhniki services in a 
special broadcast of the kind usually reserved for the deaths of 
major government figures the evening news program vremya led 
off with an eightminute report on sakharovs last rites 
accompanied by a sorrowful dirge 
the 2250member congress or parliament to which sakharov 
belonged adjourned at midday so its members could attend the 
funeral ceremonies 
from luzhniki the coffin was transported nine miles in a bus to 
the cemetery along slushfilled streets 
in addition to gorbachev politburo members and other soviet 
leaders gathered at the academy of sciences to view sakharovs body 
from another direction buses escorted by police cars arrived 
some 20 people carried the casket on their shoulders from a bus and 
placed it on a bier in front of the academy bonner also emerged 
accompanied by her son alexei semenov 
the coffin was opened in the frigid rain and an umbrella opened 
to shield sakharovs face 
a bareheaded and somber gorbachev walked to the foot of the 
casket and stood for awhile in silence he bowed twice and the 
huddle of people around the casket broke up 
gorbachev and bonner spoke animatedly with bonner smiling at 
one point gorbachev and his entourage entered the academy 
presidium building to sign an official book of condolences he 
wrote simply ms gorbachev 
he emerged and talked briefly with reporters the relations 
between myself and sakharov were always those of mutual respect 
gorbachev said now it is clear that he deserved the nobel 
prize 
it was gorbachev who allowed sakharov to return to moscow in 
december 1986 after the years of exile in gorky the two men had 
clashed however over the speed and sweep of gorbachevs political 
reform program with sakharov demanding the communist party that 
gorbachev heads renounce its constitutional monopoly on power 
some parliamentarians monday pledged to heed sakharovs call to 
create a fullfledged opposition in the congress and to push for 
victory for progressives in nationwide local elections that began 
this month 
lech walesa the leader of polands solidarity movement and 
winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize had been expected to attend 
the service but polands official pap news agency reported his 
plane had to land in leningrad because of bad weather

cbs fallen on hard prime times and hoping to 
change that on monday named as its chief programmer jeff sagansky 
a movie executive who worked at nbc when that network was making a 
comeback to first in ratings 
saganskys job is to put on contemporary successful 
programming and to do it with some flair and imagination cbs 
broadcast group president howard stringer said in an interview 
the appointment of sagansky 37 president of tristar pictures 
since march had been expected but it was delayed a week while cbs 
and columbia pictures tristars parent company negotiated a 
release from his tristar contract which had a year to go 
on jan 1 sagansky will become the third president cbs 
entertainment has had in as many years he succeeds kim lemasters 
who resigned nov 30 after only two years in the job 
he will be the counterpart of his former boss at nbc brandon 
tartikoff whose network has led prime time ratings for four 
seasons and is expected to be first again this season sagansky was 
nbcs senior vice president for series from 1983 to 1985 when he 
joined tristar as production president 
cbs has been third in evening ratings for two consecutive 
seasons posted its worstever november ratings this year and is 
expected to conclude this season in third again adversely 
affecting cbss revenues 
but sagansky who previously worked in a cbs finance post two 
years after graduating from harvard in 1974 said in an interview 
from los angeles that he had no trepidations about rejoining the 
network 
and he said i think youve got to be really audacious 
innovative and aggressive because of fierce competition not only 
from nbc and abc but also from cable the young fox network and 
other viewing alternatives 
although the time for midseason changes is approaching 
sagansky said he had no immediate fixes of cbs schedule in mind 
i dont think there are any immediate fixes he said i 
think this is a case of targeting your program development for a 
specific time period theres a lot more competition now than when 
nbc did it 
cbs previously considered sagansky for the job in 1987 
sagansky was again wooed before and after cbs unsuccessfully 
last week tried to lure to its vacant job a top tv production team 
marcy carsey and tom werner whose company makes nbcs the cosby 
show and abcs roseanne 
stringer called cbs talks with carsey and werner a brilliant 
detour that almost came to fruition but jeff is the guy we 
wanted

national security adviser brent scowcroft 
whose surprise mission to china earlier this month created a storm 
of criticism in congress made a secret visit to beijing in july 
the white house said today 
a month after the bloody government crackdown against 
prodemocracy demonstrators in tiananmen square bush sent 
scowcroft to china to personally underscore the united states 
shock and concern about the violence said white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater also said that scowcrofts trip intended was to 
impress upon the chinese government the seriousness with which this 
incident was viewed in the united states 
fitzwater left open the possiblity that scowcroft or other top 
us officials had made other secret trips to china 
i cant rule out other encounters he said 
he added that he personally had been unaware of earlier trips 
the spokesman declined to say when in july scowcroft had gone to 
beijing but said it was at least a month after government troops 
killed hundreds of democracy protesters when the troops moved into 
the square on june 3 
fitzwaters comments were the first administration 
acknowledgement that scowcroft has made more than one trip to china 
after the crackdown 
the president felt this facetoface mission like the one 
recently completed by general scowcroft was necessary to show the 
sense of purpose and direction of the united states government 
fitzwater added in a statement 
earlier today bush without noting scowcrofts july trip told 
reporters that critics of this months visit have been dealing 
with emotion and not facts and that once they deal with a full 
deck i expect people will understand it 
he said that criticism of the dec 89 trip by scowcroft and 
deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger was subsiding and 
that those who were still skeptical should be a little patient 
and wait and see how beijing responds 
im just going to stay with my position and take on a little 
heat from time to time and well wait and see what happens said 
bush who has been accused by democrats of kowtowing to the 
chinese leaders

terrorists pressing for more attention could 
well increase the carnage in attacks on airplanes and other 
targets next year federal officials said monday one raised the 
possibility that chemical weapons will soon be used 
terrorist groups appear to be moving away from hijackings and 
toward airplane bombings as evidenced by the pan am explosion last 
december and by the bombings this year of an avianca plane over 
colombia and a french uta jetliner over niger in africa said 
anthony wayne of the state departments office on counterterrorism 
thus he said the number of terrorist incidents might decline 
while the number of casualties would grow 
in the first 10 months of the year 410 people were killed in 
international terrorist attacks according to preliminary figures 
compiled by the state department in the corresponding period last 
year 308 people were killed 
terrorism has become so pervasive that its lost much of its 
shock value said seth cropsey deputy assistant secretary of 
state for special operations terrorists to stay on the front 
page and in the public eye feel they must increase the carnage 
he said 
as a result its likely that well see more efforts to bomb 
planes and the appearance of new weapons and tactics previously 
shunned by terrorist groups indeed future concern is the possible 
introduction of biochemical agents he said 
cropsey declined to elaborate on such prospects citing 
intelligence sources 
a third official speaking on a seminar panel with the other 
two cautioned against any expectation that reforms in the soviet 
union would result in a lessening of support for countries such as 
cuba syria and nicaragua that have been accused of financing 
terrorist groups 
until proven wrong we should not operate on that 
assumption said oliver b revell associate deputy director of 
investigations at the fbi 
revell speaking at a george washington university symposium on 
terrorism said terrorist organizations such as the 
marxistoriented japanese red army and the palestine liberation 
frontgeneral command will continue to pose a threat to us 
interests and to americans in 1990 
investigations have focused on the pflpgc as a prime suspect in 
the bombing of pan am flight 103 over scotland last december in 
which 270 people among them 200 americans were killed 
revell also said a very small number of tightly disciplined 
iranians among the 325000 iranians living in the united states 
could present a threat to americans antius sentiment has 
continued since the death of the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini last 
summer revell said 
some 10000 iranian students on scholarships from their 
governments live in the united states and with this 
infrastructure the threat appears to be substantial he said 
tehran radio reported in recent months on several meetings 
between senior iranian officials and the leader of the pflpgc 
in another development a congressional report issued monday 
said that increased security procedures since the bombing of flight 
103 are not being carried out properly at highrisk foreign 
airports due to a lack of training standards 
the general accounting office report faulted the federal 
aviation administration for not establishing minimum training 
requirements and standards for the extra security measures taken 
following the dec 21 1988 disaster

eight soviet students will tour the 
underground strategic air command headquarters friday in what may 
be the first such tour of the nuclear weapons command center 
officials said monday 
col larry greer a sac spokesman said it was coincidental that 
the tour comes amid changes in eastern europe and improved 
sovietamerican relations 
but school officials might have never considered asking sac for 
the tour if it werent for the apparently improving relations said 
di saggau a spokeswoman for the westside community schools 
the tour of sac underground is apparently the first by a soviet 
group and it will be a little different from other tours greer 
said 
were not going to bear down on nuclear deterence although 
that is part of sacs mission greer said its a fact its well 
known if they can read they know it 
sac is the air forces longrange strike force of manned bombers 
and intercontinental ballistic missiles since 1961 it has flown 
roundtheclock flights in project looking glass which would take 
charge of nuclear forces if the president and other leaders were 
killed 
five soviet girls and three boys ages 1517 have been in the 
united states since nov 27 in an exchange program with westside 
high school they are to leave dec 27 and a group of westside 
students is to visit the soviet union in march 
the soviet students teacherinterpreter and eight american 
students will accompany them on the sac tour saggau and greer said 
sac at offutt air force base near omaha will follow its normal 
security precautions for civilians including keeping the group 
together on the tour greer said 
sac officials will modify the soviet briefing because of 
language concerns and because they think teenagers are more 
interested in the technological gadgets and wizardry than in broad 
policy he said 
the students also will make radio contact with a base in alaska 
i want to remind the soviet kids that were just a few miles west 
of them greer said

the us government monday quadrupled to 2 
million the maximum reward it can offer to anyone who provides 
information that helps thwart an act of terrorism 
the money can be paid to any person who furnishes information 
that leads to the prevention frustration or favorable resolution 
of a terrorist act against us persons or property the state 
department said in a brief announcement 
the increase was made possible by a provision in an antidrug 
bill passed by congress and signed into law by president bush last 
week rewards had been limited to 500000 
we believe this increase will strengthen us efforts to 
prevent terrorist attacks and will help bring terrorists to 
justice the statement said 
anyone with information about planned terrorist acts should call 
the nearest us embassy or consulate if they are overseas or 
contact the fbi if they are in the united states it said 
the announcement came three days after the department issued an 
unusual public terrorism alert warning of the possibility of an 
attack on us targets in western europe or west africa 
concern for such an attack was based on recent reports of 
movement of terrorists from the middle east and the discovery of 
weapons shipments destined for proiranian groups in spain and 
africa 
it also reflected concern that terrorists might seek to use 
violence to observe the anniversaries of the dec 21 1988 bombing 
of pan am flight 103 or other attacks that have taken place during 
the holiday season

an american group is trying to 
bring the second part of the 1990 world chess championship final to 
the united states an official said monday 
we are very excited to be involved in the world of chess in 
the present climate said robert l burkett president of world 
professional chess promotion inc and a senior vicepresident for 
corporate affairs at the interscope group both owned by ted field 
whose family formerly owned the chicago suntimes 
if we are successful in obtaining the rights to conduct the 
world championship in the united states we plan to negotiate with 
a number of cities in hopes of finding the ideal venue burkett 
said 
earlier at a general meeting of the grandmasters association 
chairman bessel kok suggested splitting the world championship 
match between lyon france and a us city 
the governing body of chess known by its french acronym fide 
awarded the match to lyon in august but reigning world champion 
gary kasparov of the soviet union and other grandmasters objected 
that lyon was awarded the match without their being consulted 
kok told grandmasters he would meet with fide officials dec 28 
to try to work out a solution 
at mondays meeting kasparov successfully pushed through an 
amendment to a peace agreement proposed nov 26 in lucerne 
switzerland between fide and the grandmasters association gma 
calling for the world championship match to be organized under the 
auspices of the association 
we are looking seriously at the possibility of making a bid 
burkett said we are extremely pleased the gma by popular acclaim 
endorsed the concept of splitting the venues and are particularly 
looking forward to working with the city of lyon 
burkett did not discuss possible sites in the united states nor 
did he comment on the size of the proposed prize fund 
lyon offerred a prize fund of 194 million 
joel benjamin a grandmaster from new york city said he had 
heard rumors new york was the best bet to stage the second half of 
the contest 
the 24game championship will be spread over 10 weeks and the 
second half is likely to last for five weeks 
in 1986 the third clash between kasparov and anatoly karpov was 
split between london and leningrad 
us chess players long have hoped a major corporate sponsor 
would get involved in chess and revitalize commercial support for 
the game in the united states which has remained virtually dormant 
since bobby fischer refused to defend his championship crown in 
1975

texts of supreme court opinions soon will be 
available via computer within minutes of their announcement from 
the bench a court official said monday 
james r donovan director of data systems for the high court 
said the experimental system will be put in operation perhaps by 
spring for a twoyear run 
during an 18month study into speedy delivery of high court 
opinions in electronic form a special committee headed by donovan 
originally envisioned letting some private agency distribute the 
opinions to all interested parties 
but it was later decided the court itself should do the job 
the system is designed to simultaneously transmit the courts 
opinions to a specific group of recipients limited to those who 
are in the business of disseminating information donovan said in 
a letter of announcement 
the number of recipients initially will be kept down by 
practical limits of system capacity and workload imposed upon 
court staff donovan said 
he said the number of recipients each of which will pay an 
annual subscription rate expected to be set at 500 might be 
increased if there is demand and if the experiment indicates 
expansion is feasible 
recipients to be chosen by donovans committee will be 
expected to provide necessary common equipment such as telephone 
lines

the solidarityled governments sweeping 
economic reform program came under attack monday from farmers 
representatives who said they preferred guaranteed minimum prices 
to the risk of a free market 
farmers became the first major interest group to object to the 
government economic program that was introduced sunday the plan 
aims to transform poland into a market economy after 45 years of 
communist economics and calls for sharp cuts in state spending and 
subsidies to balance the budget and cure polands 900 percent 
inflation 
but while the discussion on farm policy was sharp the 
governments economic reform program as a whole was not considered 
to be in serious trouble 
agriculture minister czeslaw janicki told the sejm the lower 
house of parliament that the government would create an agency to 
intervene in the market if farm prices fall too low but that it is 
essential to move away from governmentmandated prices 
janicki also promised to curb monopoly food processors to whom 
farmers sell and pledged to try to increase the flow of farm 
machinery fertilizer and other agriculture inputs to the 
countryside 
the reassurances did not satisfy parliament members from rural 
areas who argued for guaranteed prices and more direct state 
investment in farming 
farmers in foodpoor poland are angry that the government wants 
to abandon guaranteed minimum prices for their produce arguing 
that their costs are rising and they need to be assured of 
profitability 
about 75 percent of polands farming is in private hands mainly 
on small holdings of only a few acres productivity per acre is 
about half that of western europe 
in the past the government fixed prices at what it determined 
was a profitable level often one that rewarded even inefficient 
farmers lat year the government moved toward a system in which 
prices are to be negotiated freely between farmers and purchasers 
but farmers have complained that the buyers mainly nationwide 
communist partydominated food and processing cooperatives are 
monopolies that dictate unfavorable prices 
they also complaim that city dwellers unfairly blame them for 
1000 percent price increases in recent months and that most of 
the money has been pocketed by the intermediaries 
ryszard smolarek a communist deputy argued for maintaining 
minimum guaranteed prices at least until july 
agriculture cannot be dumped into the deep water he said 
farmers incomes are going to be left without any protection 
opinions are getting more and more radical in the 
countryside deputy jacek szymaderski said arguing for greater 
government investment in agricultural development 
the government did not take into consideration the specific 
nature of agriculture said deputy jozef zych a member of the 
peasant party 
over the weekend jozef slisz the head of the independent 
farmers union rural solidarity was ousted at the unions congress 
and replaced by gabriel janowski a farmersenator who was 
perceived as more willing to criticize the government 
our farmer knows a lot and he could do a lot but his 
capabilitiies and his possibilities are limited by a lack of 
means janicki told the chamber 
the state of agriculture like the whole economy is a result 
of the piling up of problems in the system over several decades 
he said 
on the issue of supporting minimal prices of agricultural 
products janicki said it would be done through intervention in the 
market by a new agency for agricultural market affairs 
this agency will be equipped with essential means and 
authority which will allow it to better stabilize the food 
market he said it will make intervention purchases at the 
local level if necessary to support set price levels for grains 
meat and milk he said 
the governent will use new antimonopoly legislation to break up 
monopolies in agricultural services and food processing he said 
as long as there are monopolies in procurement of agricultural 
products there will be problems in creating a free market 
janicki said 
the sejm is to meet again tuesday and possibly wednesday 
after sundays meeting a 43member commission of deputies was 
formed to review the whole package charied by solidarity deputy 
andrzej zawislak it is to speed review of the package to meet a 
jan 1 government deadline 
asked whether the more than a dozen bills and resolutions could 
be approved zawislak said there is a chance because the 
extreme situation causes an explosion of social energy that can 
carry out great changes 
the government has acknowledged the program will lead 
temporarily to unemployment and lowered living standards but says 
it is necessary to choke off inflation and make the economy 
efficient 
the plan includes balancing the deficitridden state budget 
through strict austerity cutting off most state subsidies freeing 
prices limiting wage increases turning the zloty into a 
convertible currency attacking monopolies reforming the banking 
and tax systems establishing a social safety net for the poor and 
jobless and selling off state industries to the private sector

authorities were heartened friday by the death of gonzalo rodriguez 
gacha in a police shootout near covenas on the caribbean coast

luis carlos galan the leading presidential candidate 
we keep up our search for escobar gaviria and other drug 
traffickers defense minister gen oscar botero told reporters 
monday 
officials said a long fight remains as barco put it sunday 
this war has had a development favorable to the government but 
it is not over yet 
drug gangs have killed at least 200 people the past four months 
in bomb attacks in bogota medellin cali and other cities 
sixtythree died when a vehicle loaded with explosives exploded 
this month outside the headquarters of the colombian intelligence 
police 
security sources said elite military units concentrated their 
search for escobar gaviria on monday near cartagena and sincelejo 
in northern colombia where intelligence reports said he had 
planned to meet with rodriguez gacha 
bogota newspapers said the two had intended to plan sabotage 
actions to discourage president bush from attending an antidrug 
summit feb 15 with the presidents of colombia peru and bolivia 
when asked about the reports a us embassy official said we 
know nothing of it 
the government has offered a reward equivalent to 580000 for 
information leading to the arrest or death of escobar gaviria who 
is said to have hundreds of men in his own private army 
a similar amount was offered for rodriguez gacha who had an 
army of about 2000 
a diplomat said of rodriguez gachas troops they are 
mercenaries now that their boss is dead they are probably 
fleeing 
escobar gaviria escaped into the jungle nov 22 when police 
surrounded cocorna a town 110 miles from bogota where he was 
hiding 
if captured alive escobar gaviria would be extradited to the 
united states for trial on federal drug smuggling charges so far 
10 colombians have been extradited to the united states to face 
drug charges 
colombian drug gangs are believed responsible for 80 percent of 
the illegal cocaine that enters the united states

the state department said monday that it 
absolutely and unequivocally denied assertions by a salvadoran 
couple who said they were mistreated by interrogators after they 
linked the salvadoran army to the deaths of six jesuit priests last 
month 
jorge cerna and his wife lucia barrera de cerna told the new 
york times that us and salvadoran investigators repeatedly 
accused them of lying and that at one point were threatened with 
deportation from the united states 
mrs barrera de cerna worked as a housekeeper for the priets 
martha doggett of the lawyers committee for human rights said 
the woman was so intimidated by fbi agents and a salvadoran colonel 
that she recanted her story 
after the couples allegations appeared in mondays editions of 
the new york times the state department reaffirmed the denials it 
issued last week after charges by a salvadoran cleric 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said mrs barrera de 
cerna was treated with respect and courtesy during the 
interviews which were conducted in the united states over a period 
of several days in late november 
every effort was made to make the witness feel comfortable and 
secure ms tutwiler said about mrs barrera de cerna adding 
there was no threat to deport her 
william walker the us ambassador to el salvador also denied 
that us government officials had subjected mrs barrera de cerna 
to pressure 
full professionals do not involve themselves in psychological 
torment walker told reporters in washington 
however he also said she gave differing versions of what she 
saw the night the priests were slain and a subsequent liedetector 
test could not corroborate any of her testimony 
this does not mean she is not a credible witness or that shes 
trying to deceive us but we are just trying to put together what 
she did see he said 
justice department spokesman david runkle said a review of the 
transcript indicated the interviews were carried out in a 
professional fashion 
as part of the us effort to help salvadoran authorities bring 
the killers of the jesuits to justice american officials arranged 
for mrs barrera de cerna to be flown to miami after learning she 
may have been a witness 
she was considered as someone with information which could be 
useful in solving these horrible crimes ms tutwiler said she 
was never treated as a criminal suspect 
ms doggett said the interrogators cast doubt on the couples 
allegation that they had seen salvadoran soldiers moving to and 
from the priests residences 
who put you up to this they were asked according to ms 
doggett 
ms doggett said mrs barrerr de cerna was told depending on 
what you say you may or may not have to go back to el salvador 
the salvadoran officer lt col manuel antonio rivas also 
yelled at mrs barrera de cerna im ashamed of you youre a 
salvadoran youre a liar ms doggett said 
rivas is head of the ustrained special investigative unit 
which was designed to handle human rights cases 
ms doggett who coordinates latin american and caribbean 
affairs for the lawyers committee was one of two representatives 
from the organization to interview mrs barrera de cerna recently

year the report said without detail use of cigars and smoking

police departments across the country 
routinely tape conversations between jailed suspects and their 
lawyers a congressional hearing was told monday 
the hearing by the courts subcommittee of the house judiciary 
committee grew out of a connecticut auto case that came to light 
earlier this year 
but state or local police or corrections officers in at least 12 
other states routinely record lawyerclient conversations said the 
subcommittee chairman rep robert w kastenmeier dwis 
a clear pattern is emerging across the country said 
kastenmeier it is unfortunate but likely that as we explore what 
happened in these states information about other states will come 
to light 
kastenmeier said information gathered by the subcommttee 
indicates that some form of bugging or wiretapping of conversations 
between jailed suspects and their attorneys has gone on in rhode 
island west virginia georgia new mexico oregon alaska 
wyoming vermont indiana utah nebraska and new jersey 
antonio califa legislative counsel to the american civil 
liberties union detailed several instances of police taping 
in rhode island state police since 1988 have taped incoming 
and outgoing calls on a system that connects the states five 
barracks according to califa the us attorney has begun a 
preliminary investigation 
in west virginia state police have been taping telephone 
conversations from suspects to their families and lawyers for 20 
years califa said callers are not warned that the calls are being 
recorded 
the utah civil liberties union is planning a lawsuit alleging 
that the state department of corrections routinely taped 
conversations between convicted prison inmates and their attorneys 
federal law forbids telephone taping except when investigatrs 
obtain a court order based on probable cause in a criminal 
investigation or when both parties to the conversation agree to the 
taping many state laws mirror the 1968 federal statute but some 
permit taping if only one party to the conversation consents 
mondays hearing included a videotape of a telephone 
conversation on august 5 1988 between a suspect in a connecticut 
vehicular homicide case and his attorney 
during trial a connecticut state police officer testified that 
the call was recorded as part of routine department policy 
an investigation by the hartford courant revealed that the 
secret taperecording by state police was widespread prompting 
gov william a oneill to order an immediate halt to the taping of 
attorneyclient calls the revelations cost public safety 
commissioner and state police commander lester j forst his job 
a later state investigation concluded that the tapes were not 
used to illegally gather evidence against suspects 
the connecticut state police have insisted from the start that 
the tapes were not listened to 
attorneys elliot b spector and marcia j gleeson representing 
connecticut and 19 defendants including two top former state police 
officials wrote to kastenmeier on saturday that the witness list 
for mondays hearing would only expose one side of the story 
the news media some public figures and criminal defense 
attorneys hysterically characterized these events as criminal acts 
amounting to a national crisis gleeson and spector wrote i 
would hope that the committee will take a more cautious approach to 
this issue 
gleeson said committee staff members rejected offers to provide 
an opposing point of view in the hearing 
members of kastenmeiers staff said the committee sought to 
question connecticut state police lt col john mulligan about the 
taping practices but that mulligan refused

the united states is formally protesting 
romanias weekend crackdown on protesters as a terribly mistaken 
course by a government that sees its popular support slipping 
away the state department said monday 
romanian police opened fire on protesters during weekend 
antigovernment riots and at least two people including a child 
were killed a person traveling in the region said an unconfirmed 
report in the west german media said hundreds were killed 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the violent 
clashes were the result of suppression of legitimate dissent by 
citizens frustrated with repression and hardships under the regime 
of president nicolae ceausescu among the last of the east blocs 
hardline communist rulers 
ceausescu has forcefully rejected reforms that are sweeping the 
rest of eastern europe 
since the government doesnt have the support of the people 
it is following a terribly mistaken course of using security forces 
to repress a serious manifestation of popular discontent with the 
policies of the ceausescu regime ms tutwiler told reporters at 
the departments daily briefing 
she said the us ambassador in bucharest alan green was 
determining what form our protest will take 
ms tutwiler noted that the united states has consistently 
criticized that regimes repression of dissent and denial of 
fundamental human rights to its people 
she said the united states was especially critical of 
authorities use of force against the rev laszlo toekes a 
reformed church minister in timisoara in western romania the 
unrest began saturday after his congregation sought to protect him 
from a courtordered move to another town ms tutwiler said 
the demonstration apparently grew in size and took on an 
antigovernment tone she said on sunday she said government 
security units brutally put down the demonstration with the use 
of truncheons tear gas and water cannons 
she said she could not confirm reports of casualties or of 
gunfire 
toekes an ethnic hungarian has championed the rights of other 
ethnic hungarians in the face of what they see as harassment by 
romanian authorities when the protest began saturday he was 
seeking to exercise legitimate religious rights ms tutwiler said 
the us embassy has been repeatedly rebuffed in its efforts to 
visit and talk with toekes because of security personnel deployed 
around his church and home she said 
we call upon the romanian government to cease its pressure 
against rev toekes and his congregation and allow him to exercise 
his fundamental freedom to communicate ms tutwiler said 
as to reports that hungary has sealed its borders in an effort 
to prevent news of the unrest from reaching the outside she said 
of course it would concern us and of course as in all the 
other countries we are for selfdetermination of those people this 
is no different in romania than it has been in any of the other 
countries where change has occurred in eastern europe

a federal judge monday declared 
unconstitutional a 1976 regulation barring people from passing out 
leaflets in an area around the white house 
us district court judge john pratt issued the ruling in the 
case of a carol ann fennelly charged with illegally distributing 
pamphlets june 21 along east executive avenue between the white 
house and treasury department 
the material urged passersby to write members of congress in 
favor of housing for the homeless 
the judge said the regulation is an unconstitutional limitation 
on first amendment rights 
national park service regulations approved in 1970 were part of 
an effort to protect white house security by restrictions on 
demonstrations the 1976 amendments were drafted to preserve an 
atmosphere of calm and tranquility at memorials and buildings 
associated with past presidents 
in 1976 nothing was said about the underlying purpose of 
presidential security which was the overriding purpose of the 
comprehensive regulations issued in 1970 pratt said the 1970 
regulation allowed distribution of pamphlets and leaflets by not 
mentioning them 
in contrast the 1976 revision for the first time banned 
distribution of material in the white house park area the judge 
said 
pratt noted that fennelly would violate the regulation by 
passing out a leaflet but could convey the same identical 
message by word of mouth without fear of arrest 
a ban on the free distribution of leaflets and pamphlets in 
those remote areas far removed from the white house itself has no 
conceivable governmental interest pratt said in his opinion 
its distressing that the government continues to try to 
impose these ridiculous limitations on free speech in the nations 
capital said american civil liberties union lawyer arthur 
spitzer who handled the case

bush well i understand it this is to review the calendar of 
1989 so let me just click off a couple of areas that have been of 
keen interest to me and then be glad to take some questions 
first in foreign policy 
q no i was trying to see if my laughter you may 
continue laughter 
bush no but we have established a new course of relations with 
the soviet union i continue to feel the gorbachev meeting was 
extraordinarily helpful in a lot of ways and we are determined to 
move forward with the cfe proposal that i made at nato i think 
that next years summit which has now been set was set in 89 
will be fulfilled in 1990 will be a driving factor in other arms 
control agreements id like to see the start agreement finished by 
then but i think in general the soviets would also like to see 
that 
weve talked about with the soviet union given the 
unprecedented changes in eastern europe and in the soviet union 
talked about obviously about reforms and how these eastern 
european countries and indeed the soviet union is trying to go 
forward on the economic side of perestroika 
weve set a course for guiding our actions with eastern europe 
as you know jim baker was over at nato following my visit and 
that he talked there about the future and how the united states 
would continue to interact not just with the ec but foreseeing an 
expanded role for nato weve obviously moved to help poland and 
hungary in specific ways i tried very hard during this year to 
reach new levels of consultation with heads of state and 
government and im going to continue that next year but it wasnt 
limited obviously to eastern europe weve had a lot of 
consultations in this hemisphere and in asia as well 
we see democracy on the move and i want to be sure in 1990 that 
we play an active and appropriate role in encouraging democratic 
change and in being helpful to the countries that are going through 
unprecedented change 
youre familiar with the domestic agenda im disappointed in 
some ways that we didnt bring to fruition the changes in the clean 
air act on the environment and the education summit was deemed by 
most i believe to be a success and we are now following up 
indeed some of the governors were here last week to discuss a 
followon to the declarations coming out of the summit 
i was happy that at the end of the year weve got some ethics 
legislation passed and that there were other items that the 
crime package didnt go quite as the way i want to see it we 
need to move on it now in toto weve tried to push forward our 
thought on child care but obviously the congress has some 
different views on that 
on the minimum wage we took the position what the minimum wage 
ought to be congress tried to exceed that and to veto the 
legislation and that was passed in accordance with my wishes the 
program that i set out earlier and the sampl legislation was a major 
accomplishment but i continue to worry about the sampls 
the brady plan on third world debt received a lot of support 
around the world and i again weve got to follow through on 
that not just us but a lot of these private banks the private 
banks not just in the united states but in europe and elsewhere 
so we set a good groundwork early on as to how we can address 
ourselves to the debt problems plaguing people in this hemisphere 
so its been a year of obviously a beginning for this 
administration but new beginnings in terms of some of these 
initiatives as the year ends i think were on the brink of a 
tremendous opportunity and i look forward to next year when we can 
strengthen some of the initiatives that weve already taken and get 
going on our new programs work to ensure the economic that the 
economic recovery continues were now in the final throes of a 
budget process here but im very pleased that we were able to 
essentially keep my pledge to the american people last year that i 
would not raise taxes 
so those that is not an inclusive list but those are the ones 
that are mainly on my mind and if you said do you think its been 
a good year id say its been a pretty good year

christina orrcahall resigned monday as 
director of the corcoran gallery of art because of a barrage of 
criticism over her decision last summer to cancel a photography 
exhibit containing sexually explicit pictures 
the board of trustees of the 120yearold gallery the oldest in 
washington and third oldest private museum in the country agreed 
overwhelmingly to accept the resignation in the hope of laying the 
controversy to rest 
in a letter to the 54member board ms orrcahall said she was 
resigning effective feb 1 in the hope that my decision will help 
to eliminate or abate those extraneous and disruptive 
difficulties that have plagued the corcoran for the past six 
months 
gallery president freeborn g jewett jr said at a news 
conference that in all of dr orrcahalls actions and 
recommendations to the board of trustees she acted in the utmost 
good faith and had displayed qualities of professional skill 
courage and loyalty 
the corcoran became the target of nationwide criticism in june 
when ms orrcahall canceled a traveling exhibition by the late 
photographer robert mapplethorpe two weeks before it was scheduled 
to open july 1 
the corcoran trustees subsequently twice endorsed her decision 
ms orrcahall said she canceled the mapplethorpe show which 
contained homoerotic and sadomasochistic images and pictures of 
nude children to avoid embroiling the corcoran in a looming 
congressional battle over the grantmaking policies of the national 
endowment for the arts 
the endowment an independent federal agency had partially 
financed the mapplethorpe exhibits national tour organized by the 
institute of contemporary arts in philadelphia the show had 
appeared in philadelphia and chicago without incident 
ms orrcahalls decision however brought the wrath of the 
artistic community which accused the corcoran of stifling freedom 
of expression artists withdrew plans for two exhibitions of 
contemporary art at the corcoran and a third exhibition was left 
in limbo 
artist lowell nesbitt announced he had withdrawn a 15 million 
bequest to the corcoran from his will and would give the money 
instead to the phillips collection another private washington art 
gallery 
staff morale at the corcoran plunged with the resignation of 
jane livingston the museums chief curator who had arranged for 
the mapplethorpe show to appear there 
ms orrcahall former chief curator of the oakland museum in 
california previously had rejected a request by a representative 
of the corcoran staff that she resign 
but in her resignation letter monday she said that the time 
has arrived for the corcoran to turn its eyes to the future and to 
make every effort to assure that it is not consumed by the kind of 
contention that distracts the institution from achieving its 
goals 
the controversy also was noted by jewett 
events of the past several months have embroiled the corcoran 
in continuing public controversy a controversy that has interfered 
with the corcorans capacity to address its full energies and 
attention to the curatorial and educational tasks of the museum and 
the school that are the institutions fundamental 
responsibilities he said 
board chairman david lloyd kreeger a member of a special 
trustees committee appointed sept 25 to study ways to repair the 
damage said the panel was split on whether ms orrcahall should 
leave the gallery or remain 
he said the panel was ready to leave the decision on her fate up 
to the full board which he said also was divided over the issue 
kreeger and jewett said the director signaled her intention to 
resign during negotiations with board members last weekend 
kreeger said the trustees were not concerned about the 
mapplethorpe cancellation but were upset by the continued 
barrage of criticism that dogged the corcoran 
the directors decision he said was blown into a symbol 
of repression or pornography vs license freedom of speech 
political issues the future of the endowment and other issues 
mapplethorpe no longer is the issue because the director has 
resigned said kreeger who vowed that there is going to be a 
resurgent and a new and dynamic corcoran

q you mentioned noted that you were successful on no new 
taxes last year how should we read your lips for next year are 
you taking the same vow and is it as irreversible and irrevocable 
as it was this year 
bush as far as im concerned it is but i can say that i kept 
my promise to the american people and i want to continue keeping 
it 
q mr president i think on the minds of everyone today in 
terms of headline news is panama do you 
bush its certainly on my mind as a headline news ill tell 
you 
q well you said these were the things on your mind so it 
bush no but youre im glad you raised it because if you 
hadnt i had intended to because it was clearly on my mind 
q what are you going to do is it im not going to say what 
are you going to do 
bush no but let me just say one thing and put it into context 
one of the frustrations that ive had during this year is that is 
the whole panama situation an enormous frustration i see a 
little more reason to be hopeful in nicaragua although i have some 
serious concerns now about how free and fair those elections are 
going to be having talked to bob beckel and mary matalin in that 
thing but no im glad you brought it up helen because its an 
enormous frustration to me that the democratic system that was 
voted on in panama was totally put down by force 
q what are your options 
q what can you do about it i mean you have exhausted a lot of 
 
bush for one i can tell you how strongly i feel about it 
which ive just done and two review whatever actions might be 
available and three not discuss what they might be 
q well do you feel you do have options 
bush i think a president all presidents have options but 
they dont discuss what they might be 
q including military options 
bush presidents have options but they dont discuss what they 
might be 
q well does the murder of this officer american officer down 
there over the weekend does that show that actually the united 
states is pretty powerless to do anything in panama that they can 
do this and get away with it 
bush its an enormous outrage and a matter of enormous concern 
to this president 
q is there anything you can do about it 
bush its an enormous outrage and of tremendous concern to this 
president and i would refer you to the previous question and 
answer 
q mr president on the budget you say youre nearing the end 
of the budget process but it seems to me you want to stay in 
concrete on most of the things that were a part of the cold war 
you want the nuclear bombs in the air 24 hours a day and you dont 
seem to want to retreat whos the enemy 
bush helen were having a massive reevaluation of intentions 
as well as military threat and we have set a very aggressive arms 
control agenda and id like to see us take those steps and i 
think the soviets want to move forward in these areas of chemical 
reduction or elimination start cfe so lets go forward with our 
eyes open and do that and i think thats exactly what mr 
gorbachev wants to do and mr gorbachev they still have an 
enormous deployment of troops against us forces nato forces 
they still have an enormous arsenal and modernized nuclear weapons 
but the steps were taking can make the determination as to what 
the threat remains for the 90s and so i will not take any naive 
unilateral action but im determined to move forward on a sensible 
program of evaluation and on a sensible program of arms reduction 
which includes conventional forces 
q so there wont be any big cuts this year 
bush you saw the numbered bandied about out there and ill 
stand by that number although i cant confirm exactly what the 
final figure is going to be because were right down to the wire 
right now but if people are looking for us to go up there with 
massive cuts now i would say to them look put your energies on 
helping us get the kinds of agreements that will enable everybody 
to recommend massive cuts

the pantex nuclear weapons assembly plant in 
texas appeared to have no plan to handle mays accidental release 
of radioactive gas according to an advisory committee report to 
energy secretary james d watkins released monday 
it is still unclear that effective control of the situation by 
an adequately prepared response team ever took place john f 
ahearne chairman of the advisory committee on nuclear facility 
safety said in a letter to watkins 
the letter also raised questions about safety and environmental 
practices at pantex the nations only final assembly plant for 
nuclear bombs and missile warheads 
the committee said the response to the may release of tritium a 
radioactive gas was of variable quality 
radiation specialists and technicians responded properly to 
minimize workers exposure at the plant outside amarillo but 
missing was recognition that this unlikely event could take 
place and thus adequate procedures instrumentation and training 
were lacking the committee said 
although a quick and effective evacuation was conducted 
thereafter events are marked by confusion misread instruments 
and uncertain actions there appeared to be no plan to handle what 
surely must be an anticipated accident 
exposure to workers was below federal guidelines limiting 
radiation explosure and offsite exposure was trivial 
a team of government and outside experts recently inspected the 
plant and found pantex would be unable to respond effectively to 
emergencies involving releases of radioactive material 
watkins said those findings indicate workers lack adequate 
protection from emergency and rountine exposures to radioactive 
releases and that the situation must be corrected immediately 
pantex spokesman tom walton said the plant had begun correcting 
problems or will be addressing those in the very near future 
some safety violations were corrected immediately he said 
we of course are already looking at those things theyve 
identified and in areas that we need to improve obviously were 
going to make improvements walton said 
occupational safety and health administration investigators who 
also inspected the plant found more than 300 safety violations 
dozens of them serious

killings in the french quarter got widespread 
publicity but drugrelated shootings in lowincome areas made 1989 
new orleans most murderous year on record the head of the police 
force said monday 
two unrelated weekend killings brought the citys murder total 
so far this year to 242 two above the 1979 record of 240 police 
superintendent warren woodfork said 
almost 60 percent of the slayings were drugrelated and about 40 
percent took place in public housing projects woodfork said 
in spite of city budget problems mayor sidney barthelemy has 
promised more overtime money for the citys 1300member police 
force in 1991 saying expected federal grants will help 
woodfork said too many people are apathetic about the drug 
problem and complained that the media paint the wrong picture in 
covering new orleans murders 
look at the story you all tend to put out on the front page of 
the paper or the first story on television when a tourist is killed 
in the french quarter et cetera woodfork said but thats not 
the bulk of your homicides 
he referred to two widely publicized killings of french quarter 
visitors this year one man was shot to death by a robber and 
another was killed when he tried to intervene in a purse snatching 
those kind of homicides incidental to robberies if you look 
at the scheme of things thats small compared to the daytoday 
homicides in housing developments and other areas of the city im 
saying something needs to be done about those woodfork said 
in august federal uniform crime reports showed new orleans had 
the fourthhighest murder rate in the nation in 1988 with 228 
people killed 
according to the statistics released by woodfork the motive 
listed for 595 percent of the murders was narcotics arguments 
were the motive in 157 percent domestic disputes 95 percent 
robbery 785 percent 
motives in the remainder were listed as burglary child abuse or 
unknown 
woodfork said the public must fight drug abuse 
if its not your problem today i can guarantee you it will 
be yours tomorrow he said 
woodfork said other major cities also have seen their 1989 
murder rates increase including atlanta with 242 murders 
yeartodate compared to 219 for 1988 and washington dc with 
414 so far this year compared to 369 in 1988 
the two killings that pushed the city over its previous record 
occurred sunday 
in one two men were shot when they interrupted some horseplay 
among several other men outside a pool hall police said one died 
in the second killing a man was shot in the fischer housing 
project the victim and two other men had left an apartment and 
gotten into an argument the victim was shot three times police 
said they didnt know what the argument was about

a druguse survey of students nationwide found 
that white high school seniors are more apt to abuse drugs than 
black seniors according to figures released monday 
it goes against conventional wisdom particularly television 
has portrayed the problem of drug abuse in the united states as a 
black inner city problem said doug hall vice president of the 
national parents resource institute for drug education inc 
atlantabased pride surveyed 296180 white students and 59898 
black students in grades 612 at 958 schools in 38 states during 
the 198889 school year including students in inner city areas in 
atlanta chicago dallas houston new york and washington dc 
the key is keeping teenagers in school pride cofounder 
marsha keith schuchard said in a statement black students who 
stay in school have significantly fewer drug and alcohol problems 
the focus on innercity drug use by blacks feeds the 
increasing expressions of racism that surface daily in our 
country she said at a news conference announcing the survey 
results 
the preoccupation with blacks and crack also misleads white 
parents into underestimating the temptations and dangers their 
teens face from the multibilliondollar drug culture 
judge reggie walton associate director of the office of 
national drug control policy called drugs an american problem 
for all too long this problem has been portrayed as a black 
problem and i think the end result has been that there are some 
people who have not really cared a lot about it because of that 
he said this is an american problem not just a black problem 
the survey found that black students find cocaine about twice 
as available as white students but they use cocaine less than 
white students by a substantial amount hall said 
about 15 percent of black students overall said cocaine was easy 
to get compared with 8 percent of white students who responded 
that way he said noting that cocaine referred to both the powder 
and its smokable derivative crack 
however in the 12th grade in which some 40000 students were 
surveyed only 4 percent of the black students said they had used 
cocaine at least once in the previous year while 7 percent of 
white students said they had done so 
the picture changes a bit when the students were asked about 
frequency of use of cocaine 
three percent of black male seniors and 2 percent of white male 
seniors said they used cocaine very frequently meaning once a 
week three times a week or daily 
at the same time 4 percent of both black and white male seniors 
reported using cocaine frequently meaning at least once a 
month 
meanwhile 11 percent of black male seniors and 12 percent of 
white male seniors said they used marijuana very frequently and 14 
percent of black male seniors and 17 percent of white male seniors 
said they used liquor very frequently 
the students surveyed by pride filled out anonymous 
questionnaires that were spot checked internally with somewhat 
duplicated questions to determine the truthfulness of responses 
there also were occasional retests of groups of students hall said 
there was no overall margin of error because the results were 
based on actual responses and the survey was not a scientific 
random poll 
hall said the survey found that in general the girls used less 
drugs than the boys 
the person who is least likely to use is a black female he 
said 
in general use of drugs is greatest for white male seniors 
followed by black males white females and black females he said 
among the surveys findings for overall drug use for high school 
seniors boys and girls who had used certain drugs at least once 
in the year before they were questioned were 
hard liquor 65 percent of white seniors 37 percent of black 
seniors for high school students in general 57 percent of white 
students 29 percent of black students 
marijuana 29 percent of white seniors 17 percent of black 
seniors for all high school students 24 percent of white 
students 13 percent of black students 
as for intoxication levels a higher percentage of white male 
seniors than black male seniors reported getting very high bombed 
or stoned on liquor marijuana and cocaine 
for alcohol the figures were 42 percent of white male seniors 
saying they got very intoxicated vs 22 percent for black male 
seniors 
the figures were 23 percent for white males and 15 percent for 
black males for marijuana and 7 percent for white males and 5 
percent for black males for cocaine 
pride was founded by a group of parents to fight drug abuse

the federal aviation administration was 
advised eight days before the bombing of pan am flight 103 that the 
us embassy in moscow was warning employees of a terrorist threat 
against pan am flights on the same route a presidential panel 
disclosed monday 
faa officials acknowledged that they had received a telex from 
the embassy on dec 13 1988 but said they did nothing about it 
even though they said it is against government policy to warn 
employees but not the general public of such threats 
the issue of a dual standard in warnings of potential terrorism 
is one of several being taken up by the sevenmember presidental 
commission on aviation security and terrorism which held its 
second hearing into the dec 21 1988 bombing over lockerbie 
scotland of flight 103 in which 270 people died 
the panel also received the results of a congressional report 
that said steppedup security measures since the disaster may be 
ineffective at highrisk foreign airports due to a lack of training 
standards 
the report by the general accounting office faults the faa for 
not establishing minimum training requirements for people who 
screen baggage and conduct other security operations at foreign 
airports 
kenneth mead gao director for transportation issues told the 
commission that the congressional watchdog agency has found several 
fundamental deficiencies in faa security programs 
earlier reports he noted had found problems with passenger 
screening airport security controls and security inspections 
mead said the faa has concurred with most of the agencys 
findings and made some changes but does not keep close enough tabs 
on security on a daily basis 
sen alfonse damato rny a commission member said the 
congressional studies indicate that the faa and the present 
system have flunked when it comes to providing basic security 
systems that anyone can have confidence in 
damato said problems with the faa suggest there may be a 
conflict between its role of promoting aviation and that of 
ensuring passenger safety 
producing a copy of the telex from the moscow embassy to the 
faa damato said it proves the faa was aware that us officials 
were warning state department employees but not the general 
public about the threat 
since a number of people from this post will be flying out of 
frankfurt in the next two weeks post plans to issue an internal 
administrative notice warning employees of the threat said the 
telex to the faa no recommendation will be made as to course of 
action to be followed by travelers 
relatives of flight 103 victims say they believe several 
government employees changed reservations to get off the flight 
after the warning while the general public was not informed of the 
threat which specified a pan am flight within two weeks after dec 
5 en route from frankfurt to new york 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt and was en route to new york 
from london when it blew up 
officials later said the specific threat that had prompted the 
warning was not credible and they believe it was only a 
coincidence that it came just two weeks before the bombing

israel has opened an embassy in ethiopia and 
intends to establish a consular section to encourage the emigration 
of more jews to israel the foreign ministry said monday 
israeli officials have declined comment on persistent reports 
suggesting the renewal of ties would lead to israeli military aid 
to ethiopia in exchange from allowing more jews to leave 
the israeli embassy was opened sunday under the supervision of 
temporary representative meir yoffe and an ambassador in addis 
ababa will soon be appointed a foreign ministry spokesman said 
yoffe said his first priority would be establishing a consular 
section to deal with jewish emigration 
speaking on israel radio in a telephone interview from addis 
ababa yoffe indicated foreign minister moshe arens may visit 
ethiopia for the official opening ceremony he did not give a date 
for the ceremony 
a foreign ministry statement said earlier this month that israel 
hoped more jews would emigrate from ethiopia once israel 
established its embassy there 
ethiopia renewed diplomatic relations with israel on nov 3 it 
was one of more than 12 black african nations that severed ties 
with israel over the 1973 middle east war several have renewed 
relations since 1982 
it is a wonderful and exciting feeling said yoffe who was 
the last israeli diplomat to leave ethiopia in 1973 we are 
received with joy and sympathy by the government and in the 
streets in all the places we go people remember us 
the sunday times of london has said israel agreed to supply 
spare parts for soviet weapons in ethiopia in exchange for 
emigration of jews israel has captured soviet weapons from arab 
countries and palestinian guerrillas in lebanon 
ethiopian immigrants in israel say up to 18000 jews want to 
flee the east african nation which has suffered from drought and 
civil war 
there are already about 16500 ethiopian jews in israel about 
8000 of them were brought to israel in a dramatic usassisted 
operation moses airlift in november 1984january 1985 but 
reports of the airlift leaked out and embarrassed the ethiopias 
marxist government which ended the operation

reappraisal of the 15 million in aid that washington provides 
daily to el salvador 
the roman catholic church and the jesuits have concluded 
military men were almost certainly responsible for the massacre of 
the jesuits their housekeeper and her daughter a witness has 
testified she saw men in army uniforms near the priests oncampus 
residence shortly before the fatal shots were heard 
we believe president cristiani and military leaders are 
prepared to have any and all outside assistance to certify the 
exhaustiveness and thoroughness of the investigtion wherever it 
leads including if it leads to the military said deconcini 
fbi and scotland yard investigators as well as detectives from 
spain are collaborating in the inquiry 
deconcini said he would be flabbergasted if the 
investigation found highlevel military responsibility he said if 
such involvement were proven a cutoff in us aid would 
certainly be a possibility 
if a small armed forces contingent acting on its own is found to 
be responsible an aid cutoff would still be a possibility but 
not very likely he said 
if the government continues its forceful and aggressive 
investigation support in congress will be maintained deconcini 
said 
the salvadoran government has offered a reward of 250000 for 
information leading to the prosecution of those responsible for the 
massacre 
the jesuits were killed during a renewed offensive by leftist 
guerrillas trying to overthrow the government rightwing forces 
often view church people as guerrilla allies

president bush said monday the killing of an 
american serviceman in panama was an enormous outrage and that 
the united states was considering options to deal with manuel 
antonio noriega bush did not rule out military steps 
i think a president all presidents have options but they 
dont discuss what they might be bush said in an interview he 
repeated that answer when asked if military options were being 
reviewed 
questioned about noriegas declaration of a state of war 
between panama and the united states bush said ive taken note 
of his statement 
a highlevel interagency group met at the state department to 
discuss options on panama said sources who requested anonymity 
the united states has been trying to force noriegas ouster 
since his indictment in florida on drugsmuggling charges in 
february 1988 the united states supported an unsuccessful coup 
attempt against noriega oct 3 
on friday noriega declared a state of war with the united 
states and had himself installed by the national assembly as the 
countrys supreme leader 
the next day violence flared when four american officers 
traveling unarmed in civilian clothes and in a private car were 
trying to flee a crowd of panamanian troops and civilians after the 
car had been stopped at a panamanian roadblock the pentagon said 
one serviceman was killed when the panamanian soldiers opened 
fire another us officers ankle was grazed by a bullet 
after the shooting the panamanians arrested a us navy 
lieutenant and his wife who had been stopped earlier at the 
roadblock 
during four hours of interrogation the pentagon said that 
officer was repeatedly beaten and kicked in the groin and his wife 
was sexually thratened and slammed against a wall 
another incident occurred monday when an american officer shot 
and wounded a panamanian corporal near a us installation a 
southern command official said the official said the us officer 
believed the panamanian was drawing his weapon and felt threatened 
bush in an interview with the associated press and three other 
news agencies said one of the frustrations that ive had during 
this year is the whole panama situation an enormous frustration 
asked how the united states would respond to the officers 
death bush said its an enormous outrage and a matter of 
enormous concern to this president 
as for the steps available to him bush said for one i can 
tell you how strongly i feel about it which ive just done and 
two review whatever options might be available and three not 
discuss what they might be 
he said he wanted to have a free hand without having 
positioned myself on what it is i want to do 
meanwhile rep ike skelton dmo a member of the house armed 
services committee said the united states cant put up with 
noriegas actions and will have to take steps to stop the 
arrests detentions beatings and harassment of us forces 
the question is how do we do it skelton said do we wait 
for the pdf panamanian defense forces to stage another coup or do 
we take another step of unilateral military action 
bush and his predecessor former president reagan have hinted 
at military action against noriega but have refrained from a direct 
assault 
meanwhile white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
united states was very concerned about noriegas declaration of 
war he said it may have been a license for harassment and 
threats and in this case murder 
fitzwater said most us dependents have left panama or have 
been moved onto the us military base there he said that a 950 
pm curfew had been imposed over the weekend on us military 
personnel and that the base was on a high state of alert 
theres no question that its a dangerous situation 
fitzwater said 
he said the mistreatment of the naval officers wife certainly 
goes beyond any previous experience and the murder is outrageous 
in itself 
the united states has 12000 troops stationed in panama

q mr president the issue of china is on a lot of peoples 
minds you seem to approach china differently than you approach 
some other countries i know when you talked to mr gorbachev you 
gave him a list of human rights cases you want to resolve earlier 
in the year in your texas aampm speech you laid out a number of 
conditions and challenges to the soviet union with china you seem 
to take almost a kidglove approach i mean do you feel that they 
require and demand different treatment or special treatment 
bush some think up until recently the approach wasnt kid 
glove it was almost isolation thats what some felt mike before 
i sent a mission over there some thought that we were just totally 
isolating china so i dont quite understand your comparison 
q well there was a massacre in tiananmen square and a few 
bush and we strongly disapproved of it and spoke out against 
it and i still strongly disapprove of it and im delighted to 
speak out against it so why are you what is you i missed your 
question 
q well was there ever any consideration of a more lowkey 
meeting for example without toasts and dinners which may have 
sent some people a signal somewhat different than outrage but of 
the let bygones by bygones 
bush i dont think anyone is sending that kind of that 
anything should be read into that i know some of my political 
opponents have done that theres a concerted effort by the 
democratic party to do that by their leadership by the chairman 
of the democratic national committee but he is burdened with a 
lack of knowledge about china 
q mr president when do you expect mr fang lizhi will be 
allowed to leave the country 
bush i dont know when that will happen 
q did you get any concessions 
bush i wont discuss the specifics 
q why 
bush because i dont believe in doing that helen 
q they didnt promise you anything 
bush im more interested in action than i am in premature 
speculation and i notice now that some of the critics who were so 
opposed in using this fantastically diabolically antime language 
they come up now in saying well if you get a b and c then it 
will be all right or then well understand let them just stay 
tuned in 
q well did you get any concessions im not asking 
bush im not going to discuss what i did or didnt get 
q but theres still plenty 
bush you see i still believe that sometimes to effect change 
you talk in confidence to people now i know that doesnt go 
thats not in keeping with your line of work you want everything 
to be public and i understand it but ive got to say im very 
sorry im not going to discuss it 
q youre out on a limb praising the reforms democratic 
movement in eastern europe and you go and salute a brutal regime 
bush i dont think its a salute 
q it seems very 
bush but i do if the question is do i want to further 
isolate a billionplus people the answer is no and if the 
question is do i think we can do i think by having certain kinds 
of relations with china not only have we furthered the move more 
openness but can in the future i think the answer is yes 
q well youre dealing with a country youre not dealing with 
a billion people youre dealing with a regime that 
bush yes but youre dealing with the aspirations of a billion 
people and i happen to think that some of the contacts that 
theyve had with the united states have led to a better life for 
the billion people 
q mr president there were some 
bush and i think thats an important point to make and that 
isnt in any way condoning the brutality that everybody in the 
world saw in tiananmen square and what i object to is the way 
michael some of the people phrase put things into him so that 
he phrased his question the way he did because that is not a good 
rap and its not true and for those who suggest it is they ought 
to just be a little patient and wait and see and ive noticed a 
lot of people that know china best seem to think that maybe this is 
the way to effect positive change 
q there were some words of moderation 
bush so im you know im just going to stay with my position 
and take on a little heat from time to time and well wait and see 
what happens 
q did you expect this kind of heat 
bush it hadnt been that much 
q are you kidding 
bush well you think so i dont think so 
q well i can assure you that people out there really 
bush out where 
q out in everywhere 
bush but not after this interview because theyll understand it 
more laughter theyve been dealing with emotion and not facts

top advances 
they were 
the 27th woman an alltime high sworn in as a member of the

in a concession to environmentalists the 
energy department will not restart its savannah river defense 
nuclear reactors until an environmental impact study is completed 
according to a department letter obtained monday 
it was not immediately clear whether the decision would mean a 
further delay in restarting the three reactors which were shut 
down last year to undergo massive safety upgrades worker 
retraining and management restructuring 
the first of the reactors the nations only source of tritium 
needed to make nuclear warheads is tentatively scheduled to resume 
production next fall 
energy secretary james d watkins told members of the house and 
senate armed services committees in letters sent friday that he 
decided to drop the departments objection to completing the 
environmental study before restarting the reactors 
the department had agreed a study was needed but maintained 
there was no legal requirement to finish it before resuming tritium 
production 
because the decisionmaking process will be enhanced by the 
information and opportunity for public comment presented by the eis 
environmental impact study the department will complete the eis 
before it makes any decision to resume production watkins wrote 
a copy of the letter was released by the office of rep james 
hansen rutah a committee member 
department spokesman will callicott said he could not 
immediately comment on the decision except to say an environmental 
impact statement is being developed and is tentatively scheduled 
for completion in august 
three national environmental groups greenpeace the natural 
resources defense council and the energy research foundation sued 
the energy department in december 1988 seeking to force completion 
of the study before restart 
dan reicher an attorney for the natural resources defense 
council said his group had not seen details of watkins decision 
but that it appeared the energy department had conceded defeat 
it appears to us weve had a major victory reicher said 
it looks as though the energy department has seen the error of 
its ways

both east german reformers and west germanys 
opposition social democrats said monday the sovereignty of both 
germanys must be protected at tuesdays summit where the issue of 
reunification will be raised 
representatives of 16 east german political parties 
prodemocracy groups and social organizations holding their second 
session on the nations future said monday the summit was a sign of 
both hope and a possible danger 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany and hans modrow the 
communist premier of east germany are to meet in dresden on 
tuesday and wednesday 
kohl has made clear that his government seeks eventual 
reunification of germany which has been divided since 1945 
modrow and many other east germans however feel joining the 
two states would threaten the stability of europe and result in a 
sellout of east german land and industry 
monday night in leipzig about 200 proreunification activists 
tried to disrupt a silent procession of about 200000 people 
bearing candles to commemorate victims of past intolerance they 
were hushed quickly 
delegates to the east german talks said the kohlmodrow meetings 
express the expectation that the visit will contribute to the 
building of relations between east germany and west germany 
they alwo warned however that kohls visit may in no case 
put the sovereignty or state identity of either german nation in 
question 
the broad forum includes communist party chief gregor gysi as 
well as interim president manfred gerlach of the liberal democrats 
and pairs of representatives from the neues forum opposition group 
and more than a dozen others 
many of the small parties and citizens movements are 
positioning themselves for the forthcoming election campaign for 
parliamentary seats as well as airing their views on how the 
nation should be reformed after four decades of communist 
domination 
east germanys first free elections are set for may 6 a result 
of the first forum held dec 7 
under pressure from mass prodemocracy protests east germany in 
the past two months also has ousted its hardline leaders opened 
the berlin wall and other borders and ushered in reforms 
in west berlin the opposition social democratic party opened 
its national convention monday focusing on how the two german 
nations should be brought together in the new age of open borders 
party leader hansjochen vogel who is likely to challenge kohl 
in federal elections for the west german leadership a year from 
now said east germany must be allowed to find its own path 
vogel appealed for a bordertranscending solidarity to 
prevent further mass emigration from east germany 
more than 300000 east germans have fled to west germany in 
1989 many giving up hope that their state could rectify its 
daunting economic problems or institute democracy in the place of 
stalinism 
the westward tide has ebbed somewhat since the borders were 
opened nov 9 and east germans were allowed to come and go as they 
pleased 
but germans on both sides of the border fear that if visible 
improvement in the lives of east germans is not achieved soon the 
exodus will increase 
gerlach who was named interim president dec 6 after former 
leader egon krenz was forced to resign said the situation is 
already critical 
gerlach said the basic supply of goods and services to the 
public is threatened after jan 1 if labor and distribution are not 
improved by then 
an east german newspaper disclosed monday that a new law on 
trade unions to be presented to parliament will include a right to 
strike 
neues forum on monday urged both german states to recognize 
the current borders in europe the appeal aims to fix the postwar 
territorial order in europe thereby preventing formal 
reunification 
the major problems facing our world securing peace 
improving the environment social and economic issues are not 
solvable by single states the leading opposition group contended 
gerlach conceded that despite resistance by both unofficial 
citizens groups and the parties represented in parliament 
reunification is forcing itself into negotiations 
there may be no formal negotiations but in reality it is 
being discussed in both states said gerlach who opposes any 
union with west germany that would result in loss of east german 
sovereignty 
the talks got off to a disorderly start with hundreds of angry 
demonstrators shouting outside the groundfloor conference room 
where the party and citizen group representatives were assembled 
speakers inside couldnt be heard above the noise of protesters 
chanting through bullhorns that they wanted to be included at the 
talks 
anyone who tries to push his participation in this way is not 
acting in the interests of democracy gerlach said 
the participants agreed to include nine other groups at the 
talks as representatives or observers 
discussion of proposals for a new constitution and laws on the 
media political groups campaign funding and other issues 
connected with the reform movement will be carried on state radio 
and tv they decided 
they agreed to hold regular meetings mondays through the interim 
period before elections but the next regular session was set for 
dec 27 in view of the christmas holiday 
they also decided to meet friday to discuss economic problems 
with deputy premier christa luft 
another new political party was founded monday adding to the 
dozens already in existence the new group named itself nelken or 
the cloves and said it would adhere to traditional marxist 
principles

q well isnt that what life is all about 
bush once they deal with a full deck i expect people will 
understand it but there are some times in this job youve got to 
do something like that and you just have to worry about it youve 
got to you know have the conviction that youre doing what you 
think is correct thats what the people elected me to do this 
gets way over any other issue incidentally and so i cant worry 
if youd asked me 10 years ago so and so criticized you all the 
people out there are criticizing you doesnt this concern you and 
youd have gotten an honest answer out of me id probably have 
said yeah but not any more because in this job you dont do 
that you do what you think is correct if you screw something up 
you say hey i was wrong but if youre right you dont need to 
get instant credit for it so you just try to do your best 
q can we move beyond china and let me ask you about another 
part of the world there were some words of moderation out of iran 
after the death of ayatollah khomeini but nothing concrete seems 
to have happened since then are we missing anything 
bush i dont think were missing anything but i think your 
predicate is correct there 
q well but has there my predicate that there has been no 
concrete action 
bush yes 
q there hasnt been 
bush i havent seen anything that i can consider particularly 
hopeful but well continue to be alert for anything that the 
iranians decide to do 
q so its a year later for the hostages in iran 
bush exactly 
q in lebanon 
bush and thats an enormous frustration to me i wrote notes to 
the families the other day and i just at the end of the year 
you count your own blessings and you have to go through your mind 
the concerns you feel about others and this one i feel very 
strongly about and i feel a regret that i havent been able to 
facilitate the release of these hostages 
on the other side of the world i feel pleased that thanks to 
the good work of general vessey weve been able to further account 
for americans missing and im talking obviously about vietnam 
but in this one i feel a personal frustration about it its on my 
mind an awful lot and if we want to talk about frustrations i 
feel that about the lack of peace and tranquility in lebanon i 
feel we could go around the world because ive tried to 
highlight positive things here but theres been some like this 
one terry that i feel frustrated about at years end the holding 
of these kinds the young people 
q mitterrand said that you couldnt have a palestinian solution 
without the palestinian participation 
bush yes thats right 
q in the transcript do you agree 
bush well i think what jim baker is trying to work out is to 
have a voice of palestinians at the talks and its a very 
difficult process but mubarak tried to do the same thing 
q why is it difficult 
bush simply because it is difficult and the discussions 
compelling israel to negotiate with a particular palestinian entity 
is impossible so find a way to get talks going and thats what i 
would like to see us do and thats what were trying hard to do 
q can you have any kind of real or meaningful peace settlement 
in that region without the plo participating which is the entity 
you no doubt were referring to 
bush you crawl before you walk and were not theres no 
intention on our part to compel israel or anybody else to deal with 
any specific entity we are trying to be a catalyst for peace in 
the area and its plagued administrations in the past its gone 
back over hundreds of years differences that exist on these 
questions so find some common ground and try to move the process 
forward and then cross each bridge as you come to it

rep sam gejdenson dconn chairman of the subcommittee on 
international economic policy and trade of the house foreign 
affairs committee said bush had misled the american people and 
the congress 
how does the white house square that earlier trip with their 
statements at the time that highlevel contacts with the chinese 
were cut off gejdenson said 
ron brown chairman of the democratic national committee said 
there has not been a decision so out of touch with american 
values since the sale of arms to the ayatollah president bush 
has demonstrated yet again that he doesnt see the connection 
between human lives human rights and an effectvie foreign policy 
a white house statement monday said the july trip was intended 
to underscore us shock and concern about the violence in 
tiananmen square and to impress upon the chinese government the 
seriousness with which this incident was viewed in the united 
states 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said he could not 
rule out the possibility that scowcroft or other us officials had 
made other trips to china that still remain secret 
the white house confirmed the july visit only because it was 
reported by the cable news network fitzwater said the december 
visit was disclosed after scowcroft and eagleburger had landed in 
beijing 
of the july trip fitzwater said the president has had years 
of experience with china and he knows that facetoface 
declarations are important to them 
bush meanwhile said that criticism ignited by news of the dec 
8 trip was subsiding and that remaining skeptics should be a 
little patient and wait and see how beijing responds 
theyve been dealing with emotion and not facts once they 
deal with a full deck i expect people will understand it bush 
said 
he refused to say whether china had offered any concessions in 
return for his decision to rekindle relations with beijing in the 
aftermath of the june killings 
bush said he does not know when chinese dissident fang lizhi 
would be able to leave the us embassy in beijing where he has 
taken refuge since the crackdown fitzwater said scowcroft had 
denied there were any negotiations going on with china about an 
acceptable country where fang might go 
the president who has been accused by democrats of 
kowtowing to the chinese leaders said im just going to 
stay with my position and take on a little heat from time to time 
already bush said i notice now that some of the critics who 
were so opposed and using this fantastically diabolically antime 
language they come up now saying well if you get a b and c 
then it will be all right or then well understand let them just 
stay tuned in 
bush made his comments in a yearend interview with the 
associated press and three other news agencies 
on other topics the president 
said a bill he signed to bail out the savings and loan industry 
was a major accomplishment but i continue to worry about the 
sampls he did not elaborate 
said his pledge against raising taxes this year was good for 
1990 as far as im concerned he said he had kept his vow in 
1989 and i want to continue keeping it 
scoffed at reports that colombian drug lords had put up a 30 
million assassination contract on his life there is nothing to 
it bush said let me take this opportunity to reassure the 
american people that we will not unduly risk anyones life here and 
that i feel confident that the security provisions in cartagena 
will guarantee the safety of the president of the united states 
bush plans to attend a meeting of andean leaders in the colombian 
city in february to discuss the drug fight 
said he felt enormous frustration that americans are still 
held as hostages in lebanon its on my mind an awful lot bush 
said adding that he had written notes recently to families of the 
hostages the president said the tone of moderation in iran after 
the death of the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini has not been backed up 
by action 
said the united states will not compel israel to deal with the 
palestine liberation organization to get peace in the middle east 
bush also said he was frustrated by the violence in lebanon 
declared the united states will play an active and 
appropriate role in encouraging democratic reforms in eastern 
europe but said those changes will not automatically translate into 
huge spending cuts for the pentagon 
on another matter bush said he felt enormous frustration 
that panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega remained in power 
despite us sanctions and support for a failed coup attempt in 
october 
the president said the weekend slaying of an american officer in 
panama was an enormous outrage and a matter of enormous concern 
to this president 
asked if the united states was powerless to act bush said i 
think a president all presidents have options but they dont 
discuss what they might be he repeated that answer when asked if 
military steps were being considered

q could i ask you about the drug summit 
bush yes 
q on domestic trips its frequently not announced that youre 
going to go some place until about two or three days ahead of time 
because of security concerns but here it is two months before 
this drug summit in colombia where theres been a lot of violence 
and the trip has already been announced doesnt that sort of 
invite some type of attack or assassination attempt by these drug 
lords 
bush i dont think so and i think that here were dealing with 
an international meeting thats been discussed for a long time 
its not as if it were just something thats a spurofthemoment 
meeting weve talked about an andean summit for a long long time 
and the president of colombia was anxious to go forward with the 
announcement and let it be known that we were going to have the 
summit so i think its different than just kind of a dropin on 
some event here in the united states i mean we announced the 
summit with the soviet union you know months ahead of time we 
got the g7 meeting was set a long long time ago so id say 
this is more in keeping with how you handle normal international 
conferences 
q is reporting that there has been a specific threat against 
you it said about 30 million 
bush i wish theyd bring the source in so we could take a look 
at it theres nothing to it i really think thats id better 
read it before i wax indignant 
q will you feel responsible if anyone 
bush tell me what it said 
q it said that some drug lords have said that they are ready to 
spend 30 million to have you assassinated 
bush were there any quotes which drug lord or anything about it

bush thats what i saw something about rumors well i just 
wonder if i was missing something ive got total confidence in our 
security people i am not going to do anything reckless you know 
me laughter and i am going to be as supportive as i can of 
president barco and weve got outstanding secret service people 
and so let me take this opportunity to reassure the american people 
that we will not unduly risk anyones life here and that i know 
that i feel confident that the security provisions in cartagena 
will guarantee the safety of the president of the united states 
q mr president isnt the nature of the meeting though doing 
it on a military base as i understand it for about three hours so 
we can get out of town quickly in itself an implicit admission 
bush listen nobody has to go but me im the only one whos 
invited so where do you get this we stuff tonto laughter

laughter 
q so that means no state of war 
bush youre asked your followup to her question 
q there is a state of war what do you think about it 
bush ive told you what i think about it 
mr fitzwater lets go 
q what do you think youve learned the most in this last year 
was it that you have a responsibility that is more i mean you 
act differently now in decisionmaking 
bush i think some of what i learned is what i mentioned to mike 
in that long soliloquy youve got to get the best information you 
can weve got a good team take that information onboard make a 
decision and then you know if you mess it up say look i was 
wrong and if you but not worry if you draw a little flak that 
just goes with the territory but i dont want to be in the 
position and i will never be as long as i am in this job of the 
handwringing position of oh this is the loneliest job in the 
world and no one understands it isnt its not lonely weve got 
a lot of good support and so i think youre right kind of 
fingering that area is something ive learned listen do your 
best i learned that from my mother 
but as russell bakers mother used to say pull yourself up by 
your bootstraps my mother said just do your very best and as 
long as i can give that to the american people and act in a prudent 
not a reckless but prudent way knowledgeable way on events 
dont worry about it if everybody doesnt agree all those people 
are telling you that expressing some concern about china fine 
ive got to do what i think is right and thats what i think i was 
elected to do 
q sounds trumanesque 
bush and well see how it plays out well see how it works 
out and im very confident so i end the year with more confidence 
than i started it but i hope not arrogance or overconfidence 
q thank you 
bush merry christmas and a happy new year to every little snow 
bunny

little tired i got a little dragged out after that trip down there

government leaders will begin 
talks with the kremlin this week on withdrawing soviet troops 
stationed in czechoslovakia since the 1968 invasion that crushed 
reforms officials said monday 
also on monday the communist partys daily newspaper apologized 
on its front page for its past practice of vilifying many of the 
people who have emerged as leaders of the reform drive 
the party leader karel urbanek was quoted as saying the 
communists probably will try to form a coalition with other parties 
before free elections planned next year 
premier marian calfa and foreign minister jiri dienstbier a 
noncommunist and former dissident are scheduled to visit moscow 
on wednesday at the invitation of soviet premier nikolai ryzhkov 
the state news agency ctk said dienstbier would begin 
negotiations for the pullout of the estimated 80000 soviet troops 
stationed in czechoslovakia dienstbier said thursday their 
withdrawal was expected soon but gave no details 
all the hardline leaders installed after the 1968 sovietled 
invasion have been ousted and the five warsaw pact nations that 
participated in the invasion have since condemned it 
the foreign minister has said the agreement allowing the 
presence of soviet troops in czechoslovakia was invalid because it 
was signed under pressure by alexander dubcek leader of the 
illfated prague spring reforms 
dubcek signed the initial document permitting the soviet 
presence after tense negotiations in the kremlin where he was 
flown after the invasion a second agreement was signed by prague 
and moscow in october 1968 
for two decades afterward the official communist daily rude 
pravo tried to discredit dubcek and former dissident vaclav havel 
now a leading presidential candidate 
stories like stool pigeon who is vaclav havel dubceks 
journey from tragedy to farce and others did not express the 
true attitudes of most of the papers editors according to the 
newspapers apology monday 
in a separate article rude pravo quoted urbanek as saying a 
party congress this week must drawn on the ideas of dubceks 
reforms and renew itself to survive 
it is more than probable already now that the communist party 
should go into the free elections in a coalition with other 
leftist parties which already exist as well as those to be 
established in the future he said 
the party that dominated czechoslovakia for 41 years has been 
forced into the idea of a coalition by a peaceful revolt that began 
nov 17 ended the partys guaranteed monopoly on power and led to 
the naming of a federal government dominated by noncommunists 
officials have said free elections which would be the first in 
czechoslovakia in 43 years could be held in june or july 
the battle over the vacant presidency is the latest battle 
between the communists and the opposition group civic forum which 
is pushing for the election of havel its leader 
hardline president gustav husak resigned dec 10 after swearing 
in the new government under current law parliament must elect a 
new president within 14 days but an amendment under consideration 
would extend that period to up to 40 days 
both sides admitted last week that the deadline might have to be 
extended 
the official ctk news agency said about 10000 people 
demonstrated monday in ceske budejovice in south bohemia in support 
of havel 
havel a playwright whose works were once banned said saturday 
he would accept the presidency only temporarily until someone can 
be elected for the fiveyear term by a new freely elected federal 
assembly 
dubcek has also been mentioned as a presidential candidate 
the socialist party once closely allied with the communists but 
increasingly independent on monday announced it backed havels 
candidacy 
cestmir cisar who was proposed for the presidency by the 
official socialist youth union said on national tv monday he was 
not interested in being a candidate

prodemocracy activists who had 
marched noisily each week since early fall set aside bullhorns and 
banners monday night for a silent vigil to honor the victims of 
stalin 
an estimated 200000 people took part many carried candles 
through the darkened winter streets around karl marx platz for 15 
minutes after a memorial service for those mistreated during what 
now is called the intolerance of the past 
in september and early october reformers were beaten and jailed 
for taking part in protests 
adn the official news agency put the crowd at more than 
100000 but an associated press reporter in leipzig estimated the 
total at 200000 
demonstrations also were reported in other east german cities 
adn said about 30000 people marched through karlmarxstadt at 
first silently but then with growing chants of germany united 
fatherland 
at halle opposition speakers were booed when they spoke against 
reunification the agency said it did not say how many people 
demonstrated 
several hundred candlebearing demonstrators marched silently 
through central east berlin to commemorate victims of stalinism and 
about 3000 people demonstrated for a clean environment in 
schwerin it said 
leipzig church leaders and protest organizers had asked 
demonstrators to be silent this week and most marchers honored the 
call for a solemn memorial 
recent monday night protests aimed at keeping pressure on the 
communistdominated government for more democratic change escalated 
into shouting matches between supporters of saving a sovereign east 
germany and a growing minority seeking reunification with west 
germany 
isolated groups of reunification advocates disrupted the silent 
march at times with shouts of germany united fatherland but 
they were quickly hushed by others who whistled their disapproval 
or implored them to cease chanting 
there were no speeches by organizers at the march another break 
with a tradition that has made the leipzig event a forum for airing 
grievances and proposals 
a few signs on the march route expressed solidarity with 
prodemocracy movements in other east european nations especially 
in hardline romania 
freedom also for romania declared one sign 
the discipline exhibited by most marchers was likely a result of 
leaflets distributed in advance of the event by leipzig conductor 
kurt masur a respected leader of the reform effort 
the whole of europe hopes along with us that the future 
leipzig monday demonstrations after jan 8 will continue peacefully 
as has been the case until now and that the great idea of a united 
europe can become reality masur wrote we germans will in this 
way naturally grow together and retain the trust of our neighbors 
activists have decided against holding protests on the next two 
mondays because of the christmas and new years holidays 
despite the appeals about 200 participants tried to stir up the 
gathering 
free elections and one united germany were among the 
political slogans hoisted by those who broke the silence 
some people in the crowd said they suspected the ultrarightist 
west german republicans party had infiltrated the marches to raise 
the issue of reunification 
a young student from dresden said she had been fearful of a 
confrontation as the demonstration last monday was a little too 
aggressive 
i was really afraid but im very glad that this went off so 
peacefully said the woman who did not give her name 
worries about a turn toward violence and a rift in the reform 
movement mounted after last weeks demonstration reached a fever 
pitch but there were no reports of incidents monday 
the rallys exceptional solemnity was not expected to dampen 
popular sentiment for reunification 
it would all have been in vain if we dont become a unified 
fatherland again one elderly demonstrator told west germanys 
zdf television network 
i am for a unified germany i am prepared to wait but i 
cannot wait too long said another younger participant 
leipzig was a hotbed of the democratic movement that forced east 
germanys communist leaders to open the borders nov 9 and 
relinquish much of their power 
among the reasons for leipzigs role are a strong church 
movement that served as rallying point for democracy activists when 
authorities still had tight control over dissent and the serious 
deterioration of the city

police said monday they had arrested 
a man in the attempted bombing last month of a saudi arabian 
airlines jet with 339 people aboard 
they said the bomb on the boeing 747 did not explode because a 
detonator wire apparently jarred loose they said it was timed to 
go off while the plane was over the arabian sea on a flight nov 23 
from islamabad to jidda saudi arabia 
officials would not reveal the name or nationality of the 
suspect but said he was a mechanical engineer from an arab country 
who is known to be an extremist 
we do not want to give other details yet as the investigation 
is still under way said mohammad habib khan director of the 
federal investigation agency 
an agency press release said the suspect admitted guilt after 
witnesses identified him it said he handed a school bag containing 
a crude time bomb to a saudi passenger identified as abu amaar who 
was told the bag contained stamps and a book to be collected by 
someone in jiddah 
amaar is in custody in saudi arabia but we expect him to be 
sent here soon for questioning khan told the associated press 
authorities have not explained how the device escaped detection 
during normally careful screening of baggage at the islamabad 
airport 
the nov 23 flight was diverted to karachi a port city in 
southern pakistan after security officers at the islamabad airport 
received a note demanding 15 million ransom officials said 
a taxi driver delivered the note which said the saudi jetliner 
would blow up unless the money in 500 bills was delivered to a 
specified location in islamabad officials said it was not clear 
why the ransom was demanded when the bomb was set to go off 
automatically 
it was discovered after the jumbo jet landed and passengers were 
ordered to identify their luggage experts said the bomb contained 
only eight ounces of dynamite but could have caused enough damage 
to destroy the plane in flight 
in its press release the police agency said the suspect became 
acquainted with amaar in the pakistani city of peshawar near the 
border with afghanistan and they traveled together on a bus from 
peshawar to islamabad a few days before the flight 
police recovered a pistol and ammunition from the suspect along 
with false papers

the owner of an illegal casino on a mohawk 
indian reservation pleaded guilty to gambling charges on the first 
day of his federal trial monday saying he made the plea so he 
could appeal 
in order to take this case to the next level i had to make a 
plea no matter how much i feel im innocent anthony laughing 
said outside the courtroom 
laughing a 42yearold mohawk pleaded guilty to single counts 
of possession of slot machines operating an illegal gambling 
business and resisting arrest under a plea bargain prosecutors 
dropped six other counts 
the plea came after a 90minute conference that followed 
assistant us attorney john brunettis opening argument in the 
trial 
laughing is to be sentenced feb 27 he faces up to 10 years in 
prison if given the maximum penalties for each of the three counts 
he entered conditional pleas to the gambling charges reserving 
the right to appeal the charges on the basis of indian sovereignty 
issues 
laughing and 12 other mohawks who were arrested in a july 20 
raid by state and federal law enforcement officers contend the st 
regis indian reservation is a sovereign nation and that state and 
federal laws do not apply there 
laughing said he wanted to get his case to the next federal 
level more quickly rather than endure an extended trial i am 
innocent and if i have to appeal this all the way to the supreme 
court i will he said 
his attorney michael vavonese said an appeal would be filed 
with the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york city after 
sentencing 
laughing also said he did not believe he would receive a fair 
trial before us district judge neal mccurn because mccurn has 
ruled repeatedly in the governments favor 
mccurn earlier this year rejected the sovereignty argument in 
pretrial motions citing other indian cases where courts have ruled 
that federal and state governments have jurisdiction on indian 
reservations 
mccurn allowed laughing to remain free on 300000 bail but 
continued a us magistrates order that he report to authorities 
twice daily and be at home overnight to receive a call from them 
laughing owns tonys vegas international the largest of seven 
highstakes casinos on the reservation which straddles the 
uscanadian border in northern new york 
he avoided arrest in the july 20 raid and was a fugitive for 
two months until being caught sept 21 after a chase by state 
troopers 
laughings case is the fifth to be resolved three other mohawks 
have either been convicted or pleaded guilty to gambling charges a 
fifth mohawk was acquitted when prosecutors failed to prove he was 
the owner of a truck stop where state police seized slot machines

the state department renewed its criticism on 
monday of cuban arms shipments to central america and said it is 
time for cuba to stop acting like a renegade nation 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said cuba should stop 
sending weapons to nicaraguas leftist government and nicaragua 
should stop sending such arms on to salvadoran rebels 
she said that cuba must begin shouldering more responsibility 
than before because it will soon become a member of the un 
security council 
it needs now to begin acting in a way consistent with the 
great responsibility it will bear in the council she said 
her statement suggested a shift in emphasis about the us view 
of who is to blame for the continuing upheaval in central america 
the administration previously had said the soviet union had a 
duty to persuade cuba and nicaragua to block the transfer of soviet 
bloc weapons to the salvadoran insurgency 
in her remarks on monday ms tutwiler seemed to play down 
soviet responsibility for the continuing violence in central 
america but under questioning she said that the administration 
has not backed away from its previous view and that central america 
continues to be a divisive issue for moscow and washington 
the administration does not challenge moscows contention that 
it has ceased direct arms deliveries to central america but 
officials say they are convinced that some soviet weapons arrive in 
central america via third countries especially cuba 
monday evening in response to a press question the state 
department said that cuba continues to be one of six countries on a 
us government list of countries that support international 
terrorism 
cuba continues to provide safe haven weapons and political 
and financial support to a wide range of leftist and insurgent 
organizations that use terrorism the department said 
it said cuba supports a colombian leftist group that has 
attacked western economic interests 
in addition it said that the salvadoran rebel group backed by 
cuba has publicly threatened americans assisting the salvadoran 
government as legitimate targets of assassination 
also cuba has supported a leftist group in chile believed 
responsible for several international terrorist incidents in recent 
years the department said 
joining cuba on the state department terrorism list are iran 
syria libya south yemen and north korea 
cuba in turn regards the united states as the country most 
prone to international adventurism worldwide it has cited repeated 
ussponsored assassination attempts against president fidel 
castro and largescale american military involvement in central 
america 
castro recently accused the united states of directly 
intervening in the internal affairs of the philippines by lending 
air support to president corazon aquino during the recent coup 
attempt 
beyond that castro said that the worldwide us network of 
military bases gives the united states the capability to intervene 
in virtually any region on short notice

soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze signed a farreaching trade agreement with the 
european community on monday a major step toward getting needed 
western help for his nations ailing economy 
on tuesday shevardnadze will pay an unprecedented visit to the 
north atlantic treaty organization the center of the western 
military alliance 
he called the 10year accord the first between moscow and the 
12nation trading bloc truly innovative 
its nature reflects the dynamism of the process of renewal in 
europe he said 
he later had what was described as a relaxed dinner with the 12 
ec foreign ministers he was like a colleague we have known for 
many years said belgiums foreign minister mark eyskens 
hans van den broek the dutch minister said shevardnadze 
discussed the upheaval in eastern europe and the soviet unions own 
economic reform program among other issues 
his message was we do not deny the economic situation is 
difficult but grant us more time van den broek said 
on eastern europe he was so far as to say that had the 
reforms occurred a few years ago it could have happened with fewer 
shocks he added 
van den broek said shevardnadze lauded western leaders for 
insisting that change must come in europe but not at the expense of 
stability west german sources said the same point was made at a 
separate meeting shevardnadze had with foreign minister 
hansdietrich genscher of west germany 
the soviet minister said the trade and economic cooperation 
agreement he signed at a ceremony at ec headquarters would help 
overcome the division of the european continent 
he said it gives food for collective thinking about creating 
an economic complex on our continent 
french foreign minister roland dumas whose country holds the 
communitys rotating presidency hailed the arrangement as 
facilitating the integration of the soviet union into the world 
economy 
frans andriessen the communitys topranking trade official 
cautioned that the pacts success depended on soviet efforts to 
achieve a more marketoriented economy 
the agreement will gradually get rid of most import quotas on 
agricultural and industrial products from the soviet union and set 
out closer cooperation in areas including nuclear energy and 
safety financial services environmental protection and management 
training 
in return the kremlin has promised to give western european 
businesses greater access to its potentially enormous consumer 
market 
now the agreement is to be put into practice shevardnadze 
said we are ready for it and we intend to continue to work in 
earnest keeping up the high tempo and the spirit of creative 
cooperation 
he said he did not request the meeting with nato 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner but simply raised the 
question of whether there would be a chance to visit the alliance 
we have to take the first step even if the fleets are facing 
each other he said 
he said he had no particular hidden thoughts visiting nato 
questioned about whether the kremlin intended to join the 
western alliance he joked he would take a look tuesday and 
decide whether its worth joining up now 
he made a pitch for dismantling the western group of 17 nations 
formed to keep sensitive technology out of the hands of the east 
bloc nations but he said easing its restrictions was up to the 
united states the key partner in the western drive 
the accord is the fourth the community has negotiated with 
eastern european countries since it established in june 1988 formal 
ties with the socialist economic bloc the council for mutual 
economic assistance 
the community has trade and economic cooperation accords with 
poland and hungary and a smaller one with czechoslovakia it is 
discussing pacts with bulgaria and east germany 
the soviet union imported about 11 billion in goods from the 
community in 1987 while the trading bloc bought nearly 16 billion 
from moscow total trade between the community and eastern europe 
amounted to about 56 billion in 1987

redoubt volcano continued to fire 
clouds of steam and gritty volcanic ash high into the sky monday 
forcing airlines to ground flights or route them around the 
abrasive powder for fear of engine damage 
also grounded were 240 korean air lines passengers who have 
refused since saturday to reboard their flight since it made its 
scheduled stop here 
ash clouds rose to 31000 feet from redoubts 10197foot summit 
monday 
the volcano is still very active said steve brantley a 
geologist with the alaska volcano observatory we are continuing 
to observe a high level of earthquake activity on the mountain and 
we received a number of reports of confirmed ash plumes rising 
above the volcano this morning 
anchorage international airport was open monday but service was 
irregular with some airlines grounding aircraft and others 
offering limited service some domestic airlines canceled flights 
and international carriers routed their aircraft around anchorage 
projections showed that the ash carried by highaltitude wind 
could reach the kenai peninsula and perhaps the outskirts of 
anchorage sometime late monday 
while some tried to get on planes a group of korean air line 
passengers refused to reboard their flight monday saying they were 
concerned whether it was safe to fly 
we are debating that right now said christine lee 23 a 
spokeswoman for the balky passengers there are 240 of us total 
and the factions to leave and stay are about the same if some go 
we all have to go 
kal flight 25 was en route from new york to seoul on saturday 
when it landed in anchorage 
lee a korean national with a home in the united state said the 
plane arrived late then was delayed and passengers were taken to 
hotels then all these rumors started about the safety of the 
plane the volcanic ash she said its hard to tell whats 
really true 
elected passenger representatives met monday with kal officials 
lee said kal representative lee steiner in los angeles said he 
unsure what the problem was and airline officials in anchorage had 
no comment 
federal aviation administration spokesman paul steucke said his 
agency was not involved because flight 25 was an international 
flight international airline companies are responsible for the 
safety of their planes he said 
the volcanic ashs threat to aircraft especially jets also 
hampered holiday mail delivery 
about 22000 pounds of mail was stacked in anchorage on monday 
for shipment out of alaska an additional 130000 pounds waited in 
seattle for shipment to alaska said spokeswoman nancy schmitt 
its playing havoc with us she said this is the largest 
backup weve ever had 
the postal service depends on commercial jets to move the mail 
but has resorted to chartering propellerdriven aircraft she said 
the mails moving but slowly she said 
the alaska railroad added a train monday between anchorage and 
fairbanks for travelers trying to reach that interior city said 
spokeswoman vivian hamilton 
redoubt began erupting thursday after two decades of silence and 
has sent ash and steam skyward intermittently since it is in a 
sparsely populated area 115 miles southwest of anchorage in the 
lake clark national park and preserve 
no injuries have been reported but one family was removed sunday 
from a lodge in the shadow of the volcano although they were in no 
immediate danger 
another couple remains at a lodge north of the peak workers 
were removed from an oil storage depot along a river which has 
flooded in the past when redoubts eruptions melted snow

a canadian delivery of sleet and ice sledded into the deep south 
on monday in a winter preview that cracked centuryold temperature 
records across the midwest and clogged the missouri river with a 
75mile ice jam 
the bitter weather closed schools from mississippi to michigan 
and forecasters said no change was in sight the cold is being 
caused by a horseshoeshaped flow of air that follows the west 
coast up to alaska chills out and plunges down through canada into 
the east and midwest 
its simply a pipeline that carries the cold air 
southward said ed ferguson deputy director of the federal 
governments severe storms forecast center in kansas city and by 
southward i mean all the way to the gulf of mexico 
southerners from central mississippi to the carolinas awoke 
monday to a yankees vista of freezing rain and sleet that made 
driving hazardous and was blamed for at least one traffic death 
hundreds of schools were closed 
the national weather service said as much as an inch of sleet 
and freezing rain covered north and central georgia before dawn 
and freezing rain extended as far south as savannah 
ice on interstate 85 near atlanta apparently contributed to a 
crash that killed atlanta falcons tight end brad beckman 
authorities said 
at least 19 deaths around the nation were blamed on the cold 
during the weekend including the deaths of two young tulsa okla 
girls who apparently were playing with a makeshift sled sunday when 
they plunged through thin ice on a lake two homeless people died 
of hypothermia while sleeping in new york city subway stations 
one weekend hypothermia death in chicago brought to 10 the 
number of people who have died from exposure in the municipal area 
so far this winter said a spokeswoman for the cook county medical 
examiners office 
a school bus carrying 43 children crashed into a station wagon 
on a slippery highway monday near shapleighl maine but none of 
the children were seriously hurt officials said 
mondays cold broke dec 18 records that had held for more than 
a century in columbus ohio where it was minus 7 in pittsburgh 
where it also was 7 below and in detroit where it was minus 3 
other records included parkersburg wva at 4 above 
cincinnati at 3 below fort wayne ind and cleveland at minus 5 
and youngstown ohio at minus 8 
good night its been unreal said pam decker coowner of 
deckers wrecker service in boonville ind which was besieged 
with calls about stalled and wrecked cars and the need to 
jumpstart dead or dying car batteries 
the missouri river turned to ice for about a 75mile stretch 
between blair neb just north of omaha and sioux city iowa 
according to the national weather service 
the ice jam had begun late friday and grew over the weekend 
officials feared that the ice floe could cause problems for 
communities that pump their water from the river and weather 
service hydrologist roy osugi didnt hold out hope for an early 
thaw 
nothing is going to bust it up except warmer weather osugi 
said we think its going to stay in place at least this week 
because its going to stay very cold 
in st joseph mo officials activated a new emergency pump as 
a precautionary measure to keep water flowing to the city 
there were similar problems in the town of monroe mich where 
55000 water customers were asked to conserve while workers monday 
cleared a frozen intake valve that also was clogged with lake erie 
zebra mussels a nonnative species which has no natural predators 
and is proliferating in the lake 
in crooksville ohio officials declared a water emergency after 
a series of water main breaks over the weekend parts of the small 
town had been without service for three days 
the cold also was the likely cause of a break in a 4inch pipe 
that let water surge through all 12 floors of a new hospital at 
ohio state university in columbus causing at least 1 million 
damage and delaying its scheduled jan 16 opening said osu vice 
president richard jackson

the courts official figures 
the supreme electoral court said leftist luis inacio lula da

northern regions where ballot boxes were taken to votecounting 
centers by canoe and mule

globo tv the nations largest television network projected 
collor de mello as the winner and had him ahead by 3 million votes 
or 51 percent in an unofficial tally based on 868 percent of 
returns

globo tv said all its results were compiled from returns announced 
by state election officials 
four private polling institutes said monday afternoon collor de 
mello would be the winner by 35 to 45 million votes a 4 to 6 
percent margin 
there is no doubt that collor de mello is the next president

institute 
da silva known as lula the nickname he has made part of his

returns from two strongholds the southern cities of porto alegre

collor de mello rebounded with a strong showing in sao paulo 
brazils wealthiest and most populous state and in the 
southeastern industrial and farming state of minas gerais 
roberto rosas of the electoral court said the electoral court 
was investigating charges by the workers party da silvas 
organization that voters could not get to polling stations in 
bahia and ceara states both da silva country because private bus 
companies took their vehicles off the street

scotland yard has launched an international hunt 
for the hightech saboteur who sent at least 10000 tampered disks 
to individuals and institutions worldwide officials said monday 
computer users as far away as australia and south africa have 
received the altered disks which were packaged as an aids 
information introductory diskette scotland yard said disks have 
also been received in britain norway sweden denmark and the 
united states officials and news reports say 
thousands of callers from british government departments health 
authorities accountancy firms lawyers newspapers magazines and 
commercial institutions have telephoned scotland yard about the 
suspect disks 
we cant give a number of damaged systems all we can say is 
quite a number of recipients have actually put the disks into their 
machines and therefore the machines have been damaged said a 
police spokeswoman on condition of anonymity 
scotland yard said it now believes more than one mailing list 
may have been purchased by the saboteur a middleaged man calling 
himself mr e katema bought a mailing list from pc business world 
a computer magazine it said 
police said a letter with the disks asks for a license fee 
of either 189 or 378 depending on the type of license to be 
sent a panamanian postal box 
the letter warns that if the disk is used but no payment made 
the sender will employ programming in the disk to block normal 
operation of the host computer 
police sources said some damage is caused as soon as the disk is 
installed but full damage is only recognized much later they say 
the disk has a counter that masks the damage until the host 
computer has been switched on about 90 times 
the disk purportedly offers information on the risk of getting 
the fatal disease aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
experts say the disk programming does not automatically spread 
to other computers as some computer viruses have in the past 
the alarm was first raised earlier this month by alan solomon 
chairman of the ibm personal computer user group he said he had 
received one of the disks 
it has also been established that the post office box number 
in panama does exist and inquiries are continuing with assistance 
of authorities in panama scotland yard said 
detectives have determined that most of the disks were mailed 
from london the scotland yard statement said 
scotland yard had said it was treating the case as criminal 
damage and blackmail

premier ante markovic proposed 
introduction of a new convertible currency unit in yugoslavia on 
monday at a key parliamentary session that is to consider sweeping 
economic and political reforms 
markovic also announced tight monetary and budgetary controls 
free formation of interest rates which in the past were set by the 
national bank and government control of prices on electricity 
gasoline rail transport rents postal services and medicines 
he asked for an overhaul of the criminal code including 
dropping socalled verbal offenses under which thousands of 
people were prosecuted for privately or publicly criticizing the 
communist regime 
the new program is designed to lead the nation out of its worst 
economic and political crisis and to curb rampant inflation 
parliament must approve it during a threeday session or the 
government says it will resign 
markovic said a solution to yugoslavias crisis is not 
possible without a completely new economic and political system 
that would ensure economic efficiency and political democracy with 
full freedoms and human rights 
he said yugoslavia should adopt all norms of a democratic and 
pluralistic society adding that yugoslavia must not be satisfied 
only by marketoriented reforms but should introduce radical 
political changes as well 
winding up his 90minute address he pleaded for undivided 
support from the deputies for the reforms crucial for the fate of 
this country 
markovic said yugoslavia successfully ended negotiations with 
the international monetary fund on obtaining new loans yugoslavia 
is seeking loans from the imf and the world bank to implement its 
new reform package 
under his proposal for a new currency unit one new 
convertible dinar would be worth 10000 old dinars he said 
yugoslavs would be able to freely purchase foreign currencies with 
dinars in local banks 
the exchange rate would be fixed at seven dinars for one west 
german mark and stay fixed until june 30 before the dinar rate 
was adjusted daily against foreign currencies and lost value 
rapidly as inflation hit 2000 percent 
one us dollar would be worth 12 new dinars instead of the 
120000 dinars now markovic said 
he said the dinar was pegged to the mark because of the marks 
greatest stability on world money markets and will vary in 
comparison to other western currencies according to fluctuations in 
the value of the mark 
he said the changeover will take place jan 1 1990 if 
parliament approves the package yugoslavias last reevaluation of 
the dinar occurred in 1965 
the central bank would for the first time become fully 
autonomous in conducting monetary policies in accordance with 
market mechanisms and will no longer be allowed to print money to 
cover state deficits markovic said 
markovics government took over last march it has moved quickly 
to introduce market mechanisms as a way out of a crisis that 
includes a 17 billion foreign debt and a 17 percent unemployment 
rate 
his reform program has been bitterly attacked by conservatives 
in the communist leadership particularly in the republics of 
serbia and montenegro where local leaders oppose his efforts to 
restructure the economy and promote greater political pluralism 
authorities in the two republics fear the popular discontent 
that could be ignited by markovics reforms which include firing 
hundreds of thousands of employees in lossmaking firms they 
prefer shortterm measures such as price freezes 
on monday the staterun trade union of the underdeveloped 
republic of montenegro organized a halfhour general warning 
strike by 160000 workers to pressure the government to adopt 
urgent measures to contain hyperinflation 
similar short general strikes are expected in the economically 
poorest region of macedonia on thursday and in serbia on wednesday 
the day deputies are expected to vote on markovics program

this plane has no parachutes menem said anyone who wants to 
jump may jump knowing the consequences 
erman gonzalez the third economy minister in menems 
5monthold government takes over amid economic distress that 
threatens to become a political crisis for menem 
the president risks losing public support he needs in the short 
run until his reforms produce longterm benefits a wide segment of 
organized labor a powerful force in argentina and business have 
attacked his plans 
even menems own laborbased peronist party has shown only 
lukewarm support for the reforms 
inflation that moderated to 65 percent in november from 197 
percent in july is projected to top 30 percent in december 
one of the causes of economic deterioration the past week was 
massive buying of dollars analysts said the buying was triggered 
by the governments unexpected decision to suspend repayment of 
principal on internal bonds for two years and raise taxes on 
exports 
erman gonzalez instead annulled the unpopular tax hikes and said 
the government would try to repay the principal on time 
while price controls for food and many consumer and industrial 
products will be lifted erman gonzalez said the government will 
continue to regulate rates for gas electricity water telephones 
bus and commuter train fares and other public services 
to help argentines pay for the rates erman gonzalez authorized 
a monthly pay increase for public and private workers of about 20 
lifting controls on the austral means exporters may convert 
their dollars at the central bank at a much higher rate the move 
is intended to induce them to turn in dollars it has been hoarding 
from overseas sales of beef and grain 
the central bank has previously been regulating the exchange 
market

the us marshals service began screening 
packages entering us courthouses monday mindful of the mailed 
bomb that killed an appellate judge in alabama and a suspected bomb 
found at an atlanta courthouse 
were being more vigilant said flavio lorenzoni chief 
deputy us marshal for the southern district of new york all 
packages are being checked carefully 
he spoke before it was learned that another mailed bomb had 
killed a lawyer in savannah ga 
like his colleagues in other judicial districts lorenzoni 
declined to elaborate about the security procedures that have been 
invoked since the assassination of circuit judge robert s vance 
if we tell everyone what were doing it wont have any 
effect he said 
william dempsey a spokesman for the marshals service in 
washington said judges have been told to bring all packages to 
the attention of the marshals so they can be screened and xrayed 
before opening 
all packages should be screened even those bearing a familiar 
return address because a return address can be faked or forged 
he said 
although he said that security for judges is being stepped up 
around the country dempsey acknowledged that it would be 
impossible for the marshals service to provide roundtheclock 
protection for every federal judge and magistrate 
such protection is given judges when a specific threat is 
detected usually arising from a case involving a judge 
there is not a day in a year that goes by that we do not have 
roundtheclock details on some judges dempsey said 
dempsey confirmed that extra security had given to judges in the 
11th circuit which covers florida georgia and alabama following 
saturdays blast that killed vance at his home outside birmingham 
in miami daniel j horgan us marshal for the southern 
district of florida called a meeting monday of the districts 
judges to inform them of the apparent bomb found in atlanta on 
monday and the new security measures 
chief deputy us marshal james tassone said all packages and 
mail entering the federal courthouses in miami west palm beach and 
fort lauderdale were being inspected by xray 
people entering the courthouses also were subjected to extra 
examination for instance some courthouse employees who usually 
pass through security with a cursory check were asked monday to 
empty their pockets as they entered 
not all federal courthouses changed procedures for instance in 
indiana officials said security was already tight and did not need 
to be improved 
however deputy marshal jeff whitney in evansville ind said 
judges had been instructed not to open any uninspected packages 
in new york us district judge mark a costantino said federal 
marshals called him at home several hours after judge vance was 
killed and advised him to be alert for suspicious packages 
the judge said he and his family would refuse to accept any 
parcel not bearing the return address of someone they know 
we may be making a mountain out of a molehill but that shows 
that someone is making an effort to create fear in the judicial 
system he said 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
president bush had been in contact with attorney general dick 
thornburgh to ask about the status of the investigation 
the attorney general advised him we have not reached any 
conclusions about the source of his death we just dont have any 
answers yet as to who might have done it to him fitzwater said 
extra security precautions have been taken at the justice 
department in recent months since president virgilio barcos of 
colombia declared war that nations cocaine cartels 
the justice department purchased an armorplated limousine for 
thornburgh which the attorney general uses around washington the 
fbi agents who guard thornburgh now carry highpowered assault 
weapons in leather cases

a retired union leader said monday that 
state police officials used tape recordings of telephone 
conversations at state police barracks to gather evidence against 
union members 
every grievance hearing i ever went to i think they had a 
transcript of some call they did that all the time said the 
retired union leader who spoke on condition he not be quoted by 
name and is also a former state trooper 
however the former union leader said he sometimes used the 
tapes to gather information when he was putting together a case for 
a grievance 
the revelations were the latest in the secret taping scandal 
since nov 7 when the hartford courant reported that state police 
routinely recorded all calls into and out of state police barracks 
including those between suspects and their attorneys 
gov william a oneills counsel howard g rifkin said monday 
there had been no evidence any calls were monitored to gather 
unionrelated evidence on anyone 
he and tom gariepy spokesman for attorney general clarine nardi 
riddle said they had found that some calls were monitored to make 
sure phones werent being abused 
we didnt find anything to show that there was an intentional 
effort to use tapes against a trooper rifkin said 
state police commander bernard r sullivan said through a 
spokesman he would have no comment on the newest allegations 
the taping issue prompted a hearing monday before a 
congressional subcommittee in washington the panel was told that 
state or local police or corrections officers in at least 12 other 
states routinely record lawyerclient conversations 
federal laws prohibit taping telephone calls without the consent 
of one of the two people using the telephone state and federal 
laws prohibit the recording of any lawyerclient conversations 
the taping disclosures have prompted an fbi and federal grand 
jury probe and at least five civil lawsuits have been filed 
state police officials have said the tapes were only used for 
authorized purposes and were seldom listened to they have 
insisted that calls were taped to provide a record of emergency 
calls 
the officials have said only a few authorized members of the 
department had access to the tapes but union sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the tapes were sometimes not guarded 
and that many department members had access to them 
disclosure of the taping led to the removal of lester j forst 
as state police commander and public safety commissioner by 
oneill who ordered an immediate halt to taping of attorneyclient 
calls the governor ordered an investigation by state officials 
into the practice that determined that the taping was inexcusable 
but was not used to illegally gather evidence against suspects 
the former union leader said he recalled one instance where an 
argument between a sergeant and a trooper could be heard in the 
background on the tape of a call between another trooper and 
someone else the argument was transcribed and used as evidence of 
insubordination he said 
he said he sometimes called department officials and got them to 
say incriminating things on a taped phone line to be used when he 
was putting together a grievance case against the department 
he said he would go into a barracks after midnight and 
transcribe portions of the tape he wanted 
the courant on monday described a 1979 incident of monitoring 
tapes when troopers at the bethany barracks decided to protest 
manpower shortages through a sickout in which troopers falsely 
claim to be sick and refuse to go to work 
a copy of an internal investigation report on the sickout 
obtained by the courant shows that state police officials listened 
to hours of the tapes and transcribed and summarized parts of them 
the transcripts were then used as evidence in disciplinary actions 
against a sergeant and several troopers 
other monitored conversations include a trooper talking about a 
grievance he filed and troopers talking to friends outside the 
department 
robert j krzys a union lawyer said the union is trying to 
determine whether similar monitoring of tape recordings has been 
going on during the past three years 
krzys said he only knows of one recent case in which a 
transcript was introduced involving a sergeants call from the 
bethany barracks 
the union has filed a lawsuit saying its members were as much 
victims of the illegal taping as the public

prince norodom sihanouk the exiled cambodian 
leader said monday that his resistance coalition will vacate its 
un seat only if the vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia 
is dismantled 
austalias deputy secretary of foreign affairs michael 
costello briefed sihanouk and chinese leaders separately on 
australias suggestion that the united nations set up an interim 
administration in cambodia so free elections can be held 
costello also met with premier li peng who said he hoped 
friendly relations could be restored between australia and china 
relations have been strained following chinas june crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators which like most western countries 
australia condemned 
sihanouk has said free elections are not possible in cambodia 
while the vietnameseinstalled government under hun sen remains in 
office hun sen however has demanded the resistance vacate 
cambodias seat in the united nations to ensure un impartiality 
while it acts as trustee 
costellos meeting at sihanouks residence in beijing was 
closed but the prince later issued a 27page open letter to 
costello condemning hun sens government and specifying his terms 
for any un trusteeship 
i dont accept declaring cambodias seat vacant before the 
simultaneous dismantling of the resistance and hun sens state 
of cambodia and the replacement of the illegal provietnamese 
administration of hun sen with a purely un administration in all 
villages and provinces the letter said 
vietnam invaded neighboring cambodia in late 1987 and ousted the 
ruling khmer rouge who had imposed a reign of terror however the 
united nations and many governments including that of the united 
states recognize sihanouks threeparty resistance coalition as 
the rightful cambodian government 
hun sen has said he is willing to allow elections but has 
rejected sihanouks demand that he first dismantle his government 
and set up an interim government representing all cambodian 
parties including the khmer rouge the khmer rouge are part of 
sihanouks coalition 
the issue remained stalemated until australian foreign minister 
gareth evans suggested in november that the united nations 
administer cambodia during elections 
costello has met with officials in cambodia vietnam and 
thailand to explain the proposal 
the australian embassy said costellos talks would be limited to 
the problem of cambodia and would not cover bilateral issues 
however chinas official xinhua news agency quoted li peng as 
saying that although the two countries differ on some issues we 
still hope friendly cooperative relations are restored 
he said we stand for the forwardlooking attitude and hope 
both sides will join hands for this 
australia suspended highlevel exchanges with china following 
the chinese army attack on prodemocracy protesters in beijing the 
embassy said costellos visit did not indicate an end of this 
sanction

a witness testifying monday in the 
murder trial of a driver whose collision with a church bus killed 
27 people said the man asked for a drink and drank it straight 
down shortly before the crash 
kelly osbornes testimony for the prosecution blew away the 
argument by defendant larry mahoneys attorneys that mahoney was 
tricked into getting drunk said special prosecutor paul richwalsky 
osborne was one of several rebuttal witnesses presented by the 
prosecution after the defense rested its case monday 
mahoney 36 is accused of causing the nations worst 
drunkendriving accident the night of may 14 1988 as he drove his 
pickup truck on the wrong side of interstate 71 five miles south 
of carrollton 
the defense contends that mahoney thinking he had been handed a 
glass of water was duped into swigging from a tumbler of osbornes 
vodka the night of the crash 
but osborne was adamant monday that he prepared a vodka and 
sprite at mahoneys request using a plastic cup 
he just picked up the cup and he just drank it straight 
down osborne said he coughed a couple of times i figured it 
was just because he had drank it so quick 
osborne a retiree from cincinnati said he met mahoney by 
chance at the home of jay gibson osbornes neighbor at a 
campground outside carrollton 
mahoney arrived in his pickup with gibson and another friend 
all were drinking beer 
mahoney asked me if i had any beer they was out 
osborne said 
osborne said he didnt have any beer but offered to give 
mahoney a mixed drink from the dregs of a halfgallon vodka bottle 
kept stashed in his truck 
mahoneys attorneys pointed out that osborne mentioned beer but 
said nothing about vodka in at least three statements to 
investigators the first on june 10 1988 
heres a guy who less than four weeks after the accident 
couldnt remember anything said one of the attorneys jack 
hildebrand 
richwalsky countered that defense attorneys after talking about 
osbornes alleged role at length during the trial did not put him 
on the stand because they knew his testimony would be damaging 
testimony by two other prosecution witnesses aimed at rebutting 
defense claims the disaster was caused in part by an inherently 
dangerous bus 
william boehly director of statistics and analysis for the 
national highway traffic safety administration said buses are four 
times safer than cars based on accidents per miles traveled 
boehly said there had never been a comparable disaster involving a 
school bus 
hugh t spencer a university of louisville chemical engineering 
professor disputed defense testimony that smoke from the fire was 
laced with cyanide caused by burning seat covers and cushions 
cyanide is flammable and was burned before having a chance to 
poison any of the victims spencer said 
the bus a former school bus bought by the radcliff first 
assembly of god church was returning from a cincinnati amusement 
park at the time of the crash twentyfour children and three 
adults died in the fire that followed the crash 
mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder 12 of assault 42 
of wanton endangerment and one count of drunken driving

panamanian corporal near an american installation monday us 
officials reported it was the second shooting incident in three 
days between us and panamanian forces 
on saturday panamanian soldiers shot and killed an american 
officer near panamanian military headquarters president bush on 
monday called that shooting an enormous outrage and said he 
would not rule out military action 
a us southern command statement said that on monday an 
american was leaving a us army laundry in the curundu area of 
western panama city when a uniformed panamanian signaled him to 
stop and approached him 
the area is near southern command headquarters and less than a 
mile from panamanian defense forces headquarters 
the statement said the us officer fired when the panamanian 
appeared to reach for a weapon 
the american responded defensively by pulling a weapon and 
fired two shots it said the panamanian went down then got up 
and left the scene the extent of his injuries is unknown at this 
time 
us officials said the officer was being debriefed 
a panamanian defense forces communique later called it 
reckless aggression by the us army 
it said the american fired two shots from a firearm one of 
them hitting the left forearm of policeman cesar tejada it said 
the american was traveling in a vehicle that never stopped and on 
the contrary accelerated 
the communique said tejada was hospitalized but did not give 
his condition 
capt moises cortizo panamas chief of police said police were 
investigating 
according to a command official the civilian laundry has a 
contract to clean uniforms for us forces 
in washington a defense department official speaking on 
condition of anonymity gave this account 
a panamanian traffic officer signaled the american to stop and 
approached his car the panamanian pulled his weapon and the 
lieutenant did the same 
the american fired two shots and it was believed the panamanian 
was wounded in a leg and an arm 
tensions still were high at the time because of saturdays 
death panamanian officials said the us army commander in panama 
threatened an invasion 
this is the most serious incident we have had a command 
spokesman said this involved a loss of life no course of action 
is being ruled out as a response 
we are trying to be rational in our response we are going to 
take a calculated plan of action the us government does not 
respond without thinking results through 
he spoke on the condition of anonymity 
photographs of the 1981 chevrolet with michigan plates in which 
the americans were riding showed bullet holes including two on the 
drivers side and one through the trunk 
us officers said the shots came from sovietmade ak rifles 
the united states has taken no visible action since saturday 
other than to put its forces on maximum alert and display them 
visibly in its military installations 
the pentagon said the officer was fatally shot and a navy 
officer and his wife were arrested and beaten saturday night not 
far from the military headquarters of gen manuel antonio noriega 
the panamanian leader 
panamanian lt col arnulfo castrejon garcia on monday called 
completely false allegations that the couple were mistreated 
though he confirmed they were arrested 
us troops in battle gear patrolled perimeter fences at their 
bases monday and panamanian troops blocked the street in front of 
the military headquarters but life was normal in the rest of the 
city 
us and panamanian forces were holding a dialogue by 
messenger castrejon told reporters he said the us army south 
commander gen marc cisneros had threatened an invasion 
asked why the united states had not already invaded castrejon 
said it could be they realize they went through the checkpoint 
a spokesman for the us southern command which controls all 
us forces in panama including us army south said he could not 
comment on castrejons statements 
the associated press learned panamas defense forces sent a 
letter to us military officials apparently trying to gain time 
following the us demand for an explanation 
the panamanian military said the letter demanded that us 
forces exercise maximum prudence to avoid unfortunate incidents 
it said us forces disregarded our observations resulting in 
unfortunate incidents as the one which occurred on the evening of 
dec 16 
a us military source said there had been no negotiations 
with the panamanians concerning the incident 
the united states said panamanian troops were solely responsible 
for the violence saturday that the us officer and three 
companions took a wrong turn and were lost 
the defense forces accused us officers of provocation and said 
they ran through a defense forces checkpoint 
in washington the white house said the violence was a 
consequence of panamas being run by noriega 
since february 1988 when noriega was indicted in florida on 
narcotics charges the united states has tried to drive him from 
power with economic diplomatic and political pressure 
noriega denies the charges he claims washington wants to renege 
on treaties under which the united states is to transfer control of 
the canal to panama at the end of the century and close us 
military installations 
thousands of us soldiers lived in panama city until earlier 
this year when they and their dependents were ordered to move onto 
the bases many dependents returned to the united states 
the command confirmed that the transfer of civilian dependents 
from military posts was being stepped up 
the number of families still on post is 500 down from 3200

president corazon aquino threatened 
monday to close broadcast stations that air rebel propaganda and to 
file charges against newspapers publishing articles that incite 
rebellion 
the senate and house of representatives are expected to give 
final approval this week to legislation granting mrs aquino 
special powers to restore order in the wake of the failed dec 19 
coup by thousands of military mutineers 
although the bill does not give mrs aquino additional powers to 
clamp down on newspaper and broadcast operations she told 
reporters the government will take action against those spreading 
rebel propaganda 
mrs aquino told reporters broadcasters operate under government 
franchise and that the administration will strictly enforce 
regulations forbidding subversive propaganda 
if they violate these terms and conditions they will be 
closed their franchises will be taken away from them mrs 
aquino said with regard to print media its an entirely 
different matter we will base this on any article that will incite 
to rebellion if such an article does appear in any of the 
newspapers then we will go to court to file charges against the 
erring individual or the publication 
there was no indication what criteria the government will use to 
define inciting to rebellion or subversive propaganda since the 
launch of the coup attempt the sixth and worst since mrs aquino 
took office in february 1986 two radio stations were closed but 
one was allowed back on the air 
in a frontpage editorial tuesday the philippine daily inquirer 
charged that the aquino government appears to be moving toward 
tighter restrictions on the press 
meanwhile monday police said the manila city hall was evacuated 
about 9 am after telephone reports that a bomb had been placed 
there no bomb was found but the incident disrupted court hearings 
and other business there for more than two hours

string of recent bomb threats appears part of a rebel plan to raise 
tensions in the capital and undermine confidence in the government

housing and recreational compound damaging several cars but 
causing no injuries on dec 9 a grenade exploded at the citys 
main post office killing two people and injuring 18

communitywide meeting on drugs tonight to be held at his 
church 
ms reese said said police originally believed a gas leak caused 
the explosion but later concluded it was a bomb 
vance 58 died saturday and his wife was seriously injured when 
they opened a package addressed to him at their home in mountain 
brook a suburb of birmingham 
the atlanta bomb was removed from the headquarters of the 
12member 11th circuit which handles federal appeals from alabama 
georgia and florida vance was based in birmingham and kept his 
office there much of the 11th circuits caseload is drugrelated 
appeals 
vance also fought for racial moderation and progressive stands 
in alabama during 11 years as state chairman of the democratic 
party he was nominated to the court in 1977 by thenpresident 
carter 
investigators said there is nothing so far to tie vances 
assassination to drug traffickers or his civil rights stand 
in the past year six pipe bombs were left in mailboxes in the 
nearby suburb of hoover the new york times reported monday citing 
unidentified fbi officials 
only one of the bombs exploded injuring the person thought to 
have planted it but authorities said they could have been lethal 
the times reported 
one such recipient chriss doss was a former associate of vance 
in the alabama democratic party the times said 
state rep jim pannell of savannah who went to law school with 
robinson said robinson handled many criminal and personal injury 
cases but could not think of any which would have supplied a 
motive for the bombing 
robinson represented the national association for the 
advancement of colored people in a longrunning desegregation case 
against the savannah school system pannell said 
in washington dc justice department spokesman david runkel 
said i think its premature to draw any conclusions at this 
time there is no civil rights investigation 
runkel noted that robinsons clients had included accused 
cocaine dealers adding there may be different theories floating 
around out there 
the savannah bombing occurred just hours after the pipe bomb was 
removed from the atlanta courthouse 
bomb specialists examined xray pictures of the package before a 
technician in headtotoe protective gear removed through the 
courts front door under a large flag flying at halfstaff in 
memory of vance 
flakjacketed officers and federal agents had sealed off the 
street in front of the blocklong courthouse and the package 
about 10 inches by 10 inches and 4 inches deep was placed in a 
bombproof canister and taken away 
police confirmed the package was a bomb that afternoon said 
postal inspector al adams the package contained a detonating 
device he said 
holley said the brown paperwrapped package had arrived by mail 
not by hand delivery and was addressed to the court not to an 
individual unlike the bomb that killed vance adams said 
the package had a return address but adams declined to disclose 
it saying such addresses are always phony we dont want to get 
innocent people involved he said 
adams did say the return address was not that of a federal 
judge the package that killed vance listed the sender as another 
federal judge at an almost certainly phony address the atlanta 
constitution said quoting unidentified sources 
adams said atlanta police dismantled the bomb without detonating 
it and destroying the package thats a big help to our 
investigation he said 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
president bush had contacted attorney general dick thornburgh about 
the investigation 
the attorney general advised him we have not reached any 
conclusions fitzwater said we just dont have any answers yet 
as to who might have done it to him 
even before mondays bomb scare workers at the 11th circuit 
were scared because of vances assassination during the 
evacuation several who declined to give their names and said they 
were ordered not to speak to reporters said they are reluctant to 
return to work 
when the courthouse was closed employees were told to call 
before returning to work tuesday not only because of the bomb 
but because of unusual december snow in atlanta early monday 
federal judges around the country had been advised after vances 
death not to open packages received in the mail until they could be 
inspected 
the fbi said it was giving top priority to finding out who 
mailed the bomb that killed vance who was believed to be the third 
federal judge assassinated in this century all three 
assassinations occurring in the last 10 years 
the 11th circuit court had opened for business as usual monday 
despite the snowfall which had many of the citys law offices 
opening late 
lamar pope supervisor of court security for the northern 
district of georgia would not comment on increased security 
measures at the appeals court but officials acknowledged that 
plans for tighter security were going into effect at atlantas 
richard b russell building home of the us district court and 
other federal offices those plans began two months ago

entertainer arsenio hall testified monday 
that he and eddie murphy conceived the idea for the movie coming 
to america but columnist art buchwald said he wrote a similar 
story five years earlier 
buchwald testifying in his 5 million lawsuit against paramount 
pictures said he later heard his story had been optioned to murphy 
the pulitzer prizewinning columnist and author claims he wrote 
the original idea and had a contract with paramount to develop it 
into a script 
hall testifying for paramount said he never saw buchwalds 
screenplay idea king for a day before he and murphy began 
work 
both stories involve a member of african royalty who comes to 
the united states falls in love and takes home a bride paramount 
says buchwalds script idea and coming to america were not 
similar 
outside court hall who costarred in the 1988 hit film and is 
host of a latenight talk show told reporters he considered 
accusations of plagiarism insulting and absurd he insisted its 
obviously our script 
im offended by the accusations because eddie is a very 
bright man im a bright guy why do we have to seek a stolen 
concept its insulting he said 
buchwald told reporters he was sorry hall felt insulted 
i like arsenio hes a nice fellow he said this is 
between paramount and me 
in court buchwald told superior court judge harvey schneider 
that his script idea its a crude crude world was based on a 
data bank of experiences he keeps in his head 
buchwald said the king he wrote about may have been based on a 
watusi king he interviewed in africa in the 1950s he was a real 
king and he drove a studebaker he recalled 
he also said he also used an incident in which he saw a protest 
against the shah of iran and wondered what the shah would do if he 
couldnt go home 
soon after he wrote the script idea buchwald said producer 
alain bernheim sold the option to paramount the writer said he 
received 17500 less 10 per cent to my agent 
he said negotiations began for louis malle to direct and then he 
heard that eddie murphy would star i was delighted buchwald 
said 
the writer was to take the stand again tuesday to explain how 
plans for the movie were abandoned and the option was dropped 
earlier hall testified that he and murphy had been intent on 
improving the image of black people as well as murphys own screen 
image 
there had never been a black fairy tale hall said we 
wanted to create like a fairy tale beautiful like the prince 
got the girl we wanted a fairy tale everyone could relate to 
hall said he and murphy wanted to shape the screenplay 
themselves because otherwise it would just be another black 
story written by white people 
as far as murphys image he said we did a facelift on his 
character he was not the wisecracking axel foley character from 
beverly hills cop this showed him soft sensitive 
nonmaterialistic he was a gentleman in this movie he was the 
perfect man any woman would love him 
at one point hall said he and murphy are as close as brothers 
but under questioning said he would not lie for murphy 
hall noted that two other writers got the screen credit for 
coming to america and said that if murphy knew buchwald was the 
writer he would have had no problem giving him credit 
hall was followed to the witness stand by paramount chairman 
frank mancuso who described murphys rich contract with the studio 
which gives him 8 million a picture plus 15 per cent of gross 
profits 
he indicated murphy wants more 
like a good baseball player were always negotiating with 
him mancuso said hes a very important star 
courtroom spectators included famed screenwriter and director 
billy wilder who said he came to give moral support to buchwald 
and bernheim who is also a plaintiff 
halls appearance in the downtown courthouse set off a buzz of 
excitement several deputies and bailiffs rushed to the court to 
get his autograph and one brought a camera to get his picture taken 
with hall 
buchwald observing the commotion shook his head and said 
all this over a breachofcontract suit

sultan qaboos of oman opened a summit 
meeting of persian gulf states monday with a call for the united 
nations to redouble its efforts to arrange a peace treaty between 
iran and iraq 
he also noted that recent reforms in eastern europe provide new 
opportunities for cooperation with this region 
other participants in the fourday summit of the gulf 
cooperation council were sheiks isa bin salman alkhalifa of 
bahrain jaber alahmed alsabah of kuwait khalifa bin hamad 
althani of qatar and zayed bin sultan alnahyan of the united arab 
emirates and king fahd of saudi arabia 
the regional leaders were expected to focus on how trade can 
boost their national economies now that the iraqiran war is over 
and oil prices are inching up 
a unbrokered ceasefire in the war took hold in august 1988 
however talks have failed to produce an agreement on exchanging 
prisoners of war withdrawing troops to international borders and 
other sticking points 
the summit probably will issue a statement stressing the need 
for a firm peace treaty however the blocs influence is weakened 
by iranian accusations that it is biased toward iraq diplomats say 
participants were also expected to discuss setting up a common 
tariff structure and coordinating development plans 
qaboos noted that the recent reformist wave in eastern europe 
toward economic and political freedom means new opportunites for 
cooperation and for the conservative gulf states to gain a 
progressive role and effective presence in this changing world 
he said such moves would require new policies but did not spell 
them out 
he also asked the people of lebanon to carry out an arab 
leaguesponsored peace plan to end lebanons 14yearold civil war 
and said israel must be pressured to solve the palestinian problem

a missionary couple and 28 haitian children 
they intend to adopt and raise as one family were welcomed home 
monday by applauding friends and relatives 
dan and kathy blackburn christian evangelical missionaries who 
fled haiti for the dominican republic with the children in 1987 
took the children to a church camp in letts ind where they will 
live temporarily in a dormitory 
were coming home after fifteen years well just take it day 
by day blackburn 45 said as the greeters gave candy to the 
sweaterclad children at indianapolis international airport 
the children who speak english range in age from 3 to 14 and 
most have lived with the blackburns since infancy all but two came 
to the couple as babies including one who was just six hours old 
the baby was found in a hut and its mother was dead said 
mrs blackburn 42 
asked how she and her husband managed to keep track of 28 
children she said jesus christ there is no other secret jesus 
has always taken care of us 
her husband asked how the couple planned to feed and cloth the 
children said i think the lord will provide 
the rev bob lay pastor of community church near the 
blackburns hometown of elizabethtown said the family eventually 
will find another place or build a home large enough to accommodate 
the whole group 
the churches and organizations that have sponsored them for 14 
years will continue he said 
the us immigration and naturalization service granted the 
children special holiday parole status allowing them legal entry 
with the couple 
cases like the blackburns show us that the law can be 
administered with heart ins commissioner gene mcnary said in 
miami earlier in the day we would have made the same decision at 
any time of year but getting the family home before christmas made 
it all the more satisfying 
the blackburns and the children fled from haiti to the dominican 
republic in 1987 to escape political turmoil when the hatian 
government collapsed the two countries split a caribbean island 
mrs blackburn said they left haiti because of threats from 
villagers 
we left in the middle of the night with the clothes on our 
backs she said we ran for our lives i was trying to save 
their lives and ours too 
asked if she had smuggled the children out of haiti she said 
i guess so yeah i did 
ins spokesman duke austin said the conditions under which the 
blackburns and the children left haiti was not an issue 
monday the group flew first to miami international airport 
where the children some clutching stuffed animals played and 
watched planes take off while their new parents took care of 
lastminute red tape 
they then boarded a flight to indianapolis 
mcnary granted the children humanitarian parole because they 
were ineligible for entry under any other immigration category 
under ins law the commissioner may allow an otherwise inadmissable 
alien to enter the country temporarily for humanitarian reasons or 
when such entry is in the national interest 
the blackburns christian evangelical missionaries went to 
haiti in 1976 with their two sons and started a ministry in a small 
mountain village the us justice department said after about 18 
months they began caring for sick or abandoned children taken to 
their home 
the blackburns and the children were forced to flee into the 
dominican republic in 1987 after rebels threatened to kill them 
during the turmoil when the duvalier government collapsed the ins 
said 
in the dominican republic they found a home with the help of 
other missionaries while they worked to find a way to adopt the 
children and return to indiana 
they were unable to complete the adoptions in haiti or the 
dominican republic because the childrens natural parents are dead 
unknown or untraceable 
with the help of various church groups the blackburns 
petitioned the ins to permit the children to come to this country 
so they could complete the adoptions in indiana said austin 
after their petition was approved by mcnary in early december 
the ins worked with the state department to speed up the paperwork 
so the family could be home together by christmas

six months into its review of federal energy 
policy the bush administration has come to at least one clear 
conclusion the reaganera theme of just keep the oil flowing and 
keep it cheap is too simplistic for the 1990s 
energy secretary james d watkins says oil inevitably will be 
the dominant fuel well into the 21st century he has become 
convinced though that the federal government must do more now to 
begin curing the nation of its costly oil addiction 
its not yet clear how the new federal role will be written but 
almost certainly it will emphasize the virtues of conservation and 
renewable energy resources 
that alone would be a major change from the eight years of the 
reagan administration which tried to abolish the energy department 
and failing that consistently cut its budget for energy 
conservation the departments 1989 conservation budget was less 
than onethird its 1980 level adjusted for inflation

the role of washington manipulator gen 
leland masters on cbs wiseguy was written to be a big 
imposing american caesar 
the producers had in mind gregory peck who portrayed gen 
douglas macarthur in the movie macarthur after considering it 
peck turned it down the producers then considered kirk douglas 
richard widmark and others before turning to norman lloyd who was 
cast in the role 
lloyd who spent six years on st elsewhere as the saintly 
cancerstricken dr daniel auschlander brings a new aspect to the 
role in a way masters is more dangerous more cunning because of 
lloyds benign appearance 
i saw him instead as a man of some intellectual power lloyd 
said of the fictional general 
one of our best generals was an intellectual vinegar joe 
stillwell he was a small wiry man hed been a schoolteacher he 
would not have thought the way masters did however masters would 
have been closer to chiang kaishek than stillwell 
in the current fiveweek arc on wiseguy vinnie terranova 
ken wahl comes out of cover at the instance of masters to 
investigate a scheme to undermine the economy of japan 
somebody wants to flood japan with counterfeit money and he 
wants vinnie terranova to work on it said lloyd as it 
unfolds we see that masters is the heavy and hes setting up 
vinnie to be the patsy 
their antagonism goes back several years ago when vinnie 
stymied masters pet project the invasion of isle pavot masters 
pretends to uncover this plot but its all to frame vinnie to get 
his revenge 
early in his career lloyd usually played villains he was the 
bad guy who fell from the statue of liberty in alfred hitchcocks 
saboteur in 1942 that spectacular scene is often studied in 
film schools 
when i see that i mourn for my lost hair said lloyd it 
was red 
lloyd was in hitchcocks spellbound which starred gregory 
peck and ingrid bergman and in 1957 hitchcock brought him out from 
new york to produce alfred hitchcock presents he spent eight 
years on the series and directed 25 episodes 
in dead poets society he was not a villain but he 
represents the establishment in his conflicts with robin williams 
and the students 
gen masters is a political power behind the scenes lloyd 
said his power reaches right into the white house hes on the 
national security commission hes a very dangerous fellow the 
writers threw in some wonderful throwaway lines i have a line i 
told them we needed more helicopters in the desert you know right 
away it refers to the attempt to rescue the hostages in iran 
i think this show gets into some controversial issues in a 
dramatic way it has energetic gutsy stories 
lloyd said he found the role a refreshing change from dr 
auschlander who had a long remission from cancer apparently in 
the beginning auschlander was not meant to stay around but the 
producers had a change of heart he was still working at the end of 
the series 
as a heavy youre always in conflict he said youre 
into the energy of the piece when you play a hero you have to 
create situations of interest to the audience that arent just 
white bread its easier to play a heavy its more dramatic 
the newfound freedom of television helps you dont have to 
say gee whiz you can say words that are closer to reality 
lloyd has a book coming out based on his oral history for the 
directors guild it tells of his work with such directors and 
filmmakers as jean renoir charlie chaplin orson welles bertolt 
brecht lewis milestone and alfred hitchcock

for the 20th time since the founding of the 
republic your government is setting out to learn something about 
each of you and quite a lot about many of us 
where do you live how old are you and whats your race are you 
single married or living with an unmarried partner how big is 
your house whats it worth and is it paid for 
yes its time once again for a new decade and another census 
even now massive printing presses are churning out the more 
than 100 million forms that will be needed to count over 250 
million americans april 1 
originally required as a count of the population to help divide 
up seats in the house of representatives the census has become an 
effort to assess the state of the nation 
the debate about what to ask in 1990 has been under way for most 
of this decade since 1984 there have been 65 public meetings 
around the nation to get the publics comments and suggestions 
more than 5000 people attended 
suggestions that the census bureau ask people about their 
religion their pets and their sexual preference come up often 
and are rejected every time 
a proposal to ask about citizenship in an effort to determine 
the number of illegal aliens was also not included on the short 
form intended to enumerate everyone living in the united states 
few people in this country illegally would be likely to admit as 
much to the government officials said 
in choosing what to ask census officials considered the needs 
of government agencies tried to repeat as many questions as 
possible from the past to maintain consistent statistics and 
realized that asking too much would result in people refusing to 
cooperate 
indeed the office of management and budget complaining of a 
paperwork burden for the public fought a battle wth the census 
bureau over some of the questions 
the bureau produced a 150page study justifying the questions it 
is asking after finding little support for some of the information 
collected the last time the agency has dropped questions about 
marital history and home air conditioning 
most homes will receive the form in the mail in late march and 
are expected to mail it back after april 1 census takers will go 
only to some rural homes and to other places from which the mailed 
forms were not returned 
as in 1980 when mailed forms largely replaced census takers 
the postal service will deliver forms to more that four out of five 
homes in the country based on address lists purchased from 
commercial firms and compiled by the census bureau census takers 
will go to areas where no adequate address lists could be obtained 
over the years hundreds of federal programs have developed that 
disperse money and projects on the basis of census statistics and 
thus need specific information collected every 10 years 
welfare programs and highway funds job training and mass 
transit projects education and urban renewal all depend on the 
census for raw data 
simple pride results in some data being kept when statisticians 
want to drop it 
this time for example the census bureau wanted to leave a 
blank for people to write in their ethnic group if they had checked 
off asian or pacific islander under race 
in 1980 that question offered a list of possible asian and 
pacific island groups and a checkoff box beside each 
members of congress representing areas with many asians and 
pacific islanders didnt like the proposed change and got a bill 
through congress to restore the 1980 style so in april the 
census form will have a list of checkoff boxes for such groups as 
chinese filipino hawaiian korean vietnamese japanese asian 
indian samoan and guamian as well as the writein space for folks 
who dont fit any of those categories 
the end result is two census forms just as in 1980 
one form will be sent to every home in the nation more than 
106 million that form contains seven questions about individuals 
and seven about housing 
one household in six will receive a long form which amounts to 
a massive random sample of the nation 
besides the questions on the short form the long one asks 26 
more about individuals and 19 more about housing 
the personal questions include ones dealing with ancestry work 
and income the housing questions include ones asking about 
plumbing telephones and building age

when the clock strikes midnight strange 
things happen at the dog temple which was dedicated to the 
fidelity of a dog but now attracts gangsters prostitutes 
housewife stock whizzes and forlorn lovers 
tough guys roll up in sports cars sauntering to the altar to 
pray on their knees girls in miniskirts and lowcut blouses 
accompanied by bodyguards in leather jackets place incense in 
sacrificial urns their bouffant hairdos bob as they mumble prayers 
middleaged women clutching copies of stock market listings 
drop wood blocks in a buddhist ritual as they search for an 
ethereal tip 
im praying against vd said a prostitute with fluorescent 
pink lipstick who called herself fragrant flower we little 
misses need all the protection we can get 
praying has become a big business on this island of 20 million 
people where superstition is pervasive thousands of temples 
throughout taiwan do a steady trade in fortunetelling 
astrologers palmists and soothsayers have flocked to the big 
cities to give advice on taiwans huge stock market and the 
popular illegal numbers game 
buddhist taoist or confucian all temples are in on the act 
but perhaps the most famous is the dog temple on a cliff 
overlooking the sea about 15 miles from taipei 
legend has it that about 100 years ago 17 fishermen were caught 
in a storm and pitched overboard their bodies washed up on the 
shore 
local villagers dug a grave for them by the coast as they 
buried the fishermen the vessels pet dog jumped into the ditch to 
be with his masters the villagers buried the dog alive and hung a 
lantern on the grave to commemorate its fidelity 
for years fishermen used the grave as a navigation marker when 
steering their junks into the harbor in rough weather 
in 1961 a group of local businessmen built a temple on the 
site equipped with bronze dogs sacrificial urns with canine 
engravings and statues of taoist sages 
in 1975 the temple doubled in size and began staying open 24 
hours a day it started a store and hired dozens of people to sell 
temple paraphernalia clay dogs incense paper money that is 
burned for the dead 
when plans were made for a nuclear power plant next door the 
temple appeared doomed but local pressure saved the site and now 
nuclear plant officials come to the dog temple to pray 
some businessmen opened a replica of the dog temple just down 
the road to cash in on the excitement but after a few months it 
lost customers 
they could feel there was no power there explained wang 
yuanyuan a dog temple board member who was working the graveyard 
shift at the advice counter recently only we have the genuine 
article the dog spirit 
business has been so profitable said wang that the temple is 
planning a dog theme park just up the hill 
the little dog has been so good to us we want to pay him 
back he said 
hsiao hsinhuang a professor of sociology at national taiwan 
university says uncertainty about the future has fanned the prayer 
craze on this nationalist chinese island he estimates that temples 
make millions selling religious goods and gathering contributions 
nobody knows what will happen so people naturally turn to the 
gods he said people are only interested in fast money and 
many of them believe in luck 
over the past few decades taiwans economy has boomed bringing 
its per capita gross national product to the equivalent of 7518 
in 1988 the fourth highest in asia 
the growth also has created huge savings but the economy lacks 
investment opportunities so much of the cash floods the highly 
speculative stock market in 1987 the market had an up and down 
swing of 450 percent record rises and falls were registerd on two 
consecutive days in november 
proper investment techniques do not seem to work very well 
because big players control the market many investors resort to 
prayer 
thick clouds of eyestinging incense swirl around the temples 
red columns 
two elderly ladies both with pink pocketbooks pluck sheets of 
paper from the wall and head to wang yuanyuans advice desk 
were here looking for good bets says one woman we play 
the stock market and we need a little advice 
mr wang says we have to buy stocks tomorrow her friend 
says after the consultation ends he gave me two numbers 
there it is eighth column fifth stock she says pointing 
to her stock chart thats what ill buy

the visions of st teresa of avila the 
16thcentury spanish nun have run afoul of britains film censors 
who have invoked the littleused blasphemy law for the first time 
the producers of visions of ecstasy a 20minute video about 
the saint lost an appeal to the video appeals committee which has 
met just six times since it was created five years ago 
john stephenson producer of the video said his company was 
considering a further appeal to britains high court 
we condemn the decision as a disgraceful act of censorship 
stephenson said free expression in relation to religion is a 
fundamental right in a pluralistic society 
the video was defended by novelists fay weldn and marina warner 
as a legitimate exploration of the connection between sexual 
passion and religious fervor as expressed in such christian notions 
as the bride of christ 
the video was not in any way an insult to god who i might 
suggest is not easily insulted ms weldon told the appeals 
committee 
the video shows teresa caressing the body of christ on the cross 
and in amorous embraces with another woman the producers say the 
scenes are clearly teresas imagination and the two women 
represent two sides of her personality 
it is the first time in 77 years that the board of censors had 
rejected a film because of the blasphemy law it was given 
responsibility for reviewing videos in 1984 
recently the board cleared martin scorseses controversial 
movie the last temptation of christ though it was condemned 
by many christians because it included a brief scene of christ 
imagining that he was making love with mary magdalene 
it indicated that christ had sex james ferman director of 
the film classification board told the appeals panel at the 
hearing on visions of ecstacy 
ferman said he thought the video showed contempt for the 
divinity of christ by presenting him as a living man not a symbol 
and as an object of sexual passion he said he was particularly 
offended by intercutting the figure of christ into the scene 
between the two women 
there is no attempt to flesh the character physically 
metaphysically or spiritually of st teresa who undertakes 
movements on the body of the crucified christ that is the kernel 
of the objection richard du cann attorney for the board told 
the appeals hearing 
geoffrey robertson attorney for axel ltd which produced the 
video said the board was only speculating that a court would find 
the production blasphemous he called the video an imaginative 
metaphoric portrayal of religious ecstasy 
one wonders what is going on why the board decided to take 
this attitude said andrew puddephat director of the national 
council for civil liberties 
though rarely applied the blasphemy law has been discussed 
frequently in the past year in the controversy over salman 
rushdies novel the satanic verse which many moslems charge 
blasphemes islam in its portrayal of the prophet mohammed 
however britains blasphemy law applies only to christian 
religions and the government has rejected appeals to broaden it 
puddephat said he saw no parallel between the controversies over 
visions of ecstasy and the satanic verses but he added 
sooner or later someone will make it 
stephenson the producer told the independent newspaper that he 
thought the film would sell about 200 copies and disappear and he 
had not anticipated any trouble with the censors 
personally i object to pornography probably more so than 
the board said stephenson who described himself as a former 
devout roman catholic 
our intention was not to offend to titillate or be 
provocative it was to explore something in our own way the 
whole iconography language and meaning of the catholic religion 
are so bound up with images of blood pain suffering and 
sacrifice those in turn are linked to beauty and eroticism 
marina warner who has written scholarly studies of joan of arc 
and the cult of the virgin mary said that if the video was 
blasphemous it was blasphemous in the same sense as the writings 
of teresa and of st catherine of siena who both employed 
erotically charged images 
in 1970 they were the first two women to be cited as doctors 
of the church by the vatican 
teresa born in avila in 1515 fell into trances and experienced 
vivid visions of christ satan and angels 
teresa and her visions have long been a subject for art notably 
gian lorenzo berninis statue the ecstasy of st teresa in the 
chapel of santa maria della vittoria in rome 
film has a special problem ms warner said because actors are 
easily taken to represent real people and the idea of allegory 
starts evaporating 
though such imagery might be congenial to 16thcentury spanish 
catholics ms warner said it would be anathema to protestants 
one religion is a blasphemy against another one sect is a 
blasphemy of another she said in an interview 
i thoroughly disapprove of the law of blasphemy and i think 
it should be repealed i think its divisive unjust and 
capricious

in theory the house has shelved the oldest of 
issues congressional pay with the political pact that is 
supposed to keep candidates quiet on the subject next year in 
practice thats going to be a very difficult deal to enforce 
a conservative think tank already is denouncing both the raise 
and the political pact stephen moore of the heritage foundation 
said congressional tactics on the pay raise were dictatorial if not 
criminal 
the prospect of loopholes that may yet make the pay raise a 1990 
campaign issue does not dismay republican political strategists 
who signed the campaign truce reluctantly in the first place they 
figure that the pay raise could have been the basic issue for gop 
challengers in their campaign to whittle at the house majority the 
democrats have held for 35 years 
house leaders of both parties wanted the political truce to open 
the way to passage of a cost of living increase next year followed 
by a 25 percent raise and a ban on honoraria both effective in 
1991 president bush wanted what they wanted 
and attackminded republicans couldnt buck that lineup so 
party chairman lee atwater swallowed his misgivings and signed away 
an issue that cuts against incumbents the agreement was signed by 
the two national party chairmen and by the chairmen of the national 
house campaign committees 
shelving the issue works to the advantage of house democrats 
because they are the majority with more incumbents at risk 
although one early application of the truce is said to have been a 
reminder to a wouldbe democratic challenger for a republican seat 
that the pay raise is not supposed to be used as an issue 
thats not always going to work in either party even if 
accompanied by sanctions such as the withholding of money and 
manpower the parties customarily supply to their candidates to 
some challengers the issue is likely to be worth more than the 
support especially when criticism of the pay raise could be 
coupled with a denunciation of the national party truce as an 
attempt at gag rule 
one reason the issue will wont die in 1990 is that it will come 
up again in the senate which shunned the full pay raise and voted 
itself a cost of living increase without matching the house ban on 
honoraria 
another is the newfound clout of the radio talk show hosts and 
producers who stirred the outcry against the big pay raise congress 
decided to forgo early in 1989 
political use of that episode notably by atwater who sent out 
a republican fundraising letter denouncing the pay raise even 
though ronald reagan recommended it and president bush endorsed it 
figured in the negotiations that led to the attempt to keep the 
subject out of the 1990 campaign 
atwater signed and therell be no replay he plans to observe 
the pay raise truce to the letter but not beyond he does not feel 
bound to monitor or enforce the truce or to punish gop challengers 
who dont observe it 
in his heritage foundation paper moore argues that congress 
should get a raise only if it meets deficit reduction targets 
otherwise he said pay should be frozen or perhaps even cut it 
seems inconceivable that any corporation wallowing in billions of 
dollars in debt would reward its management with a 40 percent 
acrosstheboard raise moore says 
moore called the raise a bipartisan midnight raid on the 
treasury and said if the executive branch of a private business 
handled its affairs that way they would be universally denounced 
and probably tossed into jail 
he said the political truce is even worse in effect the two 
parties are conspiring to choke off any political opposition to the 
pay raise moore said 
truce or no truce complaints like that are likely to rekindle 
the pay raise issue and put it on the political agenda next year

darkness comes early on dec 21 the 
winter solstice 
but the darkness that fell over syracuse university last dec 21 
when students learned 35 homewardbound classmates had been killed 
by a terrorist bomb aboard pan am flight 103 never completely 
lifted 
its getting harder to think about it without it becoming 
overwhelming said ann lareau a senior who studied in london 
with several of the victims including her best friend 20yearold 
theo cohen 
this was the time of year we were together there when we were 
starting to talk about the things we were going to do when we got 
back said lareau who added in a hushed voice i miss them 
donine carrington a junior said not a day goes by that she 
doesnt think of her friend frederick sandy phillips 
you just dont expect people to die at that age at that age 
youre looking forward to the future she said i guess in time 
the pain will diminish but in my heart it wont start until those 
who are responsible are brought to justice theyre not buried with 
peace their story is not whole 
phillips cohen and 33 other students who spent the semester 
studying overseas under syracuses division of international 
studies abroad program were returning home when their pan am jumbo 
jetliner exploded in the sky over lockerbie scotland 
the bombing killed all 259 people aboard the jet and 11 
residents of lockerbie who died when debris from the plane crashed 
into the town 
the bombing cast a pall over the syracuse campus 
it was oppressive here last spring but those feelings started 
to wane over the summer and earlier this semester said nan 
jensen the universitys religious counseling coordinator but 
its never been forgotten and many students still are having 
trouble letting go 
for some students it was days before they could leave their 
rooms to go to class she said others immersed themselves in 
campaigns for tighter airport security and for travellers right to 
know about terroristic threats as a way to cope with the murders 
jensen said attendance at her weekly grief support sessions 
picked up as the anniversary drew nearer 
kathleen deters who coordinates counseling services in the 
universitys dormitories said residence hall counselors had not 
seen the same increase but that it was more likely students simply 
did not need to see the therapists that work with her office 
ive talked to students and i know theyre still dealing with 
feelings of loss but i dont think its so deepseeded they need 
the kind of counseling we offer she said 
the bombing hasnt been forgotten and i doubt that it ever 
will be every time this part of the season rolls around it will 
come to mind deters said i think that the students organized 
a vigil tells us they still needed an outlet to express themselves 
and reflect on it 
an interfaith vigil was held dec 13 in hendricks chapel where 
hundreds of students converged a year ago after the news of the 
bombing a procession of 35 students carrying candles in memory of 
the victims and a song composed especially for the victims by 
senior marshall whinney highlighted the service which was the day 
before final exams started 
the university is building a memorial wall and has established 
scholarships in tribute to the slain students syracuses football 
coach dick macpherson made a goodwill trip to lockerbie over the 
summer and the universitys twotime defending national champion 
lacrosse team is making a trip in january 
twentyfive of the student victims attended syracuse while the 
remaining 10 were from other schools who traveled abroad as part of 
the universitys foreign studies program 
theyve never been very far from our minds from my mind 
said geri clark a drama professor who had taught seven of the 
victims i still get a number of students in my office every week 
who just want to talk about the bombing or the friends theyve 
lost theres a real sense that our numbers have been diminished in 
a profound way 
many of her students have taken it upon themselves to contact 
the families of the victims they knew clark said 
i guess they just dont want them to feel lonely at this time 
of year she said 
while grieving continues to be the most visible legacy 
hendricks chapel dean richard l phillips has witnessed another 
effect from the bombing 
there is always some good to be found in the worst of 
tragedies he said as a university as a whole we have become 
a more sensitive people because of this tragedy there is more 
reverence for the sanctity of life people are more caring in their 
interpersonal relationships 
phillips said he speaks often to students about the bombing but 
he always tries to focus on the need to reflect on the beauty of 
the lives lost 
they were among the best and brightest and we must never 
forget that he said echoing the words delivered by chancellor 
melvin eggers during a memorial service last january that drew 
15000 people 
lareau the senior who lost her best friend said a recent visit 
to london while difficult helped revive good memories that had 
been blocked out the past year but the effects of the bombing are 
mostly negative 
its a big battle to make friends for me now she said 
im afraid to get close to people i let them in and it seems 
they die

the bombing of pan am flight 103 has not 
reduced the popularity of syracuse universitys overseas study 
program its director says 
no one backed out of the international studies abroad program 
last spring just after 35 returning students were killed in the 
bombing nirelle galson said a handful of students did switch 
flights from an american airline to a foreign one she said 
in the just ended semester about 820 students went abroad to 
study about a 10 percent increase she said 
we had a number of parents and students call asking about 
safety prior to departure but it seemed they were simply seeking 
reassuarances said galson 
i thought wed have some downturn in the spring but it hasnt 
happened but i cant say we wouldnt have had a 20 percent 
increase in participation if it didnt happen

subtle advertising constant sales periodic 
discounts and rebates and an abundance of consumer goods helped 
make big spenders of many americans in the decade of the 1980s 
now as if the abundance of choices were insufficient ordinary 
folks are likely to be presented with still another decision in the 
1990s they will be asked to decide between spending and saving 
it wont be easy after a 15year addiction to the retail 
marketplace a period in which the subtle arts of marketing along 
with plentiful credit and tax incentives helped produce a 
livefornow mentality 
uncle sam will be trying to break that habit in the 1990s and 
the government is preparing the first of its incentives a family 
savings account that would allow 5000 a year to be saved taxfree 
thats a big incentive but one many americans will find 
difficult to exploit because as envisioned those savings would 
lose their tax exemption if not maintained for a decade an 
eternity for those used to immediate gratification 
in this and other ways the bush administration hopes to 
accomplish two ends promote savings which are necessary for 
industrial development and job creation and spur americans to seek 
greater financial rewards by investing for the long term 
the consequences are enormous for individuals the general 
economy and government 
for individuals saving for the long term rather than immediate 
spending might provide the means to buy even more tomorrow 
investments grow the value of purchases often falls 
money saved generally means a sounder economy since it is 
invested in research and development of plant and equipment that in 
turn enhance productive efficiency more goods at lower cost and 
create jobs 
for government the return might not be immediate in fact tax 
exemptions can have the shortterm effect of reducing revenues but 
over the longer term a larger healthier economy inevitably means 
an increase in revenues 
whether the goals can be accomplished is made uncertain by many 
factors for one thing the family savings plan would involve a 
10year period of time an ambitious endeavor in a nation 
accustomed to making tax changes each year 
individual retirement accounts for example were originally 
meant to spur savings by allowing 2000 a year to be invested and 
deducted from current tax liability but after several years the 
deductibility feature was removed 
that action in the opinion of critics all but emasculated an 
otherwise strong incentive to save rather than spend it probably 
left a legacy of doubt about government promised that could impact 
the family savings plans 
however some of the other tax changes in recent years have been 
more in line with the need to save rather than spend most consumer 
debt for example no longer is tax deductible thus removing at 
least one incentive to spending 
americans accepted that action with amazing calmness even 
though it proved to be enormously costly to them however it 
didnt stop them from taking on debt and in that respect it failed 
to make a dent in the buynow philosophy 
it leaves this question if people feel so strongly about buying 
that they will pay higher taxes in order to continue buying will a 
program that rewards them for savings instead of buying be any more 
successful

with stocks diminishing in their own waters asias 
fishing nations are casting for new fishing grounds in a search 
that is bringing conflicts with allies and new links with 
traditional enemies 
the issue also has reached the us congress where senators and 
representatives act either for environmental reasons or to assure 
plentiful supplies of tuna and salmon for american west coast 
fishermen 
much of the conflict however is in the south pacific where 
environmentalists and governments charge that fish stocks are being 
wiped out by a sudden wave of japanese and taiwanese fishing boats 
using giant nets called driftnets 
japanese fishing officials say the criticism is another form of 
japanbashing motivated more by displeasure over japans rapid 
economic growth than environmental concerns 
we dont want another world war ii to occur as a result of the 
current situation but there are people in japan who now feel 
isolated and unfairly treated by the outside world in the same way 
that people did before the war said kiyoshi katsuyama a 
fisheries agency official 
in recent years japan taiwan and south korea have sought 
fishing rights in other nations waters as fish resources have 
declined along their own heavily harvested coasts 
but countries like the united states that once welcomed asian 
fishermen to their relatively unexploited 200mile economic zones 
now have developed their own fishing industries and are limiting 
foreign access to stocks that are seen increasingly as a limited 
resource 
its a whole new situation that fisheries is entering said 
ian kennedy fisheries officer at new zealands embassy in tokyo 
theres a definite trend from management not only within 200mile 
limits but with the high value of migratory species of fish 
migrating outside the limits 
in 1981 japan was allowed to catch about 12 million tons of 
fish within the united states 200mile zone but its quota was cut 
to virtually zero by 1988 
in their search for fish some countries are entering deals with 
nations they had little to do with before 
companies in anticommunist south korea have landed deals to 
fish in soviet chinese and vietnamese waters 
taiwanese fishing companies plan to visit the soviet union 
early in 1990 to explore fishing cooperation officials say 
china has established joint ventures with nigeria 
guineabissau senegal and morocco in africa and plans to increase 
its fishing fleet in foreign waters next year from 100 to 120 
boats according to official press reports 
japan is interested in entering joint ventures in soviet waters 
but is waiting for more signs of political stability in moscow 
before deciding us officials say 
but increasingly asian fishing powers are turning to 
international waters for their fish 
last season after japanese fishing researchers discovered large 
supplies of albacore tuna in the south pacific high seas japanese 
driftnet boats in the region increased from 20 to 60 and taiwanese 
boats surged to at least 60 and perhaps as many as 130 
driftnets which sweep as much as 30 miles of ocean at once 
consist of a line of nets each about two miles long separated 
from each other by about a quarter of a mile japanese fishing 
officials say the nets attached to floats are allowed to drift 
until they are picked up later 
driftnetting countries say the nets are the only economically 
feasible way to fish on the high seas where fish are less 
concentrated than in coastal areas 
in october however prime minister geoffrey palmer of new 
zealand asked the united nations to ban driftnetting calling them 
walls of death that catch and kill like a vacuum cleaner 
virtually every living creature including some endangered species 
which come in contact with them 
in november 20 south pacific nations decided to ban driftnets 
from their economic zones and urged japan and taiwan to agree to a 
regional prohibition on the method 
the two nations agreed to reduce their fleets but refused to 
discuss a total ban japan called instead for an international 
commission to oversee regional fishing stocks 
theres no scientific evidence yet that driftnetting is 
damaging fisheries resources so its premature to institute a 
ban said kunio kimura senior managing director of the japan 
fisheries association 
its true that there is an incidental catch of marine animals 
in driftnets said katsuyama the fisheries agency official 
but its a mistake to ban a method because one or 10 are caught 
if the number is too large then what we need to do is reduce it 
controversy over driftnetting originally began in the north 
pacific where us salmon fishermen protested poaching by asian 
squid driftnetters 
taiwan has acknowledged that violations occurred and along with 
south korea has agreed to let us officials inspect driftnet 
vessels suspected of illegally catching us fish 
american officials in tokyo say that because of the japanese 
governments tough monitoring they do not believe japanese 
driftnetters now are poaching substantial amounts of us salmon 
despite such charges by members of the us congress 
a bill before the us house of representatives would prohibit 
imports of all fish caught with driftnets while a congressional 
subcommittee has given its approval to a bill calling on the bush 
administration to seek an international ban on driftnetting 
that could be embarrassing to the united states said an 
american official in tokyo because the us has one of the 
biggest driftnet fisheries in the world for salmon in american 
waters near alaska and elsewhere 
environmentalists have a bad taste in their mouth regarding 
japan because of its whaling the us official said speaking on 
condition of anonymity theres a sense that if japan does it it 
must be bad environmentally but if japan does change its policy 
regarding driftnetting it could start pointing its finger at us

tourists can still see the subtle 
smile but little else of the sphinx the half man half beast 
crouched in the desert sands guarding the pyramids 
the smile projects above protective scaffolding being erected to 
envelop the chest of the ailing 4600yearold statue as egyptian 
authorities try yet another remedy for the ills afflicting one of 
the worlds bestknown monuments 
the effort has surrounded the stoic stone statue with turbaned 
workers prying rocks from his massive paws sticking sensors into 
his backside or hammering on the wooden chest girdle 
scaffolding first appeared at the sphinxs right shoulder in the 
spring of 1988 shortly after a rock broke off and tumbled to the 
ground more weak spots were discovered and now the framework is 
being extended across the famous frontal view 
prime minister atef sedki of egypt made an official inspection 
visit seeking to determine whether restoration begun in 1982 
which covered the front paws and other portions with concrete 
blocks helped or harmed the sphinx 
theres no threat to the sphinx sedki said after the visit 
but he added although im not a technical man i can see with my 
eyes that former restoration work was wrong 
the government will not deny any financial support that the 
new restoration work requires the important thing is to save the 
statue that symbolizes the egyptian civilization 
sayed tawfik chairman of the egyptian antiquities organization 
said the latest effort calls for removing all large restoration 
stones attached since 1982 
restoration was being done on the sphinx at least 3000 years 
ago but tawfik climbing atop the front paws said a key 
difference in the current project is that for the first time 
restorers will try to ensure that the repaired sphinx looks like 
the sphinx 
earlier restorations in the 1980s he said simply coated 
endangered areas without regard to the shape the ancients carved 
theres a 10centimeter fourinch difference in the original 
shape of the paws and in restoration stones that cover them 
tawfik said you cant even imagine how the sphinx should look 
he said the egyptianborn artist and sculptor adam henein has 
been brought from paris to help restore the body to its original 
form 
were studying hundreds of pictures taken since the middle of 
the last century even when it was almost totally buried for clues 
to how the sphinx looked he said 
concrete blocks have been numbered and are being carried from 
the site as smaller replacement stones from the giza plateau are 
installed greeks and romans restoring the monument more than 2000 
years ago also used small blocks and tawfik said their work is 
better than any by modern restorers 
restoration begun in 1982 proved awfully bad because large 
stones were used that completely damaged the sphinx said zahi 
hawass director of the pyramids area 
also they used cement and gypsum so now not only are we 
looking at bad rock that has always been in the sphinx but also at 
rock thats been damaged from bad restoration 
criticism of the 1980s restoration has been common for years and 
the sphinx has become a political issue as well as a scientific one 
the latest controversy began in midnovember with stories in 
newspapers speculating that mischief felled the chunk of stone from 
the sphinxs right shoulder on feb 7 1988 
tawfik and other experts responded by saying scientists studied 
the rockfall for a year before deciding it occurred in a section of 
limestone weakened by salt wind and other natural phenomena the 
dispute raged for weeks 
the sphinx is likely to have little peace for quite a while 
the sphinx is like lebanon with militias tearing at each 
other said omar elarini a member of the antiquities 
organizations scientific committee and a science officer at the 
us embassy 
hes a 50millionyearold man because thats how old the 
rock is how do you restore him do you rejuvenate him do you 
treat his ailments 
whats missing here is a general plan

cambodias noncommunist guerrillas 
are seeing an erosion of support from the western world at a time 
when they are making significant gains against the 
vietnamesebacked government in cambodia 
everywhere in the world the communist system is falling 
said gen sak sutsakarn commanderinchief of the khmer peoples 
national liberation front why wont the world support the 
noncommunists in cambodia especially cambodia we have suffered 
more than anyone 
the apparent reason for the diminishing support is a concern 
that the noncommunists are coordinating their military offensive 
with the communist khmer rouge which took power in 1976 and 
inflicted a reign of terror on cambodia that left a million or more 
dead 
the national liberation front the khmer rouge and a 
noncommunist group loyal to prince nordom sihanouk the former 
head of state have formed a loose alliance that has been waging 
war against the vietnamese and the cambodian government they 
installed in phnom penh the capital in 1979 
the coalition which holds cambodias seat in the united 
nations is largely armed by china but the two noncommunist 
factions get us and other western financial and political support 
the noncommunists still reel from charges of corruption 
internal bickering and being militarily inneffectual but they have 
established better internal discipline over the past two years and 
in recent months they have shown battlefield prowess 
in recent weeks a number of us congressmen have criticized 
washingtons support for the noncommunists as tantamount to 
support for the khmer rouge 
britain backed away from supporting the noncommunists in 
november following media reports that the british were training 
soldiers under the control of pol pot the shadowy khmer rouge 
leader who led cambodias terror government until a vietnamese 
ousted him in 1979 after they invaded the country 
australia and france have voiced support for leaving cambodias 
un seat vacant creating more cracks in what only months ago was 
a solid western bloc of support for the coalition 
all three groups seek either the downfall of the government of 
leader hun sen in phnom penh or leverage at the negotiating table 
but reporters able to reach battle zones or newly taken towns have 
seen no sign of joint military operations between the 
noncommunists and the khmer rouge 
with the bodies of government soldiers lying in nearby trenches 
national liberation front guerrillas celebrated their biggest 
victory of the war recently with the capture of svay chek a key 
town 
where are the khmer rouge said gen khun roeng pointing 
toward hundreds of his guerrillas on the defense perimeter the 
khmer rouge are not invited to this party 
resistance leaders acknowledge however that they do have field 
communication with the khmer rouge but solely for reasons of not 
getting in the way of each others attacks 
the noncommunists have seized more than 100 square miles of 
territory in northwest cambodia since launching a general offensive 
after vietnam began withdrawing its last troops from cambodia in 
september 
we have two enemies says gen dien del the national 
liberation fronts founder the first is the vietnamese and then 
the khmer rouge the cambodian people understand that vietnam wants 
to swallow our country and that is why all patriots have a duty to 
work together to save cambodia but we are not with the khmer 
rouge and the khmer rouge knows this very well 
he added we need the public support of the americans we 
need to be able to say look we are backed by the west 
sak the commanderinchief said what happens to cambodia if 
support for the noncommunist resistance stops the war will 
continue between the two communists the khmer rouge and the hun 
sen government there will be no peace but it guarantees the 
future government will be a communist one

months after their daughter melina was 
killed on pan am flight 103 a notebook she carried was returned to 
paul and eleanor hudson a quote written in the back by the 
teenager read no one dies unless theyre forgotten 
the hudsons have spent much of the past year making sure that 
melina and the 269 other people killed when the jumbo jet was blown 
up over lockerbie scotland last dec 21 are not forgotten 
the organization they started families of pan am 103lockerbie 
takes up a whole room at hudsons law offices the room is filled 
with evidence of the couples life this past year letters to 
politicians transcripts of congressional hearings news clippings 
lists of victims families newsletters a sketch of melina 
melinas mother says she spends countless hours at the office 
im a teacher by profession but this is my job theres a duty 
here she said 
that duty to reveal the full story of the flight 103 bombing 
has taken hudson a softspoken welltodo lawyer to the halls of 
congress to europe and to a private session with president bush 
he still has questions 
why wasnt the bombing of flight 103 prevented why was his 
daughter coming home for christmas after a semester abroad in 
london allowed to take a plane with a bomb on it 
we thought what do we do now that she died do we pretend 
that she just died in a drowning eleanor hudson said she was 
sixteen she was coming home from christmas what kind of joke 
is this 
she shows a picture of melina on the front steps of their albany 
townhouse she is thin her blonde hair is swept back and she is 
smiling coyly she was beautiful how could we not do this 
days after the crash hudson took melinas dental records to 
lockerbie for her identification the hudsons dentist told eleanor 
hudson who remained in albany that another area family who lost a 
daughter in the crash the hartunians was unable to get 
information from scotland 
she spoke to them on christmas eve and realized her husband 
could help 
they just wanted to know whether their daughter was in a body 
bag or in a morgue she said i said my husband is there he 
can find out 
the hudsons met more families at nine funerals and at a memorial 
service for the 36 syracuse university students killed on the 
flight they too were frustrated by the state departments 
silence after the crash hudson said 
to see nothing but a cloak of silence it gave us not only an 
angry feeling but frankly it was very ominous he said 
it was clear to me by the end of january that unless there was 
some public outcry and unless people formally organized that the 
government was going to do nothing he said 
on feb 19 the families of pan am flight 103lockerbie held its 
first meeting in hasbrouk heights nj 
the organization is partially a support group but hudson as 
chairman has spearheaded government lobbying asking for an 
investigation of the bombing 
the group is pressing the government to tighten security for 
international flights hudson contends that if pan am had competent 
security the bombing could have been avoided 
weve known pan ams security was a sham for many months 
and it still is he said its geared to public relations not 
to effectively stopping bombings 
he wants a ban on electronic devices used to hide bombs like the 
one in a radiocassette player that blew up flight 103 he says 
luggage should be searched by hand and all luggage be matched with 
passengers 
he also wants the government to make public all credible threats 
made by terrorists concerning international flights 
private investigations found the state department received as 
many as four warnings of possible terrorist actions directed at 
us air carriers last december one of them apparently directed at 
flight 103 hudson said 
they had a lot of intelligence in the case of 103 its just a 
matter of what they did with it he said 
after extended pressure from families and congressmen president 
bush appointed a sevenmember committee in august to investigate 
the crash and draft a report 
hudson said that could be the definitive document explaining the 
disaster it is tentatively due on may 1 
meanwhile the hudsons have gone to scotland to mark the crime 
that has brought them together with dozens of other families on 
thursday evening in lockerbie luminares candles stuck in bags of 
sand are to be lit for each of the 270 victims of pan am flight 
103 
the quiet lawyer and his wife say they refuse to let anyone 
forget 
i felt and i feel that unless something is done about these 
things we will see hundreds perhaps thousands of more americans 
coming back in body bags he said 
i have three other children i dont want to see this happen 
again

to the same calendar worldwide there are at least 40 of them each 
marching to its own drummer 
but just 10 years from new years day christians will rip a 
page off the calendar and saturday 12311999 will become sunday 
112000 the zeros lined up like cherries in a slot machine like 
a milestone 100000 miles on the family clunker killjoys say the 
millennium really is 112001 because we count from one not zero 
so 2000 is really the 10th year of the 1990s disregard them 
but one mans millennium is anothers numberless day at the 
office moslems will uncelebrate the middle of 1420 ah jews 5761 
am ancient greeks will observe the 694th olympiad 
olympiad 
the way years get numbered you see depends on whos counting 
when they began counting and what theyre counting if you count by 
the moon moslems do a year is 12 lunar months based on 29 days 
12 hours 44 minutes and 28 seconds from new moon to new moon the 
solar year is about 11 days longer the 365 days 5 hours 48 
minutes and 46 seconds it takes earth to circle the sun eventually 
by the moslem calendar its june in january but who decided its 
january in january anyway 
to begin with the calendar is a convenience to mark the passage 
of time it tells you when its time to move the sheep into the 
hills when to report for spring training when to plant cotton 
when to pay bills when to get married next saturday and celebrate 
the anniversary of such 10 years hence 
ancients just chased mastodons whenever they could find them and 
didnt worry about dates until they settled down and began planting 
crops for that you had to know seasons the clock of the heavenly 
bodies in their unalterable cycles told them 
the egyptians knew the nile was about to flood when sirius the 
dog star was on the horizon at sunrise plant australian 
aborigines know its time to hunt termites when arcturus is on the 
horizon at dawn eat 
the sumerians and babylonians firstrate farmers and no 
dummies had a good calendar but it was based on the moon and 
pretty soon youre planting wheat in december with predictable 
results 
the year hath a deficiency would declare hammurabi the 
great lawgiver as he threw in an extra month we call such 
doctoring intercalation 
the babylonians also invented the week maybe because seven was 
their lucky number maybe because it conveniently divided the 
lunation into quarters the jews later reinvented the week based on 
the seven days of creation 
somewhere along the line sunday became the first day because the 
sun gave life saturday at weeks end comes from the roman god 
saturn who presided over old age oldtime teutons also named days 
for gods such as wodan thor and fria guess what became of them 
in yemen the day begins when you can tell a white goat hair from 
a black one moslems begin a month when holy men first report a 
sighting of the new crescent moon if its overcast they wait a 
day and start counting again 
the mursi in southwest ethiopia spend most of the month 
arguing about what day it is they spend the rest arguing about 
what month it is says leroy doggett editor of the nautical 
almanac in washington dc 
if you dont have to catch a plane the date may not really 
matter 
the soviets in the flush of communist creation tried a 
fiveday week in 1919 went to six days in 1932 and returned to 
tradition in 1941 they also celebrate the october revolution in 
november which well get to 
the ancient egyptians switched from the babylonian moon to a 
12month solar calendar of 30 days each and tagged on five holidays 
at years end in 238 bc ptolemy iii also no dummy put in a 
leap day after checking with sirius to make up for the fraction of 
a day left over from 365 days in orbit 
meanwhile in rome the romans did as the romans romulus 
cofounder of the city devised a 10month calendar of 304 days 
winter months were useless and not counted the year began in 
aprilis from latin to open at the time of the equinox of 
equal night and day 
romuluss successor king numa added januarius and februarius 
and came up with a 12month calendar of 365 days not bad but 
still out of tune made more so by high priests who were not above 
subtracting a month to collect taxes sooner or adding some to 
extend friends terms of office 
what with one thing or another by the time of julius caesar the 
calendar was three months out of phase with the sun caesar hired 
the egyptian astronomer sosigenes he added three months just like 
that to 46 bc producing a year of 445 days and what justly 
became known as the year of confusion 
this julian calendar had the requisite 365 days plus a leap 
every third year caesars birth month of quintilis was renamed in 
his honor guess where july comes from augustus caesar finetuned 
things by making leap year every fourth year in his honor the 
month of sextilils was named for him by now you must know where 
august comes from and a day was added to it to make 31 and not be 
outshone by 31day julius the julian calendar was ok but lagged 14 
seconds a year or one day every 128 years 
but which year was it 
the romans started counting from romulus and remus year one 
being 753 auc anno urbis conditae the year the city was 
founded the jews toted up the begats and counted from creation 
3761 bc before christ to christians am anno mundi year of 
the world to jews the greeks counted in fouryear periods 
olympiads starting with 776 bc when coraebus won the first 
olympic foot race the japanese counted from the first emperor 
660 bc and the chinese from the first year of whatever dynasty 
they were in the mohammadans werent there yet

this brings us to 1285 auc which the abbot of rome 
dionysius exiguus decided after much research was 532 ad that 
many years since the birth of christ everything else was bc even 
though for instance it was year 146 of the yuan wei dynasty in 
china the century before early christians at the council of 
nicaea 1206 auc 4214 am or 453 ad had pegged easter to the 
spring equinox as well as passover out of respect for christs 
jewish origins this tiein became important in christian dogma 
enter the moslems they began counting from thursday july 16 
622 ad when allah directed mohammed to flee from mecca his 
successor omar opted for a lunar calendar of 12 alternating 
29and 30day months for a year of 354 days since intercalation 
was forbidden islam has a lot of movable feasts and fasts as the 
lunar year gains a year on solar about every 32 years you can 
figure a moslem is a year older if not wiser for every such period 
in india astronomers picked up on solar time but there were a 
lot of calendars that kings and rajahs dated for themselves the 
sivajli era began for example with year one as of june 6 1674 
when king maratha was crowned in western india 
the era of parasurama began in 1176 bc around madras but is so 
complicated you dont even want to think about it the saka 
calendar dates from march 3 ad 78 when the visible planets were 
lined up 
india had about 17 calendars when it went gregorian in 1957 when 
march 22 became 1 chatra 1879 saka there is also a time period of 
4320000 years in the hindu religion called the mahayuga which is 
one day in the life of brahman god of creation which makes auc 
look like a split second 
as julian time passed easter was increasingly out of synch with 
equinoxpassover and well on its way to summer in the 13th century 
a worried roger bacon in england wrote pope clement iv about it 
nothing happened the council of trent which began in 1545 
authorized reform 
pope gregory xiii finally sat down with italian astronomer 
aloisius lilius and german math whiz christopher clavius and 
devised a new calendar years ending in double zero were only leap 
years if they could be divided by 400 that meant the calendar was 
only off 26 seconds a year and only one day by the 1420th olympiad 
plus a year of ad 4905 gregory forthwith decreed that thursday 
oct 4 1582 would be followed by friday oct 15 
catholic nations dutifully complied protestants being 
protesters protested gregory was trying to confuse christs second 
coming and wasnt he afraid the world would end sooner suspicious 
britain didnt go gregorian until sept 2 1752 a wednesday to be 
followed by thursday the 14th the julian calendar then being 11 
days out of whack 
laborers rioted over lost pay landlords screamed about lost 
rent ben franklin cool as ever counseled his fellow british 
subjects to lie down in peace on the 2nd and not wake till the 
morning of the 14th which they did as usual time healed all 
wounds including george washingtons who since gregory moved new 
years from march 25 to january 1 was now born in 1732 instead of 
1731 thus becoming a year younger 
the russians stuck with julius caesar until after the bolshevik 
revolution hence the october parade in november alaska lost 12 
days when it changed hands from the czar to the united states in 
1867 but life went on 
for some reason revolutionaries seem to take it out on the 
calendar for a time american redhots dated from their rebellion 
against england the french revolution all but guillotined the 
calendar abolishing sunday with a 10day week the new calendar 
had 12 30day months poetically named eg floreal blossom 
month and vendemaire vintage month the last five days of 
the year were named sans cullotides without pantaloons in 
honor of the paris freedom fighters of the barricades who couldnt 
afford aristocratic knickers napoleon went gregorian again in 1805 
not that gregorys work is ideal untidy says doggett 
gregorys year cant be divided into handy halves and quarters 
upsetting finicky accountants dates keep falling on different 
days the western clock co of la salle ill decided in 1892 to 
go its own bookkeeping way with a regular quarterly calendar by 
1950 1062 companies in the united states and canada had followed 
suit 
one suggested reform is for 13 months of 28 days each each year 
would begin sunday and end saturday followed by a year day people 
born jan 29 for example would blow out the candles feb 1 in 
all 94 days would have to be moved 
in 1930 elisabeth achelis an american proposed a world 
calendar of even quarters moving only eight days and making the 
same date recur on the same day every year adding leap year at the 
end of june and putting a year day at the end that would not be 
sunday or anything else the united nations has mulled it over but 
seventh day adventists and orthodox jews object to the 
disappearance of a sabbath 
then theres the earth herself in ad 1654 james ussher 
archbishop of the church of england delved into assorted old 
testaments and astronomical works and decided time began when 
creation did 9 am oct 4 4004 bc by this reckoning 112000 
or even 112001 arent millennia at all its just 6004 
but earth like a proper dowager is coy about her age 
scientists know sometimes she spins slower sometimes faster they 
dont know why several hours have been lost in the past 3000 
years 
whats official however is that in just 10 years your 
insurance companys gregorian calendar will end in 000 that means 
earth will have embarked on her 2000th orbit around the sun since 
dionysius exiguuss year zero a lot of people have claimed 
exiguus was four years off about adbc but they were too late 
so to speak 
whether purists deign to salute 2000 with a toot or two remains 
to be seen to many mayans in the crowd it will be a humdrum 
5113th year for those crackerjack astronomers the japanese will 
toast 2660 indians will celebrate saka 1922 romulus may wish 
remus a prosperous 2573 auc 
to the rest of you happy millennium

youre probably aware of the origins of corn 
squash and beans but did you know american indians also gave us 
blue corn tortillas fried squash blossoms and black bean soup 
native american dishes are showing up on some of the trendiest 
menus in the country if you ask barrie kavasch a longtime expert 
on americas oldest ethnic cuisine its about time 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
barrie kavaschs saturday night dinner 
parties in the mid60s were notorious among her neighbors 
at a time when most suburbanites were mastering the art of 
french cooking with boeuf bourguignon and chocolate mousse the 
unassuming housewife and mother of two was stunning guests with 
dandelion fritters and smoked eel stew 
while many americans were cooking french kavasch was cooking 
american native american her platters of fried squash blossoms 
nasturtium salad and conch stew could utterly astonish even the 
most sophisticated people she recalls 
not anymore 
today many of the same foods that once confounded barrie 
kavaschs neighbors are showing up on some of the trendiest menus 
at some of the hottest restaurants in the country 
and kavasch is in great demand as a teacher and lecturer shes 
as apt to be baking pumpkins and frying cornpones at museums 
universities and cooking schools as in her bridgewater kitchen 
in february shell team up with a chef at the harvard club in 
new york to produce a fivecourse american indian dinner for 300 
distinguished guests in may shell prepare a similar banquet for 
culinary historians in boston 
having spent much of her life a somewhat solitary booster of 
american indian foods kavasch who is not of indian heritage 
suddenly finds herself with lots of company though still far from 
mainstream indian foods are enjoying a renaissance amid a national 
passion for southwestern and cajun dishes and a growing concern 
over diet and health 
theres more acceptance that people should eat high 
carbohydrates more grains and more vegetables says mark miller 
owner and chef at the muchheralded coyote cafe in santa fe nm 
if you look at diets made up of grains and complex 
carbohydrates that will take us right back into indian food adds 
miller whose indianinfluenced creations include wild tumbleweeds 
with grilled venison and dried cherrychili sauce his new 
cookbook coyote cafe due out in january is sprinkled with 
american indian legends and poetry 
at the mansion on turtle creek in dallas another culinary 
landmark chef dean fearings offerings include grilled game with 
cornpones and wild rice sauce and texas antelope stew on posole 
tortillas 
at arizona 206 in new york former executive chef brendan walsh 
had diners lining up for a taste of the southwest in the big apple 
with corn flour pastas and pumpkin seed sauces 
southwestern food especially new mexican food is probably 
60 percent indianinfluenced and 40 percent spanish says jane 
butel a former new mexico home economist whose texmex 
cookbook helped launch the craze a decade ago 
while most people are quick to recognize the spanish element 
they are far less aware of the indian influence adds butel who 
recently opened a traditional new mexican restaurant pecos river 
cafe in new york 
thats not surprising says jack weatherford an associate 
professor of anthropology at macalester college in st paul minn 
theres a tendency to want to emphasize european heritage and 
minimize native heritage he says 
european food is prestige food we simply dont value american 
indian foods enough adds weatherford who traced indian 
contributions to medicine agriculture cooking and other areas of 
modern life his resulting book indian givers will be 
published by ballantine books in january 
while most people are aware of the origins of corn beans 
squash pumpkin and turkey they tend not to know indians also gave 
the world guacamole tomatoes potatoes tortillas tacos and 
tamales weatherford says 
few people think about indians while eating lobster oysters 
scallops clams and roe not to mention smoked salmon fried 
catfish and clam chowder barbecue was an indian invention as were 
tomato sauce clambakes brunswick stew crab cakes baked beans 
maple syrup baked apples and cranberry sauce 
most regional american cuisines stand on an indian base 
says weatherford consider the liberal use of maple syrup seafood 
and beans in the northeast hominy grits sweet potatoes and 
pecans in the south and red beans cayenne pepper file and 
crayfish in cajun and creole dishes 
though the latter are often associated more with french than 
indian cooks he says these foods are no more french than tacos 
and tamales are spanish creole and cajun foods came to us via the 
mixture of people who incorporated french blacks and indians into 
their heritage the resulting food is primarily indian secondarily 
black and only tangentially french 
sixty percent of foods grown in the world today came from north 
and south american indians weatherford says the american indian 
larder contained a tremendous variety of foods the indians of the 
andes produced more types of crops than all the farmers of europe 
and asia combined 
and a recent report by the academy of sciences identified 70 
fruits vegetables and grains we never use in this country that 
would be appropriate for use 
quinoa an ancient grain that once grew wild in north america 
is being reintroduced with the highest protein content of any 
grain quinoa now grown experimentally in the rockies can be used 
as a wheat substitute for flour pasta and other products 
though slightly less nutritious amaranth also grown in the 
west is still higher in protein than all european grains and is 
being sold ground or as a cereal chef miller recently experimented 
with amaranth in making tamales and found them earthier with a 
stronger grain flavor than their corn counterparts

while some chefs dismiss indian food as dull weatherford 
disagrees some of this is extremely sophisticated food i think 
of guacamole for example as a very subtle refined dish 
miller an anthropology graduate student before becoming a chef 
agrees the high level of aesthetics in other american indian art 
forms indicates a highly evolved cuisine he says 
unfortunately kavasch says indian cuisine has been 
trivialized american indian food is so unsung and misconstrued and 
put down in fact its as exotic as oysters and roe and smoked 
salmon there is no more colorful or unique ethnic cuisine 
kavasch whose native harvests was published in 1977 is 
writing a new cookbook with dale carson of madison who is indian 
she also is working with american indians and food scientists on 
a line of snack foods made from wild produce 
in her early years in bridgewater kavaschs cooking wasnt the 
only thing that set her apart 
i treated my kids with natural remedies resorting to 
antibiotics and other prescription medicines only when necessary 
she says ive always been into farming and gardening and ive 
always valued selfsufficiency 
she grew up during the 1940s and 50s with an appreciation for 
natural things and respect for selfsufficiency rare in an era of 
processed convenience foods but on her grandparents 100acre farm 
in tennessee we bought nothing canned we dried and canned 
everything we needed and there was no such thing as garbage 
everything had a use there was great dignity in it 
she still forages on her land in northwestern connecticut for 
black walnuts wild mushrooms and onion grass and grows much of 
her own produce in a carefully tended garden 
it was her lifelong interest in health that led her to study 
ethnobotany ways in which indians used plants to create medicines 
preservatives heating and building materials and other goods 
her path led on to food and nutrition 
indians could tramp all day on a pocketful of parched corn 
the ancestor of cracker jacks and outdistance the europeans she 
says scientists have discovered they were taller than europeans 
with stronger bones and teeth and longer life expectancies 
clearly the indian way of eating held lessons for modern 
society earlier people had an intrinsic sense of wellness they 
saw certain food as preventive medicine eaten for greater mental 
health and vigor 
unfortunately information about cuisine was not passed on 
the accounts that exist were usually from a white perspective 
reflecting mens outlook on things done by women 
recipes in native harvests are based on accounts by trappers 
and missionaries conversations with american indians and camping 
trips during which kavasch lived off wild foods 
one treasured recipe came from a catawba indian from north 
carolina who told her of a corn and peach soup made by his mother 
i worked on it for years he would come to visit and taste my 
latest attempt and i would send him pictures 
it took years when i finally got it right he took a mouthful 
and burst into tears recalls kavasch whose own eyes fill with 
tears at the memory 
in keeping with historical accuracy she used no salt or dairy 
products in native harvests but in the interest of 
palatability she says shell probably use them in her new book 
among writers of american indian cookbooks the debate between 
authenticity and taste is an old one 
though admirable accuracy doesnt sell says jean anderson 
whose 16 cookbooks include the art of american indian cooking 
the big problem with indian cooking is its heavily adapted 
for the american kitchen you cant say run out and gather the 
salmon spawn ladies will say yuck 
in developing recipes for her 1965 cookbook we took the 
things we felt would be most appealing and tried to make them into 
something a lady in garden city kansas would prepare and her 
family would like anderson says we got dinged 
los angeles food photograper lois ellen frank the granddaughter 
of a kiowa indian also chose accessibility over authenticity in 
native american cuisine due out next fall 
she says she kept the minuscule metropolitan kitchen rather than 
the open fire in mind in developing recipes for such dishes as 
rabbit rolled in blue corn meal and broiled with wild mint or 
venison steaks with juniper berry and red chili sauce 
when you think about it everythings adapted whether its 
how to make pasta or what is southwest cuisine frank says 
does that ruin it i dont think so

come take a ride on a new york subway with a 
conductor who likes to entertain his passengers with funny 
announcements at each station stop harry nugent the son of a 
circus barker says he wants o reassure the riders that they 
havent left civilization behind when they walk down the subway 
stairs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the no 1 broadway local is packed but the 
subway cant leave the station it cant leave the station because 
the trains doors cant close the doors cant close because some 
idiot is holding them open for a late arrival on the platform 
this is bad enough but the passengers must now brace for an 
accompanying sonic assault the obligatory conductors admonition 
over the public address system always delivered in harsh loud new 
yawkese 
stanclearadaclosindoors 
but instead this morning they are surprised to hear 
your hearts in the right place but your foot isnt if you 
dont want to ride just step onto the platform youll find its 
quite stationary 
this message is delivered not as a rebuke but as a gentle 
reminder and the speakers voice is smooth and soothing like that 
of a professional broadcaster from the old school 
the impression and the hope that this will not be the usual 
subway trip is confirmed at the next stop 
this is rector street wellpositioned in the financial 
district rub shoulders with the stock exchangers but stand clear 
of the closing doors this is the no 1 to van cortlandt park 
the conductor is harry nugent who has raised stationstop 
announcements to an art and introduced a measure of civility into a 
subterranean realm that could use it 
nugent 60 is a pleasant man with a neat moustache and receding 
hairline who manages to look natty in the standard blue transit 
authority uniform and cap 
imaginative announcements break the tedium he explains but he 
also wants passengers to feel they havent left civilization merely 
by walking down a flight of stairs 
this is franklin street tribeca in location litigious in 
concept and convenient to an eclectic collection of courthouses 
franklin will be followed by canal as we make our way to van 
cortlandt park 
how did a guy who talks like this get into subway conducting 
nugent says he spent 15 years at look magazine basically as a 
gofer with a nice office on the 16th floor when the magazine 
folded he became a conductor because he says with a smile i 
didnt want to get out of communications then he adds it was 
a port in a storm that was 17 years ago 
now were entering 14th street station if you think youd 
like to change into something else you can slip into a 2 or a 3 
train speaking of numbers were the 1 to van cortlandt park 
before leaving the train a middleaged man carrying a briefcase 
walks up to nugent and tells him if the rest of the transit 
authority was as competent as you theyd have no problems 
a welldressed woman asks nugent for his name which she writes 
down in a notebook she seems reluctant to get off at her stop 
were approaching 23rd street which puts its best foot 
forward with the illustrious chelsea hotel its other foot isnt 
bad either the flatiron building the next stop we encounter will 
be 28th street 
nugent says he began to embellish his announcements about eight 
years ago when the transit authority was trying to get conductors 
to give passengers more information a process that was abetted by 
the arrival of new trains with audible public address systems 
nugent had spent a lot of time between stops thinking about what 
to say at first i just wanted to break the hostility with a few 
elegant announcements but the point im at now is probably absurd 
maybe ive been breathing too much steel dust down here 
our stop is 28th street noted for its flora and fauna its 
the site of the flower district and the fur district twentyeighth 
will be followed by 33rd thats the way it is on the no 1 local 
perhaps the steel dust is taking effect

this is 34th street how does it serve us let me count the 
ways penn station the long island railroad amtrak madison 
square garden and much else times square is next on our quest for 
van cortlandt park 
nugent regularly gets applause cheers flowers and thankyou 
notes a homeless woman told him youve given me 40 minutes of 
happiness a punk rocker said he dug his rap one man obtained 
nugents schedule and began planning his trips accordingly 
sometimes tourists throw money into his conductors booth they 
think im some sort of street performer he complains 
this is times square a station that celebrates transfers to 
the 2 3 and 7 the n and r the grand central shuttle up one 
track and down the other not one dull or idle moment 
that line comes from nugents father who ran away from home as 
a boy to join the circus and went on to become a magician 
puppeteer and sideshow barker sometimes he feels like a pitchman 
himself a tout for 38 stations 
our station is 50th street its several blocks from 
rockefeller center but you can walk there if you have a yen for 
it 
nugent often slips in references to current events in this case 
the sale of a majority interest in rockefeller center to a japanese 
corporation but you have to be careful he says because people 
dont pay their 1 to be offended 
were arriving at 96th street here we have a parting of the 
ways with our running mates the 2 and the 3 so its your last 
chance to transfer heading our way perhaps we should join forces 
were the 1 to van cortlandt park 
nugents conducting has opened doors for himself too including 
offers to perform on radio and in nightclubs he passed on the 
former his line has 38 stations and hes on all of them as for 
standup comedy he asks how would i get the train in a club 
the problem with notoriety is that people now expect the unusual 
from nugent one day i was just making standard announcements 
nothing special and a guy came up and said whats wrong i 
brought my wife to hear you 
this is 110th street also known as central park north and 
cathedral parkway does a street with three names sound magical no 
surprise harry houdini used to get off here if you just joined 
us were going uptown to van cortlandt park 
some riders ask nugent if the voice they hear is a tape 
recording he tells them yes im stateoftheart others 
who assume theyve been listening to the motorman in the front of 
the train tell nugent hes great 
hes happy to hear that the conductor responds 
were at 215th street a station that is gradually winning 
acceptance from the newly erected allen pavilion of presbyterin 
hospital 
nugent stole that line from bob and ray he often twists the 
languages logic as when he says that the 79th street station is 
cleverly arranged to be only two blocks from the museum of 
natural history 
his routine also includes an assortment of puns sixtysixth 
street station serves the medley of theaters known in concert as 
lincoln center when the train emerges from the tunnel and runs 
on elevated tracks after 116th street he says you may get the 
impression were gaining altitude but we never rise above our 
station 
our next stop will be 225th street in the bronx were now 
crossing the broadway bridge the bridge they put the harlem river 
under if you look west youll see one of our better views 
nugent would like a new audience i thought id have died by 
now on this line and the chance to talk about other stations 
but he plans to stick to the broadway line until he retires 
because its northern terminal is near his home in yonkers just 
over the city line it also has the best trains and the best pa 
systems 
this is 242nd street van cortlandt park the gateway to 
westchester county here our journey usually draws to a 
conclusion but thats fine because weve run out of track wed 
like to thank you for riding the no 1 have a good day

remember when it seemed everybody was jabbering 
away on cb radios out on the highway including betty first 
mama ford it was a fad that peaked in the mid1970s then hit 
the skids but now sales of citizens band radios are on the upswing 
again industry officials say but not to people who just want to 
chitchat 
</TEXT>

breaker breaker onenine 
cb radios a craze during the gasoline crisis of the 1970s are 
making a comeback largely because of increased sales to motorists 
who want a way to summon help in case of breakdowns or accidents 
industry spokesmen say citizens band radios appeal to women 
retirees and young people who do not want to pay hundreds of 
dollars for a cellular telephone 
its not a boom but its a nice steady gradual increase 
says john chass vice president of marketing for midland 
international corp a major supplier of the radios in kansas city 
mo the preponderance of customers weve surveyed are using the 
cb for emergency use they dont buy a cb to talk 24 hours a day 
they buy a cb for a perceived problem with their vehicle 
chass says emergency radios account for 37 percent of all cb 
sales 22 percent of all cb buyers are women and 30 percent of the 
male cb purchasers say they are buying them for women 
emergency cbs are small handheld units costing 30 to 60 that 
have the power of larger radios they plug into cigarette lighters 
use antennae with magnetic bases and can be stowed in the trunk 
with the jack and spare tire when not in use 
the market is coming back says tony margoulas a marketing 
information representative for tandy corp a major supplier of cb 
radios through its nationwide network of radio shack stores 
cb sales peaked at about 11 million a year in 1975 and 1976 as a 
result of the arab oil embargo motorists used them to share 
information on dwindling gasoline supplies high prices and long 
lines at service stations 
in the process americans became fascinated with the nations 
longhaul truckers who had been using the radios for years to warn 
of smokey bears and maintain human contact during lonely trips 
that kept them away from home for weeks 
chass says sales plummeted to 800000 units a year by 1980 but 
began picking up about five years ago an industry publication says 
sales jumped from 16 million in 1984 to 22 million last year 
tom lauterback spokesman for the washingtonbased electronic 
industries association says emergency radios have become popular 
with young fairly affluent motorists who want to be able to get 
help on the road 
they provide a tremendous amount of peace of mind at an 
affordable price lauterback says if you have a flat tire or a 
mechanical breakdown between towns you can summon a trucker to 
help you or at least report it when he gets to the next town 
ron mayes general manager of react international inc a 
12000member group that uses cbs and other radios to assist 
motorists and maintain communications during emergencies says 
studies show that emergency vehicles can reach an accident about 20 
minutes faster when the trouble is reported by cb radio reacts 
700 teams in the united states and canada and many police 
departments monitor channel 9 the official cb emergency channel 
if there is a serious injury 20 minutes is a significant 
amount of time mayes noted during a phone interview from reacts 
headquarters in wichita kan we would like to see more 
monitoring of channel 9 by police departments and volunteer groups 
we know that if they did more people would utilize cb 9 for 
emergencies and in general the traveling public would be safer 
most cb radios have 40 channels but the majority of routine 
highway information is relayed on channel 19 a popular frequency 
for truckers the federal communications commission no longer 
requires a cb license but users need to learn the truckers jargon 
to do much talking or listening cbs have a range of 5 to 15 miles 
depending on terrain weather conditions and antenna 
once you learn to understand all that gibberish you can tune 
in to what theyre saying margoulas said in an interview from 
tandys headquarters in fort worth texas 
rather than names cbers use handles such as 
roadrunner six pack double clutch candy man 
old timer night rider and alabama slim 
before transmitting its polite to ask for a break 
a bird dog is a radar detector my bird dog is barking 
means theres police radar in the area police who use radar are 
taking pictures 
a smokey bear is a state trooper a county mounty is a 
deputy sheriff and a city kitty is a city cop 
a chicken coop is a weigh station a trucking terminal is a 
junkyard and the big road is an interstate highway 
automobiles and pickups are known as four wheelers and car 
carriers are known as portable parking lots 
a footwarmer or kicker is an illegal linear amplifier 
that boosts the transmission power of a cb beyond 4 watts 
besides their communications value cbs also provide a source of 
entertainment and help break the monotony on long drives 
keith urban a marketing director with dynascan corp a chicago 
company that sells cobra cbs says cellular telephones are helping 
to fuel the comeback young people who dont want to pay 300 for a 
cellular phone can buy a cb for less than 100 and talk to friends 
urban says cbs are still important to the nations 1 million 
commercial truck drivers despite the advent of cellular phones and 
small computers that allow truckers to communicate with their 
companies by satellite 
they spend long hours on the road he said they dont 
listen to it all the time but when they get bored they know they 
can flip on their radio and talk to the guy in front of them 
trucker roy carden of albany uses his cb to locate delivery 
points in strange towns to get help if he has a breakdown and to 
talk to other drivers 
i think everybody who is on the road a lot ought to have a 
cb says carden who goes by the handle wild man

jamie lee curtis bucked the trend by going 
into television on the heels of a hit motion picture 
curtis after starring in a fish called wanda is now 
starring with richard lewis in the abc comedy series anything but 
love 
i got involved in this show before wanda and it actually got 
picked up because of the success of wanda curtis says after 
wanda i did blue steel abc then picked up this show after 
passing on it before and retooled the concept 
she had her reasons for wanting to switch to television when 
you have a child your needs become very immediate to take care of 
that child she says you want stability in your life and no 
traveling 
curtis the daughter of actor tony curtis and janet leigh is 
married to actor christopher guest they adopted a daughter annie 
in 1987 and that led to adopting the lesshectic schedule of 
television production to have more time for her family 
the hours on a film can be deadly she says you have to 
surrender your life for 12 weeks or more when you do a film but on 
a tv comedy series the hours are quite workable you can have a 
professional life and a personal life at the same time 
in anything but love curtis plays hannah miller who gave 
up teaching school to pursue her dream of becoming a writer she 
lands a job on the stylish chicago weekly magazine with the aid of 
writer marty gold played by lewis 
are they just friends or will it get more serious than that 
the comedy comes out of the sexual tension 
the original concept which abc passed on was a romantic 
triangle between myself and two men says curtis as she walks 
from the stage to the commissary at 20th century fox studios where 
the comedy series is filmed she has a secure but not very 
exciting relationship with a solid guy then an old boyfriend shows 
up it was the most passionate and exciting sexual relationship 
shed ever had was she going to go with the solid guy or the 
dangerous guy 
the part that worked was richard as the rocksolid guy and 
thats what they kept but how long can you keep them at arms 
length experience shows that you cant not bring them together 
because the audience demands it after that you have a cooling off 
period and a feeling the story is over once they go to bed 
that was one of the things that brought the downfall of 
moonlighting once maddie and david went to bed the stories 
went downhill 
curtis goes through the cafeteria line and picks out a salad 
she settles at a table in a deserted corner of the commissary 
shes wearing faded jeans and a jacket and no makeup 
our characters are not cool and aloof she says richard 
and i offer more menschy characters they arent sexual barterers 
they dont use sex as a duel theyre afraid of what sex might do 
to their wonderful relationship theyve barely kissed 
last year we didnt know what direction we were going in 
then peter noel took over the show his philosophy is that they are 
best friends and should never come together i dont know what the 
pressures will be to make it a sexual relationship 
its the first series for curtis since operation petticoat 
in 1977 when she first began and had a small role as one of the 
nurses it was adapted from the 1959 movie starring cary grant and 
her father 
soon after operation petticoat curtis was in halloween 
the first of a series of horror movies that earned her the 
sobriquet of scream queen but she also had roles in such 
pictures as trading places perfect amazing grace and 
chuck a man in love and dominic and eugene 
her tv movies included shes in the army now and dorothy 
stratton death of a centerfold she did a comedy pilot a few 
years ago in which she played a sort of female version of indiana 
jones it wasnt picked up as a series 
in blue steel she plays a rookie policewoman who is accused 
of a crime her first week on the job and is fired she has to find 
the killer to prove her innocence 
i never want to say never to films she says i did this 
work in the series and it satisfies my needs as an actor i didnt 
take it so i could then go off and do films i came from films but 
if something good comes along i may take advantage of it 
her husband was formerly on nbcs saturday night live and 
starred in the movies this is spinal tap and the princess 
bride 
i saw his picture in a magazine and called his agent she 
says he didnt call me back but we ran into each other soon 
afterward by chance we married five months later

whats that sweet karate kid doing now hes 
changing his image in a big way 
actor ralph macchio who played the title role in three karate 
kid movies is on stage playing a character so nasty that when 
another character knocks him out with a bucket of ice the audience 
cheers the play at offbroadways westside arts theater is 
only kidding set in the world of standup comedy 
macchio did new york theater once before in 1986 in cuba and 
his teddy bear which he calls probably the most exciting 
moment of my career it opened offbroadway and moved to 
broadway one big attraction for him was playing robert deniros 
son 
this time the big attraction is a chance to change his image 
the karate kid brought macchio to the publics attention but it 
has made it difficult in trying to prove myself as something other 
than that character he says ive got my work cut out he 
says that casting directors are apt to think angelic guys when 
they think of ralph macchio 
this is a step to chopping through that wall 
sitting on the set of only kidding looking younger than 
his 28 years and wearing the wedding ring he takes off before 
playing an unmarried young comedian macchio says i do not 
complain things could be a heck of a lot worse sometimes i think 
there isnt a better thing that could have happened getting the 
karate kid part and at times i feel there isnt a tougher thing 
that could have happened 
in only kidding macchio is half of a young struggling 
comedy team then he breaks with his partner and ties up with a 
mobconnected manager for whom sleazy would be a compliment in act 
2 he arrives famous and stoned for a television talk show he 
demands that an older makingacomeback comedian be bumped from 
the program but righteousness prevails and macchios character 
gets chilled out with a bucket of ice and the older comic gets his 
chance curtain 
paul provenza who played the part when only kidding opened 
in april had been a standup comedian macchios career began in 
movies in up the academy in 1980 ive never done standup 
comedy not outside of my own house i always expressed a sense of 
humor or attempted to 
im learning it as i go being with this cast is like doing 
standup comedy even backstage youve got to keep up with them 
especially being the new kid on the block 
the role came up macchio says after he told his agent he was 
interested in doing a play i said i didnt want to be 17 again 
i didnt want to be a student of a mentor or such a nice guy 
he said paul was leaving this show my wife and i came to see 
it i had a great time initially i was going to say i couldnt do 
it paul was so perfect were different types did i want to fill 
in for somebody else 
he saw it again and decided the play was timely as comedy clubs 
more than rock clubs are an 80s thing he figured it would be 
a challenge he started in midnovember 
ive seen characters like the one i play sad to say he 
says theyll do anything step over their mother to have a 
chance at the johnny carson show they have the fear that the 
laughs wont be there or when the laughs are there its all in 
life that matters 
thats the gist of the guy i play desperate is the key word 
tragic also 
when you first meet him he is offensive in certain things 
but he seems like a likable guy he is so desperate and so afraid 
he does so many offensive things he becomes quite loathsome 
when im playing the scenes as nasty as he gets as hurtful 
and angry there is something about him i like i feel bad for him 
when he is out there when i say those lines im believing him 
it is exciting to play a role like that to be cheered against 
as opposed to always being cheered for 
macchio grew up on long island learning to tapdance enjoying 
school plays and talent contests my mouth was always going 
macchios wife of 2 years is a nurse they make their home on 
long island he lived in los angeles for 18 months while shooting 
the eight is enough tv series 
his first noteworthy movie part was as an abused kid in the 
outsiders directed by francis ford coppola in 1983 patrick 
swayze emilio estevez matt dillon rob lowe and tom cruise also 
were in the cast 
macchio didnt expect the following years the karate kid to 
be a hit i thought it was too corny he says some of the 
scenes were just so sweet thats why im not a studio head 
after his current stint among the standup comedians of only 
kidding hed like to make another film i think that would be 
the right move he says im rummaging trying to find one that 
would be best to do

a string of strikes by public workers has 
disrupted perus already battered economy and brought chaos to the 
daily lives of thousands of people 
prisoners who complete terms cant get out of jail bodies stack 
up in the morgue waiting for autopsies mail piles up undelivered 
in post offices taxes are uncollected hospital patients must wait 
for treatment 
the crisis in the public sector is an expression of the 
economic chaos that exists in the country said carlos morales 
an independent labor analyst 
hundreds of thousands of government workers have walked off 
their jobs to demand gargantuan pay raises to offset the loss in 
the purchasing power of their salaries caused by perus 
hyperinflation running at nearly 3000 percent annually 
not wanting to fuel inflation the government has resisted the 
workers demands approving wage increases that fall short of the 
inflation rate 
a mountain of 5 million letters sits in limas central post 
office waiting to be sorted and delivered as postal workers walk 
the picket lines 
a walkout by workers at the national tax administration office 
has reduced tax collections by 70 percent 
a strike by prison workers has delayed paperwork authorizing the 
release of prisoners who have served out their terms the director 
of perus department of prisons wilder vidal said recently that 
more than 900 convicts whose sentences have lapsed remain behind 
bars 
teachers bus drivers water and sewer workers and gravediggers 
are all on strike 
even prostitutes from the nearby port of callao took to the 
streets recently to demand a reduction in the 50 percent tax they 
are required to pay to a city government starved for revenue to 
meet escalating costs 
a sign in the emergency room at casimiro ulloa hospital asks the 
understanding of patients and injured who cannot be attended 
because of a strike by hospital workers including doctors 
the strike in public hospitals has had grave consequences for 
the poor who cannot afford private clinics 
josefina quispe said she tried to take her father a street 
vendor to a state hospital when he complained of kidney pains 
apparently caused by complications from a kidney operation months 
earlier 
a doctor told me to take him home to die ms quispe said 
her father died at home without medical attention 
the common denominator in all the strikes some of which have 
resulted in bloody street clashes with riot police is a demand for 
higher pay to help workers deal with the inflation 
on average government salaries have 15 percent of the 
purchasing power they had in 1973 and 35 percent of what they had 
before september 1988 the magazine analisis laboral said 
recently 
the average monthly salary for public employees is 753012 intis 
50 government studies say the minimum income a family of five 
needs to buy basic necessities is the equivalent of 213 or 10 
times the minimum wage of 21 
the economic crisis also has provoked the most dramatic fall in 
the gross national product in perus history the economy has 
shrunk by 14 percent so far this year following a 9 percent drop 
in 1988 
with public services paralyzed some entrepreneurs have been 
quick to see an opportunity in the chaos they have created private 
ventures to offer alternatives to public services 
at least six private mail services have started up some 
offering guaranteed fourday delivery to the united states at 
prices ranging from 150 to 7 a letter 
its very simple said a worker at giant express one of the 
new mail services so we dont have to charge as much as 
doortodoor courier services we take the letters and send them to 
miami with an airline and from there we send them on by regular 
mail 
the company also brings mail into the country a service many 
have used since the us postal service stopped delivering to peru 
in october because of the strike which began sept 14 
business is booming and we have increased our deliveries 
tenfold said the giant express worker 
morales the labor analyst predicted the strikes will continue 
as long as the countrys economic slide goes unchecked he and 
others blame a bloated bureaucracy for much of the economic 
troubles 
they say the excessive number of bureaucrats numbering more 
than 1 million in a nation of 21 million people are an 
unproductive drain on the government 
one who shares that view is the novelist mario vargas llosa the 
frontrunning candidate for the presidency in aprils election 
vargas llosa is running on a platform of freework economic 
policies he is pledging to reduce the government bureaucracy and 
shift thousands of state workers to the private sector 
president alan garcia a populist ineligible for reelection 
has tried to maintain the little political support he still enjoys 
by accusing vargas llosa of planning to fire half a million 
workers a charge the candidate denies

christmas eve is becoming a time for lovers in 
japan 
while people in other countries attach bows to packages more 
and more japanese young people hope to tie a marital knot on 
christmas eve or at least seal a relationship 
hotels are packed with couples who pay about the yen equivalent 
of 315 a person for dinner shows and christmas eve together 
cruise ships are booked months ahead for 360 overnight cruises in 
tokyo bay 
behind the relentless commercialism and repeated refrains of 
rudolph the rednosed reindeer the japanese have taken 
christmas and made it into something uniquely their own as they 
have with countless other imported products and customs japan 
where the vast majority of people practice shintoism has about 17 
million christians among its 121 million people 
on valentines day women do the giving declaring their love by 
presenting their men with chocolates but for christmas men are 
advised by magazines and tv programs to plan a christmas eve that 
will win a womans heart 
its a test for a man whether he can provide the right 
luxuries for one day said the weekly magazine spa 
the christmas eve tradition for decades in the japanese home has 
been for the father to bring home a cake frequently after a night 
out drinking 
cake sales remain twice as high in december as in any other 
month but they are falling as christmas customs change according 
to the japan western confectionery association 
in the past christmas for most people meant christmas cakes 
but now people are beginning to celebrate christmas in other ways 
with parties and presents and family activities the 
associations kenji nagao said 
but the custom has left a bittersweet legacy the term unsold 
christmas cake often is used to describe unmarried women over age 
25 
twenty years ago christmas eve was a time for men to go to 
bars and get drunk there would be drunk men all over the ginza 
wearing silly hats said masaki oka sales planning manager for 
matsuya department store but now ginza bars are virtually empty 
on christmas eve and its becoming a family holiday 
people now are interested in the personal touch creating a 
warm family experience together 
a custom much older than christmas in japan is the giving of 
yearend presents called oseibo 
christmas presents are completely different from oseibo oka 
said oseibo gifts are given out of business obligation and 
people think only about how much they need to spend on each person 
when they shop but christmas gifts are a chance to pick out a 
present that you think will make someone happy 
many of those gifts men give are presented before christmas as a 
way of enticing a woman to accept a date on christmas eve at 
least thats the advice in an 80page article on christmas eve 
dating in the biweekly mens magazine hot dog 
according to the magazines survey of young women 38 percent 
said they made their christmas eve plans a month ahead 
spending christmas eve together is seen as a public declaration 
of a relationship and for those not ready to make a commitment or 
afraid of being left at home alone some groups of friends make 
plans together for dec 24 far in advance and then make sure their 
other friends know 
it hardly seems to matter that so few japanese are christians 
though hot dog magazine recommends a visit to a romantic chapel as 
part of a christmas eve date 
a good idea is to pray together quietly with your 
girlfriend it says do it somewhere fashionable your 
relationship will quickly become more intimate 
years ago the minister of a christian church in tokyo said he 
was putting up christmas decorations when a passerby stopped and 
asked oh do you christians celebrate christmas too

valmont 
 
filmmakers seem to have a love affair with choderlos de laclos 
1782 epistolary novel les liaisons dangereuses and with his 
story of seduction hedonism and revenge in 18th century france 
its no surprise 
the work was first interpreted on film by roger vadim in 1959 
it starred gerard phillipe and jeanne moreau as vicomte de valmont 
and his wife juliette two icy modernday opportunists with an 
open marriage it had a jazzy score by thelonius monk and jack 
murray 
the second movie version was last years dangerous liaisons 
an americanized fastpaced drama directed by stephen frears and 
starring glenn close as the scheming marquise de merteuil and john 
malkovich as the notorious rake valmont 
now comes milos forman with valmont and it is as different 
from the other efforts as the many interpretations of william 
shakespeares hamlet it is a lush and elegant movie graced by 
the seductive camera work of miroslav ondricek 
with a keen eye for detail cheese wrapped in leaves in the 
market a bathtub with a little bench on which to sit forman eases 
into de laclos story against the blind morals of prerevolutionary 
france his vision is sweeping theres no rush but still much 
activity forman loves the bustle and business of earlier times 
jugglers merchants servants always underfoot 
as madame de merteuil annette bening brings a sugary 
bitchiness she is less brittle than the glenn close interpretation 
and also less focused but her intent is clear she loves playing 
games wicked vicious games that ultimately destroy people and 
bring ruin to a way of life 
colin firths valmont is far more attractive than malkovichs 
indeed one wondered why women would ever be drawn to the malkovich 
character with his pasty visage and deepset eyes and bronx 
sounding voice 
firth is almost too cute almost too soft hes sexy sensual 
flirty but the steely maliciousness is missing 
meg tilly who is about to emerge as a leading actress with her 
role in valmont and her upcoming part as harvey keitels 
unfaithful wife in the two jakes is convincing as the 
vulnerable and pious young wife madame de tourvel she is the woman 
valmont worships and for whom he lusts 
fairuza balk who starred in the horrendous return to oz 
portrays cecile the target of valmonts seduction and the innocent 
victim of merteuils revenge her mother has arranged for the 
convent school girl to marry gercourt an older man who will take 
only a virgin as his wife hes also merteuils exlover 
forman dances his characters about in a game of musical beds a 
game thats a nowin for just about all 
jeanclaude carrieres screenplay makes good use of de laclos 
focus on letter writing letters show up just about everywhere and 
even valmont gets into the spirit by dictating erotic passages to 
an unsuspecting cecile to send to the young music teacher henry 
thomas who loves her 
formans denouement is almost anticlimatic the duel and 
valmonts death is almost a mirthful moment but valmont is 
worth watching 
the orion pictures release has a running time of 134 minutes and 
is rated r

license to kill cbsfox video vhsbeta 8998 rated 
pg13 
 
bond james bond is a grim figure in licence to kill in 
which the secret agent takes on a murderous latin drug lord in 
florida and latin america while earlier 007 films offered a sly 
roguish charmer given to jaunty double entrendres licence to 
kill serves up a moody humorless bond 
which is to say no bond at all bond played by timothy dalton 
in his second 007 film is upstaged this time by the gadgetry and 
special effects 
worse not even the villain lives up to the usual standards 
while previous villains were often megalomaniacs who wanted nothing 
less than the entire world sanchez played with reptilian charm 
by pockmarked robert davi is a bad guy of almost reallife 
proportions hes not much worse than some of the drug lords making 
headlines these days 
in place of bond licence to kill offers lots of violence 
including a few gruesomely creative ways to die and the usual 
fiendish weapons as unveiled by gadget scientist q 
davi is so believable that his character comes off as 
conventional talisa soto is perfectly wooden as sanchezs and 
later bonds love interest and carey lowell plays an agent whose 
most alluring quality is the way she keeps her gun in a thigh 
garter 
but without a compelling bond license to kill rarely rises 
above the level of a good episode of miami vice

the double deuce is a down and dirty bar where the lowrent 
patrons mix it up at the slightest provocation a toilet of a place 
so mean that someone hits a blind guitarist in the face with a 
bottle then comes dalton patrick swayze 
dalton a bouncer with fists of steel zenlike calm and a 
philosophy degree from new york university weeds out the 
undesirables among his bouncers schools them in selfrestraint and 
has the place looking like a yuppie nightspot in no time 
but in doing so he runs afoul of brad wesley a highclass thug 
who bleeds local merchants for protection money and at one point 
flips a coin to decide who will live and who will die 
this is a violent tale as simpleminded as a comic book and 
this bouncerwithabrain stuff is a little much 
but road house is packed with action and rollicks along to a 
riproaring ending 
swayze dirty dancing gets the job done as a sort of

dr feelgood elektra motley crue 
 
rx for feeling good send for motley crues dr feelgood 
produced by bob rock who just wrapped the cults sonic 
temple the fifth album from heavy metal vaudevillians motley 
crue has something for everyone 
if youre mulling over the current political disarray in the 
world theres time to change the musically sappy but 
lyrically stinging closing ballad 
if you like things a bit more playful theres sticky sweet 
she goes down and same old situation sos 
but the wittiest most aerosmithlike of these is the 
downinthebayou groove of slice of your pie a twopart tale 
of lead singer vince neil leering at a female passerby then 
getting her where he wants her via the closing grind a steal from 
the beatles i want you shes so heavy 
numbers such as the barroom stomp of rattlesnake shake and 
the nearspeed metal of kickstart my heart show off the new and 
improved musicianship of guitarist mick mars and bassist nikki 
sixx who both leave behind most of the usual metal riffs they used 
in 1987s girls girls girls 
standouts are the title track a tale of urban blight as seen 
through a drug kingpins rise and fall and the dark without 
you written by sixx for drummer tommy lee and his actress wife 
heather locklear 
the latter praising monogamy is a nice break from the 
relentless barrage of the sex songs on feelgood and the 
mushiness of recent power ballads such as warrants heaven 
if you want aerosmith buy their latest pump but the 
closest thing on the motleys record is dont go away mad just 
go away its a breakup song with a smart attitude despite the 
ending that strains to use the cute title

france ends a hectic year of bicentennial 
celebrations with an immense retrospective of the works of 
jacqueslouis david the painter who put his genius to the service 
of politics and ultimately his own ambition 
on show through feb 12 in the louvre are 245 paintings 
sketches and drawings by the man whose artwork and career reflect 
the turbulent and bloody events of 200 years ago 
the oath of the jeu de paume and the distribution of the 
eagles monumental works too fragile to be moved can be seen at 
the palace of versailles 
few french artists were as problematic as david who emerges 
from history as hungry for power as the successive dictators he 
served he was chief propagandist of the revolution and later the 
premier painter of napoleon bonaparte after the emperors fall 
david fled to belgium where he lived until his death too proud to 
ask for a pardon from the restored bourbon monarchy 
his remains came home to france on dec 19 for a proper and 
official burial in the pere lachaise cemetery in paris 
this is both a symbol of francobelgian friendship as well as 
a tribute to the man whose life and work were wedded to history 
french culture minister jack lang said 
a political propagandist the artist immortalized such 
revolutionary heroes as jeanpaul marat whom he depicted dead in a 
bathtub and joseph bara the young boy bayonetted for refusing to 
salute the king and who cried vive la republique instead 
more than any other artist davids work recounted the events of 
his day as they happened the coronation of the emperor and the 
empress 180507 looks much like a modernday news photo 
despite the fact that david painted himself into the spectators 
gallery and added napoleons mother when she was absent 
in his private life david was ruthless hated and loved feared 
and respected he had few friends and confided in no one some say 
he was plain coldblooded as a member of the committee of general 
security he signed many arrest warrants sending some of his own 
artist colleagues to the guillotine 
though he escaped death after robespierres fall he did spend 
some time in jail where he produced two of his most fascinating 
works a haunting selfportrait and the huge painting the sabine 
women 
inspired by a truetolife historical event david depicts the 
ancient sabine women thrusting themselves and their babies between 
battling romans and sabine men 
often interpreted as an appeal for national reconciliation in 
wartorn france david wrote that was my thought when i grabbed 
the paintbrush 
critics agree that modern art begins with david an unparalled 
draftsman and master of color he abandonned the flowery 
decorative styles of his predecessors and embraced simple 
structures and forms borrowed from classical painting and sculpture 
his embrace of classical themes the result of a fiveyear stay 
in rome in 177580 was interpreted in many different ways for 
robespierre and his revolutionary followers david was a precursor 
of the values they invoked to justify the reign of terror 
davids the lictors bringing back to brutus the bodies of his 
sons 1789 characterized by brutus icy stoicism was often 
cited as a perfect example of the personal sacrifice necessary for 
the overall good of the nation the work in fact was a royal 
commission and had nothing to do with the revolution 
a gifted portraitist david also immortalized the coquettish and 
beautiful juliette recamier reclining on her day bed and napoleon 
astride his rearing white horse crossing the st bernard pass 
he even flaunted the strict rules of the academy to which he 
belonged depicting his subjects on huge canvasses normally 
reserved for historical tableaux or religious themes 
visitors familiar with davids work will be surprised to see the 
number of portraits david never finished including the famed 
madame recamier because he often quarreled with his subjects

gavin friday is a punk his hair isnt spiked 
his clothes arent torn and his music might seem too sophisticated 
but still hes a punk punk is an attitude friday insists 
worrying about looks and sound runs against everything punk stands 
for and according to friday punks were around long before johnny 
rotten picked up a microphone and screamed that means oscar wilde 
jacques brel and bob dylan are punks too 
when i was 17 around 197677 i shaved my head and became a 
punk explained the 30yearold irish singersongwriter who 
named his new album each man kills the things he loves after 
a wilde poem it was great for a while but the media made it all 
fashion 
the whole message was if you have something to say say it 
get up on the stage and say it that was the best thing about punk 
you dont have to practice your guitar for six years just get up 
and try 
friday admires writers such as wilde and bertolt brecht who 
used humor and irony to coat stinging social satire in that 
spirit the albums title track sounds like a demented vaudeville 
tune the music rolls and crashes like a ferris wheel sprung from 
its girders like a merrygoround speeding out of control 
the lyrics are sung gleefully your worst nightmare delivered 
with the warmth of a christmas carol 
i really just relate to the words in my own way and put the 
melody to the way i felt it should be he said in an interview 
the words are really dark but i didnt want to sing them like 
that i wanted a circus type of feel 
he never sounds happier than on dylans death is not the 
end cheer up he sings no matter how bad life gets death is 
not the end change the lyrics to an advertisement for deodorant 
and you might never know the difference 
it interests me how people dont read that much anymore in 
general and i wonder if people listen to lyrics in songs i did it 
singsong so pople will join in then they think hey what am i 
singing what are those words that element really attracts me 
like life is cabaret no problems right uh uh 
friday grew up in dublin the eldest boy of six children in a 
strict roman catholic household it didnt take long to rebel by 
age 10 he was a rock n roll fanatic and hung out with kids who 
felt the same way such as young paul hewson the future bono vox 
of u2 fame 
we were kids that related to music and we thought we were 
gods gift to the world friday said every kid thinks hes 
special youre heading into puberty and you dont know who you 
are everyone misunderstands you 
youre thinking leave me alone i want to grow up and 
music becomes your best friend i loved marc bolan roxy music and 
david bowie i thought i was the only man in the world who felt 
that way its weird when you find other people like that 
bono got mad and got rich friday got mad and stayed mad his 
first band the virgin prunes was harsh even by punk 
standards critics loved them but popularity was out of the 
question eventually friday lost patience as well 
he was tired of the punk scene all that sound and fury was 
boring him so he began listening to brecht and kurt weill and 
looked for a collaborator with a classical background who could 
help arrange the music in 1986 friday found his man in maurice 
roycroft nicknamed the man seezer 
he had studied theology and philosophy worked in a choir and 
studied cello and piano since he was four friday said 
it was inspiration with all these idiots you work with who are 
trying to do what jimi hendrix did 20 years ago or bowie or u2 
he was into brecht and weill it was like chalk and cheese he was 
so focused i had to push him out and he tried to pull me in 
for friday punk is a universal language classical musicians 
are welcome so are 19th century poets emotion matters more than 
form or content thats why friday covers brels next using a 
punks disgust to practically spit out the french composers 
tortured lyrics 
its angry really angry dont ever be next dont ever 
stand in line for those guys be your own person i saw him 
brel on video doing this in french in about 1984 i couldnt 
understand a word he said but i knew what he was talking 
about

rien poortvliet lives in a rustic house in the 
tiny dutch village of soestduinen on a recent walk the author 
found a chestnut on the ground and began kicking it ahead of him 
after losing the first chestnut he quickly found another and 
continued 
hes no better when it comes to sleep anything less than seven 
hours and hes miserable the next day away from home he dreams of 
lying on his new firm mattress with his four dogs snoring by the 
bed and the window open so he can hear the owls over a cool night 
breeze 
some might consider this behavior immature or childish 
childish poortvliet happily agrees 
my friend wil author huygen has said when you have the 
child in your heart be careful to keep it there not to lose it 
said poortvliet who collaborated with huygen on the bestselling 
childrens book gnomes and the new the book of the sandman 
1795 abrams 
when making books or drawings i do have the child in my 
heart he said i dont want to let that part of myself get 
away 
american author delia ephron lives in a house in los angeles 
she was once childish she admits as a kid she hated coming 
downstairs when her parents invited friends over ephron was 25 
years old before she actually threw a party of her own 
but shes changed now she would certainly never kick a chestnut 
that she says would be impolite ephron has a more 
sophisticated way of relaxing she makes up tests for her nieces 
and nephews impromptu multiple choice exams on etiquette for all 
occasions 
for instance youre at a restaurant and the waiter brings you 
soup youre about to eat when you notice theres a fly in it do 
you a swat it b eat it c say to the waiter excuse me but 
a fly is swimming in my soup 
the kids always laugh ephron says and her nieces proudly 
provide the right answer the nephews proudly give the wrong one 
aunt delia as she calls herself in her work believes a comedy 
of manners works better than drama 
its such a great way to teach manners without ever really 
teaching manners said ephron whose newest book do i have to 
say hello 1495 viking includes pages of offbeat quizzes 
i think of children as uncivilized and thats what i love the 
most about them she said i wrote this as much to write about 
what they really do than to teach them the right thing to do 
ephron seemed born to write although not necessarily for 
children one sister nora is the author of heartburn and 
wrote the screenplay for when harry met sally another 
sister hallie is a novelist 
delia ephron had been at work for about a year when she dashed 
off how to eat like a child a short piece that was published 
in 1979 aunt delia had arrived 
i was very nervous about being a writer because everyone in my 
family was a writer said ephron now collaborating with nora on 
the screenplay for the meg wolitzer novel this is your life 
one day i wrote this piece and very quickly wrote it i didnt 
think i was writing a book for children i was writing an adult 
book the original piece was written in the new york times i was 
absolutely shocked when kids thought it was funny i suddenly knew 
that this was what i knew how to do she said 
poortvliet on the other hand had been an artist for years in 
an advertising agency but happily gave up his comfortable salary 
in the early 1970s for the chance to illustrate childrens books 
he speaks not only of the gift for writing but the gift of 
writing sharing with a child the book of the sandman and 
earlier works such as gnomes and noahs ark is like 
pulling up a chair and carefully explaining a remarkable adventure 
making childrens books does not mean making childish 
drawings he said for all my books dogs or noahs ark i 
use my drawings to tell and to show come here and look how 
elegant a doe can jump over a fence 
ephron also insists that writing especially for children 
requires a special generosity of spirit 
i wasnt someone who wanted to be around children but i do 
think theres an emotional connection that you make she said 
its more than thinking like a child its some sort of emotional 
understanding of childhood 
i think what youre going to write as a creative person is 
pretty well set by the time youre 14 its about who you are and 
your take on life something that sets in when youre very young 
while do i have to say hello can be read anywhere the 
dinner table with the parents permission of course the 
playground the car the book of the sandman is very much a 
bedtime book to be cuddled like a favorite stuffed animal 
it starts with the teddy bear in bed and the feeling of that 
cozy warm teddy bear poortvliet said and i believe thats 
the work of those books they do the same like the teddy bear 
does

its called snake music delta 
blues shot through with rock riffs and punchy drumming 
and if the drummer gives the beat a soulful touch its because 
he once played for aretha franklin 
the band is the snakes who have released their selftitled 
debut album amid comparisons to the fabulous thunderbirds the 
group composed of veteran recording session musicians plays a 
tight mix of original and reworked blues and rock n roll tunes 
the connection to the fabulous thunderbirds doesnt end with the 
sound snakes pianist wally wilson cowrote the thunderbirds hit 
powerful stuff featured in the soundtrack for the movie 
cocktail 
wilson who is also a veteran country music and rock songwriter 
says the band didnt plan for the new lp to sound like the 
thunderbirds but he likes the comparison 
the album contains snakes versions of two songs by the late 
blues legends robert johnson and bukka white johnsons 3220 
and whites aberdeen a marriage of acoustic delta blues and 
hardedged rock it also features walkaway heard on the 
soundtrack for the movie major league 
perhaps the most unusual tune on the lp is pay bo diddley a 
humorous but scathing look at how the famous rock n roll pioneer 
was cheated out of royalties by smooth talking record company 
executives 
wilson persuaded diddley to come to nashville to sing and play 
guitar on the cut 
when we brought him up here to do the session he loved it 
wilson said it was his song he was king for a day 
wilson adds that he had to wire half of the cash fee for the 
session to diddley at his florida home before the performer would 
come to nashville he was paid the other half in cash of course 
once he arrived 
recording an album wasnt on the minds of founding members 
wilson and guitaristvocalist mike henderson when they met and 
began playing the blues in nashville 
we decided we would get the mike and wally show together and 
play holiday inns and places like that wilson joked 
we got a fourpiece band together to play monday nights at the 
bluebird cafe he said the bluebird is known as a breeding 
ground for new talent and many artists have been signed to their 
first recording contracts after appearing there 
at first the snakes played to an audience consisting mainly of 
waitresses but in time college students and members of the music 
industry became fans 
pretty soon it was jam packed in there wilson said 
he credits that success to the combination of original members 
henderson bassist glenn worf and drummer bill swartz but as the 
groups sound began to evolve from straight blues to bluesrock 
guitarist kenny greenberg was added and swartz was replaced by 
veteran rhythm and blues drummer james stroud 
the lineup started playing more clubs in nashville and attracted 
the attention of curb records executive dick whitehouse who signed 
them to a record deal 
the effortless dovetailing of the musicians styles is the 
reason for their success wilson says 
kenny is an incredible rock guitarist when he came here from 
louisville ky he was going to play country that lasted about 
two days said wilson who migrated to nashville from dallas and 
started as a janitor at a music publishing company 
kenny is the leading guy in this part of the south for playing 
rock n roll he has been featured in guitar player magazine hes 
done a lot of album work 
wilson characterizes worf as the best musician in the band 
glenn is an incredible bass player he is very musical he could 
be a jazz musician 
stroud also is a record producer and has drummed for such greats 
as aretha franklin henderson grew up listening to the blues he 
usually sings and plays the harmonica wearing an old esso service 
station attendants shirt and a battered straw cowboy hat 
he is the strangest guy ive ever met all of his clothes are 
second hand wilson said he thinks its ridiculous for people 
to pay more than 20 for an article of clothing if you see him in 
a suit it will be a 10 suit

was pretty sure that susan would say yes but he had her parents 
blessing handy just in case when he popped the question on oct 
31 1988 to nobodys surprise susan did say yes 
what followed was a year of intense planning by the couple for a 
wedding that would be personal to them yet involve their families 
and friends 
the story of how susan lynn parsons 28 and donald merrill 
waite 48 planned this most important event for both of them is a 
good indicator of the new ways of marriage in the united states 
circa 198990 
their wedding took something from the past and something from 
the present uniting tradition with life today what was old was 
the sense of joy and anticipation in melding two lives into one 
the desire to make vows in front of family and friends and the 
wish to have a wonderful party in a beautiful place with all the 
trimmings of music delicious food photos to commemorate the 
occasion 
what was current was their determination that the wedding 
reflect their unique history and tastes and that both would play 
equal roles in making the party happen 
the care they put into arranging their wedding also reflects the 
couples determination to make a go of this the second marriage 
for don and the first for susan and their story may be 
increasingly typical these days when two out of five marriages 
dissolve 
the couple planned and paid for their wedding themselves 
sharing decisions equally they held the wedding where they live 
not in the brides home town selecting a country farmhouse owned 
by dons brother for the party and a nearby church for the ceremony 
the event took place on sunday afternoon but many guests came 
for the weekend the round of celebrations included a friday 
evening bachelor party a saturday afternoon decorating session at 
the farm a buffet dinner saturday evening at a relatives home 
and a postwedding brunch on monday morning for those who stayed 
on when the couple opened their wedding presents 
susan a dancer and don met when she applied for a 
betweenengagements job as a waitress in his manhattan restaurant 
they had known each other for eight years when don proposed 
marriage the night she returned from performances in the national 
tour company of the show dirty dancing 
the couple took just under a year to plan their oct 8 1989 
wedding throwing themselves into it with enthusiasm though susan 
researched wedding form in etiquette books they felt free to 
deviate from tradition in virtually every aspect of the wedding 
from selecting the church and ceremony through menu planning 
attire music and photography they personalized the traditional 
choices 
they looked at sites in new york city where they lived they 
have since moved to california but decided early that they wanted 
a country wedding after investigating catering halls and country 
clubs they chose a church ceremony and a home party 
after a 1230 pm service at the bedford ny presbyterian 
church 140 invited guests made a short drive to the farm the 
nearby country home of dons brother ralph waite an ordained 
presbyterian minister who is better known as the actor who played 
john walton in the waltons television series 
ralph who no longer has a congregation donned ministerial 
robes to participate in his brothers marriage ceremony susan was 
attended by her two sisters don by another brother and his two 
grown sons 
before the exchange of vows ralph offered some personal 
reminiscences about the couple then invited other guests to add 
theirs dons sons and susans dance teacher were among those who 
spoke 
there were laughter and tears recalls susan who says some 
of the speakers surprised her with the depth and sincerity of their 
comments 
after pronouncing the couple man and wife alcorn asked all 
guests to bless the marriage by responding in unison i do 
the waites lit a candle of unity as part of the service then 
the scriptural reading from first corinthians concluded the 
ceremony 
after a short pause for photos the wedding party reconvened at 
the farm for an afternoon of dining and dancing to the music of a 
fivepiece band since the house was not large enough to 
accommodate the crowd don and susan rented two heated tents one 
for dining one for dancing the tents were set up against a 
backdrop of rural splendor of meadow trees and distant hills 
the site set the mood for food and decor in keeping with the 
waites preference for an informal party and for healthy whole 
foods caterers molly siple and gillie holme created a fall harvest 
buffet that included ham roast turkey cornbread squashes new 
england baked beans salads cheese and fruit and wedding cake as 
guests assembled hors doeuvres of smoked salmon corn tartlets 
filled with chili smoked trout on endive and cheese crusts were 
passed by waiters seasonal flowers and vegetables pumpkins 
squashes autumn leaves chrysanthemums decorated each table the 
tents and the grounds 
two bars were set up one was for alcoholic drinks and the other 
for nonalcoholic drinks including a variety of sodas and hot 
apple cider 
we went on instinct when interviewing and choosing the 
caterer recalled don 
music for dancing was furnished by members of a fivepiece band 
all friends of the groom the photographer also a friend of the 
couple recorded the event 
with a beautiful natural setting the trees were beginning 
their seasonal change to brilliant autumn reds and golds not much 
decoration was needed instead of hiring a florist the couple 
some guests and their caterer embellished the setting with 35 pots 
of chrysanthemums don bought for the occasion a wagonload of wood 
chips was used to create a pathway and items already on the 
property such as an antique tractor were embellished with dried 
grasses and leaves and seasonal fruit a grape arbor was hung with 
bunches of grapes 
it was a wedding celebration that few guests wanted to end at 
twilight guests slowly began to leave then the bride exchanged 
her long white dress for jeans and the groom and his attendants 
changed from morning coats and tuxedos into work clothes to clean 
up the site before going home 
outoftown guests were accommodated in a block of rooms 
reserved for them at a nearby holiday inn 
the wedding however was not over on monday morning ralph 
hosted a brunch at which the couple opened their gifts then on 
tuesday members of the family who had come from almost every part 
of the country gathered once again at the farm the occasion was a 
memorial service for a beloved relative who had died after a long 
illness we were afraid it might be a downer recalled don 
but it was a joyous occasion

the wedding ceremony of susan parsons and donald waite expressed 
their relationship with each other their families and their 
friends 
and thats a what wedding should do says rev paul alcorn 
copastor of the bedford ny presbyterian church in which the 
couple were married 
alcorn says that most couples now want the wedding ceremony to 
reflect their personal histories in this instance the grooms 
brother an ordained minister officiated in the service with 
alcorn and the congregation was asked to consent verbally to the 
union then anyone who wished to could speak about the couple a 
part of the ceremony known as sharing time 
the wedding also was typical because one partner had been 
divorced says alcorn a significant proportion of couples come 
from a background of divorce 
some other trends noted by alcorn and others premarital 
counseling is taken much more seriously alcorn says couples are 
very interested in interpersonal dynamics and ministers are 
likely to initiate discussions on how relationships succeed and 
fail 
more couples are opting for a more traditional type of service 
than five to eight years ago but with contemporary nonsexist 
language they avoid masculineonly gender pronouns and the thees 
and thous its not just the father of the bride giving daughters 
away in 95 percent of the services both families give their 
blessing says the pastor he says he found the same thing true 
in prior pastorates in neenah wis and suburban chicago 
rabbi daniel syme author of the book the jewish home and 
vice president of the union of american hebrew congregations in new 
york finds that jewish couples in the reform tradition are much 
more interested in knowing the meaning of the ceremony and the 
symbols that will be part of that ceremony as opposed to passive 
participation in a ceremony which is not understood 
interest in restoring traditional ceremonies but updating them 
to reflect a more equal role for women also is an important trend 
he said in jewish ceremonies its common for both sets of parents 
to join the couple under the wedding canopy or chupa 
other ways in which tradition is returning include the use of a 
jewish marriage document in hebrew and arabic known as a ketuba 
however the ketuba the word comes from the hebrew word meaning 
written has been recast to reflect the equality of the sexes 
in the marriage covenant says syme 
among a growing number of reform jewish couples the groom wears 
a yarmulke or skullcap and makes similar caps available to all 
men in the temple reform judaism eliminated the requirement for 
the headgear many years ago 
donning the skullcap signifies both the reembracing of 
tradition and the fact that many of those now affiliated with 
reform congregations came from more traditional homes for them 
the yarmulke is an important symbol says syme 
it is customary now for the couples getting married in the 
catholic faith to enter more into the planning of their wedding 
says bishop patrick v ahern vicar of staten island ny and 
pastor of the church of the blessed sacrament there 
in the old days it was a fully developed ceremony which they 
accepted and didnt modify according to ahern who has been a 
priest for 45 years the changes introduced by the vatican council 
15 years ago make it easier for couples to exercise some choices 
couples are delighted to have that opportunity to participate 
they get a pamphlet listing options and in most cases go over it 
very carefully says ahern often they design very beautiful 
ceremonies for themselves selecting the readings from scripture 
and using certain permissible options he says a favored biblical 
reading is the section on love in first corinthians the waites 
chose this 
many catholic couples will opt for a candlelighting ceremony 
each lights a taper and then together they light a third candle to 
symbolize the unifying sacrament of marriage and their equality as 
man and wife they often turn to each other in exchanging consent 
vows adds ahern 
rabbi alex goldman author of the novel the rabbi is a lady 
and 12 other books and religious leader of temple beth el a 
conservative temple in stamford conn reports that there has been 
a change in choices of ceremonial music of the wedding 
gone almost completely are traditional military marches like 
here comes the bride instead music that has come out of israel 
and is drawn from the psalms or solomons song of songs is 
preferred this gives the ceremony a more romantic and more loving 
character

offering guests a festive meal after the wedding ceremony is a 
way of sharing the happiness of the bride and groom so part of the 
feast reflecting the couples ethnic backgrounds is appropriate 
says molly siple who with partner gillie holme catered the sunday 
afternoon country wedding of donald and susan waite 
while you do need one dish that virtually everyone will like 
in new york chicken turkey or poached salmon fulfill the 
requirement other selections can be more adventurous if 
ingredients of a particular ethnic favorite are available locally 
professional caterers will enjoy the challenge of preparing these 
dishes for your guests siple says 
food served can take a cue from the season and time of day of 
course practical considerations of budget and cooking facilities 
also need to be considered in menu planning 
the menu at the waites wedding was dictated by minimal cooking 
facilities the outdoor setting autumn season and the country 
locale 
requests for a healthful menu light on saturated fats and sugar 
and dishes prepared without alcohol also were taken into 
consideration all these factors made a harvest theme natural says 
siple 
the menu included ham roast turkey and condiments new england 
baked beans a melange of seasonal squashes and cornbread on the 
main buffet table there were a separate salad station tomatoes 
with basil marinated mushrooms and greens a table for cheeses 
and fruit and another for the wedding cake 
the waites choices are part of a trend to more healthful fare 
and ethnic dishes according to modern bride editor cele lalli the 
use of several different buffet stations making it easy to offer a 
variety of dishes and serve a crowd more efficiently also was 
typical she says 
lighter fare such as a choice of fish chicken or beef is 
being offered at many weddings around the country some invitations 
arrive with a request for guests to indicate their main course 
preference a practice lalli finds unappealing its more gracious 
to have the choice made just before the meal she says 
one reason for more adventurous menus is that more couples now 
are actually planning and paying for their own event as a result 
their tastes and budgets are taken into account says boyce 
brawley a partner in the catering firm new york parties and 
coauthor of a new book of the same name 
brawley says that when the couple plan the wedding theyre more 
likely to opt for an informal event than their parents might have 
been younger people prefer an extended cocktail party with finger 
foods and passed foods and several serving stations as a rule 
thats less costly than a sitdown meal but not if you want 
everything that you would have had at a dinner says brawley 
weddings of this type are not quite so formal and are more 
conducive to conversation he says people have a chance to 
circulate formalities and traditions of toasting and cake cutting 
however are observed just as much by the young he says 
late afternoon teas are increasingly popular since this is 
not necessarily a period when parents are paying for the wedding 
the lesser expense of a tea is welcome 
brawley says that mixing ethnic foods with more standard dishes 
is becoming more common if the bride and groom are of different 
ethnic backgrounds its a practice to serve foods from both 
traditions nothing is wrong with mixing ethnic flavors after 
all this is a union of two families and you want to make everyone 
feel comfortable we may even ask the couple for family recipes 
brawley says that while more variety is sought in dishes a few 
foods turn up often nine times out of ten some form of salmon 
will show up and meats such as lamb duck and quail are being 
ordered far more often people are ready to experiment 
wedding planner marcy blum says the eclectic menu makes for a 
more festive party food becomes part of the entertainment with 
six or seven buffet stations the party flow works better at a 
large wedding she adds 
blum who is based in new york but helps plan weddings in many 
areas says many people prefer to offer fowl rather than red meat 
she agrees that ethnic foods are popular and part of a trend 
toward ethnicity throughout the event

when planning their wedding party donald and susan waite 
confronted the issue of whether and how to serve alcohol at their 
wedding 
the waites decided to serve both liquor and nonalcoholic 
drinks set up at separate bars the waites took another step that 
is becoming more common according to their caterer they specified 
that no alcohol be used in food preparation 
serving food laced with spirits creates a problem for people 
with ulcers and other physical disabilities and for recovering 
alcoholics so its better not to do so according to caterer molly 
siple the waites sensitivity is not unique my mail is filled 
with questions on how to handle alcohol says cele lalli editor 
of modern bride it can be particularly touchy if one family has 
religious scruples against alcohol and the other family does not 
i always tell readers that they dont have to serve alcohol if 
doing so would make them uncomfortable often a good compromise is 
to have two separate bars one with alcohol and the other 
without adds lalli 
according to millie martini bratten an editor at brides 
magazine we see more people beefing up the nonalcoholic side of 
the wedding by serving designer waters and natural sodas theres 
more of a choice for people who dont drink 
boyce brawley of new york parties says concern about guests 
drinking is much more evident among hosts than it used to be our 
bartenders can cut someone off by not serving them at some 
weddings only champagne and sparkling water are served if there 
is a full bar bartenders are urged to exercise discretion perhaps 
making succeeding drinks weaker for a guest if they notice he has 
been consuming a great deal of alcohol 
there was a period when everything including the cake was 
soaked in liqueur thats no longer fashionable according to 
brawley the idea of being a social drinker is being looked at 
with more scrutiny 
wedding consultant marcy blum says hosts worry about too long a 
cocktail hour they dont want guests drinking for two hours 
whereas in the past they didnt care at two recent weddings we set 
up a separate nonalcoholic bar and featured nonalcoholic 
prominently smoking grass outside something that used to happen 
at weddings is no longer considered acceptable she adds

one of the surprising things don and susan waite learned in 
planning their wedding is that a celebration at a public place a 
restaurant catering hall or country club can be less expensive 
than one at home 
most catering halls are equipped with everything needed to 
entertain a crowd so they can offer a package price lower than an 
event at a private site where many items must be rented 
individually the onestop wedding party also may take less time to 
plan 
the waites decided against going this route because they wanted 
to keep control of all the details they especially liked the idea 
that their wedding in all its aspects would be a personal 
reflection of them and they could keep the party going as long as 
they wanted they discovered that most public places have more than 
one wedding in a day so they would have been limited to a booking 
schedule 
the waites spent about 20000 on their wedding and the party 
not including the cost of clothing susans dress cost about 800 
while don and his attendants rented their attire 
costs worked out as follows 3000 to rent and erect two large 
heated tents 2000 for photography 2000 for the band and 
12000 for the catering services food and beverages 
a tip the waites offer others who are planning a wedding is to 
decide on the guest list early and to order extra invitations 
we thought we had 100 friends and relatives to invite so we 
ordered 100 invitations then we thought of 100 more we had to 
have we had to order extra invitations which was quite 
expensive recalls susan

social scientists will tell you that the october 1989 wedding 
of susan parsons 28 and donald waite 48 is an good example of 
demographic trends affecting marriage in the united states 
according to demographer arlene saluter u s census bureau 
statistician people are older at first marriage than they once 
were the median age for women is 236 years for men 259 these 
1988 statistics are the latest and represent a trend 
young adults are postponing marriages until later to pursue 
education and careers the high cost of housing is also a factor 
as is the acceptability of alternative arrangements such as 
sharing households says saluter most people at least 90 
percent will marry eventually she adds statistics show that the 
chance of divorce is lessened by advanced education so by waiting 
longer couples may have a more stable marriage 
at 28 for the bride and 48 for the groom there is a 20year age 
difference between bride and groom though unusual this is part of 
a slight trend toward age differences of eight years or more 
between partners according to us national center for health 
statistics demographer barbara foley wilson 
comparing 1976 and 1986 wilson found that in 1976 the groomrecently 
married couples whom she interviewed for 
her book problem areas included combining possessions lifestyles 
and close relationships and adult friendships they had with 
individuals other than their spouse another important issue is 
that women come to marriage committed to careers 
mcdonough whose own recent marriage was to a man 16 years older 
and of a different religion says that there are more marriages 
between individuals of different religious or cultural traditions 
who may have vastly different sets of experiences and expectations 
the families have a lot more work to do to assimilate this new 
union 
the differences can be either problems or opportunities 
depending on how they are handled they can lead to a stronger 
marriage between partners who bring more to a relationship 
unexpressed fears about differences can lead each partner to 
doubt the wisdom of the step they are about to take when unvoiced 
the worries become a generalized anxiety which becomes attached to 
the wedding event itself 
almost everyone i interviewed experienced a great deal of 
turmoil about small details of the ceremony and reception she 
says becoming overwrought over such issues as where people sit or 
the color of the napkins is usually a cover for other emotional 
issues 
there is almost always a question of whether the couple will 
satisfy themselves or their parents since they are older and 
more selfassured and often paying for the wedding themselves the 
couple are more likely to make decisions in keeping with their own 
wishes however how to do this tactfully without alienating the 
parents is often a central issue of the wedding 
my parents were divorced very acrimoniously 15 years ago and 
i wanted them both to attend my wedding it took a lot of work i 
had it at a friends home rather than at my mothers so my father 
would feel comfortable invited my fathers new wife and made sure 
to invite my mothers close friends too says mcdonough 
the attempts i made were helpful although at times my husband 
and i thought about simply eloping i am glad i had the wedding i 
always wanted 
she advises others to verbalize their fears because it is more 
fun to plan a wedding if you are aware of the emotional issues and 
try to do something about them 
in the 1950s we had a little box we all called marriage the 
60s threw it out and everyone said no more boxes for me says 
barbara tober editor of brides magazine 
in the 1970s many people realized marriage could be reshaped to 
fit their needs and in the 1980s many became comfortable with the 
idea that their marriage could be different from others 
tober says that the key to 90s attitudes will be that 
marriage is something you mold a freeform sculpture a work of art 
in progress that you can do anything you want with

dont get so wrapped up in the excitement of 
courtship and planning your wedding that you put off planning your 
marriage cautions a mental health specialist 
talking things out is the key to starting and maintaining a good 
marriage says donna j rankin associate professor of community 
and health nursing at loyola university when you think to 
yourself well talk about this later that later may be too late 
subjects that are best aired before the ceremony include 
parenting finances career and educational plans dealing with 
relatives and friends compatibility sexuality and other shared 
intimacies and religion and spirituality both for the couple and 
the children they will have 
everything is fair game for discussion at this point says 
rankin too many couples think they can talk later but if you 
dont do it now will you ever get around to it 
rankin says most problems emerge after the honeymoon phase a 
period which which can last for just a few months or as long as 
several years then the reality sets in and you see your partner 
as he or she really is rankin says this can be revealing but not 
necessarily negative 
many of the couples i see for counseling yearn for the good 
old days of their marriage wishing it could be like the marriage 
was previously she says you cant expect marriage to grow 
without change but change can hurt and requires adjustment by both 
parties 
rankin advises couples to have a serious discussion of their 
life together at least once a year and suggests anniversaries as a 
good time examine where youve been and where youre going

the engagement ring whether set with diamonds or other 
precious gems is now likely to be more elaborate than the 
longtraditional halfcarat solitaire and its also more expensive 
the average price of a diamond engagement ring in l988 reached 
an alltime high of 1325 a 23 percent increase over the previous 
year according to lloyd jaffe chairman of the american diamond 
industry association 
one of the reasons he says is that couples are waiting until 
they are older to marry this may account for the trend of 
brides and grooms to purchase larger and better quality stones 
says jaffe 
while in most cases the groom still pays for the ring both he 
and the bride share in choosing it according the william g 
underwood president of the american gem society he says older 
couples who account for twothirds of engagement ring purchases 
are spending about three times as much as younger couples 
the diamond association says that 73 percent of engagement rings 
purchased in l988 were diamonds while the gem society estimates 
that about 55 percent of todays couples are picking alternatives 
to the halfcarat diamond solitaire 
diamonds are being picked from a wider variety of cuts 
including pave baguette channel and marquise shapes and more 
couples are choosing rubies sapphires and other colored gemstones 
the gem society says that women marrying for the second time are 
likely to pick one ring often set with one center stone and 
complementary stones rather than the engagement and wedding ring 
combination

you want to look terrific at your wedding not just because its 
your day in the spotlight but because the pictures made will be 
among the most tangible mementos of the event 
but just like every other detail of the celebration getting 
your hair makeup and skin ready takes planning and care 
hair and makeup are the keys to a brides beauty and she 
should devote as much care and attention to them as she does to the 
selection of her dress says denise odonoghue brides magazine 
beauty editor 
along with prell the shampoo maker she advises getting hair 
into shape early if you plan to color highlight or permanent your 
hair do it well enough in advance to fine tune the result 
preliminary shaping should be done about three or four months in 
advance and a fresh cut done about three weeks before the wedding 
freshly washed and conditioned hair will look fullest and best in 
the photographs smooth wispy flyaway strands with hairspray but 
be sure to do so before stepping into your gown to avoid staining 
or spotting on lightcolored delicate fabrics 
also plan your makeup which may be different from your daily 
wear remember you will be wearing white from head to toe since 
the only color will be on your face your palette has to be just 
right says odonoghue 
she recommends experimenting ahead of time using a white sheet 
to simulate the effect of the gown this will help you discover 
whether youll look better in peach or pinktinted makeup she 
advises forgoing frosted or pearlized makeup items since the 
resulting iridescence reflects too much and will make your skin 
photograph unnaturally 
choose a light foundation toned to your skin and soften blusher 
and eyeshadow by blending the edges soft black or brown mascara 
should be lightly applied since the white of the gown will 
intensify its impact and of course the mascara should be 
waterproof to avoid streaking from tears 
then have a friend make test pictures to see how the makeup 
choices do on film 
nails should be professionally manicured every three or four 
weeks with the last session the day before the wedding choose 
pastel pink or peach shades consistent with your makeup 
part of the preparation is getting skin into shape according to 
loreal cosmetics which recently introduced a top french skincare 
collection called plenitude according to linda harris vice 
president of product development the key to healthy skin is 
cleansing and moisturizing bar soaps are too harsh and strip 
natural oils she says so the job should be done with gels for 
oily skin or creams dry skin

no bridal couple really needs to start out with a lifetime 
supply of salt and pepper shakers but no coffeemaker so if youre 
giving shower or wedding gifts make use of bridal registries to 
avoid duplicates or wrong patterns or personalize your gifts 
bridal registries at local stores are recommended by jacqueline 
greenwood black amp deckers bridal program manager listed here 
are gifts the bride has indicated she wants and needs one cant go 
wrong giving a gift from this list she says make sure to 
purchase it at the store where the registry is so that it will be 
crossed off and no one will duplicate the gift 
but if getting a gift idea from the registry seems too 
impersonal and routine go ahead and make a creative personal 
choice she says and giving a personal gift to the bride instead 
of a household item is appropriate if youre a friend of the 
bride roommates in college get a college memento perhaps a 
framed photograph or painting of the campus she suggests 
greenwood advises thinking first of items that are in nearly any 
household but perhaps not owned by someone just setting up 
housekeeping for example if you choose a spice rack fill it up 
with a variety of spices to start with 
appliances are among the most common gifts and irons 
coffeemakers or blenders will be among those needed a personal 
touch suggested by greenwood is to pair a corn popper with 
membership in the local video rental store 
she cautions that the giver should think small choosing compact 
versions of kitchen appliances since the couples first home 
likely will be compact 
and if youre giving a shower party pick a theme that will help 
organize the gift choices such as something for every room in the 
house or apartment

wedding bells are all right but those who get married in the 
oklahoma county courthouse in oklahoma city can no longer celebrate 
with rice or birdseed 
oklahoma county commissioners have voted to ban the throwing of 
rice birdseed confetti and other similar substances in and around 
the courthouse 
rice and birdseed traditionally have been tossed at weddings as 
symbols of fertility but the commissioners action apparently was 
not an effort to limit population growth 
commissioner fg buck buchanan says the policy was enacted 
as a safety measure weve had people who have been hurt by 
sliding on rice and so forth

the wedding ceremony of susan parsons and donald waite expressed 
their relationship with each other their families and their 
friends 
and thats a what wedding should do says rev paul alcorn 
copastor of the bedford ny presbyterian church in which the 
couple were married 
alcorn says that most couples now want the wedding ceremony to 
reflect their personal histories in this instance the grooms 
brother an ordained minister officiated in the service with 
alcorn and the congregation was asked to consent verbally to the 
union then anyone who wished to could speak about the couple a 
part of the ceremony known as sharing time 
the wedding also was typical because one partner had been 
divorced says alcorn a significant proportion of couples come 
from a background of divorce 
some other trends noted by alcorn and others premarital 
counseling is taken much more seriously alcorn says couples are 
very interested in interpersonal dynamics and ministers are 
likely to initiate discussions on how relationships succeed and 
fail 
more couples are opting for a more traditional type of service 
than five to eight years ago but with contemporary nonsexist 
language they avoid masculineonly gender pronouns and the thees 
and thous its not just the father of the bride giving daughters 
away in 95 percent of the services both families give their 
blessing says the pastor he says he found the same thing true 
in prior pastorates in neenah wis and suburban chicago 
rabbi daniel syme author of the book the jewish home and 
vice president of the union of american hebrew congregations in new 
york finds that jewish couples in the reform tradition are much 
more interested in knowing the meaning of the ceremony and the 
symbols that will be part of that ceremony as opposed to passive 
participation in a ceremony which is not understood 
interest in restoring traditional ceremonies but updating them 
to reflect a more equal role for women also is an important trend 
he said in jewish ceremonies its common for both sets of parents 
to join the couple under the wedding canopy or chupa 
other ways in which tradition is returning include the use of a 
jewish marriage document in hebrew and aramaic known as a ketuba 
however the ketuba the word comes from the hebrew word meaning 
written has been recast to reflect the equality of the sexes 
in the marriage covenant says syme 
among a growing number of reform jewish couples the groom wears 
a yarmulke or skullcap and makes similar caps available to all 
men in the temple reform judaism eliminated the requirement for 
the headgear many years ago 
donning the skullcap signifies both the reembracing of 
tradition and the fact that many of those now affiliated with 
reform congregations came from more traditional homes for them 
the yarmulke is an important symbol says syme 
it is customary now for the couples getting married in the 
catholic faith to enter more into the planning of their wedding 
says bishop patrick v ahern vicar of staten island ny and 
pastor of the church of the blessed sacrament there 
in the old days it was a fully developed ceremony which they 
accepted and didnt modify according to ahern who has been a 
priest for 45 years the changes introduced by the vatican council 
15 years ago make it easier for couples to exercise some choices 
couples are delighted to have that opportunity to participate 
they get a pamphlet listing options and in most cases go over it 
very carefully says ahern often they design very beautiful 
ceremonies for themselves selecting the readings from scripture 
and using certain permissible options he says a favored biblical 
reading is the section on love in first corinthians the waites 
chose this 
many catholic couples will opt for a candlelighting ceremony 
each lights a taper and then together they light a third candle to 
symbolize the unifying sacrament of marriage and their equality as 
man and wife they often turn to each other in exchanging consent 
vows adds ahern 
rabbi alex goldman author of the novel the rabbi is a lady 
and 12 other books and religious leader of temple beth el a 
conservative temple in stamford conn reports that there has been 
a change in choices of ceremonial music of the wedding 
gone almost completely are traditional military marches like 
here comes the bride instead music that has come out of israel 
and is drawn from the psalms or solomons song of songs is 
preferred this gives the ceremony a more romantic and more loving 
character

a us district court jury has found no 
evidence to substantiate a claim that united airlines and american 
airlines monopolized the airline reservation market by giving 
travel agents underpriced computer systems 
a federal jury ruled friday against four airlines that asked for 
damages totaling 149 million from united which operates the 
apollo reservation system and american which runs the sabre 
system 
the plaintiffs contended that travel agents bought the united 
and american systems because the airlines undercut the actual 
price and that agents then were asked to sign exclusive contracts 
the jury has confirmed what american has long maintained that 
the marketing of computer reservation systems to travel agents is 
extremely competitive robert l crandall americans chairman 
and president said in a statement 
united vice president edward hoenicke said that uniteds 
position as to the fairness of its pricing for the apollo service 
and its contract and marketing practices have now been vindicated 
when the case began about five years ago a number of airlines 
were listed as plaintiffs but their numbers were reduced by 
mergers and outofcourt settlements 
the remaining plaintiffs were northwest airlines which was 
suing american and alaska airlines midway airlines and muse air 
corp which were suing united 
max blecher an attorney for the plaintiff airlines attributed 
the verdict to us district judge edward rafeedies decision to 
throw out fraud and racketeering claims 
in the case the judge left us to try we did not have our best 
ammunition blecher said we were not playing with our 
strongest suit 
in january rafeedie is scheduled to preside over a separate 
trial on similar claims against american and united this time by

the researcher whose 1984 report said a 
controversial investment strategy posed no danger to lincoln 
savings and loan says he stands by his evaluation even though those 
investments have been blamed in the sampls subsequent failure 
george j benston now a professor at emory university was with 
the university of rochester in new york when he issued the study 
paid for by lincoln savings of irvine calif 
i stand by the conclusions i drew from the data i had 
benston said last week 
the report was used by lincoln to battle regulators who sought 
to block it from increasing its direct investments in real 
estate and undeveloped land 
in a direct investment an sampl becomes an owner not merely a 
lender in a project putting off income from loan payments in 
favor of a hopedfor profit when the project is sold for lincoln 
many of those deals went sour and have been blamed in part for 
lincolns collapse 
benstons report was endorsed by alan greenspan then a private 
economist paid by lincoln and now chairman of the federal reserve 
board 
greenspan has been criticized for his role as have five us 
senators all beneficiaries of campaign contributions from lincoln 
savings owner who held a special meeting with sampl examiners to 
ask why the thrift was the subject of federal scrutiny 
fifteen of the top 17 sampls benston cited in his report to show 
that direct investments were profitable have since failed 
benston argues direct investments were not the main reason 
they had big losses on their loan portfolios not their direct 
investments he said 
edwin gray chairman of the federal home loan bank board and the 
nations top sampl regulator from 1983 to 1987 counters that direct 
investments played a major role 
i think he benston made a disastrous mistake said gray 
now president of chase federal bank in miami i dont know how 
much he was paid by lincoln but his advice was as wrong as wrong 
can be 
benstons report delayed early attacks on direct investments 
gray said and in significant part that led to the thrift 
crisis 
this year congress voted to phase out sampl authority to make 
direct investments 
benston now promoted by emory university as a thrift industry 
expert said his report merely provided an accurate analysis of 
contemporary data 
im a researcher he said if it turns out that the world 
has changed ill change my conclusions but i still dont know for 
sure what happened at lincoln

its crunch time at nintendos only us 
repair shop 
with 800 broken electronic game machines to fix each day scores 
of technicians are working feverishly to get them finished and back 
home in time to play the new games placed under christmas trees 
when super mario wont jump when the screen goes blank when 
the whole gadget chooses to be a lump of uncooperative plastic the 
place to send the misbehaving merchandise is nintendo of americas 
headquarters in this seattle suburb 
in a workroom crammed with testing equipment tv monitors spare 
computer boards and electronic parts from wounded toys the 160 
technicians try to make things right 
the home office is the only place in the united states to go 
with broken nintendo entertainment systems game packs and other 
products for the popular electronic toy that will change next 
year says jon pedersen nintendo director of technical services 
as the company starts opening dozens of service centers around the 
country 
at the moment however pedersen is worried about this week 
right now were looking at quite a big load for the christmas 
rush pedersen said were trying to do the best we can now to 
get everything back to the consumer which means we have to ship by 
wednesday 
theyve been making about 800 repairs a day up from 400 to 500 
before the holiday season on the other hand with nintendo selling 
9 million more game systems this year theres never really been 
a normal load pedersen said 
it grows with the hardware sales it never really levels off 
nintendos entertainment system a small computer that lets 
owners play games on a tv screen has been the nations topselling 
toy the past three years so far nearly 20 million systems have 
been sold in this country plus about 101 million game cartridges 
the company expects the game system will be in 22 percent of all 
us households by the end of 1989 said spokesman bill white 
pedersen says the machines and games are pretty reliable with a 
problem rate of about onetenth of 1 percent but with about 120 
million control decks and game cartridges sold that works out to 
something like 120000 repair jobs 
the no 1 troublemaker for nintendo is simply dirty contacts 
between the game pack and the control deck pedersen said 
basically because of the age group of the individual who uses 
this product there tends to be a lot of sugar 
the machines dont like carpet fuzz either so when you play on 
the living room rug put something under deck pedersen says 
nintendo devices carry a 90day warranty after that its a 
flat 30 to fix control decks and 10 for each cartridge no matter 
the problem 
well we will call them to ask why we got a sack of parts 
pedersen said but i dont think to date weve refused a repair 
starting early next year nintendo will open repair centers at 
some of its world of nintendo retail outlets by the end of 
1990 there should be about 200 service outlets each capable of 
doing any repair the main workshop can 
that wont mean pedersen will be cutting back 
the way the workload increases around here i dont see it

marriott corp today announced a major 
restructuring including the sale of its fast food and family 
restaurant businesses in an effort to reposition the company for 
the next decade 
the company also said that it has completed the sale of its 
airline catering division to a group of senior managers for 570 
million that sale was expected to yield more than 200 million for 
marriott 
as we move into the 1990s we want to sharpen marriotts focus 
on megamarkets in lodging and contract services which together 
have an estimated aggregate potential of more than 400 billion in 
industry annual sales said jw marriott jr chairman and 
president in a news release 
we believe the restructuring will help the company to grow at 
15 to 20 percent per year from our 1989 profit base for continuing 
operations marriott said 
the plan calls for the sale of 358 companyoperated roy rogers 
fast food restaurants in the middle atlantic states in the first 
quarter of 1990 those stores were expected to register about 400 
million in sales this year 
marriott also said it intends to sell the 434 units operated by 
its family restaurants division including 235 bobs big boy 79 
wags 31 bickfords 57 howard johnsons and 32 allies 
restaurants in total these restaurants had 1989 anticipated sales 
of about 440 million 
the company also announced it has repurchased 32 million shares 
or 24 percent of its common stock over the past three years 
leaving 104 million outstanding 
marriott said one of the companys key objectives is to be a 
leader in each of its segments 
we have concluded that it is unrealistic for us to continue to 
pursue this goal in standalone restaurants marriott said 
in fast food we have a strong regional concept in a highly 
competitive segment dominated by a handful of national chains in 
the family restaurant segment competitive conditions have changed 
significantly within the past year and we believe it now is too 
difficult for a new grand to become number one he said 
the company headquartered in suburban bethesda md expects to 
record pretax restructuring charges and writeoffs of between 225 
million and 250 million on continuing operations in the fourth 
quarter of this year pretax writeoffs and reserves of 50 million 
to 75 million also will be incurred in the sale of the restaurant 
operations the company said 
despite the additional costs william j shaw executive vice 
president and chief financial officer said he expected per share 
income from continuing operations in fiscal 1989 to be up slightly 
from 1988 
marriott the nations largest hotel company has projected 1990 
sales of 75 billion 
our airline catering and standalone restaurant operations 
are sound profitable businesses marriott said but they do 
not offer the same scale of longterm market growth potential as 
our other major businesses 
the company has recently launched a new division senior living 
services for older americans

most grain and soybean futures prices fell 
slightly monday on the chicago board of trade as badly needed 
precipitation fell in us winter wheat region and the brazilian 
soybean belt

which should help insulate the dormant winter wheat crop from the 
brutal cold in the nations midsection the development was bearish 
for newcrop wheat contracts those for delivery next spring 
in brazil where its late springtime weekend rains brought 
relief to the soybean crop which has been suffering through hot 
dry conditions brazil is the worlds secondlargest soybean 
producer after the united states

cattle being fed for the slaughter market as 
of dec 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 813 million head 
up 2 percent from a year ago but 3 percent below the level of two 
years ago the agriculture department said monday 
marketings of fed cattle in november totaled 150 million 
head fractionally below a year ago and 1 percent below two years 
ago 
the placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last 
month was reported at 199 million head up 18 percent from a year 
ago and 22 percent more than two years ago 
this was the largest november placement total since 1977 and 
was the result of cattle moving into feedlots rather than going 
onto wheat pastures 
net placements of 190 million for november was 20 percent above 
last year and 24 percent more than two years ago 
state feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven 
states which account for about threefourths of the nations beef 
the first number is the number of cattle in thousands as of dec

heating oil futures soared monday on the new york mercantile 
exchange as forecasts for more brutally cold weather attracted new 
buyers to a market that has been climbing with barely a pause for 
five weeks 
on other other commodity markets monday precious metals were 
lower livestock futures were mixed and grains and soybeans were 
mostly lower 
heating oil futures settled 49 cent to 424 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in january up 424 cents at 7466 cents a 
gallon a fouryear high 
unleaded gasoline futures finished 13 cents to 174 cents 
higher with january at 5451 cents a gallon crude oil futures 
settled 3 cents to 112 higher with january at 2222 a barrel 
the highest level since last april 
with subzero temperature readings boosting domestic demand for 
heating oil the entire energy complex has become a weather market 
the cold snap that descended on the nations midsection last week 
is expected to continue into this weekend bringing unseasonably 
frigid temperatures to most of the united states east of the 
rockies 
weve had weather markets in heating oil before but in my 
lifetime i dont remember a weather market developing this early in 
the season said james ritterbusch a energy market analyst with 
carson petroleum co a chicagoarea oil distributor 
weather markets can create huge profits for speculators but they 
are notoriously treacherous a hint of a change in the weather 
pattern can send prices plummeting 
the heating oil market began its climb from about 60 cents a 
gallon in early november amid concerns about tight supplies of 
heating oil in europe which also had an early runin with arctic 
weather 
but the european weather has since warmed and river levels there 
have risen with rain opening transportation channels that had been 
problematic 
a week or two ago you saw a lot of cargoes from south america 
being redirected from north america to europe ritterbusch said 
i think some of those ships are now going to be making a uturn 
precious metals futures fell moderately on new yorks commodity 
exchange as the dollar showed some strength prices opened sharply 
lower but trimmed their losses by midday with support stemming 
from tension over the shooting of a us soldier in panama 
gold futures settled 210 lower across the board with december 
at 41180 a troy ounce silver was 39 cents to 42 cents lower 
with december at 5565 a troy ounce 
pork futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange on 
ideas that cold weather would curtail hog marketings 
cattle futures settled mixed in cautious trading ahead of the 
agriculture departments monthly cattleonfeed report 
the report which was released after the close showed 2 percent 
more cattle on feedlots dec 1 than on the same date a year ago 
compared with market expectations for no change 
november feedlot placements were much higher than expected while 
marketings off of feedlots were only slightly above expectations 
analysts expected the report to prompt some selling of live 
cattle futures at the opening tuesday but the report was perceived 
as bullish for the cash cattle market and gains there could 
partially offset selling pressure in the futures markets 
live cattle futures settled 10 cent lower to 35 cent higher 
with december at 7827 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent 
lower to 30 cent higher with january at 8457 cents a pound live 
hogs were 30 cent to 55 cent higher with december at 5345 cents 
a pound frozen pork bellies were 13 cent to 88 cent higher with 
february at 5207 cents a pound 
most grain and soybean futures prices fell slightly on the 
chicago board of trade as new snow insulated the winter wheat crop 
from the cold and rain brought refief to soybean crops in southern 
brazil 
wheat futures settled 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with 
december at 415 a bushel corn was unchanged to 1 cents lower 
with december at 234 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents 
lower with december at 142 a bushel soybeans were cent to 2

former stock speculator salim b lewis on monday 
was spared a prison term for stock manipulation by a federal judge 
who ordered him to work in a drug rehabilitation clinic saying 
your skills should not be wasted 
lewis 50 a prominent wall street veteran whose downfall 
resulted indirectly from the ivan boesky insider trading scandal 
was placed on three years probation and fined 250000 after 
pleading guilty to three counts for illegally inflating the price 
of firemans fund corp stock in may 1986 
us district judge mary johnson lowe also fined lewis firm 
sb lewis amp co 400000 for violating federal securities laws 
lewis faced up to 15 years in prison and a fine of 750000 and 
the firm a maximum 1 million fine for the manipulation which 
raised the value of firemans fund stock immediately before a lewis 
client american express co sold a large amount of shares in a 
new public offering 
american express was never charged and there is no proof that 
it or lewis profited from the manipulation but under federal 
securities laws profit is not necessary for a crime to have been 
committed 
i recognize my conduct was wrong lewis told the court 
for this i am deeply sorry 
he said he was not motivated by greed but by a desire to punish 
rival speculators attempting to bid down the price of firemans 
fund the government said his version of events was simply not 
supported by the facts 
lewis pleaded guilty in manhattan federal court in august 
reversing his assertions of innocence nine months after he was 
indicted 
the charges stemmed from a 1987 guilty plea by former los 
angeles stockbroker boyd jefferies who testified against several 
wall street figures in the governments criminal fraud crackdown 
jefferies was implicated in the scandal by boesky the convicted 
inside trader now in a new york halfway house finishing a 
threeyear prison term 
lewis was ordered to work 40 hours a week for one year at daytop 
village a manhattanbased drug rehabilitation clinic he must work 
20 hours a week at the clinic in the second and third years of his 
probation lewis will work at daytop as an executive consultant 
arkin said 
you should be sentenced in such a manner that your skills 
should not be wasted lowe said 
but she added i firmly believe your actions undermined the 
integrity of the financial system i have no problem saying that 
should not be tolerated or go unpunished 
prosecutors alleged lewis requested two of jefferies employees 
to buy more than 400000 shares of firemans fund on may 8 1986 
in an attempt to drive its price up 12 cents to 38 a share 
the indictment also accused lewis of promising to reimburse the 
jefferies employees for any losses and of hiding his role through 
phony records 
on may 9 1986 american express announced it would sell 8 
million shares of its 41 percent owned firemans fund at 4150 a 
share a new stock offering that had been widely expected 
prosecutors said american express made 88 million from the sale 
but they never offered evidence that any of that profit was tainted 
by what lewis did 
lewis said he manipulated the stock price to foil 
shortsellers in firemans fund stock shortsellers are 
speculators who sell borrowed stock to push down the value 
repurchase it at a cheaper price return the borrowed shares to the 
lender and pocket the difference as profit 
the securities and exchange commission in september 1988 banned 
shortselling in new stock offerings like that of firemans fund 
exactly the type of activity lewis claimed hed tried to thwart 
stock prices tend to fall after announcement of a new issue which 
dilutes the stocks value 
vincent diblasi attorney for sb lewis amp co said the firm 
had fired all but seven of 44 employees and is liquidating 
lowe said the firms demise sends the appropriate message to 
the investment community that if a company engages in this type of 
activity it will no longer be around 
in other words the death of a company is as final as the death 
of a human being she said

heating oil futures prices to their highest closing levels in 
nearly four years on monday and crude oil futures soared above 22 
a barrel for the first time since april 
on the new york mercantile exchange the january contract for 
no 2 heating oil climbed 424 cents to 7466 cents a gallon in 
active trading domestic heating oil last closed higher on jan 7 
1986 when it hit 7567 cents a gallon the january contract had 
risen 314 cents a gallon on friday 
the january contract for west texas intermediate the leading 
grade of us crude rocketed 112 to settle at 2222 per 
42gallon barrel

wholesale unleaded gasoline for january ended the session at 
5451 cents a gallon up 171 cents from fridays settlement the 
unleaded gasoline contract rose 119 cents on friday 
we are seeing weatherdriven markets right now led by heating 
oil said evan baron of the energy group at elders futures inc 
in new york 
he said the cold weather that has swept across much of the 
nation in the past week is usually not seen until january or 
february 
heating oil distributors were simply not prepared for this 
kind of extended cold weather this early in the season baron 
said 
william byers director of futures research at bear stearns amp 
co inc said cold weather in europe several weeks ago inhibited 
shipments of oil products adding to the problems when the weather 
worsened in the united states 
in addition he said inventories of home heating oil are 
slightly below what they were a year ago 
byers said one reason for the jump in crude prices was that the 
january contract expires at the end of trading on tuesday other 
contract months rose but finished below 22 a barrel 
he said reports of continued turmoil in panama failed to exert 
as much influence on the market as on friday when the reports were 
cited as a major factor in the rise in crude prices

the securities and exchange commission has 
withdrawn an appeal to a federal judges dismissal of its 
6yearold civil case against blinder robinson amp co inc 
officials said monday 
tom carter sec regional counsel said the withdrawal was filed 
dec 11 in the 10th us circuit court of appeals 
he declined to comment on the reason but said it had nothing to 
do with a separate disciplinary inquiry the sec has undertaken into 
the activities of blinder robinson a leading penny stock 
brokerage 
penny stocks are inexpensive shares of startup companies ranging 
from biotechnology research labs to energy and mining concerns the 
stocks usually are traded overthecounter and have been targeted 
by federal authorities as a frequent breeding ground for fraud 
the sec filed the civil case in april 1983 contending blinder 
robinson had failed to keep correct books and records and violated 
customer protection regulations 
in april us district judge lewis t babcock dismissed the 
case after determining the sec failed to comply with a court order 
and had not acted in good faith 
the judge also said the sec could not use documents or testimony 
obtained in the 1983 case in court against blinder robinson 
babcock said his ruling was justified by the secs egregious 
conduct in this case 
on dec 12 babcock ordered the sec to pay blinder robinson 
58575 in attorneys fees carter said 
in a news release issued monday blinder robinson executives 
said they are pleased that justice has been served by the award 
of attorney fees and costs to defendants 
carter said the sec is considering a possible appeal to the 
specific amount of the fees

a littleknown government agency created 11 
years ago to lend money to cooperative organizations has failed to 
adequately serve consumers since it was privatized by the reagan 
administration in 1982 a group affiliated with activist ralph 
nader charged monday 
the nader group center for study of responsive law charged at 
a news conference that the national cooperative bank has in effect 
used the subsidy from a lowinterest 1843 million federal loan to 
provide the profits necessary pay its executives high salaries and 
provide financial benefits to large cooperatives serving small 
businesses rather than consumers 
in 1988 only 5 percent of the banks 641 member cooperatives 
served businesses rather than individuals yet 30 percent of the 
banks 1996 milion in disbursements during the year were to the 
business cooperatives even though the law limits lending to 
business cooperatives at 10 percent of the total according to a 
report prepared for the nader group by seyoum a haregot 
the report also claimed the bank is not doing enough to serve 
lowincome consumers or to stimulate the formation of new 
cooperatives 
nader in a forward to the report said bank has abandoned its 
onecooperative one vote principle in favor of a voting system 
that gives control of the organization to large established 
cooperatives 
he said the banks managers drove it from serving ultimate 
consumers and toward a commercial banking model replete with 
executive emoluments all the while enjoying its substantial 
taxpayer subsidy 
the federal subsidy to the bank totaled 1195 million from 1982 
through 1988 according to haregots report salaries benefits and 
bonuses to the banks nine top executives totaled 13 million in 
1988 including 250000 to thomas s condit president and chief 
executive officer of the bank the report said 
in a written response linda r lewis corporate vice president 
of the bank said the salaries were in line with the pay of other 
financial institutions and said the bank has not been obligated to 
keep its pay comparable to government salaries since its 
privatization 
she said the bank disagreed with haregots argument that it lent 
too heavily to businessowned cooperatives saying that we 
believe a cooperative owned by a business is in fact owned by 
ultimate consumers 
also the bank at mid1989 had a lowincome loan portfolio of 
1318 million she said 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee said he was deeply concerned about the failed 
promise of the bank and said it would be placed on the 
oversight agenda of the committee

boeing co engineers and scientists rejected a 
threeyear contract with the worlds largest commercial jet builder 
but technicians and support workers ratified a separate pact union 
leaders said monday night 
charles bofferding president of the seattle professional 
engineering employees association said members of the professional 
unit voted by 69 percent to reject their contract offer but also 
voted 52 percent against authorizing negotiators to call a strike 
it was the first time in the unaffiliated unions history that 
engineers and scientists rejected a contract offer he said the 
union consists of nearly 9300 of 15200 affected boeing scientists 
and engineers 
about 8300 of boeings nearly 12800 technical and support 
workers belong to the technical workers unit almost all of those 
covered by both contracts are in the puget sound area 
leaders of the engineers union will contact boeing officials 
immediately about returning to the table bofferding said 
we are critical parts of the boeing team and we affect them 
in all areas he said 
bofferding said the voting rate for both units exceeded 80 
percent a record the unions vote by mail 
the offers included general pay hikes totaling 3 percent for 
engineers and 7 percent for the lowerpaid technicians 
bofferding said he believed the main factor in the engineers 
rejection was the belief that the money package was too small 
compared with that won by boeing production workers in a 48day 
strike that ended last month 
the machinists threeyear pact includes pay increases of 4 
percent the first year 3 percent the next two years productivity 
bonuses of 10 percent 5 percent and 4 percent of annual gross pay 
and a boost in the costofliving formula from 86 percent of 
inflation to nearly 100 percent 
the offer to engineers who now make an average of nearly 
40000 a year called for a 3 percent wage increase and a 
productivity bonus of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year and 
no further general increases

finance minister ryutaro hashimoto denied news 
reports tuesday that japans central bank will raise its official 
discount rate by 05 percentage point to 425 percent later this 
week 
speaking at a news conference hashimoto said bank of japan 
governor yasushi mieno told him tuesday morning that he knew 
nothing about the news reports when the two met at a monthly 
meeting of economyrelated cabinet ministers earlier in the day 
the yomiuri shinbun and the asahi shinbun the nations two 
largest newspapers quoting unidentified sources reported the 
central bank is making final adjustments with the finance ministry 
on the rate hike which they said will be put into effect this week 
if the bank action is taken it will be the third such discount 
rate hike in japan this year 
hashimoto said mieno gave no indication of a plan to boost the 
discount rate during the meeting the minister said the domestic 
economic situation does not demand a third increase in the discount 
rate this year because prices are stable even though exchange rate 
levels require watching 
after the news conference hashimoto told japanese reporters 
that he has instructed the ministrys monetary officials not to 
agree to any central bank plan to raise the official discount rate 
if the bank came up with such a plan kyodo news service said 
japans current discount rate after a 075 percentage point 
raise march 31 and another 05 percentage point hike oct 11 
stands at 375 percent 
a spokesman for the central bank refused to confirm or deny the 
reports 
mieno who assumed the central banks highest post sunday told 
reporters at his first news conference monday that a strong yen is 
necessary for the continued expansion of japans domestic 
demandled economy 
mieno said the nations economic conditions are favorable and 
growth should continue as long as prices remain stable but he said 
the central bank must continue to keep the situation under close 
surveillance 
the official discount rate the rate the central bank charges on 
its loans to commercial banks has a strong impact on other 
domestic rates higher rates tend to make the countrys currency 
more attractive to investors 
the newspapers said the rate hike is intended to curb 
inflationary pressure and to stem the continuing weakness of the 
yen against the dollar 
a lower yen tends to make imports more expensive in japanese 
market while making japans products in overseas markets less 
expensive 
the spread of rising land prices beyond tokyo and the tightening 
of the labor market are also behind the measure the reports said 
the measure is also aimed at narrowing the gap in interest rates 
between japan and other industrialized countries they said
