an iraqi soldier shot down an egyptian jet 
fighter by mistake last week as it descended to land in baghdad for 
an air show a published report here said 
the two egyptian fliers ejected safely before the plane crashed 
the washington post reported in fridays editions 
the iraqi government had invited egypt to fly its homebuilt 
alpha fighterbomber to baghdad for the air show but apparently 
word of the invitation had not reached the soldier who armed with 
shoulderfired missile downed the unfamiliar jet the post said 
the newspaper cited secret intelligence reports making the 
rounds of us government offices here as the source of the story 
the alpha jet was developed by french and german aircraft firms 
egypt has purchased alpha kits from france and assembles the 
fighterbomber in a plant south of cairo the jet has a top speed 
of 600 mph 
two years ago in another case of mistaken identity an iraqi 
pilot in a mirage f1 bomber shot two exocet missiles into the uss 
stark killing 37 sailors aboard the us frigate in the persian 
gulf iraqi officials said the pilot mistook the us ship for an 
iranian vessel 
also the uss vincennes downed an iranian airbus on july 3 
1988 killing 290 people as it flew over the persian gulf where 
us ships were protecting neutral ships during the iraniraq war 
the united states said it attempted repeatedly to contact the plane 
for identification and when it got no response the vincennes 
destroyed the plane with a surfacetoair missile

the miniseries comes to mister rogers 
neighborhood next week and the shows cardiganclad creator 
promises a message as gentle and reassuring as ever 
the threepart musical titled josephine the shortneck 
giraffe tells the story of a young giraffe who yearns for a 
long graceful neck like all the other giraffes she eventually 
grows fred rogers confided not on the outside but on the 
important side 
its very much like the usual message of the neighborhood 
that you can be acceptable as you are he said smiling its 
not so much the outsides of us that are important 
a song sung by josephine and her friend hazel the elephant sums 
it up best according to rogers 
youre much more than a neck josephine and youre much more 
than a trunk hazel a chickens more than a peck and theres more 
than a smell to a skunk rogers quietly sang during an interview 
at pittsburghs wqedtv home to his childrens programs for the 
past 35 years 
the special week of new programs gets under way monday on public 
broadcasting service stations with a trip to the san diego wild 
animal park where viewers are introduced to reallife giraffes and 
elephants on tuesday rogers visits a film processing lab to have 
his animal photographs developed 
the miniseries which features a cast of 15 elaborate animal 
costumes and five sets runs wednesday through friday rogers 
gently guides his young audience from one day to the next 
summarizing the main events and hinting at what might lie ahead for 
josephine 
in the neighborhood of makebelieve where animals sing dance 
and play the trombone josephine is befriended by jr a shy 
giraffe who overcomes his problems by helping josephine conquer 
hers he accomplishes that with help from hazel the elephant who 
advises him to just let your heart speak 
there isnt a time that i see the scene in which jr talks 
and sings with josephine that i havent gotten chills up my 
spine rogers said tapping his right hand against his back 
and this is something ive worked with for years theres 
something so redemptive about someone who is trying so hard to help 
somebody else 
rogers 61 wrote josephine the shortneck giraffe for a 
french class assignment at floridas rollins college in 1950 he 
named jr the giraffe after fraternity brother john reardon who 
went on to sing with the metropolitan opera and was a frequent 
guest on mister rogers neighborhood reardon died a year ago 
and the miniseries is dedicated to him 
rogers set the story to music in the late 1950s and about 1000 
records were pressed writer barry head transformed josephine the 
shortneck giraffe into a poem for children in 1975 
for years rogers tried to have the musical produced on stage or 
as an animated film 
i still think it would be great for animation and a stage 
production he said but i thought unless we get it out on the 
air i dont think anybodys going to know about it 
the story rogers wrote 39 years ago is vastly different from the 
musical airing next week it is the neighborhoods 13th musical 
at the end of the original story when people are telling 
josephine that they like her just the way she is she raises her 
head to look at them because she hasnt really heard this message 
before and her neck starts to grow and it grows and grows and 
grows until her neck is as tall as everybody elses rogers said 
in the musical josephines neck remains short 
i think it shows how much weve grown rogers said you 
know you dont have to look like everybody else to be acceptable 
and to feel acceptable and wishes dont always come true 
because for a year and a day ive been wishing she sang that 
was one of her first songs her wish was for a longer neck she 
thought but really her wish was to have people like her exactly as 
she is so often what we say were wishing for isnt necessarily 
what is behind the wish this is very philosophical 
will preschoolers be able to grasp such a serious message even 
in such a lighthearted setting 
maybe not in words but let their hearts speak to them the way 
hazel said to jr just let your heart speak rogers said i 
think that thats the way an awful lot of communication takes 
place

frere jacques never sounded so revolutionary 
lying to the people lying to the people very strange very 
strange hundreds of students sang in place of the usual lyrics 
of the french childrens song 
unlike american antivietnam war marchers of the 1960s who were 
serenaded by a generation of rock and folk singers thousands of 
chinese students who marched for democracy have a limited 
repertoire of marching songs most of the time they stick to the 
national anthem with its stirring call to the masses to arise 
or the internationale the theme song of the international 
communist movement 
but they mix it up a bit with frere jacques and the nursery 
rhyme baa baa black sheep 
only the words were different

police kept their cool but some lost their hats and shoes in 
skirmishes with students who pushed through their lines toward 
tiananmen square 
when the dust settled after the students pushed through the 
first line of police one officer was seen wandering around in his 
socks wailing my shoes my shoes 
an old woman finally found one of his black cloth shoes and 
returned it a student later produced another 
in the final standoff before students surged into tiananmen 
square one worker snatched the hat off an officers head and 
tossed it into the crowd someone caught it and tossed it back like

the united states is a model to many of the students 
one student described hu yaobang the ousted communist party 
leader whose death sparked the recent protests as chinas george 
washington 
another said american student protests in the 1960s against the 
vietnam war inspired him and his classmates to take to the streets 
despite the fact that the united states at that time was chinas 
enemy no 1

most of the police who withdrew in the face of the huge 
insistent crowd did so gracefully 
about 50 police who had been roughly pushing back bystanders on

a few traffic police caught up in the melee simply took off 
their uniform white crosschest straps and belts climbed over a 
fence and melted into the crowd 
other police crouched on their haunches at the side of the road 
heads in their hands and smiled wearily as the crowd passed

what makes a successful entreprenuer a 
recent massachusetts institute of technology survey reports that 
many are immigrants the offspring of selfemployed parents and 
hold advanced degrees 
the survey of 99 mit graduates who will be honored by the 
university saturday night provides some insight into the men and 
women who give upthe security of a salary to take a chance on their 
own business 
as part of the institutes 128th anniversary it will honor the 
99 sociology consultants financial managers and computer 
technicians for their hard work foresight and courage 
collectively they have created 100000 jobs in the state and 
250000 worldwide in fields that range from womens apparel to 
geotechnical engineering the cumulative sales of their companies 
total 25 billion annually 
according to the survey 73 percent earned an educational degree 
above the bachelor level and 33 percent went on to doctorate or 
postdoctorate work 
sixteen percent founded their companies while they were still at 
school 34 percent set up shop within five years of graduating and 
23 percent opened for business between six years and 10 years after 
graduation two percent founded their companies more than 20 years 
after graduation 
the survey said more than half were the children of parents who 
founded their own companies 
many of the companies had inauspicious beginnings in basements 
or rough neighborhoods with minimal staff and equipment but some 
of the entrepreneurs had more colorful starts 
clark abt founder of the social sciences consulting firm abt 
associates built ship models and sold them to saks fifth avenue 
when he was only 12 harold doc edgerton whom the institute 
called the father of flash photography attempted to market his 
first strobe equipment through general electric co but ge wasnt 
interested 
the three most important lessons the entrepreneurs said mit 
taught them were problem solving the importance of hard work 
confidence and the belief that anything is possible 
and when these busy people take the time to relax and enjoy 
success most said they enjoyed tennis skiing sailing music and 
art and reading 
in the advice department the entrepreneurs recommend that 
aspiring business adventurers begin by identifying a market 
opportunity and matching it with an appropriate technology select 
partners with talents that complement their own and remember that 
the success of the enterprise rests with the performance of its 
employees

a new experiment confirms observations from the 
controversial cold fusion research announced last month giving 
very encouraging evidence for fusion a scientist says 
the new experiment generated more power than it consumed and 
showed two other signs of possible fusion said researcher uziel 
landau 
but results so far are only preliminary and we stop short of 
saying that we see fusion said landau a professor of chemical 
engineering at case western reserve university in cleveland 
fusion is the nuclear reaction that powers the sun and some 
scientists hope to harness it as an environmentally benign power 
source it occurs when the cores of two hydrogen atoms fuse 
last month researchers announced at the university of utah that 
they had produced fusion at room temperature with a simple 
apparatus conventional fusion research uses extremely high 
temperatures and complex machinery 
since the announcement some scientists have reported similar 
results while others said their attempts to confirm the work failed 
landau worked with two large test tubes each containing a small 
palladium rod to act as one electrode and a titaniumcoated 
platinum mesh to serve as the other 
the electrodes were placed in a bath of socalled heavy water 
in which hydrogen is replaced by a chemical cousin called 
deuterium the liquid also contained lithium landau said thursday 
in an interview 
according to proponents of cold fusion the reaction occurs in 
one of the electrodes when current is applied 
landau said his apparatus produced three possible signs of 
fusion 
one was that the apparatus gave off 8 percent to 30 percent more 
power than it consumed with the output given off as heat he said 
the apparatus also produced bursts of extremely tiny particles 
called neutrons 
and the heavy water solution showed about a doubling of its 
initial concentration of tritium which is a form of hydrogen 
landau said 
landau said he did not test for production of helium a product 
of fusion 
future experiments will use ordinary water rather than heavy 
water landau said scientists say that can help rule out the 
possibility that a chemical reaction rather than a nuclear 
reaction produced the experimental results

prince charles says romanias president nicolae 
ceausescu is destroying that countrys cultural heritage by razing 
villages and replacing city buildings with a uniform and deathly 
mock modernity 
in an unusual royal criticism of a foreign leader the 
40yearold heir to the british throne said he was appalled at 
the awful specter of an entire society not just certain 
districts losing its roots and its ancient communities 
the 20th century has witnessed some strange aberrations of the 
human spirit but few can match the activities of rulers who boast 
about their patriotism and then systematically undertake the 
destruction of the cultural heritage of their people charles 
said at an architecture exhibition on wednesday 
president ceausescu has set about destroying the cities and 
villages of his country and replacing them with blocks of flats 
apartments which are a repetition of failed 1960s social 
engineering mixed with the atmosphere of george orwells 1984 
he added 
ceausescu plans to demolish thousands of villages as well as 
historic churches and old cemeteries to create an ideal communist 
state of industrial centers and gain more farmland for use by 
stateowned collective farms

when organizers at arizona state university 
invited ronald reagan to give a speech last month fewer than 
onefourth of the 10000 tickets were sold in advance and the 
former president agreed to waive his 50000 fee 
reagan who commanded vast audiences until he left office in 
january ago is now out of the limelight retired into the select 
club of former presidents that includes gerald ford richard nixon 
and jimmy carter 
occasionally the former president pops back into the news both 
president bush and vice president quayle visited him this week in 
southern california and his name came up more negatively in 
repeated references during the irancontra trial of former white 
house aide oliver north 
would one have expected a less reclusive retirement given 
reagans popularity during his twoterm tenure 
probably not agree president watchers they differ however on 
whether its the nature of the man or the nature of the system 
which is responsible 
its not unusual and not at all atypical historically for a 
former president to slip from sight said stephen hess a 
presidential scholar at the brookings institution an independent 
think tank 
the advent of a new president is accompanied by a flurry of 
media attention and public curiosity hess said and the former 
white house occupant generally just drifts away from power hess 
said 
reagan 78 works in his offices atop a los angeles skyscraper 
say his aides he writes speeches on such favorite topics as the 
need for a lineitem veto a balanced budget amendment and an end 
to the twoterm limit for presidents he has joined the board of 
the conservative magazine national review and also is planning to 
write his memoirs 
reagan has been virtually mum on the presidency of his 
successor and he is rarely mentioned in washington 
one way for former presidents to step back into the limelight is 
to take a shot at their predecessor thus jimmy carter made the 
news in 1981 when he criticized reagans budget proposal for 
placing too much emphasis on defense spending and not enough on 
domestic programs 
but most expresidents are obliging and they stay out of the 
hair of the current occupant of 1600 pennsylvania avenue said 
benjamin ginsberg a professor of government at cornell university 
bush also has been careful to avoid criticism of his 
predecessor last month white house chief of staff john sununu 
admonished aides to refrain from unfavorable comparisons of reagan 
and bush 
some former presidents have made a comeback several years later 
returning to vogue once a historical perspective of their 
presidency has been established such was the case with harry 
truman who left office in 1953 an unpopular leader but was seen in 
a far more favorable light in the 1960s and until he died in 1972 
presidents who cannot bear the obscurity of retirement are rare 
theodore roosevelt didnt want to be an expresident so he ran 
against fellow republican william howard taft in 1912 his run 
split the republican vote and gave democrat woodrow wilson the 
white house 
reagan is not about to upstage bush said tom korologos a 
lobbyist and reagan friend who once served the nixon and ford 
administrations as a legislative aide reagan did more for bush 
than any other president has done for his vp and now he knows its 
time to get out of the picture he said 
ginsberg and several other scholars and consultants believe bush 
aides are particularly anxious that reagan maintain a low profile 
for the time being bush lived in reagans shadow for eight 
years now he needs to establish himself as an independent and 
distance himself in some ways ginsberg said 
bush himself doesnt mention his predecessor very often as he 
seeks to move subtly away from some of the domestic and foreign 
policies known as the reagan legacy 
for example in reaching a compromise agreement with congress on 
aid to the nicaraguan contras bush effectively killed future 
military aid to the rebels a cause dear to reagans heart 
its a mark of reagans respect for bush that he has bitten 
his lip and avoided statements even on the things he felt so 
passionately about like the contras said stuart eizenstat who 
served as carters domestic policy adviser and is now a political 
consultant

here is an outline of the structure of the soviet 
communist party and government 
party structure 
the communist party holds political power in the soviet union 
but president mikhail s gorbachev has proposed changes that allow 
some contested elections to form a legislature that may exercise 
significant political power 
the communist partys power is centered in the politburo and the 
secretariat of the partys central committee 
the communist party congress which has 5000 elected members 
is supposed to be the partys supreme organ and ordinarily meets 
every five years the congress elects the central committee made 
up of 250 to 300 of the countrys top leaders it now has 251 
members 
the central committee normally meets about twice a year to 
approve policies and formally elects the members of the politburo 
and the secretariat the two highest party bodies 
since march 11 1985 gorbachev been general secretary of the 
communist party head of the secretariat and leading member of the 
politburo since oct 1 1988 gorbachev also has been the nations 
president holding top party and government jobs 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the secretariat 
this communist party body is responsible for running social and 
economic spheres as well as party personnel and ideology and 
wields tremendous power over implementation of policy politburo 
membership and a seat on the secretariat traditionally have been 
considered necessary to gain the top party job there are now 10 
secretaries including gorbachev 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the politburo 
gorbachev runs meetings of the politburo the partys most 
powerful body it now has 12 full members and eight candidate or 
nonvoting members the politburo normally meets every week 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
government structure 
the supreme soviet 
the 1500 members are elected from a single slate of approved 
candidates and theoretically make up the top government body in the 
soviet union but it has traditionally met only twice a year to 
ratify policy set by the communist party 
under a reform pushed through by gorbachev the supreme soviet 
will become a smaller body with about 500 members that meets 
several months a year gorbachev says he wants it to be more 
active handling operational questions the party apparatus has 
assumed over the years and leaving the party to decide policy 
questions but the supreme soviet has not met under the new format 
and the extent of its powers is uncertain 
the presidium of the supreme soviet 
the presidium which has 37 members is the collective 
presidency that gorbachev leads as chairman presidents of each of 
the 15 soviet republics are members the presidium has the power to 
issue government decrees when the supreme soviet or parliament is 
not in session but the presence of politburo and regional party 
leaders in its membership ensures its actions have prior toplevel 
approval

ostracized by the state department confined 
to the city limits afghanistans top diplomat in washington leads 
a frustrating existence 
miagol the first last and only name of afghanistans charge 
daffaires is hoping the recent pullout of 115000 soviet troops 
from his country will ease some of the isolation imposed on him by 
the united states but he is also realistic 
the sovieteducated economist invited secretary of state james 
a baker iii to his embassys reception thursday evening marking 
the 11th anniversary of the revolution that brought to power a 
marxistoriented government and resulted in the 1979 soviet 
invasion 
they said he couldnt come unfortunately miagol said with 
a skeptical laugh 
very few americans attended the reception which drew mostly 
diplomats from soviet bloc and other communist and socialist 
countries 
for a man who has to ask permission every time he wants to leave 
the city and is usually turned down miagol was remarkably 
cheerful at an interview in the resplendent redbrick mansion which 
doubles as residence and embassy 
physically our life is good he said but morale is 
difficult 
miagol one of 15 children does not know how old he is but 
estimates his age at about 40 my mother said there was snow on 
the ground but she didnt know in what year he said 
miagol arrived here 10 months ago with his russian wife and two 
children when he asked to travel to new york by car to attend the 
general assembly meetings of the un last fall he was told to go 
by plane 
when he asked permission to drive to the soviet embassys 
recreation compound outside washington he was denied they said 
it was too far but people from other socialist embassies also have 
25mile limit and they are allowed to go miagol said 
the united states and other countries impose 25mile travel 
limits on diplomats from countries deemed unfriendly 
this makes me nervous miagol said he spends his days 
reading messages received by telex from kabul dealing with 
administrative matters relating to his threeman embassy and 
keeping in touch with the extensive community of afghan exiles in 
washington 
his only contact with the state department is through richard 
gookin head of the protocol department whom he sees about twice a 
month i give him my opinions miagol said 
gookin listens politely hes a very nice man and conveys 
miagols views to state department experts but gookin refused to 
accept a written message from afghanistans leader najibullah 
congratulating george bush on his inauguration as president and 
expressing his hopes for improved relations miagol said 
they told me to put the envelope in a window for letters at 
the state department he said miagol said he used the same window 
to deliver a second message several weeks ago asking the united 
states to stop arming the mujahedeen rebels 
the rebels backed by the united states and pakistan fought the 
soviet occupation for nine years and are now locked in a civil war 
with najibullahs sovietbacked government 
the united states continues to view najibullah as a hardline 
marxist and fails to see that he is gaining acceptance by afghans 
as the only viable choice for leading the warwracked country 
miagol said 
they must learn from the mistakes of the soviets who didnt 
understand the afghan people miagol said 
neither the soviets nor the americans understand that afghans 
cannot embrace marxism he said it is not right with our 
culture with our religion said the sovieteducated moslem 
the united states withheld recognition from afghanistans 
government after the soviets invaded contending it was not elected 
democratically and does not represent the afghan people however 
the us embassy continued to function in kabul serving as a 
listening post in the sovietrun country 
the united states recognizes many governments that are not 
democratic that are fascist dictatorships miagol said at least 
najibullah was elected to office maybe not like american 
elections but in accordance with afghanistans constitution he 
said 
once the soviets were considered the bad guys in afghanistan 
and the americans were the good guys miagol said now the soviet 
tanks and troops have left and they are sending wheat flour and 
oil while the americans send missiles to the mujahedeen 
if the us continues this afghanistan will of course be 
prosoviet miagol said

the 1990 budget compromise worked out between 
the bush administration and congress earlier this month has eased 
some of the pressure for cutting farm subsidies but the turmoil is 
far from over 
congress still has a way to go before settling on a spending 
package for the fiscal year that will begin oct 1 and agriculture 
department budget experts say farm programs still are expected to 
be pared 
the compromise reached two weeks ago calls for 24 billion to 
be whittled from agriculture functions that are covered in the 
federal budget says robert e sherman deputy director of usdas 
budget office 
initially he said thursday in an interview the reagan and bush 
budget proposals were identical calling for a 29 billion cut in 
fiscal 1990 for agriculturerelated programs 
the major target in the original reaganbush budget proposals 
was the package of farm programs operated by the departments 
commodity credit corp a variety of price and income support 
mechanisms that soared to record spending levels during the 1980s 
the ccc cuts alone would total 19 billion to help bush show 
less of a deficit on paper part of that is to be accomplished 
administratively by paying about 800 million in advance 
deficiency payments to farmers early so they show up on this 
years budget rather than in the 1990 budget 
bush announced the early payments on april 18 pointing out that 
the move would provide some extra money to farmers as they head 
for the fields this spring 
although bush did not mention that the move also would help 
reduce his 1990 budget deficit figure the early payments had long 
been planned in both the initial bush and reagan budget proposals 
as a way to save money next fiscal year 
but that still left 11 billion to be cut from the ccc 
operations if the 1990 reduction goal of 19 billion for ccc was 
to be met 
one of the simplist ways to cut ccc some more would be a further 
reduction in crop target prices used to compute payments to 
farmers however that would have required legislation by congress 
to give usda authority to tinker with the payment formula 
sherman said the midapril agreement between the administration 
and congress calls for a ccc reduction next year of 600 million 
or little more than half the 11 billion remaining to be cut but 
a solution was found 
as it turned out 500 million in savings for 1990 would 
come from another change that will require legislation this 
involves the financing of the farm credit administration and would 
be used to offset further reductions in ccc costs 
for many years the fca enjoyed independent status as a federal 
agency and its annual spending was off budget and not counted 
in the governments overall balance sheet of receipts and outlays 
but after the farm credit problems of the 1980s forced congress 
to crack down on the huge system of federal land banks production 
credit associations and other institutions overseen by fca the 
agencys budget has been part of the regular process 
sherman said that although fca is not part of the agriculture 
department it is part of the agriculture function used in 
budget planning thus it was agreed during the compromise 
deliberations to move fca once again off budget and thereby 
save 500 million 
so with 800 million shuffled from one year to another and 500 
million moved off budget that leaves 600 million in cuts for next 
years ccc programs still to be made to reach the 19 billion in 
cuts for next year exactly how remains to be settled 
additionally sherman said the compromise calls for releasing 
500 million from a food stamp account held y the federal reserve 
a fund that has been building up since food stamps were initiated 
in the early 1960s 
the money accumulated because some stamps are lost destroyed 
forgotten or otherwise not used to buy groceries they were never 
redeemed although the government still has cash on hand just in 
case 
by releasing the food stamp account the government will have 
use of the money and the 1990 budget can be trimmed by a further 
500 million making a total savings of 24 billion claimed by 
the negotiators 
some have complained that the budget cutters may target their 
work too much on farm programs but bush said on april 18 that 
while agriculture has taken a hit so has a wide array of 
programs across the board and i think what weve done here is 
fair 
others have said usda farm programs could stand even further 
pruning pointing out that spending on those programs is still high 
although there have been sharp reductions in recent years 
in 1984 for example ccc spending on commodity programs 
including feed grains wheat rice cotton tobacco dairy 
soybeans honey and wool was about 732 billion in 1985 costs 
jumped to 177 billion and then rose to a record 258 billion in 
1986 
commodity program spending dropped to 224 billion in 1987 and 
since has declined to an estimated 138 billion this year

the outlaw snow white has disappeared and the 
copyright lawsuits have been shelved but the real impact of the 
61st academy awards has not diminished in the month since the 
curtain fell on the glitzy ceremony 
rain man winner of five major trophies including best 
picture has enjoyed a recordbreaking postoscar surge and a 
number of lesser victors have profited handsomely from their awards 
rain man the reigning domestic boxoffice champion with 
revenues of 156 million is now mgmunited artists 
highestgrossing film ever and is expected to be its biggest 
international hit too 
meanwhile best foreign film winner pelle the conqueror is 
selling tickets at a brisk pace across the country and sales for 
best original song let the river run from working girl have 
skyrocketed a fish called wanda which won an oscar for best 
supporting actor is no 1 on the home videorental charts 
most postoscar publicity focused on the oscar telecasts 
opening production number in which an unauthorized snow white 
impersonator presented material so strange disney promptly sued for 
copyright infringement 
in addition a group of 17 producers actors directors and 
writers complained to the academy that the show with all its hype 
and glitz was an embarrassment to both the academy and the 
entire motion picture industry the note dated two days after 
the march 29 show was sent to academy of motion picture arts and 
sciences president richard kahn and the academys board of 
governors 
it is neither fitting nor acceptable that the best work in 
motion pictures be acknowledged in such a demeaning fashion said 
the letter signed by julie andrews stanley donen blake edwards 
sidney lumet paul newman gregory peck billy wilder and others 
but the performance by rain man has transcended the flap 
over the telecast 
rain man has taken in 127 million internationally and the 
story of a scheming car salesman learning to love his autistic 
brother will likely surpass all of united artists rocky 
sequels and james bond features in foreign receipts 
a year ago when we planned the release of this picture we 
felt with the cast and the director and the story structure that 
we had a major chance for academy nominations and awards said 
jack gordon president of mgm international 
so we planned the foreign release so that we would be breaking 
on the screens around the world at the time the nominations were 
announced and the awards were given so the strategy worked 
perfectly and the picture has just bombarded the marketplace 
rain man is now playing in more than 50 countries gordon 
said in 6 weeks of release in japan rain man has grossed in 
excess of 25 million the movies oscar triumph it also won best 
actor for dustin hoffman best director for barry levinson and best 
original screenplay for ron bass and barry morrow has boosted 
many of the films related performers 
valeria golino the movies costar now is inundated with 
scripts and has just completed the coming feature torrents of 
spring 
for other movies that might have faded without any oscar hype 
the academy awards have given them a fresh jolt of momentum 
upon winning the academy award weve found that a lot more 
people are interested in pelle and in the films star max von 
sydow said adam rogers national sales manager for pelle the 
conqueror distributor miramax rogers said pelle with 19 
million in the bank to date is now playing in such cities as 
winsted conn fargo nd and orem utah not bad for a 2hour 
film about swedish immigrants working on a turnofthecentury farm 
and speaking not one word of english

five congressmen put a trio of leading judges 
on notice the pay raise so vigorously sought by federal judges may 
well depend on denying it to senior judges who do no judicial work 
pay raises should be reserved for those who work said rep 
robert kastenmeier dwis chairman of the house courts 
subcommittee 
his message was echoed by four republican and democratic 
colleagues at a hearing thursday they were taken aback by 
testimony from the judicial leaders who are seeking a 30 percent 
pay raise for all federal judges 
us circuit judge frank coffin depicted a federal bench 
demoralized over the loss of a 51 percent pay raise earlier this 
year but he displayed no willingness to compromise in response to 
complaints over pay that members of congress hear when they go home 
to the voters 
i have never seen so many judges at all levels in all courts 
and in all parts of the country so disheartened as i do today 
coffin said ours is a lunar landscape with all of the stark and 
ominous silhouettes that the term implies 
he called feb 7 the day congress defeated the pay raise 
black tuesday 
but rep howard coble rnc replied many voters in my 
district do not regard it as black tuesday and im one of them 
rep james sensenbrenner rwis said one catalyst for that 
defeat was the front page story in most of the nations newspapers 
that former chief justice warren burger and other senior judges 
who do no judicial work would get the raise 
he said he went to four town meetings in his district at that 
time and i heard about that 50 times if i heard about it once 
then he offered the three judges what he called a little bit 
of friendly advice the senior judge situation must be resolved if 
you want a pay raise and ive not seen much in the way of 
constructive suggestions from you 
rep george sangmeister dill said he too was peppered with 
objections at town meetings after the news stories 
i was faced with the burger question sangmeister said 
and i was not able to defend that 
earlier this year the associated press reported previously 
unpublished federal figures from 1987 that showed that 20 percent 
of 306 senior federal judges did no judicial work these include 
burger who since he stepped down has spent his time chairing the 
celebration of the bicentennials of the constitution and bill of 
rights 
an associated press survey of all senior judges in february and 
march of this year found that 17 percent of 277 senior judges did 
no judicial work the ap survey credited judges for dormant cases 
still on their dockets which the earlier government data had not 
coffin and his colleagues told the subcommittee it would be 
unfair to deprive nonworking senior judges of pay raises by as 
coffin put it suddenly changing the rules after a lifetime he 
said only three of the nonworking seniors were under age 70 16 
were in their 70s 20 in their 80s two in their 90s and two in 
their 100s 
kastenmeier asked whether these nonworking senior judges 
shouldnt go into full retirement 
kastenmeier and the subcommittees ranking republican rep 
carlos moorhead of california introduced a bill earlier this month 
to require that senior judges carry a 25 percent workload to 
qualify for raises those senior judges who did less work would get 
their last full salary and costofliving increases but no raises 
above that 
at the hearing kastenmeier announced that he and moorhead had 
agreed to the judges request to introduce in congress a 30 percent 
pay raise and annual costofliving increases for judges 
president bush has proposed a 25 percent pay raise for judges a 
51 percent raise tied to equal increases for congress and top 
executive branch officials died earlier this year in the face of 
public uproar 
currently judges who reach 65 with 15 years experience can 
resign and keep for life the full salary on their last day of work 
they get no costofliving increases but are allowed to resume the 
private practice of law currently 14 have done this 
alternatively at that age and experience federal judges may 
opt for senior status and do as much or as little work as they 
like these senior judges still pick up all the pay raises given to 
active judges and like active judges they cant have private law 
practices the number of judges in this category hovers near 300 
there are about 700 active judges

the kremlin will publish longpromised figures 
on the soviet defense and space budgets by the end of the year 
says roald sagdeyev a leading russian rocket scientist who is 
prominent in the reform movement 
soviet military spending is being cut 15 percent this year far 
short of the 142 percent cut announced by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev in january said sagdeyev who is a member of the supreme 
soviet or parliament 
defense spending will go down another 7 percent in 1990 and the 
cuts will reach 142 percent the following year he said although 
the total amount of the cuts remained unclear 
we have promised that the absolute figure would be given in 
the fall sagdeyev told a group of reporters thursday sagdeyev 
declined to specify how he knew that military spending figures 
would be disclosed by year end but he is thought to be part of a 
group of scientists and intellectuals who advise gorbachev on 
foreign policy 
sagdeyev was also elected in balloting march 26 to represent the 
soviet academy of sciences in the newly created congress of 
peoples deputies which will have the twin functions of electing a 
soviet president almost certainly voting gorbachev a new 
fiveyear term and selecting a new smaller parliament 
the issue of soviet military spending is murky for years 
western analysts have complained that figures for soviet defense 
spending were distorted because prices are set by the state and 
the cost of expensive armaments could be vastly underestimated in 
official statistics 
an indefinite delay in implementing price deregulation has led 
western analysts to say that even more complete disclosure of 
soviet military spending cannot be accurate since soviet leaders 
themselves do not know the true cost of weapons 
a study released last weekend by the central intelligence agency 
and the pentagons defense intelligence agency said that soviet 
military spending had risen by 3 percent in 1988 
the cia found strong evidence however that last year 
gorbachev took several actions that evidently were intended to 
lay the groundwork for future military cuts 
furthermore the cia concluded the 142 percent cut in military 
spending announced by gorbachev last january probably will lead to 
much larger cuts than the 500000 troop reduction he announced at 
the united nations last december 
sagdeyevs description of the 142 percent defense cuts as 
gradual suggested that gorbachev wants to make them as part of arms 
control agreements with the united states 
sagdeyev in a wideranging discussion also released the text 
of a hitherto undisclosed resolution he said was passed by the 
academy of sciences last week describing the deaths of 20 
demonstrators in soviet georgia as a criminal act that 
endangered to kremlin reforms 
sagdeyev was one of three members of the soviet academy along 
with human rights activist andrei d sakharov and russian historian 
dmitri s likhachev appointed to a parliamentary investigating 
panel 
the tragic events in tbilisi capital of soviet georgia 
confirm the sad fact that perestroika is in danger said the 
resolution using the russian name for gorbachevs reforms 
special uniformed troops under the soviet interior ministry or 
mvd were responsible for using poisonous chemicals shovels and 
clubs to suppress the demonstrations in tbilisi on april 9 killing 
20 people the statement said 
this unusually cruel act has evoked the deep indignation and 
outrage of our entire society said the resolution which 
sagdeyev said was passed at a meeting of the entire academy of 
sciences april 21

nasa designing systems in which 
three or four seconds is forever has developed a 
graphicsoriented computer program to help flight controllers react 
to launch emergencies 
atlantis with five astronauts aboard was scheduled to launch 
at midafternoon today 
in the seconds and minutes after liftoff nasa is to make its 
most extensive use of a flight control system which highlights 
potential hazards with colorful displays 
past mission managers had to sort through mindnumbing columns 
of data on blackandwhite monitors that date back to the gemini 
era of the 1960s 
the new system inaugurated at mission control after the 1986 
challenger disaster gives nasa controllers three or four more 
seconds to order a shuttle into an emergency landing in case of a 
sudden failure after liftoff 
three to four seconds in a lot of different failure modes is 
forever says senior nasa controller john f muratore 
from typewriterstyle keyboards controllers can now punch up 
graphics that trace the shuttle trajectory duplicate cockpit 
instrument displays and even mimic the horizon as the astronauts 
see it from inside their rising space ship 
the national aeronautics and space administration is designing 
artificial intelligence programs to help plug its brain drain 
as thousands of experienced apollo era employees retire the 
generic name for such programs is expert systems 
nasa has begun implementing its expert system at the mission 
control center in houston as part of a multimilliondollar 
improvement program scheduled for completion in 1991 muratore is 
in charge of developing the system 
nasa hopes expert systems can capture the knowledge of veteran 
employees to help younger workers do various jobs muratore 
predicted his system will cut months off the minimum time of two 
years that controllers must spend in training before being assigned 
to a flight 
they have to make a mental picture of whats going on with the 
shuttle muratore explained we took some senior controllers 
and learned how they built their mental models then programmed the 
computer to do that for them 
when shuttles returned to flight in september nasa installed 
the expert system to help engineers pinpoint trouble in the 
orbiters three main engines it ran in tandem with the traditional 
system 
we were prepared to take actions based on the new program 
muratore said i dont know of any other case where somebody has 
built an expert system and then put life and property on the line 
that way 
since then muratore said the system has become a primary 
tool for four controllers who monitor communications engines 
mechanical systems and guidance and navigation 
with the system nasa is phasing out controllers decipher 
multiple pages of data displayed on their computer screens all 
while monitoring dozens of blinking console lights each of which 
can signal two or more safe or unsafe conditions 
in the old system flight information is stored in two computers 
and displayed on every controllers console by comparison 
muratores system divides the data among individual consoles 
shaving precious seconds off the processing

house banking committee members who want 
savings and loan owners to put up more of their own money when they 
make loans will be fighting to preserve a legislative victory when 
they resume work next week on president bushs bailout proposal 
after hours of debate the panel voted 3615 thursday to require 
sampl owners by january 1995 to risk 3 of tangible or real 
money capital for every 100 they lend 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady praised the action in a 
statement released after the vote even though the deadline is 3 
years later than the june 1991 date sought by the administration 
requiring sampls to put their own capital at risk ahead of the 
taxpayers money is the only way to prevent in the future the 
unsound business practices that contributed to the current 
crisis brady said 
bush is proposing to spend at least 157 billion over 10 years 
the bulk of it from taxpayers to close or merge failed sampls he 
also wants to restructure the regulatory system spend 50 million 
a year to investigate and prosecute fraud in sampls and boost capital 
requirements 
assistant treasury secretary david mullins said the panels 
adoption of a 3 percent layer of protection between sampl loans that 
could go sour and federal insurance funds was more important than 
the timetable for achieving it 
however consumer groups are worried about a subsequent 
amendment sponsored by rep bill mccollum rfla that would 
permit thrift institutions to continue to risk depositors funds in 
subsidiaries involved in highrisk investments such as junk bonds 
and commercial real estate 
its a pretty critical loophole said peggy miller a 
lobbyist for the consumer federation of america it erodes what 
was just passed 
the administration had proposed that institutions raise extra 
capital to back those subsidiaries and the committee chairman rep 
henry b gonzalez dtexas had attempted to compromise by giving 
institutions five years to come up with the money 
however the committee voted 2624 to adopt mccollums measure 
he argued that without it many institutions now operating safely 
and profitably with subsidiaries would not be able to raise the 
extra capital 
another amendment sponsored by rep barney frank dmass 
would permit federal regulators to count mortgage servicing 
contracts as capital such contracts which pay institutions to 
collect monthly payments from homeowners on behalf of investors who 
own the mortgages provide a steady source of income and can be 
sold if an institution is closed 
the overall capital measure has a series of interim targets 
beginning june 1 1990 when the tangible capital standard would 
become 15 percent it would move to 2 percent in january 1992 
225 percent in january 1993 and 2625 percent in january 1994 
before reaching the full 3 percent a year later 
the house committees standard is substantially stricter than 
the bill passed last week by the senate which would require 15 
percent tangible capital by june 1991 
current law provides for a 3 percent standard but contains many 
accounting loopholes that count intangible assets such as 
goodwill as capital 
at the end of last year more than a third of the solvent sampls 
60 billion in listed capital was composed of goodwill which 
represents the value an institutions customer loyalty and name 
recognition critics argue that goodwill evaporates when an 
institution fails and thus provides no protection to government 
deposit insurance funds 
according to the treasury department about twothirds of the 
nations 3000 sampls can meet the 3 percent tangible standard some 
of those that do not should be able to raise the money but about 
245 may have to seek merger partners it said 
institutions failing to meet the standard would be subject to 
growth restrictions and closer regulatory supervision 
rep floyd flake dny said he intends to offer an amendment 
monday that would provide more favorable treatment of goodwill he 
and others including the powerful chairman of the house rules 
committee rep claude pepper dfla argue that it is unfair to 
wipe out the goodwill because during the early 1980s regulators 
permitted the accounting break to otherwise healthy institutions in 
exchange for taking over ailing thrifts

researchers for a michigan pharmaceutical 
company say the antibaldness drug minoxidil appears to stimulate 
the genes that make hair grow 
minoxidil not only affects growing cells but affects cells 
that make hairshaft protein vincent groppi jr a research with 
the upjohn co of kalamazoo mich said wednesday minoxidil 
affects gene activity that affects the growth of the hair shaft 
knowledge gained from study of minoxidils effects on genes 
could have implications for research into genetically based 
diseases such as sicklecell anemia said allen buhl also an 
upjohn researcher 
marketed by upjohn under the tradename rogaine minoxidil was 
originally developed for use internally to control blood pressure 
the food and drug administration last year approved the drug for 
use externally as a treatment for baldness 
although the drug is approved for sale scientists havent 
clearly understood why minoxidil promotes hair growth upjohn 
researchers had theorized that the drug improved the flow of blood 
to the hair roots thereby stimulating growth 
however the upjohn research released at the annual meeting of 
the society for investigational dermatology suggested the drug had 
a more basic effect on hair growth 
groppi said he believes minoxidils effect on the genes is 
particularly strong i cant think of a drug offhand that has 
such a potent effect on gene expression he said 
another scientist however was skeptical that the upjohn 
finding represented a significant advance 
it could well be that it does affect those genes but there 
are very many stimulants on the cells that control genes said 
robert weinberg biology professor at the massachusetts institute 
of technology in cambridge mass that does not set minoxidil 
apart 
although the drug may affect hair follicles there is no reason 
to believe that the drug would have similar effects on other types 
of cells weinberg said 
weinberg said the research would have been more convincing had 
it identified a specific gene or group of genes affected by the 
drug upjohn spokeswoman kaye bennett said the researchers hadnt 
identified a specific gene

a hearing on why a cargo door tore off a united 
airlines 747 killing nine passengers ended without conclusive 
evidence on the cause of the february accident southwest of hawaii 
the national transportation safety board listened for three days 
to a list of missteps by united airlines and the federal aviation 
administration and grilled aircraft designers from the boeing co 
but no culprit emerged 
the hearings here were extremely helpful lee dickinson 
chairman of the ntsb investigation said thursday we gained a 
lot of good information 
he declined to make any conclusions but said the information 
will be analyzed for several months before the ntsb issues a final 
report identifying the probable cause of the accident dickinson 
said 
the cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off united flight 
811 as the boeing 747 was climbing to 23000 feet on feb 24 nine 
passengers were sucked out of the plane over the pacific ocean 85 
miles southwest of honolulu as the plane headed for australia via 
new zealand 
speculation has focused on a possible malfunction in the locking 
mechanism of the cargo door which remains on the bottom of the 
pacific ocean the ntsb has not decided whether to retrieve the 
door 
on thursday united airlines officials said they failed to fully 
inspect a cargo door after electrical repairs were made two months 
before the accident 
a united executive said mechanics made a partial inspection of 
the cargo door after it was repaired dec 23 in chicago that was a 
coincidence because the company has testified it was unaware it 
was under federal regulations to do a full inspection of the doors 
i am convinced the check verified that the door was 
working said robert doll united vice president for technical 
services 
he added however that the inspection was not as thorough as 
the federal aviation administration required 
in other testimony an faa inspector who oversees uniteds 
31plane 747 fleet said he was not aware of the problems with the 
800pound cargo door 
the inspector george batiza also said the faa had failed to 
ensure that united complied with a federal rule that took effect 
july 1 requiring airlines to inspect cargo doors after they were 
manually operated because of electrical problems 
batiza testified that he had not found any deficiencies in 
uniteds maintenance program recently even though united officials 
have acknowledged they were unaware of the faa rule on cargo door 
inspections and were not in compliance for about nine months

house speaker jim wright sent an 8000 check 
this week to pay the costs of chartering a campaign airplane four 
years ago from an associate of the owner of a dallas savings and 
loan institution 
wright who on thursday lost his bid to make an early 
presentation of his case before the house ethics committee said 
the failure to pay the bill earlier was an oversight 
in another matter thursday the house ethics committee 
rescheduled the testimony of five texans involved in a gas drilling 
venture that yielded huge profits to wright the five were 
threatened with a contempt citation if they fail to show up for a 
second time 
wrights office this week filed a correction to his campaign 
financial report for 1985 to disclose the reimbursement aide phil 
duncan said he didnt ask the owner of the plane ken hood why he 
suddenly called this week for the money 
wrights office was notified of the unpaid bill on tuesday after 
hood learned that the wall street journal was inquiring about the 
matter according to knowledgeable sources 
according to a democratic source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity hood was an associate of thomas gaubert gaubert owner 
of a dallas savings and loan institution arranged the charter for 
wrights campaign the source said 
the trip june 30 to july 2 1985 included wright duncan and 
others the tour of seven texas cities was in preparation for a 
november fundraiser wrights office said 
the ethics committee has decided against pursuing charges that 
wright improperly lobbied federal sampl regulators to go easy on 
texas thrifts including gauberts but wrights involvement in sampl 
issues has figured in the panels determination of whether he 
improperly took gifts from people with a direct interest in 
legislation governing the industry 
on wrights request to make a personal appeal to the ethics 
panel its chairman hinted strongly for the first time thursday 
there will be no such opportunity until wright appears at a 
disciplinary hearing expected to come late next month 
no there has not been an agreement reached on a speedy 
hearing said the chairman rep julian dixon dcalif i assume 
he would appear at the disciplinary hearing 
at a twohour meeting thursday behind closed doors the panel 
heard an account from dixon and rep john t myers of indiana of 
their trip early this week to san antonio texas when they were 
stood up by the participants in the gas well venture 
the panel then ratified dixons ruling that a subpoena for the 
witnesses was valid and enforceable the chairman said the 
testimony is scheduled for next week 
without any question the committee lost round one but 
therell be more of this fight before its over said myers the 
panels senior republican 
the committee is seeking to wrap up loose ends in its 10month 
investigation of wright who has been formally charged with 69 
instances of violating house rules the charges allege that wright 
dtexas improperly accepted some 145000 in gifts from a fort 
worth business partner who had a direct interest in congressional 
legislation and that he used bulk sales of a book he wrote to 
circumvent house limits on outside earned income 
but before finishing its preliminary inquiry into charges 
against wright the panel wants to know whether a gas well that 
produced a financial bonanza to the speakers blind trust amounted 
to a gift from people with an interest in legislation 
part of the inquiry also will focus on whether wrights blind 
trust which the ethics committee approved when the trust was 
established in 1987 was truly insulated from wright 
mallightco an investment partnership of fort worth real estate 
developer george mallick and their wives turned a 9120 cash 
investment into a 340000 profit in one day last may boosting the 
value of the partnership just a month before wrights blind trust 
sold its interest 
the amount of money involved aroused the curiosity of the ethics 
panel and subpoenas were issued for san antonio financier morris 
jaffe his son md doug jaffe and three others involved in the 
transaction 
the five failed to show up tuesday for a scheduled interview at 
a san antonio hotel stanley brand their washington lawyer argued 
in a letter that the subpoenas were too broad violated his 
clients right to privacy and were irrelevant to the ethics panels 
inquiry 
the committee overruled brand and ordered the witnesses to come 
to washington for interviews on may 3 and 4 dixon said

leading lawmakers predict that a 117 
trillion budget for 1990 thrashed out in days of often contentious 
closeddoor meetings by the house budget committee will be 
approved by the house next week 
the panel approved the spending plan on a bipartisan 186 vote 
on thursday edging the budget deal completed two weeks ago between 
president bush and congressional leaders closer to enactment 
the proposal claims a deficit of 994 billion just within the 
100 billion ceiling required by the grammrudman balanced budget 
law it would hold defense spending below the rate of inflation and 
give big boosts to education science and health programs while 
cutting agriculture environment and energy spending 
as they finished their work on the document committee members 
echoed remarks made frequently in recent days about the direction 
this years budget seems to be headed 
i assume it will pass because there is no alternative said 
rep martin olav sabo dminn who voted against the proposal in 
committee 
rep harold rogers rky who also opposed the plan said he 
believed that the deficit reduction it claimed was largely phony 
but that the proposal would be approved anyway 
with the head of steam its got from the budget summit and 
from the democratic and republican leadership it will be hard to 
overcome he said 
house majority leader thomas s foley dwash who is on the 
committee also predicted the measure would clear the chamber 
saying he expected little trouble from conservatives over the 
defense expenditures it permits 
do you think people will look at the defense money in this 
bill with its being blessed by bush and cheney and say its not 
enough foley said 
defense secretary dick cheney has said he believes the cuts in 
the defense budget will be difficult but are manageable 
because the budget pact between bush and congressional leaders 
set overall spending limits for defense domestic programs and 
foreign aid those figures are identical in the house and senate 
versions of the budget the main differences between the two 
chambers is in how they distribute domestic funds 
energy programs would get 38 billion in the house plan and 
42 billion in the senate health spending would reach 562 
billion under the house proposal and 557 billion under the 
senate education would get 391 billion under the house budget 
and 387 billion under the senate 
the house budget writers set aside enough money to pay for a 
democratic initiative on children with 18 billion for child care 
and more money for head start an increase to 19 billion for aids 
research and treatment fullinflation increases in programs for 
the poor and a 36 percent costofliving raise for military and 
civilian federal workers 
before holding a brief public meeting at which they approved the 
spending plan the budget committee met behind closed doors this 
week arguing over spending priorities and working out a bipartisan 
deal 
according to meeting participants who asked to not be 
identified those sessions resulted in money being transferred to 
space and science programs and to veterans programs from other 
domestic initiatives 
there were also attempts by liberals to slash the defense budget 
and distribute the money to domestic programs such as medicare 
aids research lowincome programs veterans health and antidrug 
efforts 
the senate budget committee passed its version of the budget on 
april 19 that chamber also expects to complete work next week on 
its spending blueprint

a roman catholic priest who is defying orders 
from his jesuit superior in the united states to leave a group that 
provides aid to rural nicaraguans has appealed his case to the 
vatican 
the rev bill callahan codirector of the quixote center in mt 
rainier md held a news conference thursday to declare his 
defiance callahan a jesuit for 40 of his 57 years is also under 
orders to dissociate himself from a progressive catholic group and 
one that supports the ordination of women as priests 
callahans order for its part refused to make the controversy 
any more public than it already was 
dealings between a religious and his superior are very much 
a confidential matter and superiors find themselves in the 
position of having to protect that confidentiality the rev paul 
kenney press officer of the new england province of the society of 
jesus said by telephone from boston 
the rev robert e manning jesuit provincial in boston has 
twice ordered callahan on pain of dismissal from the society to 
leave the center and join a jesuit community in boston within 15 
days 
callahan appealed the order to the rev peter kolvenbach jesuit 
general in rome saying to leave at this time would be a serious 
betrayal of my responsibility toward the people of nicaragua 
callahan said manningss orders would make it impossible for him 
to carry on the work of quest for peace an organization which he 
coordinates from the quixote centers headquarters 
in his letter to kolvenbach he said quest for peace was formed 
to match us military aid to the counterrevolutionaries 
attacking nicaragua with an equivalent value in donated 
humanitarian aid for the people of nicaragua 
he said he had coordinated campaigns which raised 227 million 
over a threeyear period in donated aid and contributed services 
earlier manning had told callahan that in order to remain a 
member of the society he must dissociate himself from catholics 
speak out an organization of progressive catholics and 
priests for equality which favors the ordination of women as 
priests 
in a letter on april 3 after callahan said he was willing to 
work toward an acceptable compromise to alleviate the 
situation manning told callahan in fact this is not a 
question of compromise it is to repeat a matter of obedience 
callahan said the second deadline for him to report in boston 
was april 2 he said he had heard nothing further about his 
dismissal 
manning also wrote to callahan that he must make no public 
statements critical of the church or its leadership without my 
prior knowledge and consent and not add any projects to the 
mission i have given you without my prior consent

a mudslide caused by 30 hours of 
torrential rain killed nine gold miners and left seven others 
seriously injured in northwestern brazil police said 
the mining accident occurred late tuesday in the jungle 
municipality of mucajai 4000 miles northwest of rio federal 
police capt maya de guerra said in a telephone interview from boa 
vista capital of the amazon state of roriama 
no one had heard that the 50foot deep hole mine had caved 
in until one of the miners made his way 279 miles through the 
jungle and arrived in boa vista late thursday de guerra said 
a group of miners were apparently inside the hole when a wall 
of mud fell in on them and swallowed them alive de guerra said 
seven of the men managed to make it out alive but they were badly 
hurt 
de guerra said rescue teams made up of state and civil police 
were sent to the site but poor weather and the rugged terrain had 
delayed their arrival 
an estimated 1 million prospectors have invaded brazils vast 
amazon rain forests after rich deposits of alluvial gold were 
discovered in 1979 
since then thousands of people mostly unskilled have been 
lured to mine sites in the amazon where they dig with their hands 
and carry bags of mud on their backs in search of gold 
in 1986 a similar mudslide killed 12 prospectors and hurt 20 
others at the hole gold mine in the northern state of para 
government officials said last year that miners recovered about 
70 tons of gold from the wilderness worth an estimated 1 billion

the house ethics committee which agreed to 
rep newt gingrichs demand a year ago for an outside counsel to 
investigate speaker jim wright now is being asked to hire another 
independent lawyer to investigate gingrich 
four house democrats drafted a letter thursday to rep julian 
dixon dcalif chairman of the ethics panel calling for the 
appointment of an outside counsel to investigate the complaint rep 
bill alexander dark filed against the house republican whip 
earlier this month 
reps barney frank of massachusetts larry smith of florida pat 
schroeder of colorado and albert bustamante of texas sent copies of 
the letter to their house democratic colleagues seeking support for 
their request to dixon 
there is mounting evidence that congressman gingrich may have 
violated an assortment of house rules and federal campaign finance 
laws over an extended period of time through financial and other 
dealings the four democrats said in the letter to their 
colleagues 
the letter to dixon said the democrats want to preserve the 
integrity of the committees consideration process from 
politicization and outside pressure and in that regard we believe 
the appointment of an impartial outside counsel is imperative 
alexanders complaint which was filed as the committee was 
nearing the end of its investigation of wright lists 10 apparent 
violations of house rules in the formation and operation of a 
limited partnership set up in 1984 to promote a book cowritten by 
gingrich the committee has not indicated whether it will launch a 
formal investigation of the compliant 
gingrich and his wife marianne gingrich released nearly 400 
pages of documents on tuesday detailing the financial and 
incorporation history of the partnership they denied any violation 
of house rules 
eighteen people and three corporations including many regular 
contributors to gingrichs political campaigns each invested 
5000 in the partnership which was controlled by mrs gingrich 
the general partner 
in return for promoting the book the partnership was to have 
received half the publishers profits but the publisher lost money 
and the investors ended up with a tax writeoff mrs gingrich was 
paid 11500 by the partnership and received a 2 percent ownership 
interest in the organization 
gingrich had no direct financial stake in the partnership 
although he did receive 1320 in expense reimbursements when he 
traveled to promote the book he and his wife also received 12018 
each in royalties from the publisher from sales of the book 
while democrats were drumming up support for their bid for an 
outside counsel gingrich was at the national press club outlining 
the message of democratic corruption and republican opportunity he 
used propel himself in the house gop leadership last month 
the jonesboro ga republican said the gop must build a 
caring humanitarian reform party that can offer institutional 
solutions to the problems of drugs crime and poverty that are 
plaguing the nations major cities 
every conservative in america must confront the reality that 
the great age of opposition conservatism is over he said 
goldwater and reagan won the argument and now the country wants 
us to govern we must come up with a wave of reforms of 
extraordinary scale

american women are more likely to need 
antipoverty assistance than men as they struggle to raise 
children on their own and cope with leaner times in old age a 
census bureau report shows 
more than one woman in five 205 percent received help from 
some major benefits program during a 32month study reported on by 
the bureau on thursday 
during the same period the public assistance programs aided 158 
percent of men in the nation somewhat less than one out of six 
john m mcneil of the bureaus housing and household economic 
statistics division said that the difference in need is largely the 
result of women raising children without a husband present and the 
preponderance of women in the older age groups 
when marriages break up women more often obtain custody of the 
children and those families more often lapse into poverty mcneil 
said in a telephone interview in addition a growing number of 
single women are raising families of their own he noted 
as of 1987 the bureau said 343 percent of families with a 
female householder fell below the poverty level by comparison 
125 percent of families with a male householder and no wife and 
only 60 percent of married couples fell below the poverty level 
the analysis showed that more than twothirds of people living 
in a femaleheaded household with no husband present throughout the 
study period received antipoverty benefits 671 percent 
the study found that 183 percent of all americans received 
benefits from at least one of six programs studied included were 
general assistance aid to families with dependent children 
supplemental security income medicaid federal food stamps and 
federal and state rent assistance 
benefits were more likely to go to minorities to the very young 
and to people who had not finished high school according to the 
report which covered the period from late 1983 to early 1986 
one of the more important findings was that the likelihood of 
receiving benefits was very closely tied to the number of months in 
which income fell below the poverty level mcneil said so in 
that sense the programs appear to be providing benefits to those 
who need them the most 
this was the first longterm look at recipients of benefits done 
by the bureau and thus no past rates were available for 
comparison mcneil said the study will be repeated in the future 
he said 
nearly half of black americans obtained help from one or more 
programs during the period at 485 percent the study said by 
comparison the rate was 342 percent for hispanics and 139 
percent for white americans 
blacks also were longerterm recipients of help averaging 112 
months of benefits during the study period hispanics averaged 74 
months of benefits while it was 26 months for white recipients 
overall women recipients averaged 44 months of benefits 
compared with 30 months for men 
by age people under age 18 were the leading group receiving 
benefits at 266 percent and the subgroup under age 6 managed a 
301 percent rate 
programs benefited 199 percent of people aged 18 to 24 while 
in the 25 to 44 group the rate was 147 percent for people aged 65 
and over the rate was 179 
benefits were most needed by innercity residents at 237 
percent the rate was 205 percent in rural areas and fell to only 
123 percent in the suburbs 
by region 207 percent of southerners received benefits 
followed by 180 percent in the west 168 percent in the northeast 
and 167 percent in the midwest 
the study was based on repeated interviews with 19900 
households across the country

a detroitarea teamsters official with two 
convictions for unionrelated offenses has been named an 
international vice president of the nations largest union raising 
questions about its pledge to improve its image 
the selection of george vitale by teamsters president william j 
mccarthy though not announced by the union was confirmed thursday 
by teamsters sources a teamsters spokesman did not return 
telephone calls seeking comment 
the selection comes in the wake of the settlement of a 
racketeering suit against the teamsters and a pledge by its leaders 
to back election reforms and refurbish the unions image 
mccarthy surely could have done better than to go out and 
appoint a guy who has been convicted of taking payoffs both from 
employers and stealing the union members money said ken paff of 
teamsters for a democratic union a dissident union group based in 
detroit 
vitale president of teamsters local 283 in wyandotte mich 
was convicted twice in the early 1970s for accepting an illegal 
payment from a teamsters employer and for illegal use of union 
funds in a plan to buy his wife a car he received fines and 
probation for both convictions but was allowed to keep his union 
job 
the prosecutor who handled the racketeering case raised the 
possibility that a courtappointed administrator agreed to as part 
of the settlement could review the vitale appointment 
the courtappointed administrator will have the authority to 
review the appointment and to discipline any teamster officials 
said assistant us attorney randy mastro there is no statute of 
limitations on the right to discipline 
the appointment of an administrator is expected to be made in 
the next two weeks that is one of three courtappointed monitoring 
positions agreed to as part of the settlement of the racketeering 
suit which alleged widespread organized crime influence on the 
teamsters 
critics within the union characterized the vitale appointment as 
a slap at former teamsters vice president robert holmes sr of 
detroit holmes resigned in january in return for being dropped as 
a defendant in the suit 
holmes opposed mccarthys election to succeed the late jackie 
presser as teamsters president vitale reportedly had a falling out 
with holmes in recent years 
mccarthy under teamsters bylaws can fill vacancies on the 
unions general executive board which consists of the president 
secretarytreasurer and 16 international vice presidents subject 
to board approval he has a solid majority on the board because of 
recent turnover and has two vacancies still to fill

two college seniors had no trouble finding 
volunteers for research on their thesis but some subjects were 
surprised to learn they couldnt discern between cheap and 
expensive domestic beers 
we figured that college students are experts on beer drinking 
and they would determine the difference in the five brands of 
domestic beer we tested said aristotle economon who shared the 
project with his brother andrew 
but statistically people couldnt tell the difference he 
said 
free beer fliers were posted around the university of 
houston campus and drew a predictable crowd and 265 students ended 
up volunteering for the project 
the sample was pared down to 191 students who said they drank 
five or more beers each week and each participant was given 
3ounce sample cups of five different brands of us beer to 
measure for body aftertaste sweetness bitterness and strength 
some people would say this is great i can buy cheap beer 
and get just as good a product he said but others wont accept 
it because people are very loyal to their brand of beer 
he would not reveal the brand names of beers tested but said 
they ranged in price from 160 to 320 a sixpack

after only 100 days its hard to tell if 
president bushs foreign policy is intentionally uninspiring or if 
he is simply taking his time coming to conclusions about americas 
role in the world 
he has pulled back from the polemics of his predecessor ronald 
reagan and in a few as yet inconclusive ways such as a toughening 
stand toward israel indicated that he just might adopt a foreign 
policy that is substantively different from the one he inherited 
on the other hand these changes are so slight it could turn out 
that bush has no bold initiatives in mind and that like president 
gerald r ford in the mid1970s he intends mostly to mark time in 
the foreign field 
an overseas crisis could intervene forcing bush to improvise a 
response that could lead to a dramatic shift in us policy the 
rise to power in moscow in 1985 of mikhail s gorbachev for 
instance impelled reagan to drop his denunciations of the soviet 
union as an evil empire the result was a series of negotiations 
that produced a lessening of tensions and the banning of us and 
soviet intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
so far international events have not conspired to draw bush 
into major decisions a political scandal in japan and growing west 
german distaste for nuclear weapons could produce severe strains 
but bush has given no sign of a shift in us support for japan or 
us determination to modernize lance missiles in europe 
bush has worked out a temporary deal with congress to supply the 
nicaraguan rebels with 498 million in nonmilitary aid and he has 
endorsed an israeli proposal for elections among palestinian arabs 
to implement selfrule on the west bank and in gaza 
both are stopgap measures they beg the question whether bush 
will pursue the reagan policy of trying to topple the marxist 
government in nicaragua or is willing to live with it and whether 
he will try to force israel and the arabs into a lasting agreement 
the contra aid package the product of a march 24 agreement 
between the administration and the democraticled congress is good 
only until the fall nicaragua could make enough political 
concessions by then to get uncle sam off its back and spare bush 
a difficult decision 
less likely is that israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
election plan will induce the palestinians and their supporters to 
adopt a gradual and peaceful approach to settling the west bank and 
gaza problem bush has already declared himself opposed to israeli 
occupation of sovereignty over the territories 
this could be a sign that he intends to pressure israel to yield 
control but there is no hint of a us peace plan of shuttle 
diplomacy by secretary of state james a baker iii or that bush 
will summon arab and israeli leaders to camp david as president 
jimmy carter did in 1978 to help squeeze out the peace treaty 
between israel and egypt a year later 
bush and baker evidently are committed to the proposition that 
direct negotiations between israel and palestinians offer the best 
hope for an agreement that would hold up highprofile us 
diplomacy is not part of the picture at this point 
in the important sphere of ussoviet relations gorbachevs 
troop and missile reduction initiatives are receiving a skeptical 
response but nato and the warsaw pact opened negotiations in 
vienna in march to trim tank and artillery units and baker 
probably will set a date for the resumption of ussoviet talks on 
longrange nuclear weapons when he goes to moscow may 11 
gorbachev has the implicit support of the us administration as 
he consolidates his powers 
this week for instance the state department described his 
purge of 74 central committee voting members and the promotion of 
several proteges as dramatic it expressed hope that whatever 
changes occur their effect is to strengthen and promote the reform 
process in the soviet union toward greater democratization and 
openness 
bush meanwhile is encouraging reform in poland with a series 
of moves that could ease the soviet allys 39 billion foreign 
debt liberty is an idea whose time has come in eastern europe 
he said in a speech last week 
he probably will visit poland and hungary this summer to 
maintain us support for change

many babies born to mothers who use drugs are 
becoming boarders who strain staffs and facilities in urban 
hospitals after being abandoned by their parents a hospital 
director told congress 
the problem that my hospital and hospitals in cities around 
the country are facing daily is caring for those newborn babies 
abandoned by drug abusing mothers said haynes rice director of 
howard university hospital 
rice on thursday told the house select committee on children 
youth and families that the overcrowding caused by these boarder 
babies has become so acute one day he was unable to locate an 
empty bed anywhere between philadelphia and richmond for an acutely 
ill infant 
boarder babies are children who remain in hospitals after birth 
even though they are medically ready for discharge he said 
the problem is being exacerbated in the nations capital by the 
rising crossgenerational family use of crack cocaine said rice 
now we are seeing 28 and 35yearold grandmothers who are 
themselves substance abusers and who cannot readily step in to 
provide the social support as in the past 
an internal study found the average stay for 27 of the 45 babies 
being boarded at howard between august and december 1988 was 423 
days the average expected hospital stay for a newborn is three 
days 
the longeststay infant had been in the hospital for 245 days 
at a cost in excess of 250000 said rice noting the medicaid 
payment received by the hospital was set at 6100 regardless of 
the length of stay or extent of services the child received while 
there 
rice recommended streamlining foster care and adoption 
procedures to speed the placement of boarder babies into stable 
homes 
this is not a new phenomenon he said explaining that 20 years 
ago when i worked in new york city the public hospitals there 
had about 200 babies on a daily basis who had been abandoned at the 
hospitals by heroin addicted mothers 
wendy chavkin a new york city doctor said a recent report by 
the city comptroller shows the problem has not abated indicating 
maternal drug use was the reason for the boarder status of 49 
percent of the more than 300 children under age 2 in city hospitals 
chavkin said the lack of drug treatment facilities for women in 
general and pregnant women specifically also contributes to the 
problem

he is the mystery man of the nations 
worst oil spill the third mate who was on watch when the exxon 
valdez ran aground and dumped more than 10 million gallons of crude 
in prince william sound 
little has been seen of gregory cousins since the march 24 
accident and federal officials dont expect him to surface until 
the may 1619 hearings in anchorage to assess what happened and how 
to prevent a recurrence 
capt joseph hazelwood who the coast guard says was the only 
person aboard authorized to navigate the tanker through the sound 
blamed his third mate when the coast guard radioed his ship an hour 
after the wreck 
joe hazelwood here the skipper answered when coast guard 
cmdr steve mccall in valdez asked for a damage report 
a little problem here with the third mate but were working 
our way off the reef said hazelwood who tried to rock the ship 
free before shutting down the engines and waiting for help 
cousins had signed on with exxon as a third mate although he 
had obtained his second mates certification jan 12 
thats not unusual said coast guard lt cmdr gary kaminski 
in washington dc with fewer positions available people set 
sail at positions lower than their license 
a second mate is the navigator and is in charge of maps and 
charts the third mate is in charge of maintenance and the 
inventory of firefighting equipment they and the chief mate whos 
in charge of the cargo alternate fourhour watches on the bridge 
hazelwood turned the 987foot tanker and its 42 million gallons 
of oil destined for long beach calif over to cousins sometime 
after a state pilot with federal pilot authority left the ship at 
rocky point 
bligh reef was seven miles away 
at that time the master hazelwood was in the wheelhouse 
said coast guard cmdr darryle waldron the master had federal 
pilotage authority for prince william sound through the entrance 
the mates didnt have the necessary endorsements on their 
licenses 
the pilots used to navigate ships out of the sound to the gulf 
of alaska until the 1980s when a smaller ship taking a pilot back 
to valdez capsized in rough seas the pilot nearly died and the 
rules were eased 
cousins reportedly a resident of tampa fla was licensed out 
of new orleans and obtained his third mates license march 19

test nine hours after the wreck the legal limit on bloodalcohol 
tests for ship captains is 04

a new laser technique erases tattoos but spares 
the skin providing the first way to get rid of battleships 
hearts old lovers names or other such decorations without causing 
scars researchers say 
the treatment uses an intense beam of light called a ruby laser 
to blast away the colors beneath the skin 
i think this is the first truly nonscarring therapy for 
tattoos said dr r rox anderson of massachusetts general 
hospital 
dr charles taylor a member of andersons research team 
planned to present the results of the laser treatment today at a 
meeting of the society for investigative dermatology in washington 
doctors said the laser is almost painless too it produces a 
sensation something like a loosely snapped rubber band 
lasers are already widely used for removing tattoos but current 
models burn them off leaving permanent scars the new technique 
also produces high heat but its effects are much more selective 
it uses brief 100 millionwatt flashes of red light which is 
absorbed by the tattoo pigment the heat shatters the bits of 
pigment imbedded in the skin as well as the cells that hold them 
but it does not harm blood vessels or ordinary cells 
there is clearly a difference between this and other therapies 
that are used anderson said 
anderson said the procedure could become the standard treatment 
for removing tattoos after it is approved by the us food and drug 
administration perhaps within two years 
dr kenneth arndt of beth israel hospital in boston agreed 
when the ruby laser works well which looks to be a good deal 
of the time the skin remains normal he said thats 
extraordinary and its bringing fancy technology to the level 
where it can be useful for patient care 
anderson said that in testing so far on 13 people the laser 
completely erased about half of the tattoos and faded the rest 
however he said the initial study was intended to find the 
proper intensity of laser light and some patients received 
relatively low doses results may be better when higher levels are 
used routinely 
of 41 tatoos treated only one small patch of skin measuring 
less than a square inch became scarred 
the laser will not remove red pigment because it does not absorb 
the red light amateur tattoos come off more easily than 
professionally drawn tattoos which contain more color 
anderson said that after his team began experimenting with the 
ruby laser they discovered that a group of doctors in glasgow 
scotland had worked on the same approach and published preliminary 
results in a british journal 
unless burned or removed surgically tattoos are permanent the 
boston researchers said that most of the people they have treated 
so far got them while drunk 
one woman had her boyfriends initials tattooed when she was a 
teenager the next day she regretted it and always kept the 
tattoo covered with a bandage 
tattoos are drawn by puncturing the skin usually with needles 
and inserting pigment that remains after the wound heals over 
the variety of laser used in the new treatment was once widely 
tested for medical purposes but none of them seemed to work and it 
was abandoned the ruby laser is used largely for welding

gov terry branstad has taken the final 
step to launch floating casinos on iowas rivers and lakes 
he declared the integrity of the state will be protected as 
more than 50 backers watched him thursday sign the bill legalizing 
gambling on casino boats 
i couldnt be happier said rep tom fey an author of the 
gambling bill that culminated a fouryear drive it took a long 
hard effort 
this bill will provide an economic shot in the arm for many 
river communities that wish to further promote tourism branstad 
said our major rivers are already prime tourist destination 
points and this bill would attract even more tourists to these 
locations 
jubilant backers predicted historic 19th century riverboats 
would be luring thousands of tourists and millions of dollars to a 
state thats suffered from years of farmbased economic hard times 
in two years well see a major economic benefit to eastern 
iowa said house majority leader robert arnould a davenport 
democrat 
for his part branstad focused on economic development tourism 
and controls which limit each bet to 5 and nightly losses to 200 
the governor rejected suggestions floating casinos are out of 
place in the conservative middle of the nations heartland 
im very sensitive to that said branstad im very proud 
of the pristine reputation our state has 
under the new law riverboats could begin operating in 1991 and 
would be regulated by the states racing commission which would 
issue gambling licenses before any license could be issued voters 
in the county where it would dock would have to approve 
criticism came from a coalition of conservative republicans who 
fought it on moral grounds and liberal church groups who feared 
exploitation of the poor 
the riverboat gambling measure is the latest form of legalized 
gambling to win approval in iowa which already has a staterun 
lottery and parimutuel betting at horse and dog tracks

aunt jemimas downhome style is giving way to a 
more sophisticated look 
gone are the geometricprint headband and plain white collar 
the new aunt jemima wears goldtrimmed pearl earrings a lace 
collar and soft wavy graystreaked hair 
quaker oats co home to this ageless black woman since 1926 is 
updating the 100yearold trademark 
but she still looks like she knows her way around the kitchen 
company spokesman ronald g bottrell said thursday 
and her smiling face adorning 40 breakfast products from 
pancakes to syrup to grits is the same it didnt change much in 
1968 either when quaker gave the onceportly icon a more svelte 
look 
so why bother 
it was time says quaker 
the time comes about every 20 years 
five months of consumer research in 12 cities showed very high 
awareness of the aunt jemima trademark and positive perceptions 
among all groups said barbara r allen vice president for 
marketing in quakers convenience foods division 
the new design which will begin appearing in july gives our 
aunt jemima line a more contemporary look as we move into the 
1990s she said 
consumers surveyed were offered two or three choices for a 
revamped aunt jemima none of them dramatically different because 
quaker wanted to keep the good will and positive perceptions that 
already existed bottrell said 
the consumers had firm notions about her 
some described aunt jemima as a young grandmother he said 
she works she has a family others suggested 
but the consensus across the board was that she definitely 
knows how to cook bottrell said 
in order for this to have any credibility people need to 
expect that of aunt jemima he said we wanted a more 
modernlooking woman but one who still has traditional values 
the original aunt jemima pancake mix was introduced in 1889 a 
breakthrough convenience product from the rt davis milling co in 
st joseph mo where it is still made by quaker 
today aunt jemima is the leading brand in both pancake mixes 
and syrups offering lowcalorie variations and microwave 
convenience the company said her products represent about 300 
million of quakers 53 billion in sales

the food and drug administration is allowing a 
potentially promising new aids drug to be tested on people infected 
with the deadly virus 
researchers say the drug known as glq223 is unique because it 
appears to kill only those immune system cells that are infected 
with the aids virus leaving noninfected cells alone however 
they caution the drug so far has been tested only in the laboratory 
and has not been used on aids patients 
dr michael mcgrath of the university of california in san 
francisco and san francisco general hospital led a team of 
scientists from ucsf the chinese university of hong kong and 
genelabs of redwood city calif that developed glq223 
im very optimistic because of the test tube results but 
theres always the possibility it could have unpredictable side 
effects or when given to humans the drug may not be able to get to 
all the infected cells mcgrath said of thursdays announcement

treasury secretary nicholas brady is rejecting 
a proposal to reduce medicare catastrophic health insurance 
premiums that congressional analysts expect to generate a bigger 
surplus than is needed 
brady in a letter to sen lloyd bentsen dtexas that was 
released thursday said the insurance program is literally in its 
first few months of life and the administration wants to be sure 
it is not left with insufficient reserves 
the new insurance program approved by congress last year 
provides extended coverage for the costs of hospital and medical 
care and drug benefits it is financed through a surtax paid by 
social security recipients 
bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee last week 
said he would move to reduce the surtax if the treasury department 
agreed with new congressional estimates that the surtax will yield 
a 91 billion surplus over a fiveyear period 
brady however said the administration expects the premiums to 
yield contingency reserves of 62 billion and finds no reason 
to revise that estimate or to allow for a smaller surplus

a west german described by us 
authorities as the worlds top technobandit was sentenced to 
an additional 2 years in prison and fined 40000 for a daring 
helicopter prison escape attempt 
us district judge william stafford sentenced werner 
bruchhausen 49 to 30month concurrent sentences thursday on each 
of two counts of conspiracy to escape the term will be tacked onto 
a 15year term bruchhausen received in 1987 for sales of classified 
technology to soviet bloc countries 
stafford criticized letters he got on behalf of bruchhausen 
which were critical of the us judicial system saying i 
thought i ought to let you know this system has provided you with a 
fair trial 
assistant us attorney steve dobson urged the judge to exceed 
sentencing guidelines which called for a maximum prison term of 30 
months he discounted the defense contention that bruchhausen was 
entrapped 
he was the person who initiated the plan said dobson 
defense attorney bruce culpepper who asked the judge to stay 
within the guidelines said no decision had been made on an appeal 
authorities foiled bruchhausens escape by setting up a us 
customs helicopter as the escape aircraft he had reportedly 
offered to pay up to 250000 for assistance 
bruchhausen was taken into custody by an fbi agent and four 
prison officers as he started toward the aircraft that had swooped 
down over the softball field in the prison recreation yard last 
august he was later transferred to the federal penitentiary in 
atlanta 
the west german citizen began serving his sentence at the 
tallahassee prison in may 1987 
bruchhausen and three others were indicted in august 1981 in los 
angeles on charges of conspiracy and violating the export 
administration act the arms export and control act and federal 
income tax laws 
the 60count indictment charged that from january 1977 through 
june 5 1980 bruchhausen and the others conspired to export from 
the united states various high technology commodities to east 
germany and elsewhere without export licenses from the state and 
commerce departments 
at that time us customs commissioner william von rabb called 
bruchhausen one of the worlds top technobandits 
he was arrested on may 8 1985 in london extradited the 
following year and convicted of wire fraud in 1987 
bruchhausen allegedly smuggled a microwave receiver system 
semiconductor manufacturing equipment a computer system and other 
military and scientific items to the soviet bloc through dummy 
corporations in california and west germany

subsided about an immediate increase in japans official discount 
rate following the release of aprils tokyoarea consumer price 
report 
consumer prices for april in tokyo rose 26 percent from a year 
earlier and 14 percent from the prior month according to a

possible interest rate hike said a dealer with the bank of 
tokyo who spoke anonymously 
finance minister tatsuo murayama told a news conference friday 
that the nations central bank is worried about price stability and 
high oil prices but the tone of his remarks also suggested there 
will not be an immediate change in monetary policy based on the 
price data 
bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said thursday the central 
bank would act swiftly if necessary to sustain price stability

that the bank of japan is likely to hike its official interest 
rate now standing at a historic low of 25 percent to 30 percent 
as early as midmay to alleviate inflationary pressure

if youre trying to stay away from a heart 
attack federal health researchers say your chances are best out 
west 
hawaiis rate of death from heart disease is barely half the 
rate in new york which reports three such deaths per 1000 
residents per year the us centers for disease control said 
thursday 
after hawaii rounding out the healthiestheart list are new 
mexico utah alaska and idaho 
the cdcs findings from a study of heart disease deaths in 
1986 the latest year available mark a continuation of previously 
reported trends in coronary mortality also continuing is a trend 
with heart disease deaths going down while hospitalizations for 
heart disease are rising the atlantabased agency said in its 
weekly report 
the nation in 1986 recorded 593111 deaths from coronary heart 
disease chiefly heart attacks and other blockedartery heart 
problems accounting for 28 percent of all deaths in the united 
states the cdc said 
by comparison cancer the nations no 2 killer took 466000 
lives in 1986 
the cdc study found the highest rate of heart disease deaths in 
new york state which recorded 58473 such deaths or 303 per 
100000 residents the other states in the top five were all in the 
northeast or the northern midwest michigan with a rate of 299 
heart disease deaths per 100000 rhode island 284 new jersey 
278 and illinois 274 
the national rate was 246 heart disease deaths per 100000 
americans 
hawaii had the lowest rate of heart disease deaths with 1403 
or 166 per 100000 next up the list were four other western 
states new mexico 184 utah 189 alaska 190 and idaho 190 
cdc researchers say people in more populous areas are more 
likely to have inactive lifestyles holding desk jobs riding 
instead of walking which can contribute to the risk of heart 
attack or heart disease 
we really dont know what the reason is said dr robert 
hahn a cdc researcher we suspect some of the risk factors for 
heart disease may be found more commonly in those regions 
the cdc also reported thursday that while deaths from heart 
disease have declined 20 percent since 1968 the rate of 
hospitalization from heart disease has risen 
among men the hospitalization rate for heart disease was 1066 
per 100000 nationwide in 1986 up from 784 in 1970 among women 
the rate was 718 in 1986 up from 570 in 1970 men are consistently 
hospitalized for heart disease at a rate 50 percent higher than 
women 
the decrease in deaths from heart disease probably represents 
diminishing incidence but with medical advances more heart 
disease patients than ever before seem to be getting hospital 
treatment said the cdcs dr richard m rothenberg 
its an interesting social trend he said it has a lot to 
do with trends in disease mixed with hospital policies we 
really need more research trying to pinpoint what is actually going 
on 
the increase in recorded heartdisease hospitalizations could be 
because of a number of factors the cdc said including improved 
survival of heart patients progress in medical technology and even 
changes in hospital procedures and classification systems

an expert advisory panel recommends federal 
approval of birth control implants that work up to five years but 
a final decision by food and drug commissioner frank young may take 
months 
among the issues the agency still must review are the 
effectiveness of the implants in heavier women and how long the 
contraceptive protection lasts fda spokesman jeff nesbit said 
thursday 
nesbit said the 11member fertility and maternal health drugs 
advisory committee of the fda unanimously approved the implant 
called norplant because it is at least as safe and effective as 
any other contraceptive on the market 
the six slowrelease silicone capsules each about the size of a 
match stick are implanted under a local anesthetic in a womans 
upper arm they must be replaced after five years 
norplant already being used in several foreign countries 
contains a hormone called levonorgestrel that is also used in many 
birth control pills but unlike the pills it does not contain 
estrogen the hormone often implicated as a possible cause of heart 
attacks and strokes 
the population council a nonprofit international family 
planning organization sought fda approval of norplant so it could 
be distributed overseas by the us agency for international 
development the implant is made by wyethayerst laboratories of 
philadelphia 
the population council says that in tests the implants have 
been 998 percent effective over five years in women weighing less 
than 110 pounds and 914 percent effective in women weighing more 
than 153 pounds

in the year since the roof ripped off an aloha 
airlines jet and a flight attendant plunged to her death 
widespread changes have occurred in the industry that once believed 
a maintained aircraft could fly forever 
the boeing 737 involved had rolled off the assembly line in 1969 
and had 89000 cycles takeoffs and landings in a corrosive 
saltair environment 
the industry and the federal aviation administration had 
believed that metal fatigue in older airplanes especially cracking 
around rivets and corrosion could be discovered in regular visual 
inspections 
however in the aloha case investigators think dozens of minute 
cracks invisible to the human eye connected and allowed a piece 
of fuselage to blow out in an explosive decompression at 24000 
feet followed by a whole section of the plane 
the images from the april 28 1988 accident were unforgettable 
the jet with a 18foot chunk of its upper fuselage gone sitting 
on the runway of kahului airport on the hawaiian island of maui 
stunned passengers milling around while flight attendants tried to 
comfort them passengers shaking the hands of the pilot and 
copilot who somehow landed the crippled jet safely 
officials were stunned there was only one fatality although 61 
passengers were injured 
quickly the headlines changed from terror in paradise to 
miracle over maui experts marveled at the skill of the 
captain robert schornstheimer and the copilot madeline mimi 
tompkins since promoted to captain and praised them for averting 
a much worse disaster and they wondered of course what could 
cause the 19yearold jet to break apart 
i saw the original hole the smaller one before the whole 
thing ripped open said passenger arlo clippinger 51 of tucson 
ariz i still dream about that hole 
after the accident a task force of aviation industry and 
government safety experts recommended mandatory structural 
overhauls on older airliners the average age of the nearly 3000 
us airliners is about 13 years with many planes more than 15 
years old 
the national transportation safety board report on the 
inflight roof separation is not due until next month 
the accident caused everyone to question the industry folklore 
that a plane could fly forever said a maurice myers president 
of aloha airlines 
now its believed that airplanes can fly indefinitely with the 
proper lifeextending programs but thats not just daily 
maintenance its overall complete structural inspections he 
said 
since the aloha accident nine people died feb 24 when the 
cargo door and a chunk of fuselage tore off an united airlines 
boeing 747 on a flight from hawaii cargo door failure is suspected 
to be the cause of that mishap 
those two accidents united and aloha were similar only in 
what you saw on tv a jet with a hole said faa spokesman fred 
farrar the best poll of public confidence remains the fact that 
we have something like 16000 airline flights every day in the 
country and theyre pretty much full of passengers 
meanwhile boeing co this week predicted record sales for 1989 
with chairman and chief executive officer frank shrontz saying 
concern about aging aircraft is bound to be a significant 
factor in the companys sales outlook 
myers said that despite spending 60 million for two new 737s 
defending the company against 19 lawsuits stemming from the 
accident and spending millions to refurbish older aircraft the 
company turned a 58 million profit in 1988 up 200000 from the 
previous years profit 
the jet involved in the accident was scrapped and the airline 
no longer lists a flight 243 in its schedule 
the airlines insurance company is paying settlements to those 
who did not sue myers said but declined to release the average 
payment 
in 43 years of flying weve had one accident myers said 
it happened to be one that affected the whole industry and caused 
widespread changes

civil rights leaders are suing the state 
of connecticut contending its schools make it impossible for poor 
minority students to get the same education as their white 
suburban counterparts 
the desegregation lawsuit was filed thursday in hartford 
superior court on behalf of a black hartford fourthgrader and 16 
other children and teenagers arguing that racial imbalance in 
hartford area schools violates the state constitutions guarantee 
against racial discrimination 
the lawsuit contends that black and hispanic innercity children 
and white suburban children are all suffering under greater 
hartfords racially divided school systems 
black children going to black schools and white children going 
to white schools is inherently unequal said wesley horton one 
of 10 lawyers who will argue the case its got to be stopped 
the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit 10yearold milo sheff 
attends hartfords annie fisher school where 99 percent of the 
students are black or hispanic 
six of the 17 plaintiffs in the lawsuit are white including two 
children from west hartford an affluent suburb where schools are 
84 percent white in hartford where the other 15 plaintiffs live 
schools are 91 percent black or hispanic 
the lawsuit contends that the concentration of poor children 
children from oneparent families and nonenglish speaking 
children places severe burdens on the hartford school system 
making it unable to provide education comparable to that offered in 
nearby suburbs 
the lawsuit also alleges that white children in suburban school 
districts surrounding hartford are deprived of the opportunity to 
associate with and learn from the minority children attending 
school within the hartford school district 
the lawsuit does not ask for any specific remedy to desegregate 
the schools and the lawyers who will argue the case seemed 
hesitant to suggest one 
what we envision is a system whereby puerto ricans and blacks 
and whites are educated together said william olds executive 
director of the connecticut civil liberties union which is 
providing two lawyers to the plaintiffs 
a courtordered solution could focus on redrawing school 
district boundaries busing students from one district to another 
or creating interdistrict magnet schools 
state education commissioner gerald h tirozzi one of 10 state 
officials named as defendants has proposed voluntary incremental 
steps such as magnet schools to desegregate connecticut schools 
but the legislature has not acted on tirozzis suggestions and 
civil rights leaders maintain the legislature wont deal with the 
issue without pressure from the courts 
also named as defendants are gov william a oneill the six 
current members of the state board of education state treasurer 
francisco l borges the states highest black official and 
state comptroller j edward caldwell 
oneills legal advisor howard g rifkin said thursday the 
governor would have no comment on the lawsuit until he has had a 
chance to review it

president bush and vice president dan quayle 
held a meeting last week to discuss how to handle a transfer of 
presidential power if bush were incapacitated white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater says 
fitzwater called the unannounced session april 18 just a 
routine meeting just a process meeting how the process would 
work 
the 25th amendment to the constitution prescribes circumstances 
under which the vice president would assume power from the 
president and bush temporarily took over from former president 
ronald reagan when he had colon cancer surgery on july 13 1985 
fitzwater said thursday that precise guidelines were adopted 
during the reagan administration for implementing the amendment 
i dont know that theres anything more to decide he 
said its all very routine the processes were worked out in the 
last administration 
he said he did not recall that that process had ever been made 
public on the other hand fitzwater said he recalled talking about 
the process when reagan was undergoing periodic cancer checkups 
quayle who was traveling in australia said of the report 
today i have absolutely no comment on that i have no comment 
the washington post quoting an anonymous white house source 
reported today that the meeting was kept secret because of 
sensitivity to previous democratic charges that quayle lacked 
experience to handle the job of president 
fitzwater said he did not know who participated in the meeting 
but said it was a private session 
the post reported that barbara bush and marilyn quayle as well 
as white house physician burton lee ii and white house counsel c 
boyden gray also attended the meeting according to the post 
quayle remained silent while his wife and the bushes questioned the 
white house staff members on the issue 
a source familiar with the meeting who spoke on condition of 
anonymity told the associated press however that mrs quayle did 
not attend the session 
during the meeting it was determined that the 25th amendment 
would be invoked under certain circumstances but not in others but 
the details of what was decided could not be immediately 
determined the post said

writer of the abc drama in an effort to get him to drop the 
project 
englund however said the project to tell the story of the 
seven astronauts who died in the accident jan 28 1986 will 
continue 
in my heart ive tried to understand their feeling he 
said the most honorable thing i can say is that my hopes and 
wishes are that it will be accurate 
but mrs onizuka said they ought to let them be 
why do we have to relive this why dont they leave it alone 
if it is going to be done at all it should be done as a very 
serious documentary added mrs smith 
cheryl mcnair widow of challenger astronaut ronald mcnair said 
the movie just doesnt seem necessary at this time 
englund said the cast has not been selected and a start date has 
not been set but he hopes to film the entire movie in the johnson

the consumer group public citizen is getting 
50 cents on the sale of each hometesting kit for radon from two 
companies it is recommending as the best the washington post 
reported today 
bob dreyfuss a spokesman for the ralph naderaffiliated group 
admitted public citizen is accepting the money but told the post 
suggestions of a link between the payments and the favorable 
ratings are totally without even the slightest foundation 
public citizen is an umbrella organization for several consumer 
groups one of those groups buyers up recommended the kits 
produced by radon testing corp of america and teledyne isotops 
dreyfuss said 
according to dreyfuss buyers up tested seven radontesting kits 
from the nations largest manufacturers last year and asked all of 
the firms to contribute to buyers up or public citizen both 
nonprofit groups 
dreyfuss told the post it was only coincidence that the only 
firms to offer a percentage of their sales were those that won 
recommendations 
the national consumer coalition a group of 33 conservative 
consumer and public policy groups has joined firms that were rated 
poorly by buyers up in calling the arrangement a kickback 
i suppose that there could be some better way of funding it 
dreyfuss said of the testing program but we dont have any 
regrets theyre seizing on this as a way to try to discredit us 
radon is a colorless odorless radioactive gas that forms 
naturally from decay in the ground and can seep into homes

the earthquake hit at 1148 am cdt thursday and measured 47 
on the richter scale of ground motion it was centered in new 
madrid mo 10 miles north of blytheville ark 
the temblor in tennessee arkansas missouri and kentucky 
was the strongest in the region since 1976 said pat jorgenson 
spokeswoman for the us geological surveys national earthquake

the new madrid seismic zone was the center of a series of great 
earthquakes that rocked the area during the winter of 181112 
officials have warned repeatedly that a serious earthquake can 
be expected during the next several years in the new madrid seismic 
area which stretches roughly from southern illinois to arkansas 
thursdays was the strongest quake in the region since march 25 
1976 when one registered 49 said jorgenson 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude so a reading of 75 means an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 65 
an earthquake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 severe damage 
a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy 
damage 8 is a great quake capable of tremendous damage 
the richter scale was unavailable in 18111812 but those quakes 
have been estimated at 82 to 83 on the scale the new madrid 
quakes affected much of the eastern united states felt as far away 
as boston and washington dc but the immediate area then was 
sparsely settled and there was relatively little local damage

a mistake by a csx corp dispatcher with 23 
years experience caused the april 6 derailment of amtraks silver 
star near emporia a federal investigator said 
gordon j inglis of the national transportation safety board 
said thursday that the dispatcher based at csxs new central 
dispatch center in jacksonville fla had radioed the engineer 
that the silver star would be switching tracks in emporia four 
miles beyond the point where the switch had been set emporia is 
about 50 miles south of richmond 
the engineer failed to slow for the switch because he didnt 
expect it so soon inglis said 
the train plowed into the switch at its normal cruising speed of 
59 mph instead of the recommended crossover speed of 15 mph 
both engines and the first eight cars of the 18car train jumped 
the track causing minor injuries to 34 of the trains 519 
passengers and 18 million in damage 
inglis said tests found no evidence of drug or alcohol use by 
anyone involved in the trains routing or operation 
he said the dispatcher had a perfect work record before the 
derailment the man is still at his post and likely will keep his 
job the investigator said 
the safety boards final report on the accident due in june 
probably will recommend changes in operating procedures at the 
dispatch center inglis said 
csx has about 19000 miles of track in 20 states plus 
washington dc and ontario canada

trash cans in downtown johannesburg early today shattering store 
windows but causing no injuries police said 
the first explosion shortly after noon blew up a trash bin at 
the entrance of a local department store it occurred across from a 
building housing several american and british news organizations 
including the associated press cbstv the new york times and the 
times of london 
the second explosion occurred two hours later in front of a 
furnishing store seven blocks away 
bombings had dropped off sharply since a protest campaign last 
october against the racially separate nationwide municipal 
elections while there had been no bombs in johannesburg in months 
several were reported in the cape area and in the xhosa tribal 
homelands of ciskei and transkei sixteen people have been injured 
by about 20 bombs this year 
police named no suspect for todays bombings although they 
usually blame the outlawed african national congress the largest 
guerrilla organization waging a sabotage campaign to end apartheid 
and rule by a whitedominated government 
the anc seldom comments on individual bombings but they 
sometimes occur after an event considered significant to the 
organization three anc guerrillas were sentenced to death

a judge must now decide the fate of a man 
after accepting his plea of guilty but mentally ill in the killings 
of two 8yearolds during a shooting at an elementary school last 
fall 
james wilson depicted as a man plagued by imaginary voices and 
obsessed with violence also was found guilty but mentally ill 
thursday of wounding seven other children and two teachers at 
greenwoods oakland elementary school 
wilson walked into the school on sept 26 1988 and opened fire 
with a handgun in a cafeteria and classroom 
during a hearing after the judge accepted the pleas prosecutors 
asked that wilson be sentenced to the electric chair and the 
defense asked for life in prison with proper psychiatric care 
circuit judge james moore delayed sentencing wilson until may 9 
moore accepted the pleas from wilson 20 after 3 days of 
testimony from witnesses to the shooting and from psychiatrists who 
had examined him earlier this week moore found wilson competent 
to stand trial 
wilson who has a history of mental illness offered a plea of 
guilty but mentally ill to the charges on monday but moore refused 
to immediately accept the pleas saying he wanted to hear testimony 
on the defendants state of mind 
psychiatrists testified that wilson was a man obsessed by the 
film psycho which wilson claimed to have seen 500 times 
fascinated by mass murderers and how they carried out their crimes 
and plagued by the voice of his dead grandfather 
psychiatrists called by the defense this week testified that 
wilson suffered from a borderline personality disorder which 
involves a potential for violence low selfesteem paranoia 
inability to develop interpersonal relationships and suicidal 
tendencies 
prosecutors tried to dispel testimony that supported wilsons 
contention he was mentally ill at the time of the shootings in an 
effort to send the case to a jury trial

occurred at 702 am measured 50 on the richter scale and was 
centered in the aegean sea about 85 miles north of the capital

at the nearby islands and fortunately there was no panic 
more than 1 million athenians have left the capital to spend the

epicenter is in a populated area the richter scale is a gauge of 
the energy released by an earthquake as measured by the ground 
motion recorded on a seismograph every increase of one number 
means the ground motion is 10 times greater

one of historys most notorious naval 
revolts the mutiny on the bounty was reenacted today in the 
south seas by descendants of capt william bligh and his rebellious 
first officer fletcher christian 
it was a wonderful moment the ghosts of bligh and christian 
were with us today said capt ronald blighware whose 
greatgreatgreatgrandfather was set adrift off the pacific island 
nation of tonga on april 28 1789 
today was probably the most jovial mutiny in history the 
62yearold blighware added we popped champagne corks and it 
was fun 
blighwares had only to circumnavigate his ship a replica of 
the bounty built from british admiralty charts in a long boat 
his famous ancestor forced from his ship was joined by 18 
loyal crewmen who sailed a 23foot open boat about 4200 miles in 
47 days to timor indonesia in what is still regarded as a 
remarkable feat 
christian sailed the bounty back to tahiti and then spent months 
searching the south pacific for a haven knowing he would be hanged 
if caught the mutineers eventually settled on pitcairn island one 
of the worlds most remote settlements 
there they burned the ship their descendants moved to norfolk 
island off the east coast of australia in the 1850s some later 
returned to pitcairn and the populations of both islands to this 
day are predominantly of mutineer ancestry 
ken rosebery owner of the replica bounty organized the 
reenactment about 2100 miles east of australia he said that six 
of the 36 passengers and crew were direct descendants of the 
mutineers 
the passengers paid an average of 4800 for the monthlong 
voyage from sydney to tahiti and tonga they adopted the names of 
mutineers for the reenactment 
the replica ship built in new zealand in 1979 was used in the 
1984 movie the bounty starring australian actor mel gibson and 
britains anthony hopkins 
blighware like his father and grandfather is a qualified 
captain in the australian merchant navy said rosebery he also 
bears a remarkable resemblance to the 18th century bligh while 
fletcher christians greatgreatgreatgrandson gerald christian 
has the rank of lieutenant commander in the australian navy the 
sea seems to run in their families blood 
commemorative stamps that went on sale today in tonga depict 
bligh the bounty a navigational compass he used and the small 
boat on which bligh and his men were abandoned 
in london where bligh died the british navy captains 
reputation is being reassessed long regarded as the villain of the 
mutiny he now has almost heroic stature 
the old view of bligh as a bully is largely legend and im 
afraid that hollywood charles laughton trevor howard clark gable 
and marlon brando have a lot to do with it said baron terence 
lewin a retired british navy admiral 
the 68yearold admiral spoke to the associated press in london 
at the opening of an exhibition marking the 200th anniversary of 
the mutiny

two inmates and three other people tried 
to extort 10000 from the parents of a college student whose 
mutilated body later was found in a mass grave in mexico 
authorities said 
the galveston county jail inmates were arrested thursday and 
accused of using jail telephones to call mark kilroys parents in 
nearby santa fe texas where they were awaiting word on the 
whereabouts of their son who vanished in matamoros mexico 
santa fe police chief mike barry said a caller vowed to cut off 
the missing students fingers and mail them to the family if police 
arrested or followed people to whom the kilroys delivered ransom 
money 
the body of the university of texas junior was found in a 
shallow grave near matamoros mexico on april 11 one week after 
the extortion attempt allegedly began the body had been mutilated 
in a human sacrifice ritual by mexican drug smugglers police said 
police said the inmates and the other three people were not 
believed to be involved with the cult but had heard kilroy was 
missing and were trying to cash in on it the inmates were being 
held on burglary charges at the time of the alleged extortion plot 
officers said 
we were absolutely shocked that people who are in prison for a 
good reason are able to call out and terrorize innocent people 
said helen kilroy we were really shocked that people can be 
terrorized from inside our jails 
the other three people also were arrested and all five were 
charged with attempted robbery and ordered held in lieu of 20000 
bail 
kilroys mother apparently tried to pay the initial 2000 the 
group sought but the payoff was not made barry said 
galveston deputy gean leonard said the inmates had telephones in 
their cells to be used to contact family members or their 
attorneys the telephones allow the inmate to make collect calls 
only he said

a senior chinese official has renewed 
pledges to halt military aid to guerrillas in cambodia after the 
total pullout of vietnamese troops vietnams foreign minister said 
today 
meanwhile exiled cambodian resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk today rejected proposals for general elections following 
the sept 30 withdrawal of the estimated 5000070000 vietnamese 
troops from his country as illegal and absolutely unacceptable 
sihanouk in a written statement said hanois plan to have all 
troops leave cambodia by the end of september was a farce 
because the vietnamesebacked government of premier hun sen remains 
in power 
vietnamese forces invaded cambodia in late 1978 ousting the 
prochinese khmer rouge regime that massacred hundreds of thousands 
of cambodians sihanouk toppled from power in a 1970 coup now 
heads a coalition of three resistance groups that includes the 
khmer rouge 
hun sens government has reportedly said it will hold general 
elections within three months after the vietnamese withdrawal 
sihanouk who will meet hun sen in jakarta may 23 discounted 
the validity of any the elections 
hun sens government is nothing but a creation and creature of 
vietnam that has no right to to organize general elections 
he said 
sihanouk has said the vietnamese withdrawal from cambodia should 
be supervised by the united nations and that hun sens government 
should be dissolved prior to a general election demands the 
cambodian premier has rejected 
foreign minister nguyen co thach said a chinese vice foreign 
minister made the pledge to halt military aid when he received a 
copy of vietnams april 5 declaration of a total withdrawal thach 
did not name the vice minister 
they say they will stop once the vietnamese are all withdrawn 
then they will stop their military aid thach said adding he was 
confident the pledge would be kept 
thach also said vietnams deputy foreign minister dinh nho liem 
will go to beijing for a second round of talks to try to resolve 
differences over cambodia the talks are to be held may 810 
the first round held in january was the first highlevel 
meeting between the two countries in more than nine years 
sinovietnamese relations have been strained since the 1970s 
over border conflicts vietnams ties with the soviet union and 
the cambodian conflict china is the main supplier of arms to a 
guerrilla coalition fighting vietnamese troops that invaded 
cambodia in late 1978 
thach spoke with reporters while attending a symposium in 
bangkok on turning southeast asia into a peaceful trading zone once 
the conflict over cambodia is resolved

hours after exxon showed off its 
beachcleaning effort to reporters an oil company executive got an 
earful when he tried to convince a fishing community that things 
were looking better 
exxon got good reviews from a state geologist who watched smith 
island being prepared for pregnant seals but citizens of cordova 
let exxon vice president luyesse legrange know they dont see the 
same progress 
michele oleary one of 300 people at cordova high schools gym 
thursday night to talk with legrange and others coordinating the 
spill cleanup disputed exxons claims about the number of skimmers 
it operates 
when exxon said 19 were working in the sound an overflight by 
pilots for the cordova united fishermen union found only three she 
said another occasion exxon said it had 45 skimmers at work and 
the union found only five 
when can we expect to see the situation improve asked 
oleary a member of the fishermens union 
i hardly think thats the case with all the equipment we have 
out there legrange said id be most suprised if we have 
equipment not working 
after a slow start with officials questioning each other the 
twohour meeting began to get lively as the audience was allowed to 
join the inquiry 
dennis kelso the states chief environmentalist said there 
has been a long pattern of claims by exxon that dont bear out when 
people go look at whats happening 
kelso said he wasnt accusing legrange of lying but that 
nobody believes the companys recent announcement that the 
shoreline cleanup was ahead of schedule a mention that drew 
laughs from the audience 
i can tell you this is not a technical issue not a biological 
issue or an economic issue kelso continued its a moral 
issue until exxon steps up to their moral responsibility and stops 
trying to shift blame to somebody else were going to have problems 
getting the kind of performance we all expect whether its in the 
water or on the shore 
legrange denied there was any shifting of blame 
but perhaps theres some sharing that needs to be 
considered he said in the end the truth will come out in 
hearings in court rooms where people are testifying under oath and 
subject to cross examination 
national transportation safety board hearings on the accident 
and the emergency response have been set for may 1619 in anchorage 
the tone of the town meeting was sharp but polite a contrast to 
the first meeting of exxon officials and cordova residents 
dependent on fishing in prince william sound for their livelihood 
at the earlier meeting speakers were interrupted and there was 
considerable shouting the confrontation occurred shortly after the 
exxon valdez wrecked on bligh reef and put more than 10 millions of 
oil into the sound 
the newly arrived uss juneau sent its first crews to beaches on 
smith island thursday with reporters on hand to watch water hoses 
turned on the thick black goop coating the rocks standing on the 
beach was difficult 
a shoreline three football fields long should take about three 
days to clean said bert hartley a field manager for the cleanup 
but a worker struggling to maintain his footing on the beachs 
oilslickened rocks disagreed 
it takes 10 or 15 minutes of highpressure spraying to wash the 
oil off a rubber work suit said harold jones of cordova who 
joined the cleanup crew for nearly 17 an hour after his work as a 
fishermen was imperiled by the spill 
and they say theyre going to have this beach cleaned in three 
days jones said id call that extremely optimistic

at the xidan intersection near the citys center 
workers and unemployed youths broke through a line of about 200 
police to help students maintain their prodemocracy march to 
tiananmen square 
were opening a road for them said one worker carrying one 
of his shoes which had fallen off during the scuffle the people 
outnumber the students now 
just west of the central square hundreds of workers surrounded 
the final line of security forces 
give way to the students they shouted their voices 
bouncing off the redbrick walls of the forbidden city 
as the officers ranks folded the crowd broke out cheering 
defying threats that they might lose their jobs thousands of 
workers on thursday took part in the 20mile student march 
swelling the number of participants to 150000 
if chinas children have the courage to come out then its 
fathers do too said a middleaged electrician as he marched 
with his colleagues were all taking sick days 
scores of workers at the beijing light automobile co handed 
marchers dumplings and drinks at a construction site nearby work 
stopped temporarily and workers waved from atop a 15story building 
workers packed every corner sitting atop buildings billoards 
and subway entrances long live students struggle till the 
end they chanted as the crowd moved by 
the spontaneous action was an indication of widespread 
opposition to the government it also bore testimony to student 
efforts earlier this week to bring their case to the people 
the government should not stop people from speaking said an 
elderly dentist im too old to push soldiers but i can still 
walk with them 
my factory may fire me but i dont care said a foreman at a 
bus plant as he walked near the head of the protest these kids 
need help and im here to provide it 
student protests began last week following the april 15 death of 
ousted communist party leader hu yaobang 
workers did not start appearing in the throngs until saturday 
when 150000 students and their supporters occupied tiananmen 
square during hus funeral calling for a free press and an end to 
corruption in the communist party but they did not start actively 
participating until thursday 
since the saturday protest bands of student activists on street 
corners have given speeches and collected money for their protest 
workers said they agreed with student opposition to corruption 
nepotism and special privileges many senior officials in staterun 
factories engage in corruption making huge profits while their 
employees live on fixed salaries 
i read one of their leaflets and it made sense said a young 
driver i know the party leader in my company is corrupt and the 
students want a clean government 
some workers said they would keep on supporting the students 
but it was unclear to what extent 
do you know what this is one worker asked it is china 
standing up

seven weeks of fierce fighting between 
christian and moslem forces stopped today under a ceasefire called 
by the arab league 
but an apparent disagreement over a key provision of the truce 
regarding blockades of the countrys ports threatened to undermine 
the ceasefire 
the latest round of fighting in lebanons 14year civil war 
began on march 8 and has killed 273 people and wounded 993 
according to police 
the 22member arab league worked out the ceasefire plan 
thursday during a meeting in tunisia and promised to dispatch arab 
observers to monitor the truce three previous ceasefires 
sponsored by the league have collapsed 
earlier today beirut was shaken by several rocket and artillery 
blasts as christian army units under gen michel aoun battled with 
syrians and their druse moslem militia allies along the green line 
that slices beirut into christian and moslem sectors no casualties 
were reported police said 
aoun who heads a threeman christian cabinet said he welcomed 
the lifting of blockades imposed on legal ports besieged by the 
syrian forces 
he said in a statement that maritime agencies should instruct 
their ships to head to legal ports apparently meaning that aoun 
still did not intend to end his blockade of illegal ports runs by 
moslem militias south of beirut 
the latest round of fighting began when auon ordered his forces 
to blockade those ports on march 6 in an effort to restore 
government authority 
the druse moslems responded by opening fire on the beirut port 
which aouns forces control the syrians then joined in shelling 
and besieged christian east beirut and a 310squaremile christian 
enclave to the north 
acting prime minister salim hoss who heads a mainly moslem 
cabinet that is at odds with aouns government also pledged to 
observe the ceasefire 
in damascus syria the official news agency sana said the 
government of president hafez assad was satisified with 
resolutions announced by the arab league on lebanon syria 
initially sent its 40000 troops into lebanon in 1976 on a 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league 
aoun for weeks had rejected any settlement that did not include 
a timetable for syrias withdrawal from lebanon 
an aide speaking on condition of anonymity said aoun agreed to 
the arab league ceasefire because it included the arab observers 
whose presence could curb syrias influence 
this of course is not enough however it is a good step in 
the march toward stripping syria of its total control over 
lebanon the spokesman said 
the beirut daily newspaper annahar said the main achievement of 
the arab league decision is that syria no longer is the sole 
power in lebanon 
the arab leagues final statement did not say how many observers 
would be sent to lebanon 
newspapers and arab league sources have said a special committee 
it formed in january proposed dispatching 312 observers under a 
kuwaiti commander kuwait heads the committee which also includes 
the foreign ministers of jordan sudan tunis algeria and the 
united arab emirates 
beirut international airport the countrys only air transport 
facility located on the southern edge of the moslem sector has 
been closed since march 12 when it became a target of christian 
gunners 
aoun said today it could reopen but a source close to hoss said 
the airport would remain closed until the hoss cabinet decides to 
reopen it

mcgrawhill inc says it will not participate in 
a book fair next month in iran because of the unfolding 
politicalization of the event 
the company announced its decision thursday one day after 
another us publisher that had planned to exhibit its books at the 
fair john wiley amp sons a major producer of technical and 
scientific books announced it would pull out of the event 
the two publishers were criticized by the authors guild and by 
the publisher of salman rushdie irans leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini issued his death threat against the british author 
saying rushdies novel satanic verses is blasphemous 
mcgrawhill inc had planned to participate through its company 
in england mcgrawhill book co uk ltd but said in a statement 
it had directed the subsidiary to withdraw completely from the 
book fair 
the unfolding politicalization of the book fair indicates 
participation serves no constructive purpose mcgrawhill said 
the biennial fair scheduled for may 719 in tehran is 
conducted by the iran ministry of islamic culture and generally 
concentrates on scientific medical and technical books 
mcgrawhill said its original decision to show its books in iran 
was based on the belief that there should be no sanctions on 
knowledge and that some good would be served by making medical 
scientific and technical publications available to iranian 
students 
neither mcgrawhill nor wiley had planned to send anyone to 
tehran

prosecutors today demanded a life 
sentence for mohammed ali hamadi for his role in the hijacking of a 
twa plane and the slaying of a us sailor 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is charged with murder and air 
piracy in the june 1985 hijacking he admitted taking part in the 
hijacking but denies killing navy diver robert stethem 
in closing arguments chief prosecutor achim thiel said although 
it could not be proved hamadi pulled the trigger of the gun that 
killed stethem it was a clear case at a minimum of felony 
murder 
peter korneck the assistant prosecutor in the trial which 
opened july 5 1988 said it was an attack against the 
foundations of civilization 
there was no excuse for what happened it cannot be justified 
or excused korneck said referring to the hijacking stethems 
murder and the brutal beatings of passengers 
there was nothing in the evidence presented that would justify 
a milder sentence korneck said 
thirtynine americans were held hostage 17 days after the jet 
was commandeered while on a flight from athens to rome 
a verdict is not expected until the second half of may life 
imprisonment is the maximum penalty for murder and air piracy in 
west germany 
under west german law an accomplice can be convicted of murder 
even if he did not pull the trigger 
it cannot be proved that hamadi killed stethem with his own 
hands but he is at a minimum equally guilty thiel said 
hamadi has blamed his fugitive accomplice hassan ezzeddine for 
stethems murder none of the witnesses who testified during the 
trial including dozens of former hostages and crew members of the 
hijacked plane saw the slaying 
in their closing arguments the prosecutors referred repeatedly 
to the beatings of passengers described by witnesses 
hamadi beat robert stethem and clinton suggs another us 
navy diver when they were totally defenseless thiel said 
they were beaten without reason he did it out of hate 
he beat suggs until the skin on his back popped open the 
chief prosecutor said the sadistic beating of kurt carlson 
another us passenger until he was unconscious was verified by 
other witnesses they believed that carlson was dead 
we demand life imprisonment for murder and three cases of 
grave bodily harm the murder the brutal beatings of stethem 
suggs and carlson call for a life sentence korneck said 
both prosecutors described hamadi as the leader of the 
hijacking hamadi has denied being the leader 
the prosecutors also argued that hamadi should be treated and 
sentenced as an adult according to evidence obtained by the 
prosecutors hamadi turned 21 the day before the hijacking began on 
june 14 1985 
hamadi has claimed that he is one or two years younger but has 
not given a precise date of birth under west german law the age 
issue could influence the length of sentence 
stethems parents richard and patricia and their other two 
sons kenneth and patrick listened closely to the proceedings 
hamadi was arrested in january 1988 at frankfurts airport when 
customs officials found explosives in his luggage

in a littlenoticed decision a federal appeals 
court challenged the right of historians and biographers to reprint 
letters diaries and other unpublished primary source material 
without permission 
the ruling last week upheld on a technicality henry holt amp cos 
right to print an unflattering book about l ron hubbard the 
founder of the church of scientology 
a danish corporation related to the church maintained that use 
of a hubbard letter constituted copyright infringement and sought 
to bar the book barefaced messiah by russell miller 
the threejudge panel of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
in new york ruled unanimously april 19 that the plaintiffs had sued 
too late 
the opinion signed by judges roger j miner and frank x 
altimari read the district court denied an injunction for 
several reasons one being the existence of special circumstances 
in which free speech interests were said to outweigh the interests 
of the copyright owner we are not persuaded however that any 
first amendment concerns not accommodated by the copyright act are 
implicated in that action 
an authors expression of an idea as distinguished from the 
idea itself is not considered subject to the publics right to 
know 
floyd abrams a lawyer who specializes in first amendment cases 
said of the decision what they do is reject totally the notion 
that the first amendment has any role to play in deciding whether 
to issue an injunction in a copyright case 
in a separate opinion chief judge james l oakes sided with the 
trial judge pierre n laval who also denied an injunction in us 
district court in august but said the courts should consider the 
freespeech rights of an author as well as the copyright interests 
of the plaintiff especially if the material quoted is essential to 
demonstrate the point of a criticism 
oakes said his colleagues opinion tends to cast in concrete 
the language miner used to decide a similar case involving a 
biography of author jd salinger 
in october 1987 the us supreme court let stand the 2nd 
circuits decision barring random house from publishing the 
biography by ian hamilton unless brief quotations from and 
paraphrases of salingers letters were deleted 
the appeals court ruled that the letters which had been donated 
to libraries and were open to scholarly perusal still belonged to 
the writer

with a mixture of political commentary 
music and snippets of history solidarity debuted on state radio 
today under an agreement that gives the trade union limited access 
to mass media 
we return to the air after long years said one of the three 
hosts all solidarity activists 
the taped program began with religious and union songs 
interspersed with fragments from historical events including the 
sound of cheers that greeted an april 17 court ruling making 
solidarity legal again after a sevenyear ban 
it also had maninthestreet interviews about the return of 
solidarity and political commentary by opposition theorist jacek 
kuron 
it ended with an appeal by another opposition politician 
wojciech lamentowicz asking people not to boycott june 
parliamentary elections in which opposition candidates are to 
participate for the first time since 1947 
we will elect in june yes elect he said for the first 
time in many years we will elect and not just vote so the 
conclusion that a boycott serves any cause makes no sense at all 
kuron discussed the oppositions program in the election 
campaign 
the goal is sovereignty of the nation independence and 
improvement of the republic he said 
he stressed that the oppositions agreement with authorities 
that guarantees the communist party and its allies a 65 percent 
majority in the sejm the existing parliament chamber applied only 
to this years vote 
the next elections should be free he declared 
the radio show was broadcast at 11 am on radio one the main 
channel of state radio another broadcast was planned tuesday on 
another channel and a third was scheduled for may 12 
the melody at the opening of the program was composed especially 
for solidarity by wellknown composer wlodzimierz korcz an 
announcer said 
access to the mass media was guaranteed the opposition under the 
accord reached april 5 between communist authorities and the 
solidarityled opposition the agreement contains political and 
social reforms aimed primarily at reviving the countrys declining 
economy 
in addition to a halfhour weekly on radio there is to be a 
halfhour weekly television broadcast printing of the first 
opposition masscirculation daily newspaper is planned next week 
all the opposition broadcasts and publications will be subject 
to the same state censorship as the government media 
four months after martial law was imposed in december 1981 to 
crush the union the solidarity underground began organizing brief 
clandestine radio broadcasts from time to time at various fm 
frequencies using hidden transmitters sometimes they even would 
broadcast on state television during the news however the 
broadcast range was limited and officials soon learned how to jam 
the transmissions with loud disco music

sexbiased questions on the scholastic 
aptitude test taken by millions of collegebound students are 
causing girls to lose admission to selective schools scholarships 
and selfimage a researcher says 
phyllis rosser said thursday she studied the answers of 100000 
students on the november 1987 sat of the 145 questions she 
pinpointed 23 in which one sex did at least 10 percent better than 
the other boys did better in all but two she said 
these questions are tipping the balance as a result four 
years of high school achievement go down the drain theyre wiped 
out by a threehour test said rosser a senior research 
associate at the center for women policy studies her study was 
financed by a federal grant under the womens educational equity 
act 
the sat administered by the private educational testing 
service is taken annually by 15 million students 52 percent of 
them girls in 1988 average female scores were 13 points lower 
than male scores on the verbal section of the test and 43 points 
lower on the math section 
the major purpose of the sat is to predict firstyear college 
grades however rosser said studies show that females earn higher 
average grades than males in both high school and firstyear 
college classes 
rosser said ets has a biasscreening process but does not make 
its results available to researchers or the public she said her 
study is the first to identify specific questions that create a 
gender gap 
for the verbal section she said an example of a malebiased 
question would be dividends are to stockholders with the 
answer being as royalties are to writers a question favoring 
females would be love is to requite with the answer being 
as attack is to retaliate 
while the verbal section would be easy to balance rosser said 
problems in the math questions that produced a substantial scoring 
discrepancy were not as obvious 
the sat is underpredicting the performance of 780000 girls 
every year she said why are we letting this happen to girls 
nancy burton director of the ets admissions testing program 
defended the sats accuracy as a predictor and said slightly lower 
grade point averages for male freshmen were due to tough grading by 
math and science professors in courses more likely to be taken by 
males 
in general she said almost all of these score differences 
reflect valid academic differences between men and women taking the 
test 
burton said however that ets has recently begun to adjust the 
sat we are throwing out questions that show theyre unusually 
difficult for men or unusually difficult for women we also do it 
for ethnic groups she said the first test developed that way 
was given last march and results are not yet in she said 
rosser said the consequences of the gender gap include loss of 
scholarships to girls chief among them national merit 
scholarships awarded to students who score highest on the 
preliminary sat psat in their junior year of high school 
in addition she said the test scores affect womens chances of 
admission to 1500 colleges and universities that use sat cutoffs 
as an admission standard and they limit access to gifted and 
talented programs that colleges offer to high school students

a church commission today urged that the worlds 
70 million anglicans concentrate on what unites them and avoid 
further divisions over the issue of women bishops 
bishops should take every opportunity to emphasize their 
fundamental agreement on matters of faith it said 
the archbishop of canterbury robert runcie assigned the 
commission to report on how the unity of the 27 selfgoverning 
anglican churches in 164 countries can be preserved in the face of 
the disagreement 
the dispute deepened in february when us episcopalians 
consecrated barbara harris as the first anglican female bishop in 
their boston diocese 
the 18000word document report of the archbishop of 
canterburys commission on communion and women in the episcopate 
was published simultaneously in london and larnaca cyprus where 
the anglican primates met to consider that and other issues 
pope john paul ii said in a letter to runcie that the insistence 
of some anglican churches on having women priests and bishops 
appeared to block progress toward catholicanglican reconciliation 
the roman catholic church retains an allmale priesthood and it 
split with the anglican church in the 16th century reformation 
runcie spiritual head of the church of england and world 
anglican leader will meet with the pope in rome sept 29oct 2 
primarily to discuss unity of their churches a consultation their 
predecessors began in 1966 
the commissions report dismissed suggestions that a diocese 
divided on women bishops might have two bishops catering to 
opposing views 
the bishop is an embodiment and agent of unity and continuity 
in the church the report said it stressed that bishops must 
take care not to become focal points of dissent in dioceses that 
are split on the issue 
the report recommended that in dioceses with strong views for 
and against women priests and bishops a compromise first worked 
out by the us episcopalians should be adopted 
the compromise allows any congregation rejecting a woman bishop 
to petition for a male episcopal visitor bishop to administer 
confirmations 
provision for episcopal visitors is a way of exercising 
pastoral care said the unanimous report written by six ordained 
men and an english woman theologian 
it proposed that women bishops ordaining priests should do so 
collegially with a male bishop to meet the objections of church 
members who feel they could not recognize the ordinations of a 
woman 
that would protect the interests of the person ordained and 
the communities in which he or she may minister in the future 
the report said 
runcie set up the commission at the request of the lambeth 
conference of anglican bishops in august when they knew that the 
us episcopalians who have ordained more than 1200 women to the 
priesthood were preparing to approve the first woman bishop 
the conference declared that practical pastoral arrangements 
would have to be made in all anglican churches and dioceses for 
those unable to accept women bishops 
the majority of anglican churches including the church of 
england still rejects women priests 
a number of anglican bishops have said they might reluctantly 
accept women priests but could never accept a woman bishop because 
it is against belief and tradition they say it was no accident 
that jesus christ chose only men as disciples 
archbishop of armagh robert eames who chaired the commission 
said the different views on women bishops were reflected by its 
members who met for nine days of talks in london in november and 
in new york in march 
the other commission members were bishop joseph a adetiloye 
primate of all nigeria archbishop peter f carnley of perth 
australia bishop mark dyer of bethlehem pa bishop david hope of 
wakefield england the rev dr e james reed director of the 
toronto school of theology canada and dr mary tanner 
theological secretary of the church of englands board of mission 
and unity

the town council has banned 
chinese people from a chinese restaurant leased by a chinese woman 
in the citys whitesonly park legislators said today 
i feel like im on another planet its hard to believe 
said issy kramer a legislator who voted against the ban the 
council dominated by the rightwing conservative party passed the 
law 107 thursday night 
other nonwhites had already been prohibited from entering the 
resaurant 
the conservatives won control of this town east of johannesburg 
last year they declared boksburg lake park a whitesonly area 
except for the black maintenance men who clean it other municipal 
facilities also were declared offlimits to all but whites 
the lease for the golden lake restaurant run by a chinese 
woman is due to expire may 31 and an item on thursdays meeting 
agenda called for the lease to be granted to another chinese woman 
sy yip 
but a paragraph in the agreement says only white people may 
enter the restaurant said kramer i said i know you people 
are forbidding blacks coloreds and indians from entering the park 
and lake but chinese must be allowed to use the restaurant 
the conservatives said mrs yips family may go to the 
restaurant if they receive special permission 
earlier in the week nationalists teamed up with conservatives 
in the nearby town of benoni to allow blacks to use the reference 
section of the municipal library but not the lending section 
the issue had come up when two private schools which have 
nonwhite pupils applied for permission to use the library 
arguing that the whole library should be reserved for whites 
conservative party member willie koen said white taxpayers had 
built the library the more blacks are educated the greater the 
influx will be whites will find it difficult to read peacefully or 
study in the library he said 
the conservative party motion was defeated 136 then the 
conservatives and nationalists agreed to open the reference section 
to nonwhites on a vote of 135 with one abstention

islamabad pakistan afghan guerrillas claimed today they 
captured three army posts and killed more than 100 soldiers in an 
attack on a strategic valley near the besieged city of jalalabad 
deen mohammad national security minister of the insurgents 
provisional government said the guerrillas fighting in eastern 
afghanistan overran the chaprahar valley and pushed to within 2 
miles of jalalabad airport 
the attack which reportedly concentrated on the afghan armys 
81st regiment coincided with the 11th anniversary of a bloody 
military coup in which the communists seized power in afghanistan 
guerrillas captured three major army posts and 34 small ones 
and destroyed eight tanks and captured five deen said in a 
statement 
it gave no details of guerrilla casualties but one 
proguerrilla source said the heavy fighting left several people 
dead on both sides 
deens statement claimed the insurgents killed as many as 125 
government troops since tuesday and captured 44 including four 
officers 
afghan government forces have been defending jalalabad against a 
guerrilla offensive since march 6 the city is 40 miles from the 
border with pakistan where the insurgents have their headquarters 
the siege is the first major offensive by moslem guerrillas 
since soviet troops completed their withdrawal on feb 15 and ended 
their nine year intervention in afghanistans civil war 
government security forces still hold key cities but the 
insurgents backed mainly by pakistan and the united states 
reportedly control more than 90 percent of the ravaged countryside 
jalalabad with a prewar population of 67000 would give the 
guerrillas a strategic foothold to launch an attack on kabul 70 
miles to the west and advance their fight to establish an islamic 
republic

the juvenile justice system is too soft on the 
kind of brutal senseless crimes committed by a gang of youths who 
beat and gangraped a 28yearold woman in new yorks central park 
last week a congressman says 
what were saying is if youre going to do bigboy crime 
youre going to do bigboy time rep chuck douglas rnh said 
at a news conference thursday in which he called for harsher 
penalties for violent juvenile offenders 
douglas a former state supreme court justice was joined by 
members of the republican research committee task force on crime to 
discuss how the attack april 19 in central park highlights the need 
for changing the juvenile justice system 
i can tell you that we have a juvenile justice system that is 
modeled basically for the middle class douglas said the 
children of folks like us the children of the middle class who may 
get into trouble with shoplifting at a young age they may throw a 
rock through a window thats where the juvenile justice system 
works 
but the system does not work and its no deterrent and its 
no protection and shouldnt be for the kinds of kids who did what 
happened in central park 
but according to news accounts the youths suspected of 
committing the central park assault were average city kids 
teachers called them good students and one principal said of two 
of the boys they come from homes of parents who care parents 
who are as shocked as we are 
four of the suspects lived in a building with a doorman one 
played tuba in the school band another was described by teachers 
and classmates as a talented artist 
the congressmen said they were unhappy that in many states 
youngsters who commit violent crimes such as rape armed robbery 
murder or attempted murder get little more than a slap on the wrist 
what would happen in my home state of new mexico if a 13 and 
a 14 and a 15yearold were tried and convicted of kidnapping 
rape attempted murder and so forth asked rep steven schiff 
the answer is absolutely nothing more than reform school and be 
told not to do it again we believe thats based upon an 
erroneous assumption that juveniles in all cases are not 
responsible for their actions 
the task force is hoping by the end of the year to create model 
state legislation that would cause the most violent of juvenile 
offenders to receive the full punishment for their actions if 
theyre convicted said schiff a former district attorney the 
task force would strongly urge states to pass the model 
legislation he said 
and douglas said he hoped to pass his own carrot and stick 
bill that would withhold federal money for juvenile justice from 
states that fail to adopt their model 
in outlining their ideas for this model legislation none of the 
congressmen raised the possibility of rehabilitating violent 
offenders asked whether they were not writing off these youths 
schiff said in the many years that i was a criminal prosecutor 
and briefly a defense attorney i met individuals who i would call 
rehabilitated there was a common thread running through each of 
them they rehabilitated themselves 
rep melton d hancock rmo said he sometimes eats breakfast 
with the guards from the federal prison in springfield mo 
several of them have indicated to me that in their judgment 
some people are just plain mean and never should be released back 
on society he said theres not anything anybodys going to be 
able to do about it

the future of a state that masks its 
poverty with an image of fun food and crooked politics rides on a 
saturday referendum to give louisiana the power to change its tax 
system gov buddy roemer said 
roemers plan shifts the tax base putting more of a load on 
consumers and giving businesses incentives to move into the state 
and expand 
the plan also includes a 14 billion program to improve 
highways airports and shipping ports the transportation portion 
would be funded by a gasoline tax increase of 4 cents a gallon 
if the referendum is defeated the legislature would have to cut 
more than 600 million from an already tight budget which roemer 
said is impossible 
roemer has touted the plan as a way of creating jobs in a state 
that has the nations highest unemployment rate and ending 
louisianas dependence on the petroleum industry 
the governor who took office 13 months ago with a pledge to 
erase what lawmakers have called the states banana republic image 
wont predict victory 
what frightens me are those who might not look at the plan at 
all and be persuaded by something else in louisiana politics old 
wars old wounds old alliances business as usual roemer said 
thursday 
he said he also feared that opponents he did not name might 
spread street money a term for vote buying but he wouldnt 
elaborate 
two polls conducted over the past week vary in their results 
one poll showed 48 percent of 812 voters questioned backing the 
plan with 28 percent opposed and 25 percent undecided with 
numbers rounded and a margin of error of plus or minus 35 points 
a second poll says its too close to call of 750 voters 
questioned 40 percent were for the plan 38 percent against and 
22 percent undecided with a 36point margin of error 
secretary of state fox mckeithen said he expects more than 40 
percent of the states 2 million registered voters to cast ballots 
on the proposed constitutional amendment giving the legislature the 
power to change the tax system 
the plan promoted by businesses and other proponents in a 1 
million blitz of television and radio spots newspaper ads and 
mailed circulars would cost an extra 126 million over the current 
tax load 
opponents however point out that as of july 1 the tax load 
increase is 526 million 
last summer the legislature approved a oneyear sales tax 
increase of 500 million to avoid government bankruptcy the 
increase in the form of canceling longtime exemptions on purchases 
of food and utilities will expire july 1 
roemers package keeps about 400 million of that tax on a 
permanent basis 
white man speak with forked tongue state rep david duke 
said of roemer he says the plan is almost tax neutral without 
the gas tax but if it doesnt pass he says well have a 600 
million deficit he cant have it both ways 
duke a former ku klux klan leader was elected to the 
legislature in february and became the most vocal of the tax 
opponents who have raised about 60000 to fight the plan

a minister has withdrawn a boycott threat 
against an insurance company because it has apologized for its role 
in sponsoring an award for an artist whose work includes a 
depiction of christ submerged in urine 
i have received a statement from richard h jenrette chairman 
of the equitable life assurance society of the united states 
apologizing for their part in this matter and it is a genuine 
apology the rev donald wildmon a united methodist minister who 
heads the tupelobased american family association said thursday 
wildmon had threatened earlier this week to urge supporters to 
boycott the company for helping fund a 15000 award to andres 
serrano in the awards in the visual arts program the award is 
funded by the equitable foundation a division of the insurance 
company the rockefeller foundation and the national endowment for 
the arts 
as winner of the award the artist selects a work for a national 
tour the 38yearold new york artist said he had selected his 
piss christ photograph for the tour because it best reflected 
his style he uses fluids to affect photographic images 
wildmon said he had sought apologies from the sponsoring 
organizations 
jenrette in a statement confirmed by his office in new york 
said his society was deeply upset by the pain that has been 
caused by the work by andres serrano that was included in the 1988 
exhibit of the awards in the visual arts program 
as one of the sponsors of the program last year equitable is 
very sorry to have had its name associated with an offensive piece 
of work jenrette wrote please be assured that you have our 
sincere apologies and our commitment to take every precaution 
against such a situation in the future 
although wildmon said his association had not heard directly 
from the rockefeller foundation the organizations president 
peter goldmark said earlier in new york that he respected the 
right of any individual to object to a work of art and the 
parallel right of artists to express themselves and of exhibitors 
to show works that they deem interesting and meritorious 
artistically 
joseph slye a spokesman for the national endowment for the 
arts said tuesday that the endowment is expressly forbidden in 
its authorizing legislation from interfering with the artistic 
choices made by its grantees 
serrano who described himself as religious said in a telephone 
interview from new york on tuesday that when individuals such as 
wildmon attack a work of art to such a great extent they imbue 
it with a far greater power than when they ignore it and in that 
im flattered that they think it deserves such attention

many communist party officials are unprepared or 
unwilling to accept the swift changes wrought by the political 
reforms of president mikhail s gorbachev the party newspaper 
pravda said today 
the editorial followed by one day the newspapers publication of 
startling admissions of failure made by party officials at a 
meeting of the policymaking central committee on tuesday 
a senior western diplomat today said the publication of the 
admissions may have been a device used by gorbachev to force the 
officials to more solidly back his program of political 
restructuring known as perestroika 
pravda said political activity has rapidly increased over the 
past year and democratization is gaining ground 
in many cases however party organizations and functionaries 
have proved unprepared for the rapid progress in extending 
democracy the newspaper said a number of party committees and 
local governing councils are lagging behind the times in their 
attitudes styles methods and interpretation of events 
it said many officials were lapsing into old thinking 
nostalgia for authoritarian leadership and panicky attempts to 
check grassroots initiatives under the pretext of protecting 
socialism 
pravda called on all party members committees and organizations 
to follow the line of change initiated by gorbachev regardless of 
current difficulties facing the economy and society 
the diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said some of 
the 20 speakers at the central committee meeting may have been 
taken by surprise when gorbachev suggested their comments be 
published for the public to read 
the speeches were sharply critical of the party for example 
moscow mayor valery t saikin said the people feel 
uncomfortable alarmed have lost their optismism and various 
generations of people separate social levels and even regions are 
quarreling with themselves 
as a result said saikin who lost in the recent elections for 
the new congress of peoples deputies party organizations have 
lost their vanguard role 
gorbachev in closing remarks at the meeting tuesday agreed 
perestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages of 
housing consumer goods and food but the 58yearold leader said 
people still have faith in the party 
gorbachev gained strength to push for more extreme action at 
tuesdays meeting when 74 of the central committees 301 members 
retired 
because of age illness or political disgrace those who stepped 
down had lost the top government or party job that entitled them to 
membership the remarks of some of those who retired were published 
thursday 
among them was geidar a aliev the 65yearold former party 
chief in azerbaijan and a close associate of former president 
leonid i brezhnev 
news reports have accused aliev of corruption and falsifying 
records to show he was a war veteran but aliev told the central 
committee the accusations were untrue and came from people he had 
fired in azerbaijan for wrongdoing 
approximately three dozen party officials lost their bids for 
seats in the 2250seat parliament or congress of peoples 
deputies 
vladimir i melnikov the party chief of the komi region told 
the committee that many officials are so afraid of the peoples 
wrath that they are refusing to run in the next round of elections 
on may 14 
we are losing the workers he said the country is in a 
real crisis that gorbachev is not fully aware of because the 
central committee staff is safeguarding the general secretary 
from the severity of the situation 
because of the failures of perestroika the authority of the 
party is falling in the eyes of the public said ivan k 
polozkov a party leader in the krasnodar region of southern russia

students chanting yankee go home 
fought police with firebombs and rocks today after authorities 
banned a march to the north korean border and striking workers 
rioted in two southern cities 
several thousand radical students clashed with riot police on at 
least five campuses in seoul after the government banned a march to 
panmunjom border truce site 30 miles north of seoul for talks with 
communist students 
twenty student delegates were seized by police as they tried to 
get to the border to meet the north korean student delegates to 
discuss taking part in a youth festival in pyongyang in july and 
other ways to reunite the two nations 
about 6000 striking workers clashed with riot police in the 
southeastern industrial cities of masan and changwon police said 
strikers in changwon poured oil on some streets and set them ablaze 
and protesters in masan pelted police with bits of scrap metal 
it was the fifth day of clashes in changwon 
riot police blocked 4000 students trying to march out of seoul 
national university screaming students armed with metal and wood 
clubs attacked riot police with firebombs before troopers stormed 
onto the campus firing tear gas 
black police vans armed with multiple tear gas launchers fired 
hundreds of the bombs as fighting flared around the sprawling 
campus it was surrounded by 3000 riot police in green combat 
fatigues and visored helmets 
police officials said people were hurt but they had no figures 
students clashed with riot police on at least four other seoul 
campuses about 700 students battled troopers with firebombs and 
rocks for two hours at yonsei university 
student clashes also erupted in the southern port of pusan and 
radicals seized a government prosecutors office in taegu 
according to yonhap the south korean news agency 
student leaders lashed out at south korean president roh taewoo 
and the united states in rallies before the clashes accusing them 
of perpetuating the division of the korean peninsula speakers 
called for immediate unification with the communist north 
overthrow roh taewoo who blocked our vital march to the 
north for talks with north korean students lets raise a flag of 
antifacism and antiamericanism and march to pyongyang a leader 
said at seoul national university 
the government banned the march to panmunjom on grounds it posed 
a threat to public safety and the government alone has authority to 
deal with the rival north 
dissident leaders have said they will go ahead with planned 
antigovernment protests this weekend including plans for a major 
labor rally in seoul on sunday to mark the international may day 
labor holiday the government has banned all the demonstrations 
the radical students and allied dissident groups lack popular 
support because of their extremism and are not seen as a threat to 
the roh government 
but government leaders are concerned about growing labor unrest 
and a wave of increasingly violent strikes for better pay and 
improved working conditions top opposition leaders wednesday 
appealed to radical students and workers to halt protests and 
warned continued unrest could undermine democratic development in 
south korea 
also today 3400 police officers offered their resignations to 
protest an alleged assault on a police superintendent by an 
opposition lawmaker 
national police director jo chongsuk said he ordered all the 
resignations returned and government officials said his action 
would defuse the situation 
it arose after legislator sim wankoo reportedly slapped 
superintendent chung moonyoung in the face during a labor protest 
thursday in changwon 
dissident leaders claim roh is a front for military rule roh 
won elections in december 1987 after rival opposition candidates 
split the opposition vote

the governing party forced the budget through the 
lower house of parliament today over an opposition boycott opening 
the way for prime minister noboru takeshita to step down as 
promised because of a scandal 
it was the first time since world war ii that the governing 
liberal democratic party bucked the japanese tradition of consensus 
and used its majority to pass a budget despite a boycott 
chairwoman takako doi of the japan socialist party the largest 
opposition group said the move was an outrage and a serious 
challenge to the people 
she demanded the government resign and let the opposition govern 
we are determined to continue to fight until we win the 
dissolution of the diet parliament and get new elections 
called she said 
the deputy speaker of the lower house shinnen hatagaya said he 
would resign to protest the handling of the budget an independent 
lawmaker yukio aoshima told reporters he was quitting the upper 
house in a similar protest 
ms doi and the chairman of the democratic socialist party 
eiichi nagasue said the government was trying to cover up the 
influencepeddling scandal nagasue accused the government of an 
unjustifiable debasement of parliamentary democracy 
opposition politicians blocked the hall outside the house 
chamber in an attempt to halt the vote but guards pushed them 
aside to get speaker kenzaburo hara into the 512seat chamber 
after the 2811 vote one independent cast a no ballot 
takeshita bowed to the chamber which was nearly a third empty he 
promised on tuesday that we would resign after the budget has been 
enacted 
to be honest i am feeling relief but the budget still has to 
go through the upper house and i hope it will be passed quickly 
he told reporters later asked if he intends to stay in office 
until the passage takeshita said you can take it that way 
under the constitution the 455 billion budget automatically 
takes effect may 27 if the less powerful upper house does not act 
on it 
takeshita said he would step down to take responsibility for a 
bribery and stockprofiteering scandal that has deeply shaken the 
publics trust in government the scandal involving recruit co an 
information and publishing conglomerate has dominated japanese 
politics since it surfaced in june 
prosecutors say recruit sold unlisted stocks at bargain prices 
to about 160 political and business figures the buyers profited 
handsomely when the stock went public authorities say 
the only remaining hurdle to takeshitas resignation is 
selection of a successor 
takeshita planned a weeklong visit to southeast asian countries 
beginning saturday and observers believe he will leave office 
shortly afterward 
the apparent top choice of party leaders former foreign 
minister masayoshi ito 75 has refused suggestions he take the 
job he said again today the job is too heavy a burden for him 
because of his age and poor health 
ito is known as mr clean because of his humble political 
style he suffers from diabetes and government officials say his 
doctor has recommended he work no more than three hours a day 
earlier today takeshita attended the funeral of ihei aoki his 
top aide and fund controller who committed suicide wednesday aoki 
resigned last year after it was disclosed he had purchased 
bargainpriced stock from recruit 
this week takeshita admitted recruit loaned 384000 to his 
campaign in aokis name

radiation from soviet nuclear reactors 
powering spy satellites has been blinding scientific instruments 
aboard a ussatellite according to reports published today 
the blinding and its source have been known since 1980 but the 
us government classified the data as secret until last august 
scientists said in a series of five articles in science magazine 
the us solar maximum mission satellite was launched feb 14 
1980 to investigate among other things naturally occurring gamma 
rays in cosmic rays its instruments are being blinded sometimes 
eight times a day by gamma rays from the soviet satellite 
reactors the scientists said 
the blinding means that much of the data sought by the us 
satellite could not be gathered 
the soviet union has used nuclear reactors aboard more than 30 
satellites since the 1960s to provide electricity to power radars 
surveying the oceans for movements of us and other warships 
to save weight space satellites shield only their own equipment 
from the reactor the earths atmosphere prevents any radiation 
from reaching the ground 
much of the radiation in question is gamma rays these are 
photons produced in nuclear fission more powerful by far than light 
rays or xrays 
extremely energetic gamma rays also occur naturally in cosmic 
rays through processes that astronomers do not yet understand and 
in solar flares supernovae quasars and neutron stars are thought 
to be sources 
though reactorproduced gamma rays interfered with the us 
satellite instruments the main radiation affecting the satellite 
was electrons and positrons positively charged electrons from 
the reactor these charged particles can be trapped for several 
minutes by the earths magnetic field and positrons colliding with 
ordinary matter in the astronomy satellite are annihilated to yield 
more gamma rays 
the data storage capacity of the satellite instrument was 
saturated by such positrongamma ray signals an average of eight 
times a day for much of 1987 and 1988 and it was effectively 
blinded for the rest of each orbit until the data could be 
transmitted to the ground wrote joel r primack a professor at 
the institute for particle physics at the university of california 
at santa cruz in n overview article 
a ballooncarried instrument over australia in april 1988 
launched by a team from the university of california at riverside 
was immune from the electronpositron radiation because of its low 
altitude about 22 miles 
the flux we detected from the nearest reactor exceeded by 50 
times the flux expected from the strongest celestial sources 
wrote the riverside team 
the team estimated that it could detect such a reactor in an 
orbit as high as 1500 miles 
satellites could turn off their instruments when passing through 
vulnerable zones primack wrote but if many powerful reactors 
are in orbit as contemplated for advanced stages of star wars 
this approach would probably be inadequate to protect gammaray 
astronomy in low earth orbit he said 
most of the soviet satellites are in orbits only about 160 miles 
high where traces of the atmosphere would make them fall to earth 
after a few months the soviet craft are boosted to permanent 
orbits nearly 900 miles high after a few months use it was the 
failure of this boosting system that led to the crash of the cosmos 
954 satellite in canada in 1978 and the 1983 crash of the cosmos 
1402 in the south atlantic in 1983 
president carter proposed to ban reactors in space after the 
1978 accident but the soviet union refused primack suggested that 
now was a good time to renew the proposal

students at universities in beijing vowed today 
to continue a class boycott and campus wall posters proclaimed 
victory a day after more than 150000 students and supporters 
marched triumphantly for democracy 
the strike must go on read a new poster at beijing normal 
university on the fifth day of the boycott 
we must persist until final victory read another at 
peoples university 
the government announced thursday it was willing to talk with 
students about their demands for greater freedom but student 
leaders rejected a stipulation that talks be conducted through 
official student groups 
protesters at most schools rejected the groups as nondemocratic 
and formed their own unions which the government says are illegal 
student leaders from several schools met today to discuss 
strategy 
we talked about the march but didnt come to any decisions 
one leader at beijing normal university said on condition of 
anonymity right now we are savoring this victory we have made 
the communist party bend 
wang dan a student leader at beijing university said they 
hoped the talks would be held soon and wanted to meet premier li 
peng 
he is the leader of the government and he should hear all the 
views of the citizens he said 
newspapers throughout china carried a xinhua news agency story 
saying only 30000 students marched thursday 
but the 20mile march through the streets of beijing drew more 
than 150000 students workers and city residents calling for a 
free press and political reforms it was communist chinas largest 
protest in modern times and lasted 15 hours 
the march occurred after an editorial in the peoples daily 
called the student movement a chaotic disturbance and accused 
students of being unpatriotic 
the unrest began after the death of ousted communist party 
leader hu yaobang on april 15 the party fired him in 1987 for 
failing to crack down on prodemocracy demonstrations in late 1986 
protesters who led the march thursday carried a poster saying 
uphold the righteous leaders of the party 
significantly todays xinhua report did not accuse the students 
of wanting the overthrow of the government most students say they 
only want the leaders to do their job better and respect human 
rights 
television today showed the first footage of the march the 
report also repeated warnings the protest was illegal and 
organizers were breaking the law 
the peoples daily the official communist party newspaper 
published an overview of the two weeks of protests apparently to 
pacify students 
the article denied students had been beaten in beijing last week 
when they staged a sitin at the gates of the communist party 
headquarters an associated press reporter saw police hit at least 
six students 
the article also attempted to dispel a rumor that a female 
student had been killed the woman it said was hit by a car as 
she returned from the protest many students believe police killed 
her although it appeared the newspapers account was correct 
the country most liberal newspaper the shanghai world economic 
herald resumed publication today after the city government fired 
its chief editor qin benli and installed in his place city 
propaganda official liu ji 
todays issue is an altered version of a withheld april 24 
edition which carried six pages honoring hu 
the items the government said were likely to cause 
disturbances have been taken out one of the papers editors said 
during thursdays march tens of thousands of beijing residents 
escorted students on bicycles and on foot and tried to shield them 
from soldiers and police 
were opening a road for them said one worker after he 
helped push through a line of officers 
police had issued harsh warnings against marches but the 
security forces were unarmed and they gave up after pushing matches 
failed to stop advancing demonstrators 
students say they plan another march may 4 the 70th anniversary 
of chinas first student movement for democracy the movement grew 
out of students opposition to japans territorial advances in 
china after world war i but developed into a quest for broader 
political goals including democracy

visiting vice president dan quayle has 
angered the government with his insistence that us wheat 
subsidies are not hurting australia prompting one newspaper today 
to say read our lips mr quayle australians are not happy 
senior government sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said prime minister bob hawke was exasperated at quayles 
intransigence and that he became agitated and tense during their 
talks on wednesday 
quayle at a news conference thursday bluntly refused to accept 
hawkes assertion that australia had a declining share of the world 
wheat market because of us subsidies known as the export 
enhancement program 
it is still my belief that us trade policy isnt hurting 
australia quayle said adding that the subsidies were directed 
against the european community and not targeted at australia 
but hawke told reporters later if a bullet hits you in the 
head it hurts just as much if it was not aimed at you as if it was 
aimed 
quayle argued that us trade subsidies were designed to counter 
ec subsidies while hawke said they affected australias wheat sales 
to china the soviet union egypt iraq mexico sri lanka and 
yemen he said australia had suffered a very significant loss 
of exports to those countries 
he cited a 91 percent loss in exports to the soviet union and a 
21 percent loss in sales to china overall australian wheat sales 
have fallen from an annual high of 186 million tons to 125 
million tons since the us subsidy program took effect 
now these sorts of things are not figments of our imagination 
they are cold hard and brutally hurtful economic statistics which 
have adversely affected our farmers our wheat farmers hawke 
said 
trade negotiations minister michael duffy was more direct 
saying if mr quayle after a fulsome briefing by the prime 
minister cant grasp the situation then there is little hope for 
him 
the countrys main nationally circulated newspaper the 
australian said in its editorial today who do you think you are 
kidding mr quayle read our lips mr quayle australians are not 
happy 
quayle arrived wednesday on the first leg of a fournation tour 
of the pacific and the far east he is visiting australia through 
sunday to attend celebrations marking the 47th anniversary of the 
battle of the coral sea 
officials said trade was the single most important issue 
that australia had to raise with the vice president hawke and 
quayle met for 90 minutes on wednesday 
hawke is to visit the united states in june and the sources said 
he would raise trade issues in his talks with president bush

the communist party has restored membership to 
dissident historian roy a medvedev whose writings about the 
personality cult of dictator josef stalin prompted his expulsion in 
1969 tass said today 
medvedev asked that the partys central committee control 
committee restore him as a member and the request was approved 
the official news agency said it did not say when this occurred 
in a telephone interview the 63yearold writer said he reacted 
positively to the news asked if his restoration was a result 
of president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms he said i didnt 
change my views a turnabout occurred in the party the central 
committee they stopped discriminating against me i have been 
published here 
he added that he never considered asking to be restored as a 
party member during the rule of president leonid i brezhnev 
because that was another epoch brezhnev died in 1982 
medvedev said party officials asked him several months ago if he 
wanted to become a member again they asked me how i would react 
and i said i would not object 
like many soviets who had fallen out of official favor medvedev 
has been restored gradually to good graces he has appeared at 
several officially sponsored news conference and was elected april 
9 as a deputy to the new soviet parliament the congress of 
peoples deputies 
tass said it was medvedevs book let history judge about 
stalins crimes that prompted his expulsion from the party but 
that the control committee determined that action was unfounded 
and restored his membership 
let history judge which medvedev started writing in 1962 
was published first abroad in the united states in 1971 it didnt 
appear in the soviet union until this year when the literary 
journal znamya published the first part of the book in january 
the entire book an indictment of stalins dictatorial rule is 
scheduled to be put out by the soviet unions progress publishers 
under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness it is no longer considered dissent to condemn stalin or 
report his crimes in fact the soviet press is full of articles 
about stalins personality cult 
medvedev has estimated that 40 million soviets were either 
killed arrested or otherwise repressed under stalin and his 
figure along with his remarks about stalin has appeared in the

a un official said today that large 
numbers of guerrillas have left namibia and returned to angola 
after clashes with south africanled troops that jeopardized a plan 
for the territorys independence 
cedric thornberry secondincommand of the un monitoring 
force in namibia told reporters that substantial numbers of 
guerrillas had left northern namibia since midday wednesday he 
gave no figures 
south africa which has agreed to end its 74year rule over 
namibia claimed that about 1600 guerrillas of the southwest 
africa peoples organization crossed into the territory from angola 
beginning april 1 
the resulting clashes with south africanled security forces 
resulted in the deaths of 305 guerrillas and 27 members of the 
security force according to south african officials 
under a regional peace plan that provides for namibias 
independence the guerrillas were supposed to have remained at 
their bases in angola until midmay when they were to return 
unarmed 
guerrilla leaders have denied violating the agreement and said 
some of their forces already were in namibia 
to encourage the guerrillas withdrawal south africa has 
confined its forces in northern namibia to their bases for a 
60hour period that began wednesday evening and is to end at 
daybreak saturday 
south african officials have made clear they want a full 
guerrilla withdrawal by the end of the period although they have 
not disclosed what steps they would take if they believe guerrillas 
remain in namibia 
guerrilla leaders in a statement issued thursday said 1337 
guerrillas had redeployed from namibia to angola the statement 
did not specify the period during which this withdrawal occurred 
nor did it say how many guerrillas remained in namibia 
if both swapos figures and south africas estimate about the 
size of the incursion are accurate there would be few if any 
guerrillas still in the territory 
swapo said its guerrillas have been running the gantlet of 
south africa troops ambushes as well as a blockade along the 
namibiaangola border where south africa has deployed a division of 
its troops to hunt down and kill them the statement said all 
guerrillas in namibia would soon move to angola as long as security 
forces do not impede their way 
the independence plan is part of an agreement that also provides 
for withdrawal of south african and cuban forces from angola us 
soviet angolan cuban and south african delegations met thursday 
and today in cape town south africa to discuss the status of the 
accord 
in cape town roving soviet ambassador vyacheslav ustinov 
predicted today that the regional peace process would be back to 
normal within a month 
ustinov making the first official soviet visit to south africa 
in 33 years said i believe that we can make a step in the riht 
direction and at least we have succeeded in clarifying a number of 
very delicate points and overcome some difficulties but still a 
lot is left

foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher today urged nato allies to seek a reduction in shortrange 
nuclear missiles despite strident us and british opposition 
for the second day the nations leaders appeared on a 
nationally televised parliamentary session to outline their 
position which has strained the alliance italy belgium denmark 
and norway have sided with bonn in the growing rift most of natos 
shortrange missiles are based in west germany 
a government spokesman hans klein said dutch premier ruud 
lubbers will visit bonn on wednesday for talks with chancellor 
helmut kohl in an apparent bid to resolve the dispute before a nato 
summit next month 
the dutch government has expressed support for the us and 
british position and has offered to mediate in the dispute 
the west has no reason to be timid or to be concerned 
genscher said in his address rather genscher said western 
nations should have the confidence to pursue a course that would 
include shortrange missiles among the various arms already under 
discussion among the superpowers 
we must courageously and decisively make use of the new 
openness the soviet union is showing said genscher a member of 
the detenteoriented centrist free democratic party we must 
close that hole in the disarmament chain 
speaking of the west german demand for negotiations aimed at 
reducing the number of shortrange missiles genscher said we 
can see that we are finding more and more understanding for this 
position within the whole alliance 
defense minister gerhard stoltenberg spoke after genscher and 
also emphasized that west germany remains bound to nato 
stoltenberg said it was totally unfounded to say that kohls 
government could accept a loosening of ties between bonn and its 
western allies 
kohl on thursday made a speech before parliament in which he 
reaffirmed his call for talks with moscow over the shortrange 
missiles 
such talks are strongly opposed by the united states and 
britain which fear the negotiations could lead to the removal of 
shortrange weapons and leave western europe dangerously exposed to 
warsaw pacts superior conventional forces 
public opinion polls indicate a large majority of west germans 
are opposed to the modernization of the weapons 
the issue is causing a division among nato allies before the may 
2930 summit in brussels where the western alliance hopes to reach 
a common position on the missiles 
kohl is scheduled to meet with prime minister margaret thatcher 
of britain on sunday when the two are expected to discuss the 
issue thatcher has strongly criticized kohls proposal for talks 
with the warsaw pact 
the united states has launched a diplomatic offensive against 
kohls proposal instructing its ambassadors in nato countries to 
present arguments against starting up negotiations on shortrange 
weapons 
kohls government has been losing support among voters and the 
call for talks is designed to improve its standing before next 
years federal elections 
kohl also has called on the north atlantic treaty organization 
to delay a decision on replacing the aging shortrange lance 
nuclear missiles until after federal elections next year 
recent polls indicate that threequarters of the west german 
population favors eliminating nuclear weapons in europe

a bitter 18month effort by the united 
auto workers to organize the mack trucks inc assembly plant ended 
with 53 percent of the employees voting to accept union 
representation 
mack trucks said it would contest thursdays election which the 
uaw won with 453 votes to 398 for the company an employee group 
which offered to represent workers received two votes 
it is totally on hold until it is settled company 
spokeswoman deb woolley said mack is not finished fighting this 
battle we are looking at the unlawful practices of the uaw and 
challenged ballots 
the uaw urged mack trucks president and chief executive officer 
john b curcio to accept the election results 
the present opportunity to change direction should not be 
ignored the uaw said in a letter to curcio the alternative is 
further unnecessary damage to the uawmack relationship 
observers predicted the outcome of the election could affect the 
way business is conducted in south carolina which historically has 
ranked among the least unionized states 
gov carroll campbell moved quickly to assure business owners 
and workers that righttowork labor laws will not change in 
south carolina 
those who desire to join a union are free to do so those who 
do not desire to join a union are equally free not to do so 
campbell said in a statement 
uaw organizer robert miller said employees who do not join the 
union will be treated the same as those who do 
in a righttowork state we have a right to defend the 
people he said they have the right to join the union 
we worked hard and we prayed bill casstevens international 
secretary and treasurer of the uaw told employees at a victory 
celebration thursday night over the vote at the 1yearold plant 
were bringing in democracy into this plant and south carolina 
david mann a 44yearold union organizer who has worked for 
mack trucks for 17 years said he was ecstatic but not 
surprised at the election results 
and leonard drabick a worker in the plant said he does not 
foresee any problems with having the union 
were still a team we all stick together we have one goal 
and that is to build trucks drabick said im happy im glad 
we got it 
chick harrocks a unit manager for mack trucks said he was 
disappointed with the election results the employees dont 
realize what they got into he said 
the uaw which represents 1800 mack employees in maryland 
pennsylvania and new jersey began its drive in 1987 to represent 
employees at the winnsboro plant the plant opened after mack 
closed its main assembly plant in allentown pa in 1986 
under an agreement between the company and the uaw nearly 300 
employees were transferred to the south carolina plant those 
employees each have received 100 weekly from the union to defray 
moving expenses and lower wages 
employees at the winnsboro plant will earn 10 per hour by the 
end of the summer workers at the other three unionrepresented 
mack facilities make about 1450 an hour

the government indicated today it may soften its 
stand on a controversial plan to jointly develop its next fighter 
jet with the united states news reports said 
the defense agency has decided to retract its demand that more 
than 50 percent of engine production work be given to japan and 
that japan receive all computer software for flight control of the 
us f16 which is the basis for the new fsx jet asahi shimbun 
newspaper reported 
the defense agency chief kichiro tazawa told reporters today 
he hopes to reach agreement with the united states before prime 
minister noboru takeshita leaves office takeshitas announcement 
tuesday that he will resign soon because of a stock and bribery 
scandal brought new uncertainty to already troubled plans for the 
fsx us officials said 
the asahi shimbun newspaper said the director of the defense 
agencys equipment bureau returned thursday from talks in 
washington and his agency consulted today with the foreign 
ministry the ministry of international trade and industry and the 
prime ministers office to work out a unified policy 
the fsx project has been criticized by some us congressmen who 
charge it is a giveaway of us technology that japanese companies 
could use to compete with the us aviation industry 
supporters say the project is a way to add fighters to japans 
inventory in strategic northeast asia at tokyos expense it also 
would provide jobs for the united states and give washington 
access to sophisticated radar technology developed by japan they 
say 
the bush administration says it wants clarification of a joint 
production agreement reached last year 
japan reportedly demanded 50 percent of engine production work 
in exchange for giving the united states a 40 percent share of the 
production work for the entire aircraft 
the united states reportedly wants assurances any new technology 
developed from the project will be available to the united states 
along with protection for usdeveloped computer codes that help 
fly and control the plane

a twa boeing 747 flying from los angeles to london 
with more than 200 people on board lost part of a wing slat as it 
prepared to land at heathrow airport the airline said today 
the department of transport said officers from the air accident 
investigation bureau have launched an inquiry into the april 20 
incident which a twa spokesman called a minor accident 
aviation experts said the loss of a slat may affect low speed 
handling and might mean an aircraft having to land at a faster 
speed 
the leading edge slats are six feet long and positioned along 
the front of each wing to increase lift they are operated 
hydraulically to change the air flow over the wing and allow the 
aircraft to land at a slower speed 
a twa spokesman who demanded anonymity said a twofoot piece 
of the slat between the fuselage and the no 3 engine on the right 
wing fell off after a bolt sheared the shearing forced up the 
flap breaking off a section of it the spokesman said 
however he said the damage did not cause any problems with the 
handling of the aircraft and denied there had been any emergency 
it did not affect the aerodynamics of the aircraft and the 
plane made a perfectly safe landing the pilot would probably not 
have been aware that anything was wrong until he had landed it 
was a perfectly routine landing he said 
the spokesman said the piece that fell off would have weighed 
about four pounds he said authorities were notified when the piece 
was discovered missing it has not been found he said 
it is impossible to say exactly where it was lost because the 
crew felt no bump or anything like that it would have been when 
the aircraft was on approach because the slats are only used when 
the plane is coming in to land he said 
the aircraft was taken to the british airways maintenance base 
for repairs 
the twa spokesman said that he did not know the age of the 
aircraft or the exact number of passengers on flight 760

a man who kept hospital workers at bay with a gun 
while tearfully removing his comatose son from life support systems 
and letting him die dramatized an ethical issue waiting to 
happen a law professor says 
rudy linares 23 is charged with firstdegree murder and on 
thursday was ordered to undergo a psychiatric examination by a 
judge who called his case an extraordinary situation surrounded 
by extraordinary circumstances 
i want to know if he is any danger to himself or anyone 
else said cook county judge robert bastone before setting 
another hearing for may 18 
linares free on 75000 personal recognizance bond refused to 
talk to reporters 
defense lawyer richard scholz said linares who told police i 
did it because i love my son will plead innocent 
scholz met briefly with prosecutors today in the chambers of 
chief criminal court judge thomas fitzgerald and worked out an 
agreement to delay until may 3 the appearance dates for those 
subpoenaed said lisa howard spokeswoman for cook county states 
attorney cecil partee 
ms howard would not comment further because of the 
confidentiality surrounding grand jury proceedings but a 
lawenforcement source with knowledge of the case said linares 
wife and several other family members had received subpoenas to 
appear before the grand jury possibly as early as today 
partee on thursday confirmed his intention to prosecute linares 
but suggested there could be a compassionate kind of justice 
partee said he could understand the emotions that a parent feels 
at seeing the suffering of an incurably ill child 
but we must be reasonable and say i think that under no 
circumstances does any person have the right to take the life of 
another he said during the thursday taping of a radio show to be 
aired sunday 
richard epstein a university of chicago law professor and 
fellow at the schools center for medical ethics said that 
charging linares with murder was wrong and called the case an 
issue waiting to happen 
doctors have an exaggerated sense of the sacred nature of 
life epstein said it seems to me he should have been able to 
write a letter to the hospital saying please turn off the 
respirator very truly yours 
other ethicists also expressed sympathy for the father of two 
other children who along with his wife had asked months ago for 
life support to be withdrawn from their 16month old son samuel 
the parents had been refused 
the boy had been unconscious and not expected to recover since 
august when he swallowed a balloon at a birthday party said his 
physician dr gilbert goldman director of pediatric intensive 
care at rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center where 
wednesdays incident occurred 
goldman said i was personally and professionally 
sympathetic with the linares request to withdraw life support 
but i didnt believe there was a legal option to allow me to act 
on the basis of their request 
max brown legal counsel for the hospital said that because of 
illinois childabuse laws the only way the institution could have 
complied would have been if samuel had been determined totally 
braindead or his heart and lungs had stopped functioning 
arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at 
the university of minnesota said i have sympathy for this 
father because it seems to me he felt he had no choice but to act 
on what he felt was best for this child at the point of a gun 
i still think he should be prosecuted i dont think you can 
use weapons to direct medical treatment caplan said in a 
telephone interview from minneapolis 
but i have sympathy because i think society has not made it 
possible for parents to be heard about when medical treatment 
should be stopped when it is futile for very young children 
caplan said 
police said linares entered the hospital intensive care unit at 
about 1 am wednesday and unhooked the respirator of his son while 
holding hospital workers off with a 357caliber magnum handgun 
linares a house painter in cicero surrendered the gun as soon 
as he was sure the boy was dead authorities said his wife 
tamara was out of the room at the time 
authorities said linares also disconnected the respirator in 
december but it was quickly replaced and he was not charged 
because the hospital did not call police

president bush said today he learned a lot 
from his justcompleted sixstate tour designed to enhance his 
activist image 100 days into his tenure and took a slap at 
unflattering reporting of the trip 
in terms of problemsolving washington does not 
automatically know best bush told a gathering of the 
conservative american legislative exchange council a 
businessoriented group of state legislators 
apparently referring to news accounts that described his trip as 
themeless disoriented and jumbled bush said 
its a very important thing for a president to get outside the 
white house and move around this country some of the friends that 
we were traveling with didnt seem to understand that but i can 
tell you that i learned a lot from it and it was a very good thing 
to do and im going to keep doing it 
the trip was timed to project bush as an active problemsolver 
just as the media assess his first 100 days of his presidency a 
white house aide said thursday 
although bush has said he is indifferent to the milestone 
hes making these appearances even before some of these 100day 
stories are getting out said the official he discussed the 
strategy on grounds of anonymity 
other white house aides called the trip a success despite an 
aura of confusion caused by scheduling foulups and unfocused 
presidential speeches 
sometimes just the idea of getting out of washington is 
part of the presidents responsibility and role chief of staff 
john sununu said thursday he really feels its important for him 
to go out and let the folks see him the president gets a lot out 
of it 
sununu conceded that bushs speeches on several occasions 
garnered little coverage on the heavily watched national television 
evening news shows but he said you dont always focus just on 
trying to get 15 seconds or 30 seconds on the national news the 
regional aspect is very critical 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater denied that bushs 
trip lacked any overriding theme the nation could focus on saying 
that the theme is building a better america 
bush began the trip monday by attending a memorial service in 
norfolk va for the 47 victims of the uss iowa explosion this 
was added to an alreadyheavy schedule monday that had bush 
declaring himself off to a good start in a speech to associated 
press newspaper publishers in chicago 
the trip took bush to illinois north dakota california texas 
and florida 
he wanted to get to california to talk about some of the major 
issues such as research and development for high technology and 
a reduction in the capital gains tax but bush dropped plans to 
talk about offshore oil drilling because of the valdez oil spill 
aides said privately 
sununu said bush had been especially determined to hit hard on 
the administrations campaign to attack drug abuse 
most americans feel its a critical issue the chief of 
staff said and he wants to make sure he can do what he can to 
help coordinate 
as part of that attempt bush visited a 213acre ranch in the 
orange county hillside that had been turned into a sophisticated 
drugtrafficking clearinghouse replete with hidden chutes and trap 
doors to conceal the merchandise 
on thursday before flying home to washington he sat at one of 
a dozen multiscreen consoles at a coast guard druginterdiction 
communications center in miami and watched a simulated drug bust in 
which narcoticsrunning boats and planes were tracked and 
apprehended 
bush has sought to minimize the significance of reaching the 
100day threshold which will arrive sunday saying he succeeded a 
man he served for eight years as vice president and that he never 
intended substantial changes in the first months of his presidency 
sununu said the next 100 days will see bush heavily involved in 
the nato summit in brussels and the sevennation economic summit in 
paris in july also he said bush will focus heavily on trying to 
push ahead with a more lasting budgetdeficit agreement and will 
work to see through congress his proposals to save the beleaguered 
savings and loan industry 
the president also likely will spend time defending an expected 
veto of legislation that congress is expected to pass raising the 
minimum wage from the current 335anhour rate to 465 bush 
believes the rate should be no higher than 425 
sununu acknowledged that a package of crime legislation to 
assist in the drugcrusade is not yet ready for announcement by the 
white house or introduction in congress

a panamanian official today accused the 
united states of trying to provoke chaos in his country prior to 
national elections as an excuse for us military intervention 
jorge ritter panamas foreign minister said washington has 
given millions of dollars to opposition candidates and said the 
us army has sent special urban warfare units to its bases in the 
canal zone 
american plans to interfere in the panamanian electoral 
process have entered a phase of direct participation by the united 
states with the goal of disturbing the public order and propagating 
chaos prompting general destabilization in the country around the 
time of the elections to create an excuse for military 
intervention he told the security council 
ritter implied that if the opposition did not defeat the 
progovernment candidates us armed forces would foment disorder 
and back a coup attempt 
us ambassador thomas pickering replied that panama was 
concocting claims of us interference to conceal its lack of 
freedom and its apparent intention to conduct fraudulent 
elections on may 7 pickering said the government of gen manuel 
antonio noriega is doctoring voting lists and restricting the entry 
of journalists and independent election observers 
noriega the armed forces commander and de facto ruler of 
panama is backing carlos alberto duque for the presidency against 
opposition candidate guillermo endara endara has denied that his 
democratic alliance campaign has received any us money 
two vice presidents 67 assembly representatives and 510 local 
representatives also will be chosen 
noriega was indicted on federal drug charges in florida in 
february 1988 panamanian president eric arturo delvalle then tried 
to fire him and noriega had the national assembly oust delvalle 
noriega has blamed the united states for all panamas problems 
and accused washington of trying to renege on a treaty to transfer 
control of the panama canal to panama by the end of the century

pow bam zap thud 
so goes starmites the futuristic comic book musical that 
arrived thursday at broadways criterion center 
the show purports to be a salute to the fabled scifi 
superheroes of dc and marvel comics instead it trashes them 
trampling on their sense of fun style and most of all adventure 
dont look for the exuberance george lucas captured on film more 
than a decade ago in star wars or the innocent dumb fun of the 
mid1950s superman television series starring george reeves 
they are missing here 
barry keating who wrote the music and lyrics for starmites 
and stuart ross who along with keating concocted the book cant 
settle on the right tone for their meager story it vacillates 
between high camp and sappy juvenile comedy 
the tale concerns a young girl eleanor who lives in her own 
fantasy world of comic books shes pulled into inner space 
earths parallel dimension and a meeting with the starmites who 
are sort of an intergalactic version of the guardian angels 
these good guys are led by spacepunk played by brian lane green 
who bears an uncanny resemblance to star wars hero harrison 
ford green acts with the same breezy and appealing nonchalance and 
has a good voice too 
eleanor is played by liz larsen whose show business savvy and 
brash belting style of selling a song are at odds with her 
supposedly waiflike character 
they end up meeting trinkulus a lizardlike creature who sings 
what sounds like offkey softrock madrigals and diva the tough 
brassy leader of the banshees as played by sharon mcnight diva 
resembles the late drag artist divine only her crew cut is a 
little more punkish miss mcnight certainly can put over a number 
her hard to be diva pretty much stops the show although it 
wasnt going much of anywhere 
the villain of the piece a steelplated warrior called shak 
graa looks like a tincan version of darth vader and sounds like 
the phantom of the opera with a head cold 
the minimal plot includes a feeble love triangle involving 
spacepunk eleanor and divas daughter bizarbara also played by 
miss larsen you may not care who wins out but true love does 
triumph in the end 
at least director larry carpenter gets the actors through the 
dialogue quickly and choreographer michele assaf has experly 
drilled the cast but its hard to judge their expertise when they 
are forced to jump around on stage to something called the dance 
of spousal arousal 
the productions special effects are negligible set designer 
lowell detweiler has provided a nice backdrop of twinkly stars but 
the rest of his designs including a giant bird that unfolds its 
wings to reveal a throne are suprisingly tacky 
the costumes are worse especially for the women diva and her 
quartet of leatherclad ladiesinwaiting are dressed by designer 
susan hirschfeld to look like extras out of ilsa the shewolf of 
the ss 
keatings score slips from memory as soon as its heard its 
cartoonish in the worst sense crude and obvious the music and 
lyrics have none of the wit and sophistication that charles strouse 
and lee adams displayed in its a bird its a plane its 
superman one of the theaters most unjustly neglected scores 
or the broadway professionalism that strouse and martin charnin 
managed to pack into annie 
starmites is the first production at the criterion center 
stage right one part of a new theater complex in times square its 
other theater a cabaret space housed suds a lamentable 
celebration of golden oldies last fall what suds did to those 
hits of the 1950s and 60s starmites does to the comics 
wheres little lulu now that we really need her 
what other critics said 
clive barnes in the new york post wrote the trouble with it 
even before the music and lyrics is the idea it is a foolish 
idea for a musical and nothing in the theater can redeem folly 
except a circus and this is no circus 
howard kissel in the daily news said in the last few years a 
whole new genre has emerged musicals that have no intrinsic merit 
but are suitable for leaving the kids while you go shopping 
in this genre you have cats starlight express and now 
starmites in this genre you dont judge a musical by its 
content but rather by its visuals will they live up to the 
expectations of kids suckled on mtv here starmites is a sort of 
trailblazer the style of the show is tacky hightech surely a 
new category with loads of potential 
mel gussow of the new york times wrote to its credit 
starmites never takes itself too seriously and is always tongue 
in cheek it remains a lighthearted space flight

a runaway greenhouse effect has 
eliminated any trace of water volcanoes number not in the hundreds 
or thousands but the hundreds of thousands its crushing 
atmospheric pressure suffice it to say could never support 
anything resembling human life 
venus is not exactly kansas 
for eight months beginning in august 1990 the space probe 
magellan will circle the second planet from the sun using 
computerenhanced radar images to study a planet so inhospitable 
that its 900degree surface temperature would melt lead 
yet for all its alien qualities scientists think the magellan 
mission will yield valuable information about the formation of 
earth 
the most likely scenario is that well find something that 
will completely astound and baffle us said steve saunders 
magellans chief scientist at nasas jet propulsion laboratory in 
pasadena the craft was being ferried into space aboard the shuttle 
atlantis to be launched from earth orbit on its 15month 
trajectory to venus 
pictures from magellan should help scientists deduce the 
probability youre going to find earthlike planets and life 
somewhere else said geologist laurence soderblom a scientist 
working on the magellan project 
peering through acidladen clouds magellan should give 
scientists their best look yet at a planet so outwardly different 
from the garden of earth yet apparently shaped by the same geologic 
processes 
of all the planets in the solar system venus is most like our 
own earth in size mass and distance from the sun nasa says 
among the common forces scientists say are volcanic eruptions 
meteorite impacts and perhaps continental drift the evolutionary 
movement of huge land masses magellan will also look for evidence 
of wind and water erosion and test the bounds of venus gravity 
the image of venus formed by pictures taken from earlier us 
and soviet space probes is of a planet where molten rock lies so 
close to the solid crust surface that impacting meteorites might 
produce volcanic eruptions where hundreds of thousands of 
volcanoes stretch for thousands of miles across lowland plains 
where continentsized highlands sprout mountains dwarfing everest 
magellan once it begins orbiting venus on aug 10 1990 will 
look for ancient stream channels shorelines and other evidence the 
planet once may have had oceans scientists believe an unchecked 
greenhouse effect in which the carbon dioxide atmosphere 
acted like greenhouse glass and trapped solar heat raised the 
temperature until water disappeared 
its a 550million project with the scientific world watching 
part of the answer is knowing whether earth is a fluke or just 
one of the natural consequences of the evolution of a generic solar 
system said soderblom who works for the us geological survey 
in flagstaff ariz 
scientists will probe the gravity forces of venus by plotting 
the path of magellan as it swoops to within 155 miles of the 
planets surface and then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4977 
miles 
in looking for similarities between venus and earth scientists 
begin by noting that they are roughly the same size weight and 
distance from the sun and are both bigger than earths moon 
mercury and mars 
heavenly bodies are a lot like potatoes the big ones stay hot 
for a long time and the little ones cool off quickly said 
saunders himself a geologist 
the moon mercury and mars have cold surfaces free of 
continental drift because a planets internal heat drives the 
geological machinery however scientists believe venus and earth 
both give off heat through volcanic activity and movements of 
gargantuan pieces of rock along the planetary crust saunders said 
magellan should help scientists learn if any of the venusian 
volcanoes are still erupting and how crustal rock movements differs 
from that on earth 
rock in earths crust is created and recycled in a conveyorbelt 
manner hot crustal rock is born along midocean ridges undersea 
mountain chains thousands of miles long new crust is pushed away 
from these ridges as more rock emerges the crust eventually 
collides with lighter continental rock such as at the subduction 
zone where pacific seafloor rock sinks beneath alaska washington 
and oregon 
heat is released as sinking rock melts creating volcanoes 
earth releases most of its heat at midocean ridges and 
subduction zones saunders and gerald schaber another usgs 
geologist believe venus loses its internal heat mostly through 
hot spot volcanoes 
on earth such volcanoes form where molten rock rises through 
thin parts of the crust such as in hawaii but theres evidence 
that venus has crustal movement similar to earth and that the 
volcanic ranges may be the venusian equivalent of earths midocean 
ridges 
no one yet has found conclusive evidence of subduction zones on 
venus in places however folded mountains and valleys are 
squeezed up against venus continentlike highlands aphrodite and 
ishtar the latter of which has mountains taller than everest 
these regions look something like earths himalayas mountains 
formed when india smashed into china so crustal movements on venus 
may be thinskinned forming folded mountains without large 
chunks of crustal rock diving deep into the planet schaber said 
if large plates of venus crustal rock are in motion you can 
bet theres venusquakes he added

more than threequarters of people 
trying to quit smoking were able to do so with the help of nicotine 
patches in a study at the mayo clinic researchers reported today 
in a sixweek study that started last fall 77 percent of the 
people who wore nicotine patches had stopped smoking said dr 
richard hurt director of mayos smoking cessation center and one 
of the investigators 
the silverdollarsized patches slowly release nicotine through 
the skin to the bloodstream a control group in the study wore 
patches not treated with nicotine and only 39 percent of them quit 
smoking 
there were remarkable differences between the two groups 
hurt said 
while cautioning that a longterm followup study is needed 
hurt said the patch could be a remarkable advancement as a tool 
for helping people stop smoking 
the patch similar to those used for dispensing some kinds of 
medicine contains 30 milligrams of nicotine about 1 milligram of 
nicotine is absorbed through the skin every hour so smokers are 
better able to cope with the withdrawal symptoms associated with 
quitting smoking 
the mayo clinic is one of four centers studying the patch for 
possible food and drug administration approval results of mayos 
study of 62 people were the first to be reported and were to be 
released today during a national conference of the american medical 
society on alcohol and other drug dependencies in atlanta 
other studies have shown an 8 percent quitting rate over a 
oneyear period among people who use such methods as physicians 
advice nicotine gum and selfhelp programs to try to quit smoking 
the oneyear quitting rate has been about 25 percent to 30 percent 
among those who participate in a formal smoking cessation program 
the patch was developed by elan pharmaceutical company in 
gainesville ga hurt said researchers are not sure how long it may 
take before the nicotine patch if it proves successful will be 
available for commercial use

gil shaham was at his new york city high school 
reciting chaucer when he received a summons that seemed straight 
out of the storybooks 
israeli violin virtuoso itzhak perlman had an ear infection and 
couldnt perform at two london concerts and shaham was asked to 
stand in on two days notice 
the first of the concerts ended thursday night with cheers and 
flowers for the 18yearold violinist after his performance of the 
difficult violin concerto no 1 by max bruch 
this is something ive never had before said shaham 
perspiring in his dressing room at the royal festival hall 
afterward as he stared at the basket of flowers 
shaham from the bronx was reciting the prologue from chaucers 
the canterbury ttales in an english examination at horace mann 
high school on tuesday when he was called out and asked to fly to 
london next day 
shaham promptly took three days off school 
eleanor hope his london agent said telephone consultations 
with shahams general manager in new york and conductor michael 
tilsonthomas of the london symphony orchestra decided on the bruch 
concerto followed by jean sibelius violin concerto on friday 
asked how well he knew the works the tall chubbyfaced 
musician grinned and said i was nervous because i felt i could 
not fill in for perlman i last played the bruch in december and 
the sibelius in the summer 
but the funny thing is he added i had some bizarre 
premonition about this on monday i changed the strings on my 
guadagnini violin which i always do before a concert although i 
wasnt booked for any concert this week 
im always nervous when he plays but i wasnt tonight said 
his astrophysicist father jacob shaham i knew that nothing 
could go wrong 
i didnt know that his son chimed in but with an 
orchestra like that and tilsonthomas i felt completely 
comfortable 
shaham said he began playing violin when he was seven and wants 
to be a professional he said he had never been so rushed before 
i once had to stand in for yehudi menuhin who had flu in 
norfolk va he said but i had a weeks notice of that 
shaham is practically unknown in london although he was here 
once before in debut with the london symphony in may 1987 and again 
in march 1988 
concertgoers nicola constable and helen munro of the strad a 
london music magazine praised shahams performance 
i thought he was brilliant it must have been dreadful for him 
to know he was replacing perlman but nobody could have been 
disappointed and its difficult to play bruch well miss 
constable said 
i thought he was incredibly mature for 18 said miss munro 
i wonder where he can go now if he can play like this after only 
10 years thats not long for any instrument but the violin in 
particular is so technically difficult 
shaham studies music at the juilliard school in new york and has 
important bookings with european orchestras this season he also is 
scheduled for tours of japan and the soviet union 
ms hope said shaham practiced at his london hotel until past 
midnight on wednesday taking over a deserted banqueting room 
because the acoustics were better there than in his bedroom

president bush has accused the panamanian 
government of setting up systematic fraud for an upcoming 
election but that countrys foreign minister today accused the 
united states of interfering in panamas electoral process 
the united states would not recognize fraudulent election 
results engineered by panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noriega bush said in a statement released during his visit 
thursday to clearwater fla 
in recent weeks the noriega regime has taken steps to commit 
systematic fraud bush said 
but jorge ritter panamas foreign minister told the united 
nations security council today american plans to interfere in 
the panamanian electoral process have entered a phase of direct 
participation by the united states with the goal of disturbing the 
public order and propagating chaos prompting general 
destabilization in the country around the time of the elections to 
create an excuse for military intervention 
ousted panamanian president eric arturo delvalle met thursday in 
washington with secretary of state james a baker iii to discuss 
the may 7 balloting he told reporters that opposition parties in 
his country did not receive any covert aid from the united states 
and branded such reports as a coverup by noriega 
i believe noriega has looked for an excuse to take away from 
the peoples attention what is going on in panama delvalle said 
in response to a question 
reports published last week in us media said president bush 
had signed a secret intelligence directive called a finding 
to provide 10 million to the generals opponents in the 
presidential elections the white house has said it will not 
comment on intelligence matters 
earlier thursday the acting panamanian ambassador juan b 
sosa called those reports of covert aid the centerpiece of a 
misinformation campaign by noriega 
there is absolutely no truth to that sosa said the 
opposition has run a meager campaign because they have no money 
delvalle and sosa are exiles who still are recognized by the 
united states as legitimate leaders noriega ousted delvalle in 
february 1988 after the president called for the generals ouster 
the move came a few weeks after noriega was indicted by a federal 
grand jury in miami on drug trafficking charges 
as long as gen noriega remains in power there cannot be and 
will not be any improvement in relations with panama baker said 
repeating the official us stance taken since shortly after the 
drug indictment 
the secretary of state also said former us presidents gerald 
r ford and jimmy carter would be among a group of international 
observers for the may 7 presidential elections 
it will be interesting if he refuses to admit them as 
observers baker said 
the may 7 elections pits noriegas candidate carlos alberto 
duque against guillermo david endara running on an 
antigovernment coalition ticket the united states has been 
forecasting noriega will rig the elections issuing statements 
claiming the panamanian leaders manipulated voter lists and 
intimidated opposition figures 
up till now gen noriega has not shown any reason to believe 
they the elections will be fair and free delvalle said after 
the meeting with baker which ended with them both being trapped 
briefly in a state department elevator 
sosa said earlier the observers should watch the setting up of 
the polls the actual balloting and the counting the acting 
panamanian ambassador said noriega was attempting to steal the 
elections 
he said recent noriega maneuvers included the detention of an 
american journalist mandatory visas to keep people away and 
limited access by the opposition to the media 
newsweek reporter charles lane was detained wednesday for 
several hours by the panamanian defense forces for allegedly 
possessing a dollar bill bearing antinoriega slogans state 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler called it a typical 
instance of an absence of political freedom and basic civil 
liberties in panama 
sosa said the panamanian regimes appearance before the security 
council today to denounce aggression by the united states was 
to deviate from the real issue the country is held hostage by a 
dictator 
the internal problems in panama broke out in june 1987 when a 
former military officer linked noriega to drug trafficking money 
laundering and election fraud the united states cut off economic 
and military aid in 1987 sanctions were imposed last year shortly 
after the indictment in miami

an investigation into a 225 million federal 
housing program shows it was used during the reagan years to 
feather the financial nest of former administration officials and 
other prominent republicans the house banking committee chairman 
says 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas said he will hold hearings on 
the report by the inspector general of the department of housing 
and urban development which suggested favoritism and cronyism in 
awarding federal housing renovation contracts 
hud secretary jack kemp said today the program was being 
abused by consultants and some folks who were making a phone call 
and getting a federal grant kemp who addressed to a gathering 
of state legislators has halted further spending on the program 
pending a review of projects 
the report released this week documented how former reagan 
administration figures and other republicans raked in handsome 
profits on consulting contracts to rehabilitate subsidized 
apartments for the poor 
the consultants included president reagans first interior 
secretary james watt the late john mitchell attorney general 
under president nixon former republican sen ed brooke of 
massachusetts and former kentucky gov louis nunn also a 
republican 
other consultants included former top hud officials under 
reaganera secretary samuel pierce with one charging fees of 13 
million still other former officials under pierce participated as 
developers in projects to renovate subsidized housing for the poor 
benefited by the hud contracts 
inspector general paul adams drew a comparison with the pentagon 
procurement scandal with former government officials drawing big 
fees as consultants to developers seeking government contracts 
but adams said he had found no evidence that active hud 
officials had been involved in influencepeddling and made no 
charges of criminal activity 
the rehab program is a 225 million a year endeavor that 
survived in congress despite efforts by the reagan administration 
to kill it through it developers win contracts to acquire and 
renovate existing housing and receive hud guarantees of subsidized 
rents for 15 years 
it is indeed ironic that a program that the reagan 
administration had sought to terminate for six years was misused to 
feather the financial nest of hud and administration favorites 
gonzalez said thursday 
he praised the action by kemp who ordered a halt to 35 pending 
awards worth 100 million and audits of existing contracts 
adams said that while he had found no illegality in huds 
moderate rehabilitation program contracts were distributed in ways 
that suggested favoritism and use of insider information 
money for over half the units audited went to just 10 states 
which by hud formulas were entitled to just 16 percent 
adams said he had turned over the 700page investigative report 
to the fbi and justice department 
adams said in a memo to kemp that developers and local public 
housing agencies were led to believe the consultants enjoyed a 
special relationship with persons making recommendations and 
decisions 
addressing the pentagon purchasing scandal adams said in his 
memo 
in defense the contractors were paying consultants to obtain 
information to influence contract awards at hud the developers 
were paying consultants to influence awards of moderate 
rehabilitation units to public housing authorities 
the difference between the two situations is that the 
investigation at defense was able to prove that the consultants 
paid government employees for information and for selecting a 
particular contractor our investigation at hud was unable to 
substantiate that government employees received any financial 
consideration from the consultants 
adams report questioned the role of thomas t demery the 
former assistant secretary and federal housing commissioner who 
was responsible for the program beginning in 1986 the 
investigation looked into contracts going back to 1984 
investigators found that a nonprofit charity food for africa 
which demery headed before joining hud received 290000 from 
recipients of hud contracts under the program 
demery defending his role in a telephone interview called the 
investigative report misleading and said projects were not 
awarded based on favoritism he said it was understandable that 
former hud officials would become involved in projects after 
leaving government because they had developed special knowledge in 
a narrow highly technical program 
if they won those contracts it wasnt because of inside 
information demery said 
adams report named 11 former hud officials who participated in 
project contracts as developers and owners consultants or 
representatives of lenders 
among them was former under secretary philip abrams and former 
assistant secretary for housing philip winn both were presidential 
appointees and later became ownerdevelopers in half a dozen 
rehabilitation projects 
winn is now the us ambassador to switzerland efforts to reach 
him through the state department were unsuccessful 
abrams did not return a reporters call to his colorado office 
others included joseph strauss a former special assistant to 
pierce who the report said collected 13 million in consultant 
fees on such projects pierces onetime executive assistant lance 
wilson was identified as an ownerdeveloper in six projects 
watt collected a 300000 fee as a consultant on a 312unit 
project in essex md investigators reported that he said that 
his role was to talk to the right people and convince them that 
the project was needed the report said 
it said nunn was paid 375000 as attorney and consultant on a 
1984 miami project in which he in turn paid mitchell 75000 for 
his assistance 
nunn claimed mitchell told him he had hud contacts from the 
top on down because he and pierce were friends the report 
said pierce told investigators that he knew mitchell but that 
mitchell had never discussed hud matters with him 
brooke was paid 183000 as consultant most of that in a lynn 
mass deal also named as a consultant who received 260000 in 
fees was frederick bush no relation to the president who has been 
nominated as ambassador to luxembourg 
calls to watt nunn and brooke were not immediately returned

city police and federal agents seized 20 
weapons including a grenade launcher and arrested six people in a 
raid on a motel in the capitals northeast section early today 
a nazi flag was found in one of two cars with texas license 
plates searched during the raid said john kelso assistant special 
agent in charge of the fbis washington field office 
the investigation started thursday afternoon when a suburban 
dallas woman called the fbis dallas field office to report that 
her son john barnhart 33 of rowlette texas had been kidnapped 
the unidentified woman said barnhart who had been missing two 
weeks instructed her to wire him 1000 here or some harm would 
come to him according to kelso 
fbi agents traced the man to the motel and quickly determined 
that he hadnt been kidnapped kelso said 
apparently they may have been low on funds and this may have 
been an effort by him to get some additional funds kelso said 
its unfortunate that he would involve his mother 
fbi agents discovered the hotel rooms contained automatic 
weapons and notified city police the secret service and the bureau 
of alcohol tobacco and firearms the fbi official said 
two of the suspects richard william mcewen 40 and his wife 
billie joy mcewen 43 both of rowlette suffered minor injuries 
during the police raid when officers had to restrain them from 
reaching their weapons said police spokesman joseph gentile both 
were briefly treated at dc general hospital and released to 
police custody 
the other suspects in addition to barnhart were identified as 
margaret arredondo 29 of dallas kevin owen 21 of washington 
dc and diane joy mcewen 28 of rowlette 
all were charged with violating the national firearms act 
arraignment was scheduled for later today in federal court 
kelso said authorities were still trying to determine why the 
suspects were at the econolodge where they had been staying for 
several days and what they were planning to do with the weapons 
the weapons seized included a grenade launcher attached to a 
rifle some zip guns several pistols silencers and a variety of 
other semiautomatic and automatic arms said police capt philip 
a odonnell 
theyre very destructive sort of weapons said kelso they 
have the power to kill people or to inflict serious bodily injury 
six children aged 7 to 15 were found in the motel rooms and 
taken into protective custody kelso said

the governments chief economic forecasting 
gauge plunged 07 percent in march the second straight decline and 
the biggest drop in eight months the commerce department said 
today 
it was the first time the index of leading economic indicators 
which dropped 03 percent in february had posted backtoback 
declines since it fell for five straight months from september 1987 
through january 1988 the months surrounding the october stock 
market crash 
while many analysts feared that the nation was headed for a 
recession after the market collapse the economy rebounded with 
vigor and the record peacetime expansion is now in its seventh year 
analysts said the latest negative signals from the leading index 
are in line with signs that the us economy is losing steam and 
with widespread expectations that the slowdown will become more 
pronounced as the year progresses 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
report was not bad news and shows some slowing of the economy 
which is probably good 
overall it shows the economy is still sound and moving on a 
steady course he said 
looking at the overall picture fitzwater said despite 
declines in february and march the average of the leading 
indicators index for the first quarter is higher than the average 
for the fourth quarter of 1988 the index affirms the slowdown from 
the high levels of economic activity in 1988 and january of 1989 
these declines probably are transitional movements to a sustainable 
rate of economic growth without accelerating inflation 
the debate among economists is whether the end result will be an 
outright recession or a socalled soft landing in which growth 
slows just enough to relieve inflationary pressures without 
bringing a halt to the expansion 
the economy expanded at a strong 55 percent annual rate during 
the first three months of the year but the growth in the gross 
national product was a more modest 3 percent discounting a 
statistical quirk reflecting the bounce back from last years 
drought 
that was down somewhat from the droughtadjusted 35 percent 
pace for the final quarter of 1988 monthly reports on the 
economys performance in february and march suggested a progressive 
weakening during the first quarter 
the underlying growth rate in the economy is much below last 
year and the risks of a recession certainly are higher said 
economist sandra shaber of the futures group in washington to be 
a prudent planner you have to take those risks into account 
marchs decline in the leading index which is designed to 
predict economic activity six to nine months into the future was 
the biggest falloff since a 08 percent drop last july 
the traditional signal of a recession is three straight declines 
in the index however it has flashed two false recession signals 
since the 198182 economic downturn one of them in the months 
after the stock market crash 
in march nine of the 11 indicators that make up the leading 
index declined with a drop in building permits counting as the 
biggest negative factor 
other negatives included a dip in manufacturers orders for 
consumer goods a shorter average work week an increase in initial 
claims for jobless benefits a drop in an index measuring consumer 
confidence faster vendor deliveries signaling slower demand a 
contraction in the money supply a decline in manufacturers 
unfilled orders and falling stock prices 
two indicators made positive contributions a jump in prices for 
raw materials indicating stronger demand and a gain in orders for 
new plants and equipment 
the various changes left the index at 1444 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 the index has advanced 05 percent over the past six 
months compared with a 21 percent rise over the previous 
sixmonth period 
the federal reserve board for a year has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and control 
inflation the goal of the antiinflation campaign is to prolong 
the economic recovery but some analysts think the unintentional 
result will be a recession 
the leading indicator is just another indicator of how the 
economy has slowed down said irwin kellner chief economist for 
manufacturers hanover trust co in new york were at a point now 
where if the federal reserve doesnt back off the slowdown could 
very easily become a recession by or before the end of the year 
the bush administration is projecting the economy will expand at 
a moderate 32 percent pace this year 
j antonio villamil chief economist for the commerce 
department said after the firstquarter gnp report was released on 
wednesday that there is nothing to indicate a recession in 1989 
from these numbers 
he said the nation is experiencing solid moderate growth with 
the kind of mix we need at this stage of the expansion 
however the latest consensus estimate from 50 analysts surveyed 
by the blue chip economic indicators newsletter is less optimistic 
projecting this years growth rate at 27 percent with the pace 
slipping to 12 percent by the fourth quarter 
more than half of those surveyed now expect a recession to begin 
by late this year or early in 1990

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will have at 
least one opponent when parliament elects the countrys new 
president next month the head of the tass news agency said friday 
leonid kravchenko director general of the official soviet news 
agency said a group of moscow deputies plans to present an 
alternative candidate to gorbachev he did not identify the 
deputies and said he did not know who their candidate was 
i know from the sentiment of moscow there are a group of 
moscow deputies who are going to present an alternative candidate 
they didnt tell me who it was this is not to express distrust of 
gorbachev but to stress the commitment to democracy he told a 
news conference 
the new 2250seat congress of peoples deputies will choose the 
soviet president and elect 542 of its members to a new fulltime 
legislature the supreme soviet the president also will be 
chairman of the supreme soviet 
the congress will meet may 25june 1 the tass executive said 
gorbachev who replaced andrei a gromyko as president on oct 
1 is expected to be chosen kravchenko was the first soviet 
official to state publicly that the election would be contested 
kravchenko one of 1500 deputies elected by voters to the 
congress said the president would be chosen in the early days of 
the meeting and one thing is certain the procedure will be 
conducted by secret ballot 
he said any deputy could propose a candidate and the congress 
will decide whether to accept the nomination 
asked whether gorbachevs opponent might be former moscow party 
boss boris n yeltsin the political maverick elected to the 
congress in a landslide following an antiestablishment campaign 
kravchenko replied to stand as an alternative candidate against 
gorbachev i dont think he would want to do that 
ten days before the march 26 election the communist party 
central committee started an investigation of charges that yeltsin 
opposed some party policies 
kravchenko said none of the speakers at tuesdays central 
committee meeting which he attended brought up yeltsin because 
they realized that a discussion would be untimely and hopeless 
in all probability he yeltsin will be nominated to the 
supreme soviet and he stands a good chance to be elected by the 
congress kravchenko said 
kravchenko indicated deputies from different regions would 
decide among themselves on slates of nominees for the supreme 
soviet 
it has been suggested he said that all deputies to the 
congress from moscow those elected by the public as well as those 
chosen from the party and social and professional organizations 
meet may 3 at the meeting he said they would decide on a slate 
for the supreme soviet choosing one nominee from every five 
deputies 
kravchenko said he expected the same thing to be done in other 
areas in order to get a consolidated list 
speaking of the inaugural meeting of the congress of peoples 
deputies kravchenko said my prediction is there will be a very 
very sharp debate 
he said he expected the selection of the new supreme soviet to 
take the first two days after which there would be a short recess 
the first session of the supreme soviet probably will be held about 
june 12 he said 
asked about the criticism of gorbachev at tuesdays central 
committee meeting he said the very critical speeches were the 
result of two major changes in the soviet union which havent kept 
pace with each other socialeconomic development and political 
reform 
we hoped there would be some harmony between the two but 
unfortunately this has not come to pass in the new political 
structure there is no doubt great success unfortunately success 
in the socialeconomic sphere leaves much to be desired he said 
kravchenko mentioned shortages of consumer goods higher 
inflation social tensions and corruption he cited proposed 
reforms including a reduction in state expenditures a curtailment 
of capital investment projects and a reduction in defense spending 
including the diversion of 97 million to the health sector 
vladimir popov the deputy director of soviet radio and 
television when asked how the soviets assessed the criticism 
replied our assessment is pretty good we regard them as 
realistic in todays life instead of complacency and good words 
we would rather have serious criticism about serious matters 
kravchenko and popov met reporters at the 35nation eastwest 
conference which is meeting in london to monitor an accord on 
media and information signed in vienna in january both are soviet 
delegates

the shuttle atlantis and its five 
astronauts were ready for a midafternoon launch today on a mission 
to start a robot craft streaking toward venus the cloudshrouded 
planet that is an abiding mystery to scientists 
the crew finished final spacecraft checks and nasa officials 
said the space probe called magellan was ready as the 23minute 
launch window approached the schedule called for liftoff no 
earlier than 224 pm 
lennard fisk nasas chief scientist said launch of the 
explorer craft magellan will mark a resurgence of americas 
planetary program the last american probe to deep space was 
dispatched in 1978 
preparations moved smoothly since the countdown began tuesday a 
launch control commentator announced all conditions look good 
for launch time weather in florida officials kept close watch on 
wind conditions at emergency landing sites here and across the 
atlantic ocean 
atlantis was scheduled to lift off at 224 pm edt heading to 
orbit on a fourday mission 184 miles above earth 
launch pad workers completed fueling early this morning after 
breakfast the astronauts donned the bright orange launch suits 
they would wear into space they smiled and waved to nasa workers 
as they headed to their beachfront launch pad 
magellan is to be released from atlantis cargo bay six hours 
after launch and sent streaking on a 15month 806 millionmile 
unmanned trip of its own 
mission specialists mary cleave and mark lee will operate remote 
controls that propel magellan from the shuttles cargo bay 
atlantis is commanded by david m walker the other crew members 
are pilot ronald grabe and mission specialist norman thagard 
the liftoff opportunity dictated by magellans path to venus 
and lighting conditions at emergency landing sites lasts only 23 
minutes one of the shortest launch windows in shuttle history 
after its release from the shuttle magellans own rocket will 
send it out of earth orbit over the next 15 months the craft will 
fly around the sun 1 times before settling into an orbit of venus 
in august 1990 
venus has intrigued humans as long as theyve looked heavenward 
and marveled at the universe the planet the familiar star of 
the morning or evening appears just before dawn or just after 
sunset as a brilliant unblinking point of light its brightness in 
the nighttime sky is rivaled only by the moon 
venus is earths nearest neighbor with an orbit 257 million 
miles away and the two often are considered to be sister planets 
since they are about the same size but the worlds differ mightily 
dense clouds of carbon dioxide choke venus which has a surface 
temperature of about 900 degrees hot enough to melt lead 
magellan will be carrying some of the most sophisticated remote 
mapping sensors ever sent to another planet 
an imaging radar system will be able to detect features on the 
surface as small as 100 yards about the size of a football field 
the radar will be operated during almost 2000 passes over the 
venusian surface each time viewing a slice of the planet and then 
sending the image back to earth for computer enhancements 
magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of the surface 
while orbiting venus for about 243 earth days equal to a single 
venus day 
the last us planetary probe was the pioneervenus launched in 
1978 
fisk said that in the 11 years since we had a planetary 
program that was in danger of being an alsoran 
magellan is the first in a series of american planetary 
exploration missions 
voyager 2 a probe launched in 1977 and an earlier visitor to 
jupiter saturn and uranus will fly past neptune in august in 
october the robot craft galileo will be launched toward jupiter a 
space telescope will be launched next year followed by probes to 
the sun in october 1990 and to mars in 1992 
nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary 
exploration again fisk said at a thursday news conference 
its cloud cover blocks telescope views of venus and until the 
space age little was known about the planets surface twenty space 
probes have been sent to venus including four by the united 
states but only tiny fragments of the surface have been 
photographed 
stephen saunders magellan project scientist said the magellan 
studies may help scientists understand how the earth developed into 
a place where life flourishes while venus became a world of torrid 
heat

fantastic dreams of taking home all of a 
record 115 million jackpot from pennsylvanias super 7 lottery 
slipped away as 14 winning tickets turned up in an initial computer 
scan of wagers 
lottery executive director jim scroggins said each of the 14 
tickets will be worth 31752467 in annual payments over the next 
26 years if one person had won the jackpot it would have been 
worth 44 million a year 
still the first winners to step forward were happy thursday to 
claim just a share even if the money wont bring early retirements 
its better than nothing said gregory g samsa of warren 
ohio who served as spokesman for a group of 14 workers from the 
harbisonwalker brick factory in windham ohio 
if their ticket is validated possibly early next week each of 
the 14 will get 22680 a year before taxes for 26 years 
alverto handel 65 of portage pa her son jim 39 a coal 
miner from summerhill pa and daughter nancy williams 34 a 
library technician at the us military academy at west point 
ny also presented a ticket for validation 
holders of four more winning tickets checked in this morning 
lottery officials said brining the number of claimings to step 
forward to six families or groups 
two couples from the erie area put in a claim for a ticket they 
shared they are charles j and kathy davis of mckean township and 
john and rose white of harborcreek township asked how he felt 
davis 32 said i cant even remember i havent slept 
a family from east windsor nj arrived early this afternoon 
members of the arthur rosen family said the group had bought 80 
worth of tickets after waiting one hour in line 
another winner sylvia trapuzzano of washington pa said she 
had spent thursday in a harrisburgarea motel pondering her good 
fortune before putting in her claim 
i was shocked and i couldnt believe it she said as she was 
led into lottery headquarters past a crowd of reporters and 
photographers 
miss trapuzzano said her father ben had bought five tickets 
for her and her two brothers and sister after she was unable to get 
her own because of long lines 
also claiming tickets was a group from west virginia james 
evans john gardner lionel herndon and his wife connie 
coincidentally it was a year ago today that a bogus winning 
ticket for a 152 million jackpot was turned in and a check for 
nearly 470000 was issued by lottery officials 
an employee of the lotterys computer contractor who had access 
to the system produced the fake ticket and an accomplice turned it 
in lottery officials discovered the scheme several days later and 
recovered the money both men received jail terms after pleading 
guilty the lottery has since beefed up its validation process 
which can take days to complete 
a second set of computers must also validate the jackpot and the 
number of winning tickets before both become official scroggins 
said 
reports circulated thursday about winners who were set to claim 
shares of this weeks jackpot 
just fine no problem mrs williams said when asked about 
having to share the jackpot 
mrs williams came up with six of the numbers from a computer 
palm reader she had tried in an open air market during a bahamas 
vacation with her husband charles in march her mother provided 
the seventh number 
she was at a bowling alley near her fort montgomery ny home 
when her mother called her 
it was a total shock i dropped the phone mrs williams 
said 
mrs handel said she was so excited she nearly put the pencil 
through the paper she was working on as she checked the lottery 
numbers shotly after wednesdays drawing the winner was the first 
ticket she checked 
tears came to my eyes she said i was so dumbfounded i 
couldnt even look at the other tickets 
each of their shares will be worth 105841 a year for 26 years 
they said they had no plans for the money yet 
besides getting less than they may have hoped for members of 
the ohio group couldnt even get the detailed and lengthy 
validation process started 
the lottery usually tells winning groups who call in ahead of 
time that they need a formal legal agreement spelling out how the 
money will be disbursed the group said they tried to call first 
but couldnt get through 
they got excited and headed on down scroggins said 
after the group drove six hours in a fourvehicle caravan 
the group which had bought 140 in tickets contacted an ohio 
lawyer who promised to have a contract delivered to lottery 
headquarters today 
samsa called the legal holdup a slight disappointment but 
its nothing we cant overcome

romanian authorities briefly detained a us 
embassy official who met with a critic of the communist government 
and the united states has filed a protest state department 
officials said friday 
while under international law contacts between diplomats and 
local citizens are permissible the incident is being played down 
by the department and the us embassy in bucharest out of concern 
that additional strictures might be imposed on romanians 
despite the economic and political reform movement sweeping the 
soviet union poland and hungary the government of prime minister 
nicolae ceausescu remains hardline in its policies 
the diplomats identify was withheld margaret tutwiler the 
department spokeswoman said the diplomat was detained for 10 
minutes on tuesday and was not accused of any specific infraction 
she and other officials declined to disclose the name of the 
romanian 
sources in bucharest speculated that the romanian was one of six 
communist party veterans who had written a letter to ceausescu 
earlier in the year sharply critical of his policies 
the letter called for more human rights at home an immediate 
halt to food exports and the revocation of plans to destroy 
thousands of villages as part of a plan to create agricultural and 
industrial centers 
the signers included former foreign minister corneliu manescu 
and silviu brucan a former ambassador to washington 
despite its hardline domestic policies romania for years has 
operated with considerable independence from moscow in foreign 
affairs it does not permit soviet troops on its territory and did 
not support soviet military intervention in czechoslovakia in 1968 
romania has maintained diplomatic relations with israel and 
permitted massive jewish emigration for which it was rewarded with 
special us trade privileges but romania revoked its most 
favored nation status last year in anticipation that congress 
would order a suspension because of romanias domestic policies

more than threequarters of people 
trying to quit smoking were able to do so for six weeks with the 
help of nicotine patches researchers at the mayo clinic reported 
friday 
in a preliminary study that started last fall 24 of 31 people 
who wore nicotine patches had stopped smoking said dr richard 
hurt director of mayos smoking cessation center and one of the 
investigators 
the silverdollarsized patches release nicotine slowly through 
the skin into the bloodstream a control group in the study wore 
patches not treated with nicotine and only 12 of 31 participants 
quit smoking 
hurt cautioned that a longterm followup study is needed but 
said the patch could be a tool to help people stop smoking 
dr john pinney executive director of the institute for the 
study of smoking behavior and policy at harvard university said 
the results are consistent with other research on the patches 
but he agreed with hurt that a followup is important to assess 
whether the quitters remain nonsmokers after a year the relapse 
rate begins to accelerate from three to six months pinney said 
the patch similar to those used for dispensing medicine 
contains 30 milligrams of nicotine about 1 milligram of nicotine 
is absorbed through the skin every hour so smokers are better able 
to handle the withdrawal symptoms associated with quitting smoking 
the mayo clinic is one of four centers studying the patch for 
possible food and drug administration approval the others are in 
maryland new jersey and georgia 
the 62 people who participated in mayos nicotine study were 
randomly divided into two groups with 31 receiving nicotine patches 
and 31 receiving placebo patches that looked identical but 
contained no nicotine hurt said 
all were monitored weekly by a nurse who checked carbon monoxide 
levelsto confirm whether they had been smoking after the six 
weeks 24 people with nicotine patches had quit smoking and 12 with 
placebo patches had quit hurt said 
of those who still smoked all who had nicotine patches and 15 
of the 19 on placebo patches had reduced their smoking by more than 
half 
the people who wore the nicotine patches were by chance 
significantly heavier smokers before the study hurt said they 
smoked a median of 30 cigarettes daily compared with 25 smoked 
daily by the placebo group 
both groups had smoked for about 20 years 
researchers will track the participants at threemonth intervals 
for a year to determine whether they continue without cigarettes 
hurt said research at the three other centers may show that 
fewer people quit in both groups but there is still likely to be a 
2 to 1 ratio of nicotine patch quitters to placebo patch quitters 
the american cancer sociey estimates that cigarette smoking is 
responsible for 83 percent of the cases of lung cancer smoking 
accounts for 30 percent of all cancer deaths

the government said friday its chief economic 
forecasting gauge took a 07 percent nose dive in march marking 
the first backtoback declines in more than a year in a portent of 
progressive weakening in the economy 
last months drop in the index of leading economic indicators 
which is designed to foretell economic activity six to nine months 
into the future followed a 03 percent dip in february and was the 
biggest falloff since a 08 percent decline last july 
should the index point downward again for april that would make 
three declines in a row the traditional signal of a forthcoming 
recession 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
report was not bad news and shows some slowing of the economy 
which is probably good 
overall it shows the economy is still sound and moving on a 
steady course he said 
analysts said the performance of the index thus far is another 
indication that the economy is losing steam and that the slowdown 
will become more pronounced later this year 
its very clear were going to have a very marked and 
worrisome slowdown in the economy said economist david levy of 
levy economic forecasts in chappaqua ny 
whether the slowdown will deteriorate into a recession is a 
neckandneck race at the moment levy said 
but fitzwater said that the declines probably are transitional 
movements to a sustainable rate of economic growth without 
accelerating inflation 
despite declines in february and march the average of the 
leading indicators index for the first quarter is higher than the 
average for the fourth quarter of 1988 he said 
using the threemonth rule of thumb the index correctly 
forecast all eight recessions that have occurred since 1948 but it 
also gave false signals of a downturn on five other occasions 
larry moran of the commerce departments bureau of economic 
analysis said that in each of the five cases in which a recession 
did not occur the economy still experienced a significant slowdown 
in growth 
i dont see any real recession signal yet but if we do get 
another month or two of decline and if history repeats itself we 
would be looking for either a significant slowdown or a 
recession moran said 
the last time the index registered two straight declines was 
when it fell for five straight months from september 1987 through 
january 1988 the months surrounding the october stock market crash 
while many analysts feared that the nation was headed for a 
recession after the market collapse the economy rebounded and the 
record peacetime expansion is now in its seventh year 
for the past year the federal reserve has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus 
control inflation however some analysts have expressed concern 
that the antiinflation campaign will prove too potent and stifle 
the economic expansion 
white house chief of staff john sununu speaking to a consumer 
group friday said the administration doesnt want higher interest 
rates that would scrunch down the economy 
this economy is strong it is robust and it will continue to 
thrive as long as we dont adopt policies to scrunch it down 
sununu said 
if the fed persists in slowing the economy there is a very 
real danger of throwing the economy into a recession said 
lawrence hunter deputy chief economist for the us chamber of 
commerce putting people out of work is bad economic policy and 
indefensible as a way to combat inflation 
other analysts hold to the belief that the fed will be able to 
engineer a socalled soft landing in which growth slows enough 
to cool inflation without causing a recession 
william dunkelberg dean of the business school at temple 
university said the economy still is flying at a very high 
altitude we can bounce around some but i dont think there is any 
evidence yet that were going to have a very serious decline 
michael moran chief economist for daiwa securities america 
inc said that while the economy is showing signs of slowing i 
dont think its falling off a cliff 
were moving from what was a robust pace of growth last year 
to a moderate pace of growth this year moran said 
in march nine of the 11 indicators that make up the leading 
index declined with a drop in building permits counting as the 
biggest negative factor 
other negatives included a dip in manufacturers orders for 
consumer goods a shorter average work week an increase in initial 
claims for jobless benefits a drop in an index measuring consumer 
confidence faster vendor deliveries signaling slower demand a 
contraction in the money supply a decline in manufacturers 
unfilled orders and falling stock prices 
two indicators made positive contributions a jump in prices for 
raw materials indicating stronger demand and a gain in orders for 
new plants and equipment 
the various changes left the index at 1444 percent of its 1982 
base of 100 the index has advanced 05 percent over the past six 
months compared with a 21 percent rise over the previous 
sixmonth period

inc a fund for the children of inmates at the bedford hills 
correctional facility where she is serving a sentence of 15 years 
to life for the march 1979 murder of the creator of the scarsdale

would violate mrs harriss constitutional rights under the first

rubin found otherwise ruling thursday in the boards favor 
i think this ruling is very important in terms of the life of 
the statute and the ability for victims to receive compensation

episcopal parishioners are upset by a bishops 
directive forbidding the formal blessing of samesex relationships 
a priest said friday 
the disappointment is that once again it seems that the church 
just doesnt seem to be able to extricate itself from cultural 
mores said the rev richard valantasis corector of st john 
the evangelist parish he estimated that about onethird of the 
congregation is homosexual 
the episcopal church accepts homosexuals as members but is 
still studying the issues of ordination and blessing said the rev 
bruce gc bayne chairman of a massachusetts diocesan commission 
on sexuality 
the churchs mind is not determined he said 
the blessing generally is used as a form of church recognition 
of an outside marriage such as a civil ceremony st johns clergy 
proposed blessing the 15year relationship of two women but the 
ceremony would have made no reference to marriage valantasis said 
some episcopalians have trouble with the concept of endorsing 
homosexual unions said the rev sam abbott of st jamess 
episcopal church in cambridge 
the fear is that its a very short step from blessing 
relationships to being in a position of saying this is a samesex 
marriage he said 
some episcopal parishes have quietly been extending their 
blessing to samesex couples in massachusetts for years valantasis 
said but in the case of st johns rectors proposed the blessing 
take place during the sacrament of eucharist and asked for official 
approval 
david e johnson bishop of the 96000member episcopal diocese 
of massachusetts responded by letter dated april 20 saying the 
blessing would be inappropriate 
we feel that thats another way of being abusive to gay people 
by giving the appearance that nothing is happening said 
valantasis 
johnson declined to comment friday said diocesan spokesman jim 
solheim 
opponents to endorsing samesex unions cite biblical passages 
condemning homosexuality 
im one of those who feels that the church ought to offer 
support and concern and compassion to people of whatever lifestyle 
but it does seem to me that we cant easily get around the teaching 
of the scriptures which do not condone homosexual conduct abbott 
said 
but valantasis responded if we take all of those moral 
injunctions then we should also be condemning alcoholics 
parishioner margaret miles said most of st johns approximately 
200 members were pleased when valantasis and corector the rev 
jennifer phillips said they were seeking authorization the 
congregation as one person as far as i could tell got to their 
feet and cheered which is very unusual she said 
miles the bussey professor of historical theology at harvard 
divinity school said news that the blessing had been stopped was 
crushing 
valantasis said he and phillips hope to discuss the issue 
further with johnson 
i think that this is a very volatile issue and it comes to the 
sort of heart of our cultural fabric valantasis said

when the soviet union pulled the last 
of its soldiers out of afghanistan two months ago 313 were left 
behind lost during the red armys nineyear involvement in the 
civil war 
some were shot down and possibly killed some were captured by 
moslem guerrillas and held in prison camps in afghanistan iran or 
pakistan others just wandered outside one day and vanished 
moscow has turned for help to the united states which still is 
trying to trace the 2400 american servicemen who disappeared 
during the vietnam war 
its a problem that would cost the united states nothing to 
help solve and would mean a great deal to us said yuli m 
vorontsov the soviet ambassador to afghanistan and first deputy 
prime minister to president mikhail gorbachev 
you americans shouldnt have any trouble understanding why 
this is so important to us vorontsov said 
vorontsov said the issue has been raised with the state 
department and the white house in hopes washington will use its 
influence as the guerrillas principal weapons supplier 
the state department says the issue is a matter of 
humanitarian concern and it has urged the soviets and guerrilla 
representatives to reach an agreement for the exchange of pows 
we have discussed the exchange of pows with representatives of 
the afghan resistance we have conveyed to the resistance and to 
the soviets our position that there should be no involuntary 
repatriation of pows said a department official speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
vorontsov said his country has given the names of 313 missing 
soldiers to the international committee of the red cross 
we dont expect all of them to be alive he said we just 
want to know what happened to them 
the red cross is allowed to visit pow camps in afghanistan and 
pakistan which serves as the base for the guerrillas waging an 
11yearold war with afghanistans communist government 
red cross officials refuse to disclose any details about their 
visits including prisoners identifies and conditions 
they say it is difficult to say how many prisoners are held by 
the moslem guerrillas 
there are tens maybe hundreds of groups fighting and their 
connection is quite loose said one red cross official 
some prisoners are released others are exchanged 
transferred from one rebel group to another or executed the 
worker said speaking on condition of anonymity 
according to rebel sources in pakistan four soviet pows were 
traded recently for 100 guerrillas in one of afghanistans northern 
provinces there was no independent confirmation 
the rebel sources say it is unlikely there are more than 75 
soviet prisoners if that many alive in afghanistan 
and despite what the guerrillas call good will gestures they 
have said they want to keep their prisoners as bargaining chips 
should they capture the capital of kabul 
they always have an excuse vorontsov said first they 
didnt want to talk until the soviet troops were gone now that 
they are they say theyll only talk when theres a full 
settlement 
on feb 15 under a unsponsored accord the soviet union 
pulled out the last of its troops ending a military involvement 
that began in december 1979 the communists had come to power in an 
april 1978 coup that led to the guerrilla insurgency

the communist party has readmitted roy a 
medvedev a historian whose expose of the bloody dictatorial rule 
of josef stalin prompted his expulsion 20 years ago tass said 
friday 
medvedev 63 said he reacted positively to the news asked 
in an interview if he attributed his restoration to president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms he responded i didnt change my 
views a turnabout occurred in the party the central committee 
they stopped discriminating against me i have been published 
here 
tass said medvedev had asked the central committees party 
control committee to be restored as a party member and the request 
was approved but medvedev told the associated press he had not 
made any request he said party officials approached him several 
months ago and asked if he wanted to become a member again they 
asked me how i would react and i said i would not object 
medvedev said he never considered asking to be restored as a 
party member during the rule of president leonid i brezhnev 
because that was another epoch brezhnev died in 1982 
like many soviets who had fallen out of official favor for what 
once was considered dissent medvedev has gradually been restored 
to good graces he has appeared at officially sponsored news 
conferences been quoted frequently in the official press and was 
elected april 9 as a deputy to the new soviet parliament the 
congress of peoples deputies 
tass said it was medvedevs book about stalins crimes let 
history judge that prompted his expulsion from the party in 
1969 but that the control committee determined that action was 
unfounded and restored his membership 
medvedev has said let history judge which he started 
writing in 1962 was the main work of my life seeing a 
possibility that stalin would be restored posthumously to official 
good graces despite his crimes medvedev decided to have the book 
published abroad it came out in the united states and several 
other countries in 1971 
but it wasnt until this year that it appeared in the soviet 
union the literary journal znamya published the first part of 
let history judge in its january issue 
the soviet unions progress publishers is to put out the entire 
book an indictment of stalins dictatorial rule 
under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness it is no 
longer considered dissent to condemn stalin or report his crimes 
in fact the soviet press is full of articles about stalins 
personality cult 
medvedev has estimated that 40 million soviets were either 
killed arrested or otherwise repressed under stalin and his 
figure along with other of his remarks about stalin have 
appeared in the soviet press 
he believes as does gorbachev that the soviet union can move 
toward a democratic political system without abandoning fundamental 
tenets of marxismleninism 
medvedev and his brother zhores were among the first prominent 
members of what evolved into the soviet dissident movement zhores 
medvedev a biochemist and gerontologist was placed in a 
psychiatric hospital before he was forced to leave the soviet union 
for london in 1973 
human rights campaigner andrei d sakharov has said medvedev was 
an important influence on him even though they later separated 
after his expulsion from the party authorities tolerated 
medvedev and he became a valuable unofficial source for 
journalists seeking information about soviet history and politics

somebody give this man a medal 
no not oliver north mike robe the producer writer and 
director of the cbs movie guts amp glory the rise and fall of 
oliver north 
for a film hurriedly made and rushed onto the air in time for 
the important may rating period and the expected conclusion of 
norths trial it is surprisingly good it airs in two parts 
sunday and tuesday 
the crisply written script is based on benjamin bradlee jrs 
book of the same name but robe adds another dimension to the 
docudrama turning it into his own statement on the irancontra 
affair he has added a fictional character a white house aide who 
serves as the films conscience since nobody apparently fulfilled 
such a role in real life 
aaron sykes played by terry oquinn turns up in part one of 
the movie as a mentor to north when the marine colonel joins the 
national security council sykes even suggests gently to north at 
one point that some things such as his children are more 
important than fighting communists 
later in the movie after the news of the irancontra scandal 
has broken sykes confronts north arguing that the operation was 
an attack on american democracy not the grand heroic gesture 
north believed it to be how many hostages are back sykes 
demands for all those missiles you sold to the same damn people 
who blew up barracks and murdered 241 american boys shame on us 
north argues we tried the only thing we thought would work 
to free the hostages and insists that in the case of arms to the 
nicaraguan contras were fighting for democracy down there 
by keeping it from democracy here sell that somewhere else 
colonel sykes retorts 
by the end of the film when north is faced with charges and 
colleagues are running for cover sykes again confronts him what 
you guys tried to pull he says was nothing short of a secret 
government the most dangerous threat to my country i can 
imagine north sticks to his guns as a marine he says he 
fights any way i can 
the appearance of sykes does not turn guts amp glory into an 
antioliver north movie largely due to the strength and guts of 
david keiths portrayal of the colonel keith has said in 
interviews that he is a big fan of the real north 
annette otoole does justice to betsy north here portrayed as a 
sympathetic threedimensional character not the paperdoll cutout 
of a housewife that would have been easier amy stockpoynton plays 
fawn hall as an earnest defender of the cause 
there are good performances all around especially barnard 
hughes as cia director william casey paul dooley as national 
security adviser bud mcfarlane and peter boyle as admiral john 
poindexter bryan clark does a credible impersonation of president 
reagan 
as if to counterbalance the creation of sykes robe includes 
another if not fictional then at least questionable episode at 
the beginning of part two of the movie north is shown piloting a 
plane over el salvador landing it under enemy fire and rescuing 
salvadoran soldiers the story has been told but not substantiated 
bradlee included it in his book with a note that it might not be 
true 
even if it isnt true it makes for a good movie not unlike 
north himself

fourteen british soccer fans were 
convicted of involuntary manslaughter today and sentenced to three 
years in prison for their roles in a 1985 riot that killed 39 
people at heysel stadium 
the fans all from liverpool also were fined 1538 each 
eleven fans were acquitted 
the threejudge panel that handed down the verdicts suspended 
half of each prison sentence afterward the 14 convicted fans left 
belgium they have 15 days to appeal their sentence 
the 14 have already served six months in pretrial custody 
which means they probably would serve no more than a few months 
behind bars in belgium convicts generally serve a third of their 
sentence 
after the may 29 1985 disaster english soccer clubs such as 
liverpool and manchester united were banned from european 
competition the ban did not affect englands national teams which 
still can compete for the european cup and the world cup 
the verdicts came in the wake of britains worst sports 
disaster on april 15 95 people were killed in a stadium stampede 
when fans tried to crowd into a standingroomonly section during a 
match between liverpool and nottingham forest in sheffield england 
albert roosens the former belgian soccer federation chairman 
was given a sixmonth suspended sentence for negligence and poor 
organization of the heysel soccer match 
a senior police officer johan mahieu received a ninemonth 
suspended sentence for grave omissions of duty belgian police 
officer michael kensier was acquitted 
in a separate civil action brought by family members and heard 
by the same judicial panel that heard the criminal case four 
officials were found not liable for the deaths that resulted from 
the tragedy 
they included jacques georges president of european union of 
football associations europes ruling soccer body former 
organization general secetary hans bangerter brussels mayor herve 
brouhon and viviane baro a former brussels alderman for sports 
i wish wholeheartedly we will never have to face court again 
and that soccer will only bring family entertainment from now on 
georges said 
in addition to the 39 deaths more than 500 people were injured 
when liverpool fans rioted at belgiums heysel stadium just prior 
to 1985 european soccer championship final between liverpool and 
juventus turin of italy 
eighteen days earlier 56 soccer fans had died in a fire at 
englands bradford stadium 
belgian authorities had requested the extradition of 27 britons 
based on videotapes and pictures showing british fans tearing down 
the flimsy fence separating them from italian supporters two 
already were being held in british jails on unrelated charges 
bringing the number extradited to 25 
the invasion of the stands caused a panic during which victims 
were trampled to death as they tried to flee most of the victims 
were italian 
britain complied with the extradition request in september 1987 
and the fivemonth trial began oct 17 1988 closing arguments 
ended march 20 
sir harry livermore one of the defense lawyers said an appeal 
was likely 
the acquittals are ok but i am disappointed theyve handed 
out custodial sentences to the others he said i dont think 
they would have to serve more than between 10 and 12 months but i 
was hoping the whole of their sentences would be suspended 
prosecutor pierre erauw said he saw no need to keep the 14 
convicted fans behind bars pending appeal 
i thought there was no need as most of them came to fridays 
hearing he told reporters adding that unless an appeal is 
filed the 14 will receive an invitation to come to prison

un and south african officials 
disagree about how many nationalist guerrillas remain in namibia 
despite orders to withdraw a south african diplomat said friday 
neil van heerden directorgeneral of the foreign affairs 
department said south africa believes 400 guerrillas still are in 
namibia while officials of the un monitoring force put the 
figure at 200 
cedric thornberry secondincommand of the un monitoring 
force in namibia said only that substantial numbers of 
guerrillas have left northern namibia since wednesday 
south africa has suggested the timetable for the entire un 
peace plan could be affected if it cannot verify that all 
guerrillas have withdrawn after an illfated incursion that 
threatened to derail namibias transition to independence 
van heerden said between 850 and 1000 guerrillas of the 
southwest africa peopes organization have returned to angola on 
orders of their exiled leaders south africa which has agreed to 
end its 74year rule over namibia says about 1600 guerrillas 
infiltrated from angola starting april 1 and that 305 guerrillas 
and 27 security forces were killed in fighting after that 
under a regional peace plan signed last year by south africa 
angola and cuba the guerrillas were to remain at thir bases in 
angola until midmay when they were to return unarmed the 
guerrilla organization is not a signatory to the agreement and 
denies it violated the accord 
to encourage the guerrillas withdrawal south africa has 
confined its forces in northern namibia to their bases for a 
60hour period ending at dawn saturday 
south african angolan and cuban negotiators meeting in cape 
town with us and soviet observers agreed friday to a 14day 
verification period starting saturday during this period south 
african and un officials will try to confirm that all swapo 
guerrillas have moved at least 100 miles inside angola 
if a full swapo pullout is verified van heerden said south 
african forces will return to their bases may 13 and efforts will 
be made to resume the transition without delays to a un timetable 
calling for elections in november 
a swapo statement thursday said 1337 guerrillas had 
redeployed from namibia to angola it did not specify the 
period during which the withdrawal occurred nor say how many 
guerrillas remain in namibia 
swapo said its guerrillas have been running the gauntlet of 
south africa troops ambushes 
all guerrillas in namibia soon will move to angola provided 
security forces do not impede their way it said 
the independence plan is part of an agreement that also calls 
for cuba to withdraw 50000 troops from angola where they have 
supported the marxist governments fight against rightwing rebels 
backed by the united states and south africa

white house chief of staff john sununu warned 
on friday that higher interest rates could scrunch down the 
economy 
it is a consumer issue to be worried about interest rates 
as well as tax increases and international trade sununu told a 
luncheon of consumer alert a conservative group he once headed 
sununu claimed for the bush administration the achievement of 
keeping the economic recovery going saying this economy is 
strong it is robust and it will continue to thrive as long as we 
dont adopt policies to scrunch it down 
those policies he added include interest rates those of 
you who are wise consumers understand that when you go to buy a car 
or a house or anything that requires you as a consumer to pay over 
a long period of time one of the most critical aspects of whether 
or not its a good deal for you is the rate of interest you will 
have to pay on the purchase 
president bush has said that he does not want the federal 
reserve board an independent body to concentrate so hard on 
fighting inflation that it tips the economy into a recession 
the fed has strong influence over interest rates through its 
control of the money supply largely exercised through purchases 
and sales of government bonds through rates it charges for use of 
its funds and through other regulations 
fed credit policies are made public only with a time lag the 
policymaking open market committee decided in february not to 
increase rates further for the moment but two weeks after that 
meeting the fed raised by onehalf percentage point to 7 percent 
the rate it charges member banks for funds 
the most recent figures show the economy expanding at an annual 
rate of 3 percent during the first three months of the year and 
inflation as measured by consumer prices increasing at an annual 
rate of 61 percent during the first quarter the highest rate in 
two years 
sununu said the budget agreement with congress would bring a 
deficit reduction of 65 billion to 75 billion and economic 
growth if it continues at the current rate would add 85 billion a 
year to federal revenue next year and the year after without new 
taxes 
compare that to what alternatives that are being proposed one 
of the alternatives is a gasoline tax increase he said 
i think you all remember what happened when we had significant 
increases in gasoline prices in the late 70s our economy was 
stifled if you want to match what you can get out of growth 
with a gasoline tax that would inhibit growth you would have to be 
looking at an 85cent per gallon increase 
i cant imagine anyone advocating such a policy and getting 
away with being called a consumerist and yet there are those who 
are trying to do that he did not say who he had in mind 
as a consumer you certainly worry about having competitive 
products in the market and it is a consumer issue to have a strong 
commitment to free trade that allows competitive products to come 
in here sununu said 
and i think one of the most difficult consumer issues to deal 
with emotionally is the trade issue because sometimes the first 
reaction the emotional reaction of exclusion is not one in the 
best interests of consumer or the country he said

a government report on friday suggested that 
financial arrangements between physicians and health care 
businesses to which they refer medicare patients may be helping to 
drive up costs in the federal health insurance program 
the report to congress by the department of health and human 
services inspector general found that one in seven medicare 
physicians has a financial interest in a health care business to 
which they refer their patients 
it also found that patients of these physicians receive far more 
laboratory and other services than patients of physicians who have 
no financial arrangements with health care businesses 
the report by inspector general richard kusserow stopped short 
of saying that financial arrangements between physicians and 
laboratories and other healthrelated businesses lead to 
unnecessary testing and higher medicare costs 
while we have demonstrated an association rather than a 
causality this finding is quite troubling the report said 
kusserow recommends that the health care financing 
administration the hhs agency that oversees medicare require 
healthcare providers billing the program to disclose the names of 
their physician owners and investors to the program he also 
recommends that all claims submitted for medicare payment contain 
the names of referring physicians 
hhs is developing regulations that would limit 
referringphysicians financial involvement in laboratories or 
clinics and a bill introduced in congress would generally prohibit 
physicians from referring medicare patients to health care 
businesses in which they hold a financial interest 
rep pete stark dcalif who introduced the legislation said 
friday in a statement that medicare patients and the taxpayer 
are paying tens of millons of dollars for needless tests caused by 
doctors referring patients to centers from which the doctor makes a 
profit because of the referral 
if we do not stop this practice and if it continues to 
spread the added cost to medicare and the american health care 
system will be billions of dollars per year stark said 
while many joint venture arrangements in the healthcare 
industry are legitimate kusserows office is distributing 12 
million copies of a fraud alert to the nations health care 
providers warning that certain arrangements violate the medicare 
and medicaid antikickback law 
the report found that about 15 percent of physicians who bill 
medicare have an ownership investment or compensation arrangement 
with health care businesses to which they refer patients 
it estimated that 12 percent of physicians who bill medicare 
have ownership or investment interests in health care businesses 
including testing laboratories to which they refer patients eight 
percent of medicare physicians have compensation arrangements with 
such businesses including space rental and consulting agreements 
and management services contracts discounting the overlap between 
the two groups about 15 percent have at least one or both types of 
financial interest 
also at least 25 percent of independent clinical laboratories 
and 27 percent of independent physiological laboratories are owned 
wholly or partly by referring physicians the report found 
in addition the report said that patients referred by 
physicians who own or invest in clinical laboratories received 45 
percent more clinical lab services than all medicare patients in 
general regardless of where they received the services this 
increased use of services cost the medicare program 28 million in 
1987 the report said 
certainly the utilization effect we have seen in the 
laboratory industries is cause for concern to the medicare 
program the report said 
the inspector generals office compiled its findings through 
surveys of about 3680 physicians and 1132 health care businesses 
as well as interviews with industry representatives and health care 
experts

two priceless fish fossils estimated to be 
300 million years old are missing from a bradley university 
display case and officials said friday they may have been stolen 
for a private collector 
merrill foster chairman of the geological sciences department 
at bradley said he discovered the theft tuesday police are 
investigating 
we use them for educational purposes so we dont want to keep 
them locked away in a vault foster said 
stolen were the remains of a jawless fish related to the 
lamprey family and the remains of a bony rayfinned fish the two 
fossils were imbedded on four small pieces of rock 
foster said they were the rarest and most valuable specimens in 
bradleys collection which numbers in the hundreds of thousands of 
fossils 
jawless fish were prehistoric ancestors of contemporary fish and 
are thought to have evolved from sanddwelling filter feeders about 
450 million years ago foster said a similar jawless fish fossil 
was stolen from the chicago field museum about 10 years ago he 
said 
foster said the bradley theft appeared to be the work of experts 
who pried open a jewelrytype glass display case 
this was not your normal snatch thief he said to the 
average thief in peoria these fossils are worthless these were 
stolen by someone who really knows fossils well 
dave reinertsen senior staff geologist for the illinois state 
geological survey said collectors often buy and sell fossils 
through ads in mineral supply catalogs 
theres a market for it reinertsen said but if its that 
rare i suspect it was snagged for a private collection

a court convicted 14 english soccer 
fans of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced them to three years 
in jail friday for taking part in the 1985 heysel stadium riot that 
killed 39 spectators 
eleven other fans were acquitted a belgian police officer and 
the former head of the belgian soccer federation were convicted of 
charges stemming from the tragedy but received suspended sentences 
the soccer disaster in which fans from liverpool were blamed 
for the deaths of mainly italian fans led to a ban on englands 
private soccer clubs in european competition englands national 
clubs were allowed to continue playing 
judge pierre verlynde a member of the threejudge panel that 
rendered the verdicts said the liverpool fans transformed the 
field into a battleground and were thirsty for violence 
the verdicts came in the wake of britains worst sports 
disaster on april 15 95 people were killed in a stadium stampede 
when fans tried to crowd into a standingroom only section during a 
match between liverpool and nottingham forest in sheffield england 
its just been a mess alan woodray one of the 14 convicted 
liverpool fans said after fridays verdict im not looking 
forward to going to prison but ill be all right 
the court suspended 1 years of each threeyear sentence public 
prosecutor pierre erauw did not order arrests after the verdicts 
were issued and many of the convicted fans returned to england 
after the eighthour hearing 
they will receive an invitation to come to prison if they say 
no we may have to bring them here one way or the other he 
said 
the 14 fans also were fined 1538 each verlynde said the 11 
other liverpool fans were acquitted because of insufficient 
evidence 
convicted of negligence in the disaster was albert roosens 
former chairman of the belgian soccer federation his sixmonth 
sentence was suspended 
brussels police officer johan mahieu was convicted of gross 
omission of duty and his sentence for nine months also was 
suspended belgian police officer michael kensier was acquitted 
in a separate civil action brought by family members and heard 
by the same judicial panel that heard the criminal case four 
officials were found not liable for the deaths that resulted from 
the tragedy 
they included jacques georges president of european union of 
football associations europes ruling soccer body former 
organization general secetary hans bangerter brussels mayor herve 
brouhon and viviane baro a former brussels alderman for sports 
damages ranging from 900 to several thousand dollars were 
awarded to individual plaintiffs in the civil action and judges 
said there somehow would be provisions made for those convicted in 
the criminal actions to compensate the successful plaintiffs in the 
civil action 
in addition to the 39 deaths more than 500 people were injured 
when liverpool fans rioted at belgiums heysel stadium just prior 
to 1985 european soccer championship final between liverpool and 
juventus turin of italy 
eighteen days earlier 56 soccer fans had died in a fire at 
englands bradford stadium 
belgian authorities had requested the extradition of 27 britons 
based on videotapes and pictures showing british fans tearing down 
the flimsy fence separating them from italian supporters two of 
the britons already were jailed on unrelated charges bringing the 
number extradited to 25 
the invasion of the stands caused a panic during which victims 
were trampled to death as they tried to flee 
britain complied with the extradition request in september 1987 
and the fivemonth trial began oct 17 1988 closing arguments 
ended march 20 
british defense lawyer harry livermore said belgian authorities 
may have to go through a second extradition process because 
authorities allowed the liverpool fans to leave the country 
livermore said he expects those convicted to serve less than a 
year in jail all the english defendants already served about six 
months in custody following their extraditions but were freed on 
their own recognizance prior to the trial 
after the heysel riots english club teams were banned from 
european competition by european union of football associations 
the organization announced last month it would lift the ban in time 
for the 199091 season provided english fans behaved at home until 
then

the oliver north trial jury began its second 
week of deliberations friday yielding no signal on its progress 
no notes no words to the judge and no requests for clarifications 
or to rehear testimony 
after working for five hours for a total 37 since 
deliberations started the jurors told a us marshal they 
intended to come in saturday for a halfday session the same as 
last week 
the jurors weekday schedule has not varied it begins with 
their arrival from a downtown hotel at 820 am then juice and 
pastry and a 9 am start at noon a caterer arrives with lunches 
chosen individually by each juror from a menu 
on friday the order got mixed up the caterer delivered the 
wrong lunches and the jurors went back to work until 1230 when 
the right food arrived 
north took advantage of the jurys 9to4 pace on thursday with 
a quick trip to deliver a speech to the bankers club of cincinnati 
presumably for the same 2000025000 fee he has received for 
other recent appearances 
the former national security council aide spoke about 
traditional values and received a standing ovation according to 
bankers club members who heard his speech 
steven doherty an ohio state university sophomore from 
cincinnati said north spoke highly of former president reagan the 
clubs next scheduled guest booked for september 
protesters picketed outside the club before the speech 
we dont care whether north sees us or not said roy silver 
organizer for the central american task force were 
demonstrating against the bankers club for giving him 25000 
while there are homeless people in this city sleeping on the 
streets 
the bankers club did not disclose norths fee 
youre all a bunch of procommunists shouted a welldressed 
businessman at the demonstrators 
the north jury has before it 12 criminal charges most of which 
accuse north of lying or withholding information about his and the 
nscs support for the guerrillas fighting the leftist nicaraguan 
government 
north is accused of lying to congress to cover up his role in 
secretly assisting the contras and lying to the attorney general 
about aspects of the diversion of funds to the contras from the 
iran arms sales he also faces charges that he accepted a 13800 
home security system and converted 4300 in travelers checks from 
a contra leader to his own use 
meanwhile a twojudge panel of the us court of appeals 
rejected a petition by 10 news organizations for access to a 
stipulation presented to the jury at the end of the trial but not 
made available to the public 
the appeals court sent the issue back to us district judge 
gerhard a gesell for a hearing on national security issues 
involved saying it cannot make a decision without having such a 
record 
the stipulation summarizes highly secret intelligence intercepts 
about a november 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran that was 
assisted by the cia norths lawyers referred in closing arguments 
to the stipulation in an effort to show that knowledge about the 
operatiion was not limited to north but was known widely among top 
us officials

pope john paul ii said friday at 
the start of an african tour that he would welcome a meeting with 
mikhail s gorbachev when the soviet leader visits italy in 
november 
it would be the first meeting betweeen a pope and a soviet 
communist party chief 
but the pope said obstacles block a first papal visit to the 
soviet union including the repression of ukrainian catholics who 
form the largest underground church in that country 
john paul was speaking to reporters on his way to madagascar 
where he kissed the earth of this divided island nation on his 
arrival amid a papal truce called after six days of 
antigovernment riots claimed six lives 
standing together on the runway to greet him were president 
didier ratsiraka and archibishop victor razafimahatratra whose 
clergy includes strident critics of the madagascan leader 
but the pope saved his displeasure for the problem of the 
ukrainian catholic church brutally suppressed in 1946 when 
dictator josef stalin ordered it absorbed into the russian orthodox 
church today ukrainian catholics make up the largest underground 
church in the soviet union 
this is really a very difficult problem the pope said of 
the issue still being discussed with soviet orthodox church leaders 
john paul often has expressed a desire to visit his flock in the 
soviet union and some church officials hope a meeting with 
gorbachev could pave the way for it 
naturally i am always willing to receive who ever asks for a 
meeting with me the pope said in italian i would meet him 
gorbachev with great respect as the head of state the head of a 
system 
then as far as this could be linked to the visit to the 
soviet union that is something else because that is a church 
matter 
on his arrival in madagascar the pope noted the severe economic 
difficulties facing the island as they do most african nations 
the bishops of this country are working with all their 
brothers with determination for national recovery he said 
madagascar is the first stop on a trip that also is to take the 
pope to the french indian ocean island of reunion and to zambia 
and malawi 
like many african countries ratsiraka has abandoned socialist 
policies to gain western aid and improve a moribund economy at the 
same time he has moved to mend fences with the church 
in his welcoming remarks the madagascan leader wasted no time 
trying to turn the visit to political advantage and accused his 
opponents of anarchy and political bad faith 
opposition parties which claim electoral fraud in the march 12 
presidential elections urged a pause in the street violence and 
the federation of madagascar churches which supports the 
opposition fraud claims also appealed for tranquility during the 
papal visit 
the roman catholic church is a member of the church group and 
some of its clergy may be victims of retaliation for their 
outspoken criticism of ratsirakas government 
in 1988 four separate murders of clergymen again raised 
speculation that the catholic church whose officials often speak 
out on controversial issues is being targeted by unknown political 
groups to silence church criticism says the state departments 
report on human rights in madagascar 
opposition forces accuse the government of rigging the election 
which ratsiraka won by 63 percent of the vote however western 
diplomats say the irregularities likely did not significantly 
affect the outcome 
the opposition called for a national strike which failed to 
materialize but riots erupted in the capital killing at least six 
and injuring more than 70 in the past week 
ratsirakas party and the opposition have accused each other of 
instigating the riots in this former french colony where about 40 
percent of the population is christian and the rest animist half 
the christians are roman catholic

the former administrator of a federal housing 
program faulted for mismanagement and favoritism defended his 
actions friday and said an agency investigative report was 
misleading 
thomas t demery former assistant secretary of the department 
of housing and urban development and former federal housing 
commissioner acknowledged documentation was lacking from the 
process that awarded hud contracts for rehabilitation of lowincome 
housing projects 
but demery said no favoritism was used to select winners and 
that he and thensecretary samuel r pierce jr instituted more 
formal and documented procedures for awarding contracts beginning 
this year shortly before both left the department 
hud secretary jack kemp meanwhile told a group of state 
legislators friday that the program was being abused by 
consultants and some folks who were making a phone call and getting 
a federal grant 
kemp shut down the program temporarily this week following 
release of an investigative report by the hud inspector general and 
blocked some 100 million in pending contracts subject to a new 
review of the program 
the report charged no criminal activity but the hud inspector 
general turned it over to the justice department for review 
the report described how former reagan administration figures 
including former top hud officials and other republicans collected 
big fees as consultants and in some cases became developers on 
projects to rehabilitate subsidized apartments for the poor 
kemp said the report showed the programs selections were 
based on the perception and reality of favoritism and abuse of 
nonpublic information 
demery in a telephone interview said the large number of 
former hud officials revealed to be involved in projects as 
developers or consultants after leaving government could be 
explained because they had developed special knowledge in a narrow 
highly technical program 
if they won those contracts it wasnt because of inside 
information demery said 
demery handled applications for contracts under the program and 
was a member of a threeperson selection committee that awarded 
winning projects 
the investigative report by hud inspector general paul adams 
questioned the role of demery who was responsible for the program 
beginning in october 1986 it said a nonprofit charity food for 
africa which demery headed before joining hud received 290000 
from individuals and firms involved with hud programs administered 
by demery 
demery said there was no connection between the charity and his 
administration of the program he said 50000 of the contributions 
came before he assumed responsibility for the program and he 
charged the inspector general had included contributions from 
people and companies involved in hud programs other than the 
renovation program 
it is a totally inappropriate presentation of facts demery 
said its unconscionable the way hes tried to mix apples and 
oranges and call them something else whats the point except 
to mislead 
adams declined to respond to demerys comments the report 
speaks for itself adams said 
pierce hud secretary throughout the reagan administration did 
not return a reporters call

the air force which last november 
acknowledged that it had been flying the stealth fighter at night 
for five years has started operating the f117a jets during the 
day said a report published friday 
aviation week and space technology reported in its may 1 edition 
that over the past two weeks as many as 20 stealth fighters have 
been spotted over mojave calif near edwards air force base 
the weekly magazine published a grainy color photograph of an 
airborne f117a but it was far less detailed than a picture 
released by the air force last november when it acknowledged the 
existence of the airplane for the first time 
more than 50 of the sweptwing twin engine warplanes are 
stationed at the tonopah test range air field in nevada they are 
attached to the 4450th tactical air group at nellis air force base 
the air force said in statement last nov 10 
capt susan strednansky an air force spokeswoman at the 
pentagon said she had no information about daylight flights of the 
f117a but noted that the november announcement signaled that such 
operations were imminent 
daytime flights have been available to them since we released 
their existence said strednansky if you fly it only at night 
you cannot integrate it into the rest of the air force 
fiftynine stealth fighters are being purchased from the 
lockheed corp at an undisclosed price she said 
aviation week quoting unidentified residents of mojave said 
the fighters were flying what appeared to be training missions at 
530 pm and 1030 pm 
local residents many of whom are aerospace workers say the 
f117a makes an unsual noise a distinctive although faint 
engine whine that the magazine said may be caused by an unusal 
design to the air intake 
the stealth fighter like the b2 stealth bomber now under 
development is triangular in shape and incorporates design 
features and material intended to make it all but invisible to 
enemy targeting radar the trailing edge of the wings is sawtooth 
in shape to avoid presenting rightangles to enemy radar aviation 
week reported 
when the air force disclosed the existence of the f117a last 
november it said the plane was first flown in june 1981 and had 
been in operation since 1983

president bush signed an executive order 
friday aimed at giving historically black colleges and universities 
greater federal assistance programs 
bush updated an existing order so that he could place a 
presidential board of advisers on historically black colleges and 
universities in the education department 
your voices must and will be heard the president told 
several dozen black educators gathered in the white house rose 
garden to witness the signing ceremony 
for over a hundred years he said the historically black 
colleges and universities have been a special part of our heritage 
at a time when many schools barred their doors to black americans 
these colleges offered the best and often the only opportunity 
for a higher education 
and today thank heavens most of those barriers have been 
brought down by the law bush said and yet historically black 
colleges and universities still represent a vital component of 
american higher education enriching a great tradition of 
educational choice and diversity in this country 
along with setting up the advisory board the executive order 
directs federal agencies to increase opportunities for historically 
black educational institutions to take part in various federal 
programs and directs agencies to maximize opportunties for students 
of these institutions to get parttime and summer jobs 
it doesnt do much good to educate our young people if they 
cant get good jobs when they get out he said

president bush intends to go ahead with the 
controversial fsx fighter deal with japan after reaching agreement 
with tokyo on conditions to safeguard sensitive technology and 
guarantee a share of production for american companies 
congressional sources said friday 
bush was scheduled to make a formal announcement in the white 
house briefing room before the end of the day 
the project is controversial because critics say it would give 
us aviation technology to japan and hurt americas competitive 
advantage 
bush had deliberated for many weeks on the proposed deal for 
joint usjapanese production of the new fighter plane an 
advanced version of the usbuilt f16 the plane would be built 
by general dynamics and japans mitsubishi heavy industries 
the president had said previously he wanted to go ahead with the 
joint venture as long as the agreement would safeguard us 
technology 
congress will have 30 days to review the agreement before it is 
finalized 
the deal was complicated this week by japanese prime minister 
noburu takeshitas announcement that he would resign because of the 
influence peddling scandal that has paralyzed his government 
congressional sources who spoke on condition they not be 
identified said the japanese government had agreed to ensure that 
40 percent of the estimated 5 billion production run on the plane 
will be handled in the united states 
the japanese had already agreed to give us companies a 40 
percent share of the fsxs estimated 12 billion development work 
on another key point the congressional sources said the 
japanese agreed to us requests for protection of sensitive source 
codes used for computers aboard the plane 
the reagan administration negotiated the arrangement initially 
after japan refused to buy any us f16 fighters and indicated it 
would build its own fighter plane 
bush said last month that he would send congress a modified 
version of the reagan administration agreement 
sources have said that among the assurances us officials were 
insisting on were an expanded role for the commerce department to 
monitor the project and keep track of japanese compliance 
reports from tokyo earlier friday said the agreement was near on 
the project as the defense agency decided to retract its demand 
that more than 50 percent of engine production work be given to 
japan and that japan receive all computer software for flight 
control of the us f16 which is the basis for the fsx jet 
backers of the venture say the project is a way to add fighters 
to japans inventory in strategic northeast asia at tokyos 
expense it also would provide jobs for the united states and give 
washington access to sophisticated radar technology developed by 
japan 
under the fsx arrangement st louisbased general dynamics is 
to join forces with japans mitsubishi heavy industries to develop 
and manufacture the nextgeneration fighter for deployment by japan 
in the late 1990s 
proponents have argued that the agreement represents the best 
deal the united states could negotiate in the face of japanese 
opposition to buying f16s directly from the united states they 
say the deal will serve to promote beneficial technology transfer 
in both directions while generating income and jobs for us 
industry 
critics however contend that the arrangement amounts to a 
giveaway of advanced technology that japan may use to help propel 
the its civilian aircraft industry into headtohead competition 
with the united states in the world market they say tokyo should 
purchase americanmade planes to help offset the 50 billion us 
trade deficit with japan 
in the face of congressional opposition the bush administration 
conducted an interagency review culminating in heated cabinetlevel 
meetings that pitted the commerce department and us trade 
representative against the pentagon and state department which had 
negotiated the fsx deal 
as a result of these meetings bush sought clarifications 
from the japanese to help safeguard sensitive technology and ensure 
a share of the planes production for us industry

a woman who sued a liquor company over her sons 
birth defects testified friday that she drank herself unconscious 
several times during her pregnancy but never was warned that 
alcohol would hurt her baby 
candance thorp 39 an admitted alcoholic said under cross 
examination that she drank heavily during the 1984 pregnancy even 
though she had previously been in alcohol treatment programs 
david strauber an attorney for defendant jim beam brands co 
asked mrs thorp whether she drank herself into unconsciousness 
every night of the pregnancy 
at times i did she said a lot of times i did not 
mrs thorp and her husband harold of seattle are seeking to 
force jim beam to pay for lifetime care of their 4yearold son 
michael who is mentally retarded and has other birth defects in a 
pattern known as fetal alcohol syndrome 
they have maintained they would have stopped drinking if they 
had known if could harm the unborn baby they claim jim beam knew 
of a link between alcohol consumption and birth defects and was 
negligent by failing to put warning labels on its products 
attorneys have said the trial is apparently the first in which 
damages are sought from an alcohol company for fas 
the company has denied a link between alcohol and birth defects 
but also says any problems that may have been caused by alcohol in 
michael thorps case were due to mrs thorps own negligence 
mrs thorp testified that no doctor ever told her about the 
dangers of drinking while pregnant even though she had been in 
several alcohol treatment programs and had two previous children 
under prodding from her attorney kandice tezak mrs thorp also 
noted michaels birth defects on a large color picture displayed to 
the jury she noted the childs small nose thin lips and lack of 
indentation above the lip and also said he had a short attention 
span poor coordination and was not toilettrained 
if i knew it would cause the birth defects it has i wouldnt 
have drunk mrs thorp said adding that she occasionally read 
the label on bottles of jim beam liquor and that there were no 
warnings against consumption by pregnant women 
if there had been such a warning she would have stopped drinking 
while pregnant she said 
under crossexamination before the packed courtroom of us 
district judge carolyn dimmick a pattern emerged of continuous 
drinking in the thorp household before during and after the 
pregnancy 
mrs thorp admitted that while pregnant she sometimes drank 
liquor with her husband in the morning before he went to work 
during the day while she did housework and in the evenings 
mrs thorp testified that in all her pregnancies she was advised 
to rest exercise and eat well but never was specifically told 
that drinking could harm a fetus 
she admitted drinking up to half a fifth of whiskey per day 
before giving birth on dec 28 1984 
fas was first identified in this country in the early 1970s by a 
team of university of washington researchers an estimated 30000 
children are born in this country each year with fas according to 
a 1982 study

a threemember federal appeals court panel 
friday upheld the dismissal of suits by pacific islanders claiming 
damages from us nuclear tests 
congress has stripped the courts of jurisdiction over these 
claims declared the appeals court opinion by david sentelle 
us district judge thomas f hogan ruled on june 16 1987 that 
federal courts have no jurisdiction to assess the validity of an 
agreement giving the government of the marshall islands authority 
to press claims of citizens for damages from the atomic tests 
between 1946 and 1958 
the marshall islands and the united states in 1986 signed a 
compact of free association giving the islands selfgovernment 
status a federal law was passed endorsing the compact 
under the independence settlement the united states gave the 
marshall islands goverment 150 million to pay people claiming 
damages from the us nuclear tests in the 1940s and 1950s the 
plaintiffs claim that sum is insufficient and are attempting to sue 
for more 
on aug 22 1983 while the compact and settlement were being 
negotiated some 3000 island residents directly downwind from the 
nuclear test sites filed suit in federal court they sought damages 
for personal injuries and death resulting from their exposure to 
dangerous levels of radiation 
attorneys for the islanders had argued that the compact was 
invalid and that technically the islands are still a territory of 
the united states under whose stewardship they operated for some 
40 years 
all three judges on the appeals panel affirmed the lower court 
ruling 
however sentelle was alone in his conclusion that the challenge 
by the islanders raises a political question that was unreviewable 
by the courts 
while the treaty power of the executive expressly involves the 
participation of the legislature no where does the constitution 
contemplate the participation by the third nonpolitical branch 
that is the judiciary said sentelle 
judge kenneth starr didnt concur with that section of 
sentelles decision saying the matter is an unreviewable political 
question chief judge patricia wald wrote a separate opinion 
wald argued that the marshall islands controversy falls outside 
the political question doctrine on the basis of the supreme courts 
consideration of questions with potentially substantial impact on 
foreign relations 
she also said i am troubled by the majoritys uncritical 
assumption that congress may deprive a narrow class of plaintiffs 
of judicial relief even if their claims are nonconstitutional 
wald said the jurisdictionstripping provisions of the compact 
and the espousal section settling nuclear testing claims were 
consistently thought of as parts of a package 
congress did not seriously consider enacting one without the 
other 
she said that she believes congress intended that withdrawing 
jurisdiction should be contingent on court approval of the espousal 
mechanism settling nuclear testing claims 
she found that mechanism valid saying i do not believe 
that international law in any way forbids the agreement reached 
here

roy lee williams who rose from trucker to 
international teamsters president died at his farm home friday 
seven months after his release from a prison term for conspiring to 
bribe a us senator he was 74 
williams had been in poor health for years with emphysema and an 
enlarged heart and died just hours after a doctor was called to the 
house 
williams a protege of former teamster president jimmy hoffa 
served as president from 198183 he was forced to resign the 
presidency to delay the start of a 10year sentence following his 
conviction with four other men for attempting to bribe thensen 
howard cannon of nevada to influence trucking deregulation 
danny johnson who now holds positions once held by williams as 
president of teamsters joint council 56 and local 41 in kansas 
city praised his former boss 
roy williams was the best thing to happen to the teamsters 
outside of jimmy hoffa johnson said friday theres been a lot 
of bad publicity about him and maybe some of it rightly so but he 
went to jail for trying to keep out deregulation which has 
eliminated over 160000 teamster jobs 
you couldnt ask for a better man as a teamster as someone 
that cared about his members and as a leader of that movement 
johnson said 
there was no immediate reaction to williams death from the 
teamsters union headquarters in washington but william j 
mccarthy current union president made it clear earlier this month 
in testimony before congress that he was no fan of williams or 
hoffa who disappeared in 1975 and is presumed dead 
one was a cheat and one was a liar and both were mixed up with 
la cosa nostra by their own admissions i didnt care for either 
one of them mccarthy said 
williams testified at a casino skimming trial in kansas city 
that he had been on the payroll of the mob and under the domination 
of nick civella the late kansas city crime boss he said he 
received 1500 a month from late 1974 when he was a local 
teamster president until mid1981 when he was elected 
international vice president 
williams testimony in that trial and other racketeering cases 
was designed to get his sentence originally set at 55 years 
reduced and to get him out of prison early he continued to 
cooperate with the government after his release last september from 
the us medical center for federal prisoners in springfield mo 
williams always maintained his innocence and said he was set up 
in the bribery case he also claimed that he cooperated with the 
mob after the lives of his family members had been threatened by 
civellas henchmen 
i am still just an old truck driver at heart he said in a 
january interview its over now and i am glad of it i still 
have to meet my maker but i can still say i didnt do nothing 
wrong 
williams physician mark vogt said the former labor leader 
died of complications of emphysema a few hours after he refused to 
leave the house to go to the hospital 
vogt was called to the house about 530 am friday when 
williams had difficulty breathing he was a little worse than 
usual but he did seem to improve vogt said hed had several 
spells before and he did not want to go to the hospital 
vogt said he was called back about three hours later after 
williams condition worsened paramedics were not able to revive 
him 
williams is survived by two daughters and a grandson

a new federal regulation goes into effect 
saturday aimed at protecting consumers from used car sellers who 
change the odometer readings on cars 
the rule implementing the 1986 truth in mileage act requires 
that records be kept of automobile mileage and is intended to make 
it possible for a wouldbe buyer to trace the actual mileage of a 
vehicle 
although waivers have been given in several states that have 
said they need more time to change forms the law requires that 
motor vehicle titles issued after saturday must be printed so that 
counterfeiting and alterations can easily be detected 
it also requires that mileage readings be disclosed on the title 
whenever the car is sold if the title does not have a space for 
the odometer reading a separate disclosure statement is required 
used car dealers leasing companies and auto auctions must 
maintain records including the mileage of vehicles sold for at 
least five years 
federal laws prohibit tampering with odometers in 1987 the 
latest year for which the national highway traffic safety 
administration has a complete report 17 cases of largescale 
odometer fraud were sent to the justice department and five others 
to state enforcement agencies 
some of the cases led to civil action and eight federal grand 
jury indictments led to 14 criminal convictions said agency 
spokesman tim hurd

criticism of the governing party already wracked 
by a bribery scandal increased friday after it forced the 1989 
budget through parliaments lower house without opposition 
participation for the first time in postwar history 
the opposition condemned the move and for the first time in 
nine years more japanese said they supported the opposition parties 
than the governing liberal democratic party according to a 
newspaper poll 
in 35 years of unbroken rule the liberal democrats had never 
completely ignored the opposition in voting on the budget even 
though they hold an overwhelming majority in parliament 
the 455 billion budget was subject to only two days of public 
debate in february according to the constitution the budget now 
goes to the upper house for approval but it will be implemented on 
may 27 if that assembly fails to pass it 
the opposition had stalled budget deliberations since february 
by boycotting parliamentary sessions to press their demand that 
former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone testify about his links to 
recruit co a business and publishing conglomerate at the center 
of the bribery and stockprofiteering scandal 
the government has been operating on an interim budget since 
april 1 with the government unable to issue bonds or authorize new 
public works projects analysts said business confidence was in 
danger of falling this may have helped prompt the move by the 
liberal democratic party which has close ties with big business 
analysts said 
on tuesday prime minister noboru takeshita announced he would 
resign after the budget is approved to take responsibility for the 
recruit scandal which has brought sharp public criticism of his 
administration and his party 
japanese political tradition holds that the governing party 
should provide an opportunity for opposition parties to participate 
in parliamentary debate and vote even if they comprise only a 
minority 
opposition politicians blocked a hallway leading to the lower 
house in an attempt to prevent the vote on the budget but guards 
pushed them aside to get speaker kenzaburo hara into the 512seat 
chamber 
one independent lawmaker voted against the budget which passed 
by a 2811 margin 
the partys budget action was an outrage unprecedented since 
the end of world war ii and a serious challenge to the 
people said takako doi chairwoman of the japan socialist party 
the largest opposition group 
the deputy speaker of the house a former socialist said he 
would resign his post while an upper house lawmaker from a minor 
opposition party said he would quit parliament to protest the 
governing partys move four liberal democrats also boycotted the 
vote in protest against their partys action while 11 members were 
absent 
in a survey conducted by the newspaper asahi shimbun 44 percent 
of 2403 respondents said they supported one of japans five main 
opposition parties or other minor parties while 42 percent said 
they supported the liberal democrats the poll was taken 
immediately after takeshita announced his plans to resign and was 
to appear in the newspapers saturday editions 
an asahi editorial saturday called for the dissolution of 
parliament for new elections and a radical reform of politics in 
our country 
takeshita is to leave saturday for a weeklong trip to southeast 
asia and is expected to step down after his return 
news reports continued to speculate on who would be his 
successor with many analysts expecting that former foreign 
minister masayoshi ito 75 would eventually accept the post 
although he has so far refused suggestions that he take the job 
in the scandal recruit sold unlisted stocks at low prices to 
about 160 prominent people including politicians and businessmen 
many of the recipients sold their shares after they were listed 
publicly and rose sharply in value 
takeshita has admitted receiving more than 1 million in 
political donations from recruit in 198587 
before attending the budget session takeshita attended the 
funeral of ihei aoki his top aide and fund controller who 
committed suicide wednesday 
aoki had purchased recruit shares and used the profits to 
finance takeshitas political expenses the prime ministers 
announcement tuesday that he would resign apparently prompted aoki 
to hang himself

panamas foreign minister accused the 
united states on friday of subversion and plotting military 
intervention and the us ambassador retorted that panamanian 
elections next week are rigged and a fraud 
foreign minister jorge ritter excoriated the us government at 
an emergency meeting of the security council requested by panama 
saying washington was trying to bully and intimidate his nation 
us ambassador thomas r pickering the permanent 
representative rejected the allegations and said the moral 
bankruptcy of the regime of gen manuel noriega for which mr 
ritter speaks is well known 
noriega is armed forces chief and as such de facto leader of 
panama 
pickering accused panamas government of blatantly interfering 
in the election process manipulating voters lists muzzling the 
opposition press and tv and restricting access by impartial 
foreign monitors and journalists 
the meeting was adjourned after the panamanian and us 
speeches no action was taken and no further meeting was scheduled 
ritter said the united states has supplied millions of dollars 
to opposition candidates opposing noriega and has sent commandos 
special weapons and helicopters to that central american nation 
right before elections may 7 
he accused the united states of trying to subvert democratic 
elections set up a puppet prowashington government and undermine 
the panama canal treaty 
us plans of interfering in the panamanian electoral process 
have entered a phase of direct participation ritter told the 
15member council 
the objective is undermining public order causing chaos 
promoting widespread destabilization in the country around election 
time and creating a pretext for military intervention in panama 
he said us intervention was jeopardizing regional peace and 
security 
in february 1988 noriega was indicted on federal drug charges 
in florida he denied the charges the united states imposed 
economic sanctions against panama trying to force out noriega 
ritter also complained that pickering did not address the 
specific complaint that the us government was sending special 
arms and making nondefensive military preparations in panama as a 
prelude to using force 
he referred to a statement thursday by bush who said the 
noriegacontrolled government is committing systematic fraud and is 
employing violence and coercion to intimidate panamanian citizens 
who believe in democracy 
pickering said we are discussing panama before the security 
council because the regime will not permit a free and open debate 
to take place among the panamanian people the solution to panamas 
lack of democracy does not lie here in the security council but in 
panama 
he said panamas crisis stemmed not from any us plot to 
interfere but from the policies of gen noriega who has 
arrogated to himself complete power over civic life and sponsored 
and countenanced widescale corruption drug trafficking and 
gunrunning 
the ambassador said the united states has grave doubts about the 
honesty of panamas election process the human rights commission 
of the organization of american states also expressed concern about 
extensive irregularities interfering in free elections 
pickering said 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said friday that through manipulation and intimidation the 
noriega regime is making it extremely difficult for international 
observers to perform their functions 
we hope that despite the many roadblocks which noriega is 
putting in their way observers will go to panama to see and tell 
the truth about what is going on there 
she expressed hope that panama will let former presidents jimmy 
carter and gerald ford monitor the elections there panamanian 
officials have said they would be welcome 
noriega is backing carlos alberto duque for president against 
guillermo endara of the opposition democratic alliance endara 
denied that his campaign received us funds 
voters will also choose two vice presidents 67 asembly 
representatives and 510 local representatives

president bush on friday touted his adherence 
to his no new taxes pledge for 1990 but conceded that we 
still have a ways to go to bring the deficit in line with 
mandated grammrudman targets for the following year 
bush in comments to the american legislative exchange council 
said that rough times lie ahead for his administration on the 
economy 
he praised his budget agreement with congressional leaders for 
meeting the deficitreduction target of the grammrudman law for 
the 1990 fiscal year while the agreement has 53 billion in 
unspecified new revenues bush has said those wont be new taxes 
and i kept that no new taxes pledge bush added but we 
still have a ways to go because weve got to go move dramatically 
down in the next fiscal year to meet the grammrudman targets which 
im determined to do and that does mean we have to have fiscal 
restraint in a lot of areas where very candidly i wish we could 
do more 
bushs nonewtaxes pledge was a campaign rallying cry that many 
critics say will be impossible to live up to for another year and 
still reduce the budget deficit below the ceiling set by the 
grammrudman legislation 
press secretary marlin fitzwater asked later if bush was 
hinting that he might entertain some backing away from the notaxes 
vow said i dont interpret that as any hints of any changes 
asked whether the president might go along with congressional 
democrats and approve tax increases a few months down the line 
fitzwater said bush was looking at all future budget decisions 
carefully and that as the next grammrudman target approaches 
clearly those decisions will be even tougher in terms of 91 and 
92 
we have brought the deficit down steadily from something like 
212 billion to 150 billion and now to 100 billion but its 
clear that the last 100 is going to be very difficult 
fitzwater said however that bush was vowing to keep his 
nonnewtaxes pledge in 1990 
bush also reiterated that he will not cave in on his 
proposal to raise the minimum wage to 425 an hour and to tie it 
to a lower sixmonth training wage congressional negotiators are 
now working on a proposal to increase the minimum wage to 455 an 
hour with a more restrictive twomonth training wage

a ceasefire negotiated by the arab 
league was strained by repeated violations friday threatening a 
renewal of the shelling duels between lebanese christian and syrian 
troops that killed 273 people 
the truce that ended 52 days of bombardments also was 
jeopardized by differences of interpretation over who controls the 
ports the issue that started the fighting 
a police spokesman said syrians and their druse moslem allies 
fired sporadic salvos of rockets at the christian port of byblos 
from about 130 pm to nightfall but no casualties were reported 
the ceasefire went into effect at noon friday 
the spokesman said the christian gunners did not retaliate 
infractions are so far of a minor nature but they could 
collapse the ceasefire if they continue or intensify said the 
spokesman who was not identified in line with regulations 
he also said that at about 130 pm two howitzer shells fired 
from syriancontrolled mountains southeast of beirut hit the 
christian sector but caused no casualties 
on friday before the ceasefire began syrian troops and 
christian militiamen intermittently fired howitzer and mortar 
rounds across the green line that divides the capital into moslem 
west beirut and christian east beirut police reported they said 
there were no casualties 
during the 52 days of frequently heavy shelling at least 993 
people were wounded 
the truce was announced thursday at the end of an emergency 
meeting of arab foreign ministers in tunis tunisia 
the agreement provides for an unspecified number of arab 
observers to monitor the ceasefire thus loosening syrias grip as 
lebanons main powerbroker 
the ceasefire is the fourth attempt by the 22nation arab 
league to halt the fighting it was welcomed by the main parties to 
the conflict syria and lebanese christian army commander gen 
michel aoun 
aoun who had declared a war of liberation from syria 
called the truce the first step toward a broader panarab role in 
lebanon which would weaken syrias monopoly of the decisionmaking 
process in our country 
in damascus syria president hafez assads government said it 
is satisified with resolutions announced by the arab league 
syria initially sent its 40000 troops into lebanon in 1976 on a 
peacekeeping mandate from the league 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said washington supported the decision to send in arab league 
observers she added that outside parties involved in lebanon must 
exercise utmost restraint under questioning ms tutwiler said 
that statement was a reference to syria 
a un spokesman in geneva said un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar would meet saturday with the chairman of the arab 
league committee that drafted the plan 
the meeting follows a statement by the un security council 
supporting the arab leagues peace efforts and urging that perez de 
cuellar make all possible efforts and contacts which could be 
deemed useful 
the league truce calls for lifting the air sea and land 
blockades imposed during the fighting 
an earlier statement from aouns cabinet welcomed lifting of 
blockades imposed on legal ports besieged by the syrian forces 
it said maritime agencies should instruct their ships to head 
to legal ports 
aoun appears to be maintaining a blockade of ports run by 
syrianbacked militias a step likely to jeopardize the truce 
moslem army brigade commanders said the ceasefire and the 
lifting of blockades were a whole package agreement 
the present confrontation broke out march 8 two days after aoun 
ordered a blockade of militiarun ports that deny the state 
treasury 100 million a year in customs dues 
druse warlord walid jumblatts militia retaliated by shelling 
the 310squaremile christian enclave syrian gunners joined 
the christian voice of lebanon radio the organ of the 
rightwing phalange party voiced concern the truce is mere 
security tranquilizers 
the syrianbacked moslem cabinet of acting premier salim hoss 
which competes with the aoun government in running lebanon pledged 
full cooperation in the truce 
it made no comment on aouns order friday that beirut 
international airport reopen the countrys only airport located 
on the edge of moslem west beirut closed march 12 after christian 
gunners targeted it a source close to hoss said the airport will 
stay closed until the moslem cabinet decides otherwise

city government fired chief editor qin benli and replaced him with 
a propagandist chinese sources said 
the weekly is widely read by chinese intellectuals and students 
the city forced it to stop distribution of its april 24 edition and

demanding democratic reforms 
journalists at several major dailies have shown support for the

a wildfire in florida burned 4000 to 6000 acres of the osceola 
national forest on friday sending smoke 45 miles to jacksonville 
and 7000 acres burned in a weekold fire in southeastern new york 
its still burning uncontained said scott enos supervisor 
of the florida division of forestry in lake city we dont expect 
any relief from the weather before monday 
westerly winds carried the smoke and the national weather 
service warned of dense smoke in jacksonville over the weekend 
unless the fire is brought under control enos said the smoke was 
not blowing over major highways 
the us forest service said 100 firefighters were fighting the 
blaze in pinhook swamp 23 miles northeast of lake city 
enos said no structures have been damaged and there have been 
no injuries 
the origin of the fire which began thursday was under 
investigation it began on land adjacent to the forest owned by a 
subsidiary of container corp 
high winds low humidity and dry brush and trees hampered 
firefighters efforts in new york 
capt raymond wood regional forest ranger for the state 
depatment of environmental conservation in new paltz compared this 
springs stubborn blazes in orange and rockland counties to the 
vast fires that burned for much of last summer in the western 
united states 
wood said the presence of two superhighways in the region the 
new york state thruway and palisades interstate parkway have been 
key to preventing even more extensive burning 
i think that if it had not been for the parkway and the 
thruway these things just would have kept getting bigger and 
bigger he said its just like out west you do everything 
humanly possible and the fire does what it wants anyway 
paul rinaldi a dec forest ranger in new paltz said the fire 
had burned about 3000 acres of timber 
the burning conditions are absolutely right just 
incredible rinaldi said were not getting the humidity or the 
rain so everything is very dry were seeing fires that are 
jumping bulldozer lines macadam roads its beyond belief

senegalese angered by violence against 
their countrymen in neighboring mauritania attacked mauritanians in 
dakar on friday killing at least 20 people officials said 
authorities in senegal in an order broadcast by state radio 
declared a state of emergency in the capital and a curfew from 10 
pm to 6 am to be in effect for at least six days under the 
state of emergency all public and private gatherings are banned 
the violence began this month in dispute over land near the 
border between the west african nations reports say more than 150 
people have been killed 
several thousand senegalese assembled friday around the hospital 
at grandyoff on the outskirts of dakar where survivors of the 
violence in mauritania were being treated after being flown home 
police used tear gas to try to break up the mob but the 
officials said on condition of anonymity that at least 20 
mauritanians were killed 
president abdou diouf was among the senegalese who visited the 
hospital but reporters said he broke down in tears and cut short 
his visit 
among the 281 people being treated some had their sex organs or 
limbs mutilated and most of the corpses brought home had been 
decapitated the reporters with the president said 
word of the nature of the injuries enraged the crowd which then 
went seeking mauritanians many of whose homes and shops had been 
burned or looted this week 
a few hundred mauritanians were flown home to nouakchott after 
the earlier violence but many others had been gathered at the 
dakar fairgrounds to await repatriation many of the angry 
senegalese headed to the fairgrounds in search of vengeance 
mauritanias ambassador to dakar mokhtar ould zamel said a an 
air mauritanie plane that arrived friday afternoon to take about 80 
people home was forced to leave more than half of them behind when 
senegalese attacked the passengers

the others because its presence was considered a provocation 
the french news agency agence francepresse quoted what it said 
was a good source in dakar as saying senegalese planes were denied 
permission to fly to mauritania to pick up refugees apparently in 
response to the airport incident in senegal 
according to news reports in dakar between 150 and 200 people 
both mauritanians and senegalese were killed by mobs on monday and 
tuesday in nouakchott and nouadhibou the second largest city in 
mauritania

report but a source in the capitals main public hospital said 26 
people died there and 675 others were treated for injuries others 
may have died at other hospitals or clinics he said 
the government of senegal declared it has the right to respond 
by any measures necessary if it is established that mauritanian 
forces were responsible for killing senegalese 
the violence was spawned by a land dispute along the river 
separating the countries two senegalese accused of farming 
illegally on mauritanian land were shot april 9 sporadic attacks 
on mauritanians in senegal blew up into widespread attacks 
sparking retaliation

raul sendic founder of the extreme left tupamaros 
movement in uruguay died friday in paris where he was undergoing 
treatment for a neurological illness officials at the edouard rist 
clinic said he was 63 
sendic long suffered from neurological problems believed to be 
the result of torture in uruguayan prisons in the early 1970s he 
had lived in france for the past two years 
sendics tightly organized urban guerrilla cells were a model 
for central american argentine and chilean movements to follow 
the cells used cleancut youths from old families to infiltrate the 
government they sought to topple 
after 13 years in prison sendic was freed in 1985 along with 
many other political prisoners after the civilian government of 
president julio sanguinetti replaced uruguays military regime 
sendic organized strikes in the sugar cane fields and hunger 
marches in 196061 then changed to an urban guerrilla strategy 
with the founding in 1963 of the national liberation front 
the front is called the mln by its spanish initials but is 
better known as the tupamaros after tupac amaru an 18thcentury 
inca chief burned at the stake by the spaniards 
the tupamaros raided food warehouses redistributing their booty 
to the poor and later moved into kidnappings for ransom to raise 
money 
one such incident inspired the film state of siege by 
director costa gavras starring yves montand as the american 
advisor to the uruguayan police who was kidnapped and later killed 
the mlns first legal convention was held in december 1985 
where delegates voted to abandon armed struggle in favor of 
nonviolent political action with a marxist and nationalist 
program favoring labor and land reform 
sendic was wounded and captured by soldiers in september 1972 
he was held without trial for 12 years during which his family 
and human rights campaigners protested the conditions of his 
detention 
he was convicted and sentenced to 45 years in prison in 1984 
but released the following year

the heinz company said friday it will destroy its 
stocks of baby food in british stores and replace them with food in 
tamperproof jars after extortionists contaminated the product 
it said stocks removed from stores will be replaced in two to 
three weeks by jars enclosed in heatsealed plastic sleeves hj 
heinz co ltd the british subsidiary of the pittsburghbased hj 
heinz co sells about 170 million jars of baby food a year in 
britain 
heinz officials were unable to say immediately how many 
containers of baby food would have to be destroyed or to give a 
monetary value 
police investigating nearly 300 reports of contaminated baby 
food said two apparently were the work of one man demanding up to 
17 million from heinz 
detectives at scotland yard police headquarters said they 
believe the vast majority of the incidents involved copycats 
people getting on the bandwagon cranks and some cases of 
selfcontamination 
arrests have been reported in connection with hoaxes scotland 
yard said 
a 14monthold boy matthew cookson was the latest casualty of 
the potentially deadly campaign he was hospitalized in manchester 
with glass in his stomach after eating a jar of babys yogurt that 
was found to contain glass a doctor at booths hall hospital said 
matthew was not at risk 
in three earlier cases two mothers cut their fingers on glass 
in baby food and a 9monthold girl cut her mouth when she bit on a 
piece of razor blade in yogurt 
the tampering reports began april 7 
the news agency press association said detectives believe the 
extortionists may have mastered a sophisticated technique of 
resealing jars the small glass jars have metal lids with an 
indented center which indicates the vacuum seal has not been 
broken 
ted smyth director of corporate affairs at heinzs headquarters 
in pittsburgh flew to london on thursday night 
he said we will never pay the blackmailers when asked 
about british news reports that some unidentified companies had 
handed over a total 850000 to extortionists the reports have not 
been confirmed 
smyth pledged his company will do everything possible to catch 
those responsible 
he described people lacing baby food with broken glass 
thumbtacks pins needles razor blade fragments and caustic soda 
as thugs and terrorists 
i am absolutely outraged and disgusted these people are 
attacking the most vulnerable sections of our society babies 
smyth said 
cow and gate ltd a baby food manufacturer that shares 80 
percent of the british market with heinz said it had received no 
demands most of the objects were found in heinz or cow and gate 
products but several were in other brands of baby food 
a scotland yard statement said police believed the man who made 
the demands to heinz also tried to extort money from a pet food 
company last fall 
police refused to name the pet food company but british 
broadcasting corp television said pedigree petfoods paid 34000 
to stop the threats 
it said the money was placed in a bank account earlier reports 
said most of the money then was withdrawn through bank machines and 
that police failed to catch the cuprits

the bush administration on friday won a 
reprieve from a judges order to release 1200 semiautomatic rifles 
that had been impounded as part of a temporary ban on importing 
assault weapons 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta granted the 
justice departments request for a temporary stay of a lower court 
order that the us customs service release the rifles impounded at 
the birmingham ala airport 
the government had contended that the federal district judges 
ruling wednesday could undermine the import ban imposed last month 
following public outcry over increased use of assault weapons in 
drug killings 
the justice department said the suit by an alabama gun dealer 
challenged actions taken by responsible officials to combat the 
growing epidemic of violent crime and to insure that the statute 
governing gun importation is properly enforced 
the threejudge panels ruling came about an hour after us 
district judge william acker jr in birmingham refused to stay his 
order which was issued wednesday in a lawsuit brought by the gun 
importer 
the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms last month 
temporarily suspended importation of up to 640000 foreignmade 
weapons while it determined if the guns were being used for 
legitimate sporting purposes 
the governments ability to protect the public during the 
review process would by definition be irreparably damaged if one of 
the very weapons under scrutiny is allowed to be imported and 
used to kill someone the justice department said in court papers 
acker ordered the customs service to release 1200 steyr augsa 
rifles made in austria 
gun south inc of trussville ala contended in its suit that 
the permit it obtained to import 5200 steyr rifles was approved 
before the atf ban took effect 
gun south meanwhile sought an order friday from acker that the 
government show cause why it shouldnt be held in contempt of the 
judges order for refusing to turn over the guns on thursday 
donald wood the companys president said in an affidavit that 
the head of the customs services birmingham office refused to give 
him the weapons wood said eldon green the customs official told 
him he was under orders from superiors in washington not to release 
the guns despite the judges order 
in its filing the justice department said that the court order 
should be stayed because once released to plaintiff and sold to 
the public the weapons are effectively outside the control of the 
defendants and therefore capable of being put to antipersonnel 
uses which the ongoing atf review is designed to investigate 
the government said ackers ruling is likely to spur similar 
actions by other gun importers 
while the 5200 guns imported by gun south are a clearly 
significant number of weapons the suspension of outstanding 
permits applies to approximately 640000 guns the justice 
department noted 
the specter of release of approximately 640000 weapons which 
are unlikely to be recovered upon possible reversal of the district 
courts judgment highlights the potential for harm to the public 
the governments brief said 
ackers order does not affect other rifles but in his ruling he 
criticized the ban which was initiated by william bennett the 
federal drug policy coordinator acker held that the import ban 
interferes with congress right to enact laws

the justice department filed suit friday to 
recover millions of dollars in medicare payments it claimed should 
have been paid for elderly workers insured by the travelers 
insurance companies 
the lawsuit against the hartfordbased insurance company was 
filed as part of the governments continuing investigation to 
recover payment by medicare of medical expenses that should have 
been paid by private companies insuring elderly workers 
the lawsuit filed in us district court in new haven conn 
charged that the medicare overpayments were made to elderly workers 
and their spouses covered by grouphealth insurance plans 
underwritten by travelers 
the justice department suit did not seek a specific amount of 
money but assistant attorney general john r bolton said in a 
statement that the government believes it is owed millions of 
dollars 
a public relations spokesman for the company could not be 
reached at the travelers headquarters in hartford 
the suit charges that travelers paid only benefits not covered 
by medicare despite 1982 legislation that made private insurance 
companies the primary payers of health insurance for employed 
workers between the ages of 65 and 69 
similar lawsuits have been filed against blue crossblue shield 
of michigan and provident life and accident insurance co of 
chattanooga tenn 
bolton said the department will continue to bring these 
lawsuits where warranted to stop this practice and to return to the 
medicare program the money that has been overpaid 
an audit by the department of health and human services 
uncovered the overpayments which some officials estimate could 
total hundreds of millions of dollars 
the wall street journal reported earlier this month that its 
examination of medicare records suggested the overpayments could 
total as much as 10 billion since 1983

professionalism so there wont be victims from any of our actions 
but that doesnt depend on us because two sides are acting

katusev said four georgian activists arrested shortly after the 
demonstration were charged with being organizers of and active 
participants in group actions violating public order

of gases to put down the demonstration was proper and what the 19 
protesters died of most of those killed were women 
soviet officials acknowledged that soldiers used tear gas 
members of a citizens commission investigating the confrontation 
and doctors treating victims say a second gas that paralyzes the 
central nervous system was used georgias communist party chief 
givi gumbaridze said some victims died of gas poisoning

agriculture ministry told the associated press she found out about 
the appeals court ruling about an hour before she was allowed to 
leave the prison she was met by her mother and oldest daughter

britain

energy secretary james d watkins said friday 
he hopes the idle savannah river nuclear weapons plant will become 
the flagship of the nations nuclear facilities even though he 
has delayed reopening it 
the savannah river sites three nuclear reactors the nations 
sole source of tritium used in the production of nuclear warheads 
have been shut down for safety modifications since august 
watkins in south carolina to tour the plant said he hoped to 
announce a startup date for the reactors by july earlier this 
week he said he would delay resumption of production at the plant 
slated for late 1989 until at least early 1990 
until we are convinced we have the best interests of our 
people at heart the reactors will not be restarted watkins told 
employees at the plant 
the energy secretary said it was important to delay the restart 
to demonstrate to the american people that we know how to 
manage nuclear technology 
the 330acre plant on the georgia border manufactures tritium a 
radioactive gas used to boost the explosive power of nuclear 
warheads 
shortly after the reactors were shut down the department said 
it could have them running again by late 1988 after that target 
was missed the department told congress it expected startup by 
late this year 
the pentagon warned of an imminent shortage of the vital nuclear 
material but that did not discourage watkins from delaying the 
plants restart 
while the nations dwindling supply of tritium is a concern 
its a matter of what steps we can take the worst thing would be 
a preliminary startup of the reactors said us sen sam nunn 
dgeorgia who accompanied watkins on a morning tour of the plant 
watkins said he believed the savannah river site once back in 
operation would become the bestrun facility among the countrys 
nuclear weapons and power plants 
i can see us emerging here as the number one plant in the 
nation thats my goal to have this plant be the flagship 
watkins told employees at a meeting in the plants cafeteria 
numerous relevations surfaced about the plant last year 
prompting its shutdown among them were concern over accidents lax 
management and policies that stressed production over safety 
westinghouse electric corp took over management of the plant on 
april 1 before that it was operated and managed by chemical giant 
ei du pont de nemours amp co which built the plant 38 years ago

rightwing military president augusto 
pinochet said friday he definitely will not run in the dec 14 
presidential election but he said he will stay on as commander of 
the army 
gen pinochet speaking at a news conference after swearing in 
two new ministers to his 16member cabinet also proposed limited 
changes to the constitution written by the military 
i feel a deep attachment to the constitution pinochet said 
explaining why he will not run for president 
the constitution prohibits him from seeking reelection but 
several rightwing groups have insisted in recent months that a 
formula be found to allow him to run 
pinochet himself previously hinted that he could agree on 
tuesday he told a group of labor leaders who asked him to run 
again that does not depend on me but on you i am prepared for 
anything 
he stressed that he will hand power to the winner in the 
december election which he was obliged to call after voters in a 
referendum last october rejected a military proposal to extend his 
term until 1997 
pinochet said friday that after leaving the presidency he will 
remain as commander of the army which the constitution allows him 
to do 
under the present circumstances i think thats the position 
where i can serve my country best pinochet said 
opposition parties and even some government supporters 
repeatedly have criticized pinochets decision to remain head of 
the army which has been his power base since he seized power in a 
violent 1973 coup 
critics said his continuation in the nations top military 
position would threaten the stability of the future civilian 
government 
pinochets decision this week to keep interior minister carlos 
caceres was seen by some opposition leaders as an indication that 
he was finally accepting the constitutional changes sought by 
opposition and progovernment parties 
but on friday he made clear that he is offering only limited 
changes at the news conference he listed six possible amendments 
far less that those sought by the opposition 
he said he is prepared to change an article banning marxism to 
ease the mechanism for future constitutional changes to drop the 
presidential power to disband the lower house of congress and to 
send citizens into exile to shorten the eightyear presidential 
term and to change the makeup of a powerful military dominated 
national security council 
he rejected changes sought by the opposition including a clause 
that makes nine members of the 26member senate appointed instead 
of elected and another that prevents the future civilian 
government from firing the heads of the three branches of the armed 
forces and the national police 
pinochet appointed rene salame a chemistry teacher to replace 
juan guzman as education minister and jorge lopez a mining 
engineer to replace pablo baraona as minister of mines

dollar 
the weeks fluctuations followed a twomonth drop in value of 
the austral and touched off price increases the suspension of 
credit card sales and shortages of some medicines and foods

tuesday 96 to 1 and on wednesday 84 to 1 the austral worth 17 to

thursday that alfonsin had called the meetings to materialize 
common ideas aimed at improving the economic situation ensuring 
the political transition and reassuring the population

measures including reforms in the exchange market restraint on 
government spending and possible steps to increase government 
income

jason the milliondollar submersible robot was 
still missing at sea friday but its disappearance failed to sink a 
7 million high school science project 
jasons still down there but were optimistic said nancy 
green of the woods hole oceanographic institution home base to the 
propellerdriven remotecontrol robot sunk to the bottom of the 
mediterranean sea 
more than 250000 students in 13 cities in the united states and 
canada were boning up on plate tectonics and underwater volcanoes 
in preparation for the start monday of a massive satellite science 
project gone slightly awry 
on wednesday museums across north america were hooked up live 
via satellite with the star hercules a marine exploration ship 
anchored over the ancient ruins of a sunken roman trading ship off 
the coast 
as about 2000 museum officials teachers and technicians 
watched marine biologists began lowering the 7footlong robot and 
its 8000pound mobile garage argo into the ocean for a test run 
the footage was to be viewed by thousands of students during a 
twoweek period 
all of a sudden the live cameras focused in on a group of crew 
members holding the severed cable that once had been jasons 
lifeline 
in a flash the horrible truth emerged the million dollar robot 
whose older brother nosed among the titanics ruins had sunk 2100 
feet to the soft silty ocean floor 
green said a second consecutive day of churning seas and high 
winds prevented dr robert ballard and his team of marine explorers 
from sending down a second submersible to rescue its errant

security forces killed 77 leftist guerrillas 
friday in two separate attacks in the andes mountains and the 
jungle the government said it was the heaviest day of fighting in 
perus nineyear insurgency 
six soldiers and three university students also were killed 
officials said 
also friday the officials said more than 6000 people were 
detained in lima in massive sweeps by police seeking the killers of 
leftist congressman eriberto arroyo who was slain thursday 
at dawn troops spotted a column of leftist guerrillas in 
uniforms near molinos a tiny village 35 miles north of huancayo 
the government said in a communique 
in fighting that followed 62 leftist guerrillas and six 
soldiers were killed and 23 soldiers were wounded it said 
president alan garcia said in a brief radio statement that the 
rebels were from the tupac amaru revolutionary movement which 
endorses a cuba styled marxism and has been active since 1984 
police also killed 15 maoist shining path guerrillas in fighting 
near santa rosa a village in perus cocaineproducing jungle 260 
miles northeast of lima 
the government said drug traffickers supported the rebels in the 
clash but it did not provide further details 
the casualties friday marked the highest number of guerrilla 
deaths in any single day of fighting during the nineyear 
insurgency thirtyfour shining path guerrillas died earlier this 
month in two battles with troops in the amazon jungle 
more than 900 people have died this year in political violence 
in related violence police said the bodies of three students 
shot to death friday by shining path guerrillas were found at the 
university of huancayo 
the region around huancayo one of perus richest agricultural 
zones 140 miles east of lima has been a growing focus of rebel 
activity for the past three years 
both the maoinspired shining path and the smaller tupac amaru 
revolutionary movement are active in the region the groups are not 
linked 
analysts said the guerrillas are seeking to disrupt farming and 
isolate the zone to prevent food from reaching coastal lima 
further agravating an severe economic recession that has already 
sparked temporary food shortages 
police said 6407 people were arrested and 1135 automobiles 
were stopped and searched on city streets late thursday as police 
sought the killers of arroyo a member of the united left party 
the second strongest party in congress 
police have blamed the shining path for the killing but some 
members of the united left a marxist coalition blamed the murder 
on on antirebel death squad called the rodrigo franco command 
during previous sweeps the vast majority of those detained have 
been released after proving their identities 
analysts said the spreading violence coupled with perus 
deepest economic recession of the century has fomented political 
instability and social chaos that have become a threat to perus 
democracy 
the shining path has been fighting since 1980 to topple the 
government 
the violence has claimed more than 14000 lives including 
soldiers police guerrillas and noncombantants but most of the 
dead have been highland peasants caught in the crossfire between 
government forces and guerrillas

funeral services are scheduled saturday for 
controversial us district judge stephen s chandler who went 
into semiretirement 14 years ago after a stormy 32year career on 
the bench 
chandler died thursday at age 89 after a short bout with 
pneumonia and a long battle with a bleeding ulcer his family said 
he had been hospitalized about two weeks 
chandler was born sept 13 1899 in tennessee he received his 
law degree from the university of kansas in 1922 and was a private 
attorney in oklahoma city when president franklin roosevelt put him 
on the federal bench in 1943 
chandler often feuded with other federal judges in 1962 he 
testified before a us senate subcommittee that he was afraid of 
being poisoned that his telephone was tapped and that his fellow 
judges sometimes cursed him 
twice he was removed from hearing multimilliondollar lawsuits 
because of alleged personal interest or alleged bias and prejudice 
he was indicted by a state grand jury in 1965 for allegedly 
conspiring to have a road on property he owned paved by the county 
the criminal charge later was dismissed 
in 1965 the 10th circuit judicial council stripped him of his 
powers for a month contending he was unable or unwilling to 
discharge efficiently the duties of his office 
he was embroiled in a libel suit with one attorney and once 
disbarred the us attorney and five other federal attorneys in 
oklahoma city from practicing in the federal court 
a state court once ordered chandler to pay a 50000 libel 
judgment to an attorney the judge accused of a 1 million fraud in 
a bankruptcy case the verdict was overturned in federal appeals 
courts 
in 1974 chandler disbarred us attorney william burkett four 
of burketts assistants and an internal revenue service lawyer from 
practicing in the federal courts of western oklahoma the judge 
contended the attorneys were illegally hiding a witness in a case 
involving then gov david hall 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals overturned chandlers 
order eight months later 
chandler offered to retire in 1973 but only if he could name 
his successor 
when chandler announced in may 1975 that he would take senior 
status at age 75 president gerald ford accepted his letter of 
retirement in a matter of hours judicial retirement formalities 
usually take up to a month 
as a senior judge chandler was still eligible to hear cases 
but his caseload was greatly reduced 
chandler was chairman of the judicial administration of the 
american bar association in 195960 and was on the governing 
council of the interamerican bar association 19561973 
in 1960 he was inducted into the oklahoma hall of fame from 
196063 he was professor of law at oklahoma city university 
he married margaret patterson now deceased in 1922 he is 
survived by a daughter and two sons

cards calls and compassion were pouring in 
friday for the desperate young father who held hospital workers at 
gunpoint as he removed his comatose baby son from lifesupport 
systems and held him till he died 
rudy linares 23 a house painter from west suburban cicero 
faces firstdegree murder charges in the death early wednesday of 
his 16monthold son samuel 
i would fly to chicago tomorrow and do anything i could 
to help this guy because i feel that there but for the grace of god 
go i michael killigrew parent of a braindamaged child said 
from nevada city calif 
samuel had been in a coma partially brain dead since he 
swallowed a balloon at an aug 2 birthday party blocking the flow 
of oxygen to his brain 
the toddler was considered to be in a irreversible vegetative 
coma says dr gilbert goldman samuels physician at pediatric 
intensive care at rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center 
goldman has said he did not believe he could legally comply with 
the familys request months ago for withdrawal of life support 
though he was personally and professionally sympathetic 
under state childabuse laws support could be withdrawn only if 
samuel had been found to be totally braindead or his heart and 
lungs had stopped functioning said max brown a lawyer for the 
hospital 
the family had planned to see a lawyer friday to discuss their 
options 
this is something that should not be the choice of government 
its a private individuals choice killigrew said in a telephone 
interview with the associated press 
when his 17monthold daughter claudia suffered severe brain 
damage from a 1970 case of spinal meningitis killigrew said a 
sympathetic doctor allowed him agonizing choice of letting her 
go rather than prolonging treatment 
linares told reporters i did it because i love my son 
assistant public defender richard scholz has said his client will 
plead innocent 
linares is free on a 75000 recognizance bond but was ordered 
thursday by cook county judge robert bastone to undergo a 
psychiatric examination to determine whether he is any danger to 
himself or anyone else 
public defender philip mullane told the court linares took 
matters in his own hands after a nurse left a message on the 
familys answering machine that said samuel was to be moved to a 
longcare residential facility to die 
hospital officials however said the message made no reference 
to the childs being transferred to die and was left only after 
repeated attempts to reach the linares and his 21yearold wife 
tamara had failed 
mullane said the babys funeral is scheduled monday at an 
undisclosed location 
residents of the linares workingclass neighborhood said they 
had received so many calls offering financial help for the family 
that they plan to set up a fund at a cicero bank to help cover 
medical bills and other expenses

a huge portrait of soviet dictator josef stalin 
is to be banished from chinas main square this may day just two 
weeks before soviet president mikhail gorbachevs ceremonial 
welcome on the same square 
communist party spokeswoman yue yanghua said saturday that for 
the first time in three decades portraits of stalin lenin marx 
and engels will not appear for may day a major labor holiday in 
china and other socialist nations 
yue said the only portrait to appear on tiananmen square this 
year and in the future will be that of sun yatsen founder of the 
first chinese republic 
she said authorities decided only pictures of chinese historical 
figures should be shown on the square mao tsetungs portrait 
hangs permanently from atop tiananmen gate at the entrance to the 
forbidden city 
yue denied the decision was linked to a reappraisal of stalins 
historical role as soviet historians acknowledge stalin was 
responsible for political repression murderous purges and economic 
disasters 
in the past decade of economic reforms china rejected stalinist 
state planning and oneman rule but still recognizes stalins role 
in the early history of the chinese communist party 
portraits of marx engels lenin and sun have decorated the 
square every may day and on chinas oct 1 national day since the 
1950s 
stalins picture was added in the late 1950s several years 
after his death and at a time when chinesesoviet relations were 
deteriorating because of differences between mao and nikita 
khrushchev 
gorbachevs may 1518 visit will be the first since khrushchev 
was in beijing in 1959 and will normalize political relations after 
30 years of hostility

defense secretary dick cheney said in an 
interview friday he expects soviet president mikhail gorbachevs 
reforms to ultimately fail and that gorbachev will be replaced 
by antiwestern leader 
my personal view is that the task he set for himself to trying 
to fundamentally reform the soviet system is incapable of 
occuring cheney said in the interview taped for broadcast 
saturday on cnns evans amp novak program 
if i had to guess today i would guess that he would 
ultimately fail cheney said 
cheney suggested in the interview that the soviet leaders 
political survival hinges on the success of the economic and 
political reforms he has instigated 
that is to say that he will not be able to reform the soviet 
economy and when that happens hes likely to be replaced by 
somebody who will be far more hostile than hes been in terms of 
his attitude towards the west cheney said 
his comments followed closely the answers he gave a 
congressional committee earlier this week when asked about the bush 
administrations proposed reductions in the pentagon budget cheney 
told the house armed services committee on tuesday there is a 
very real likelihood gorbachevs reforms would fail and that he 
would either have to change course or hand over power 
he said in the interview that the pentagon cutbacks announced 
tuesday which included delays in several weapons programs are not 
part of an overall plan to scale back western defenses because of 
gorbachevs peaceful overtures 
he could modify his policies and have to accomodate a more 
conservative line he said of gorbachev he could conceivably 
be replaced the point is we dont know

a convicted murderer freed from a florida prison 
after asserting his innocence for 21 years visited the tomb of 
martin luther king jr on friday and vowed to work to help troubled 
young people 
james richardson sentenced to death in 1968 in the poisoning 
deaths of his seven children won his freedom tuesday after a judge 
ruled that his murder trial was tainted by prosecutorial misconduct 
he has insisted he did not kill the children who ate a prepared 
lunch tainted with the pesticide parathion and sworn affidavits 
implicated the familys baby sitter as a suspect 
richardson flanked by civil rights activists spoke to 
reporters at the king center in atlanta telling the dramatic tale 
of his nearexecution and his years in prison 
ive seen things you never thought in your whole life he 
said describing how he saw young inmates raped and brutalized by 
other prisoners 
i want to get started on things ive wanted to do to help 
he said adding that he hopes to work with alcoholics and young 
people so many of our young people are going to prison they 
dont need this i want to tell our young generation to get 
themselves together 
activist dick gregory said richardson who underwent openheart 
surgery in prison will join the staff of the dick gregory diet and 
health resort at fort walton beach fla encouraging other heart 
patients to stay healthy 
friday evening richardson and gregory arrived in fort walton 
beach 
i feel pretty good so far richardson told reporters i 
havent made any plans at this time but to be with mr dick 
gregory i think its going to be wonderful 
richardson is to spend the weekend at the clinic gregory has 
offered a 100000ayear job at the diet clinic to the 53yearold 
former orange picker who has until june 1 to decide on a contract

wouldnt hire him 
richardson sat before kings tomb and sang out the words on the 
slain civil rights leaders crypt free at last free at last 
thank god almighty im free richardson used the same words on 
the first full day of his release 
sclc president joseph lowery said richardsons case 
underscores and affirms again and again the argument against 
the death penalty one of the damnable things about the death 
penalty is you cannot correct a mistake he would be dead 
richardsons death sentence was commuted to a life term in 1972 
after the us supreme court struck down the nations capital 
punishment laws 
rubin said richardson his wife and daughter have authorized him 
to seek compensation from those responsible for imprisoning 
richardson a step that must be taken before the state legislature 
could consider a relief bill to award damages

the launch of atlantis was scrubbed 
friday less than a minute before its planned liftoff when 
controllers detected an electrical surge in a main engine fuel 
pump five astronauts were on board along with a robot probe that 
nasa is sending to venus 
were disappointed we couldnt go today but were satisfied 
with the checks and balances inherent in the launch system said 
mission commander david walker we are prepared to go as soon as 
the bird is fixed and we are confident it will be done quickly and 
safely 
launch director bob sieck said it will be at least monday before 
a second launch attempt can be made and he termed that timetable 
optimistic after revealing that nasa was also checking on an 
unexpected vapor cloud that emerged around a hydrogen fuel line 
among tens of thousands who gathered for the rare afternoon 
liftoff were some of the countrys most renowned planetary 
scientists they have been waiting to resume solar system 
exploration since 1978 when pioneervenus was launched on the last 
us planetary expedition 
thats just the way it is shrugged james head a geologist 
from brown university following the postponement weve got a 
nice long launch window he said noting nasa has until may 28 to 
get magellan on its way 
we have waited a number of years for this flight and a few 
extra days wont matter said lennard fisk nasas chief 
scientist the window is a month long having the shuttle ready 
on the first day is ample time to solve the problem and get us on 
our way to venus 
sieck said nasa probably would not understand the precise cause 
of the problem until inspecting the spacecraft over the weekend he 
also said technicians reviewing film discovered that a troubling 
vapor cloud appeared around a fuel line towards the end of the 
countdown 
he said it could be well into next week if nasa has to 
replace the pump or the fuel line for a monday launch both of 
them would have to fall into a quick fix and it would be 
optimistic to expect that 
the postponement set back nasas plan to eject its robot 
magellan spacecraft out of the shuttle toward venus the 
550million magellan mission would revitalize nasas unmanned 
space science program 
atlantis astronauts were strapped in and the countdown was 
advancing toward a launch less than a minute to go when a 
controller detected something wrong on a monitor and informed 
sieck possible problem with an engine 1 recirculation pump 
recommend hold at t31 seconds 
launch commentator hugh harris quickly reported there is not 
enough time to recycle and launch today 
the pump circulates liquid hydrogen to keep fuel lines cool 
before engine ignition 
keith hodkins director of nasas orbiter division said that 50 
seconds before the planned launch monitors detected a sudden power 
surge reading of 21 amps on the pumps electrical circuitry 
normal he said is 2 to 3 amps 
the spike tripped the circuitry forcing a shutown hodkins 
said 
harris had said the problem may not be in the pump at all it 
might be in ground support equipment or somewhere in the orbiter 
if the fixes are simple we can maintain the possibility of a 
monday afternoon launch he said if we have to replace the 
pump or the fuel line we could go well into next week 
harris said the first goal of the launch team was to get the 
crew safely out of there by making certain all systems were 
stable the astronauts reset switches in the cabin before taking 
the elevator to the base of the pad for a trip back to their crew 
quarters 
the astronauts walker pilot ronald grabe and mission 
specialists mary cleave mark lee and norman thagard returned to 
crew quarters 
nasa had set atlantis liftoff between 224 pm and 247 pm 
a narrow window dictated by the need to deploy the magellan payload 
from a precise location above the earth and a requirement that the 
shuttle go before darkness fell at emergency landing sites in spain 
and morocco 
the space agency must send magellan on its way between april 28 
and may 28 because that is when earth and venus are in proper 
alignment if the spacecraft cannot be launched by the end of may 
officials would have to wait two years before the two planets again 
are in the desired position 
the countdown had been almost flawless until the last minute 
the only snag was a problem with a rangesafety tracking computer 
that set back the count six minutes 
all systems were ready to support a launch until we hit that 
unexpected problem harris said 
when atlantis is launched the astronauts are to release 
magellan from the cargo bay and start it on a 450day 
806millionmile journey to venus it will be the first us 
planetary flight in 11 years 
the 7600pound spacecraft is to loop into orbit around venus in 
august 1990 and map up to 90 percent of the surface with a 
highresolution radar system that will pierce the planets sulfuric 
acid clouds 
the photos could disclose much about the history of venus and 
why it evolved so differently than its sister planet earth even 
though scientists believe they were almost identical at the 
formation of the solar system 46 billion years ago

several days of storms washed oil off 
alaska beaches and back into prince william sound but 
concentrations are far lighter than in the first weeks after the 
exxon valdez oil spill an official said friday 
were seeing sheens that are almost solely associated with 
rewashing said jerry galt of the national oceanic and 
atmospheric administration after several storms brought the cleanup 
to a standstill for three days 
most of the oil remained off eleanor island in the center of the 
sound galt said the concentrations however are nothing like 
they were two weeks after the tanker ran aground 
its heavy only in a relative sense he said compared to 
what we were seeing two weeks ago three weeks ago its quite 
light 
but bill lamoreaux of the alaska department of environmental 
conservation said the bad weather was a disadvantage because it 
hindered cleanup operations 
both of us are reflecting something realistic said 
lamoreaux decs coordinator of the spill effort stormy weather 
can have a a favorable effect but ongoing cleanup work remains 
essential he said 
lamoreaux said the states aerial surveys show a number of areas 
where oil appears sufficiently concentrated for effective skimming 
the storms washed oil off some beaches and back into the 
fishrich sound where grey whales migrating north stop over every 
summer and where pregnant seals soon will haul out to have their 
pups 
the weather kept skimming operations to a minimum on the gulf of 
alaska parts of the sound had very rough seas including the 
waters around smith island where the uss juneau is anchored with 
343 cleanup workers 
exxon and the coast guard said workers wouldnt leave the ship 
because of rough seas and winds in excess of 30 mph were reported 
friday 
in other developments 
the attorney for capt joseph hazelwood told the anchorage 
daily news that the exxon valdezs skipper wasnt trying to free 
his ship from the reef as taped conversations between the ship and 
the coast guard seem to indicate some officials had worried that 
hazelwood risked breaking the ship on the reef 
michael chalos of new york said his client was trying to keep 
the vessel on the ledge and that hazelwood was concerned about 
coming off the ledge and possibly capsizing or breaking up 
the tapes seem to contradict chalos 
hazelwood told the coast guard an hour after the ship ran 
aground that were in pretty good shape now stabilitywise and 
ah trying to extract her off the shoal here once we get under way 
ill let you know 
gov steve cowper accused exxon of misleading the public with a 
campaign of tall tales aimed at shifting blame for the slow 
response to the exxon valdez oil spill to the state 
cowper said exxon chairman lawrence rawls repeated statements 
that the state refused to approve the use of chemical dispersants 
soon after the spill were demonstrably false 
the statements have been repeated in the national news media and 
by federal officials including interior secretary manuel lujan 
giving them increased credibility cowper said 
if an untrue statement continues to be repeated time after 
time after time after time and you dont make an effort to refute 
that statement then people will believe it like it was gospel 
obviously thats happening now he said 
the fact is exxon did not have the capability to carry out any 
kind of oil recovery that was very effective dennis kelso the 
states chief environmentalist said 
rawl fired back at the governor late friday accusing him in 
turn of spreading wrong information 
in a letter to cowper a copy of which was obtained by the 
associated press rawl said exxon had enough dispersants on hand 
and en route to contain the spill and significantly mitigate the 
impact of the oil on the shoreline 
an anchorage mountain climber meanwhile took his own protest 
to an eightstory office building in anchorage where exxon has 
offices 
anchorage police said michael a tumey climbed out on the roof 
of the building and rappelled down stopping at about the fourth 
floor to attach a banner that read oil spilled exxon kills 
remember the sound 
when he completed his descent tumey was arrested on trespassing 
charges but not before he pulled a dead oily seabird from his 
backpack to show the gathered cameramen photographers and small 
crowd

timber industry officials angrily accused 
environmentalists friday of using threats against the spotted owl 
as a propaganda hoax and promised to mount a national effort 
to preserve forest lands for logging 
the statements at a news conference appeared to dampen efforts 
by members of the northwests congressional delegation and 
environmentalists to negotiate a way to protect both logging jobs 
and the endangered owl 
prodded by environmentalists the federal fish and wildlife 
service this week recommended listing the northern spotted owl 
which inhabits forests from northern washington to northern 
california as a threatened species 
that would involve preserving a large number of acres of 
oldgrowth forest for the approximately 1500 breeding pairs of 
owls left each pair would require as much as 2200 acres under a 
draft forest service plan 
industry officials however contend that action could result in 
as many as 280000 job layoffs losses could reach 62 billion in 
payrolls 900 million in payments to local counties and 3 billion 
in timber receipts to the federal treasury said the national 
forest products association 
its warfare between the preservationists and the industry 
said bill pickell of the washington contract loggers association 
he accused enviros of using the spotted owl issue to bring 
logging in old growth forests to a halt 
by the time all these studies on owl populations are done 
five years from now i think well find that this is the biggest 
hoax thats ever been pulled on the american public he said 
but by that time if these timberland setasides are allowed 
to continue the devastation to the industry and the northwest 
economy will be equivalent to that hiroshima bomb 
gus kuehne director of the northwest independent forest 
manufacturers said the industry was forming a national group 
called the american forest resource alliance 
he said it would battle environmentalist efforts to make inroads 
against logging in all areas of the country and would back up 
industry efforts to seek federal legislation designating lands for 
logging 
kuehne said the industry would only sit down to the negotiating 
table over the spotted owl issue as part of national talks pitting 
environmental issues against timber issues 
the forest industry officials estimates of damage to the timber 
industry were disputed by jean durning of the wilderness societys 
office in seattle 
i am distressed with the exaggerated claims of job losses 
and money losses to the economy that the industry has been 
making she said 
she said a society report last fall concluded that only 2300 
jobs would be lost over the next 40 years if significant stands of 
oldgrowth timber were set aside to save the owls at the same 
time she said 26500 jobs would be lost due to mill modernization 
conservationists recognize that achieving a healthy economy 
for the northwests timberdependent area is part of the picture by 
which we will also achieve protection for ancient forests she 
said 
the news conference followed a meeting between reps al swift 
dwash and sid morrison rwash and more than two dozen 
representatives of the timber industry 
both congressmen expressed hope that the differing sides could 
begin meetings to resolve the owl issue 
i think its essential to work with them and see what we can 
come up with said morrison 
however many at the meeting expressed doubt the industry could 
make any headway against the environmentalists position noting 
that court decisions have locked up some owl habitat forestlands 
at least temporarily

the united states and kuwait agreed to 
remove the american flag from six kuwaitowned oil tankers that 
sailed under us protection during the iraqiran war in the 
persian gulf officials said friday 
the decision announced by the us maritime administration in 
washington ended two months of deadlock between us and kuwaiti 
officials over what had been assumed to be a routine matter when 
first announced last february 
according to official sources in the gulf and in washington the 
kuwaitis objected to a us legal provision stipulating that even 
after the vessels reverted to kuwaiti registry the united states 
would retain the right to requisition them for use in a national 
emergency 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said kuwaiti 
officials rejected such a condition as infringing on kuwaiti 
sovereignty 
they said the two sides finally agreed that the tankers would be 
returned to kuwaits finance ministry rather than to the kuwait oil 
tanker co which actually operates them 
although the tanker company is wholly governmentowned the 
sources said us officials deemed the distinction sufficient for 
a waiver of kuwaits obligation to make the ships available to 
america 
walter oates a spokesman for the us maritime administration 
said he could not comment other than to say the agreement became 
effective as of thursday kuwaiti officials were not available to 
comment 
the six ships include two petrolem product tankers and four 
identical liquefied gas carriers they were among 11 kuwaitowned 
tankers reflagged by the united states in mid1987 entitling them 
to us naval escort 
iran at that time was attacking kuwaiti shipping because of 
kuwaits support for iraq in the war hostilities ended last aug 
20 with a unmediated ceasefire 
kuwait had set up a new company the chesapeake shipping co of 
dover del as ostensible us owners of the tankers chesapeake 
will sell the six ships back to kuwait in a transaction 
existing only on paper the sources said 
the other five tankers will continue to fly the stars and 
stripes at least until next february on condition that 
allamerican crews replace the regular crews during that period 
at the time of the reflagging in 1987 the reagan administration 
waived a us law requiring usflagged ships to have allamerican 
crews

a federal prosecutor promised friday that 
evidence would paint a dark picture of greed at the 
racketeering trial of e robert wallach the exlawyer of former 
attorney general edwin meese iii 
in his opening statement to the jury assistant us attorney 
baruch weiss said wallach and two other defendants had turned the 
nowdefunct wedtech corp into a vehicle for their own personal 
financial gain 
but a defense attorney countered later that the bulk of the 
governments case was based on the testimony of corrupt exwedtech 
executives with a history of deceiving and lying 
wallach exmeese financial adviser w franklyn chinn and 
chinns business associate r kent london are charged in a 
21count racketeering indictment with taking more than 1 million 
from the onetime defense contractor in phony consultants fees and 
payoffs including 525000 allegedly paid to wallach to influence 
meese and other government officials 
weiss said wallach 57 of san francisco had gone to law school 
with meese and they were very close friends 
wallach who expected to get a high government job after meese 
became attorney general in the reagan administration had a secret 
agreement with wedtech weiss said 
wallach in effect agreed to be wedtechs mole in the federal 
government he added 
wallachs lawyer gary naftalis conceded that wallach and meese 
were good friends but he called them a political odd couple 
because meese was a staunch conservative while wallach was a 
bleeding heart liberal 
the lawyer attacked former wedtech officials who already have 
pleaded guilty to corruption charges and will testify for the 
government 
naftalis claimed wallach was as much a victim of the greed and 
dishonesty of wedtech executives as were investors and employees 
wallach fell for the wedtech dream hook line and sinker 
said the defense lawyer 
once a small south bronx machine shop wedtech grew into a 100 
million government contractor through a special small business 
administration program that set aside contracts without competitive 
bidding for minoritycontrolled companies 
in previous cases prosecutors have maintained that wedtech 
continued to receive the nobid contracts even after it ceased 
being a minorityowned company through a series of bribes to 
numerous officials 
meese was never charged with any criminal activities although 
his ethics were questioned by a special prosecutor in washington 
who said meese could have been hit with tax and 
conflictofinterest charges 
meese is expected to testify at the trial at federal court in 
manhattan 
wallach and chinn 47 of san francisco and london 46 who 
divides his time between san francisco and hawaii all face maximum 
20year sentences if convicted of racketeering the most serious 
charges 
former us rep mario biaggi dny his son and four others 
were convicted last summer of corruption charges that they turned 
wedtech into a racketeering enterprise former white house aide lyn 
nofziger was convicted last year of illegal lobbying on behalf of 
wedtech 
others convicted in wedtechrelated cases include two former 
maryland legislators two new york area teamsters officials the 
former commander of the new york state national guard and a former 
postal service official in baltimore 
us rep robert garcia dny is awaiting trial on charges 
that he extorted 185000 in cash and a diamond and emerald 
necklace from wedtech

vice president dan quayle said saturday 
the usaustralia alliance is stronger than ever despite a flap 
over american grain subsidies 
i came here with expectationsthese expectations have been 
surpassed quayle told reporters at his second news conference 
since arriving in australia four days ago 
the us vice president was flying to the great barrier reef on 
saturday to do some snorkeling before heading for indonesia on 
sunday 
quayles trip has been marked by criticism from australian 
officials over the united states export enhancement program which 
provides subsidies to us grain growers 
the australians say the subsidy program has cut into their 
exports to other markets although quayle maintained during his 
fourday visit here that it was aimed at countering only europes 
protectionist policies 
asked if the debate over exports had hurt the alliance quayle 
said i dont believe we have angered the australian government 
overall he said the two countries share a common strategy of 
opening markets around the world and eliminating trade restrictions 
however quayle acknowledged his trip had provided him an 
education on the issue 
i am far more sensitive to that issue than before i came he 
said at the conference held in the sydney opera house 
quayle said he was impressed by the directness of the 
australian people and liked their approach in addressing him by 
my first name 
personally i enjoy candor he said 
another issue that has come up during quayles visit was the 
status of the australiannew zealandus military alliance known 
as anzus 
new zealands prime minister david lange has indicated his 
country might formally leave the pact 
but quayle said that alliance is stronger than ever too 
despite a virtual freeze in relations between the united states and 
new zealand over new zealands antinuclear stance the policy 
prevents us warships armed with nuclear weapons from making port 
calls 
quayle said there is still a vacant chair for new zealand in 
the tripartite pact should it chose to return to full participation 
and that he hoped that would be as soon as possible 
the australians have complained that us subsidies on wheat 
hurt their exports abroad an argument that quayle rejected we 
do not believe that it is injuring australia he said 
in an editorial friday the australian a nationally circulated 
newspaper said who do you think you are kidding mr quayle 
read our lips mr quayle australians are not happy 
all in all however quayle has been wellreceived in a country 
that enjoys smooth relations with the united states talking with 
reporters aboard air force two quayle called australia a very 
important country with which the united states has close ties 
he said his meetings with officials in indonesia singapore and 
thailand countries he visits next on his 12day foreign trip 
might be more contentious because of frictions with the united 
states particularly on trade issues

launcher three machine guns five handguns four rifles a 
shotgun five automatic weapons and 10 silencers in the predawn 
raid on three rooms of a motel in the citys northeast section 
city police and federal agents sought to determine what those

five congressmen put a trio of leading judges 
on notice the pay raise so vigorously sought by federal judges may 
well depend on denying it to senior judges who do no judicial work 
pay raises should be reserved for those who work said rep 
robert kastenmeier dwis chairman of the house courts 
subcommittee 
his message was echoed by four republican and democratic 
colleagues at a hearing thursday they were taken aback by 
testimony from the judicial leaders who are seeking a 30 percent 
pay raise for all federal judges 
us circuit judge frank coffin depicted a federal bench 
demoralized over the loss of a 51 percent pay raise earlier this 
year but he displayed no willingness to compromise in response to 
complaints over pay that members of congress hear when they go home 
to the voters 
i have never seen so many judges at all levels in all courts 
and in all parts of the country so disheartened as i do today 
coffin said ours is a lunar landscape with all of the stark and 
ominous silhouettes that the term implies

soviets are growing increasingly pessimistic about 
their future the mayor of moscow told president mikhail gorbachev 
during a meeting of the communist partys policymaking central 
committee 
many soviets believe the party has failed to lead society and 
have lost faith in their leaders mayor valery t saikin told 
gorbachev during an unprecedented closeddoor exchange tuesday 
excerpts from the meeting were published thursday in pravda the 
partys official newspaper 
officials said one reason for the loss of faith has been that 
gorbachevs 4yearold restructuring program of perestroika has 
failed to solve many of the countrys problems 
gorbachev in closing remarks at the meeting tuesday agreed 
perestroika was going poorly and was worsening shortages of 
housing consumer goods and food but the 58yearold leader said 
people still have faith in the party 
i do not agree with extreme judgments that the party is nearly 
losing its position in the country or that it has turned into a

miami vice has gone cold cbs 
wiseguy has become the hottest show in prime time 
its also the hippest guest shot on tv the current storyline 
about the recording industry guest stars rock stars glenn frey and 
deborah harry cult actor tim curry the rocky horror picture 
show and former don johnson main squeeze patti darbanville 
an earlier storyline lured reversecool jerry lewis into a rare 
television role tony winner ron silver speedtheplow played 
lewis son 
the attention is welcome for now but the pitfalls of being 
annointed as hot by the coolest of the cool is not lost on the 
shows producerwriters steve kronish and david burke 
when you get too cool you can get cold said kronish 
sitting in burkes office in the stephen j cannell productions 
building in hollywood a long way from vancouver where wiseguy 
is filmed 
kronish said he and burke plan to avoid bigname stars in the 
future and return to the obscure offbeat casting that impressed 
the industry and tv critics alike when the show premiered last 
season 
the first storyline rejuvenated ray sharkeys career then 
unknowns kevin spacey and joan severance made a splash as an 
incestuous brothersister crime wave in a second storyline another 
of last seasons guest stars was 60s andy warhol film veteran joe 
dallesandro 
wiseguy is something of a distant cousin of miami vice 
burke cowrote the pilot of crime story for miami vice 
executive producer michael mann 
burkes road to hollywood was winding his father former 
latenight new york talkshow host alan burke disapproved of his 
sons showbiz aspirations but begrudgingly got him a job with a 
friend director otto preminger 
burke moved into documentary production and became a political 
media consultant for clients ranging from jamaica to us senate 
candidate jay rockefeller 
the script that got me essentially plugged into this business 
i was working on during a tour of west virginia with jay 
rockefeller from television station to television station burke 
said at the end of the day id go back to the hotel and sit in 
the hotel office and work on the script its actually a pilot now 
at abc 
sacraments is about the mayor of a large northeastern city 
who came up from the streets bringing his workingclass cohorts 
into power with him 
kronish armed with a degree in journalism got a job as talent 
coordinator on a local talk show in la a play he had written 
landed him his first scriptwriting job after he was variously 
unemployed an insurance salesman and an assistant golf pro his 
first steady tv job was a game show called appropriately enough 
anything for money 
while still overseeing wiseguy burke and kronish found 
themselves with another series at midseason nbcs unsub about 
a crack federal forensic unit 
paul monas an attorney friend of burke had come up with the 
idea a couple of years ago burke mentioned it to cannell but 
other projects ensued and burke forgot about it at a lunch last 
fall with nbc entertainment president brandon tartikoff cannell 
offhandedly pitched unsub the show was on the air three months 
later 
unsub was a modestly successful midseason replacement 
wiseguy meanwhile has begun to catch on cbs picking up on 
the cult status of the show has launched an aggressive ad campaign 
burke and kronish are hoping though that the show is not a 
megahit 
maybe the fact that it isnt does give us a certain amount of 
freedom to do things that a hit show might not be able to do 
said kronish 
i think the people who like wiseguy like it because weve 
done things that are relatively unexpected and i think we deal 
with the sort of gray areas of these characters lives that a lot 
of episodic tv doesnt deal with 
i think that we havent been a hit in terms of big numbers was 
a benefit in terms of being left alone to do what we want said 
burke 
i found this year particularly following the jerry lewisron 
silver storyline we suddenly were being watched a lot more 
closely by everybody the network people out there who watch the 
show in general and the question of can we do that became one 
that started getting asked and it was never asked before

the widely publicized death of a 
prostitute has increased concern about aids and officials are 
trying to dispel false ideas about the disease in a nation where 
sex is a flourishing trade 
officials say at least 22 people in the philippines have 
developed active aids cases and 100 have been identified as 
carriers of the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
sixtyone of the 100 carriers are female prostitutes and 50 of 
them work near clark air base and the subic bay naval base the two 
huge us military installations in the philippines 
dr erlinda guerrero the national aids registrar believes the 
true figures are higher she says inadequate testing and reporting 
methods may be missing 90 percent of the carriers 
since 30 per cent of carriers develop symptoms of the disease in 
five years she fears aids cases could reach 300 by then 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome for which there is no cure 
weakens the bodys ability to resist infection and makes the victim 
vulnerable to a range of fatal illnesses it is spread by sexual 
contact use of infected needles and contaminated blood products 
officials say all but three of the 22 aids patients acquired the 
disease abroad 
two of the three who contracted it in the philippines have died 
a male homosexual died last year and the second victim was a 
24yearold bar girl from angeles home of clark air base her 
death last month was widely publicized 
she died at the time of newspaper reports that a young brazilian 
woman who claimed to have had sex with many prominent filipinos 
tested positive for the aids virus the brazilian has left the 
country and because of privacy regulations health officials 
refuse to confirm whether she was infected 
officials say aids could spread rapidly in the philippines 
because of prostitution and public misconceptions of the disease 
peter resurrecion of the national aids control program said a 
gallup survey of 35 nations had the philippines among the countries 
whose people believe the disease can be contracted by working 
beside infected people or sharing drinking glasses with them or 
from insect bites 
a survey by the health department found that many male 
prostitutes thought exercise prevents aids he said 
officials say 94 percent of men who contracted aids or carried 
the virus had not used condoms 
health department workers are studying ways to combat aids myths 
and are instructing the public on effective precautions officials 
plan to spend most of the 467290 allocated for aids control on 
print and broadcast advertising 
our basic goal is to change the behavior of people 
considering that each individual has the responsibility to protect 
himself dr guerrero said 
in angeles city health officer proceso mejia said posters 
saying prevent aids use condoms and no condom no sex were 
placed in the bar district 
the high percentage of aids carriers among prostitutes working 
near us bases has led some womens groups to urge that the 
installations be closed to keep the disease from spreading 
we think aids is coming to the philippines through the us 
bases said adul de leon an official of the militant feminist 
organization gabriela which demands that the united states finance 
aids control programs 
dr guerrero said the high incidence around the bases may be 
traceable to the fact that since us authorities paid for the 
program 67 per cent of the 108000 screened were from those areas 
us officials have promised that any american service member 
found to carry the virus will not be assigned to the philippines

a decade ago china set a course of 
marketoriented reform the soviet union has just begun it has 
experienced the reward and pain of economic freedom for a communist 
society and may have some valuable lessons for mikhail s 
gorbachev during the first chinesesoviet summit in 30 years 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for mikhail gorbachev chinas chaotic blend of 
plenty and want success and failure is a vision of what may await 
the soviet union as it embarks on economic and social reform 
he arrives may 15 on a mission to normalize relations between 
the two communist giants after 30 years of hostility one thing he 
will take home is a lesson in the difficulties of easing a 
communist states grip on the economy 
senior leader deng xiaoping began marketoriented reforms 10 
years ago long before gorbachev and perestroika came along 
gross national product has tripled foreign trade has gone from 
40 billion in 1980 to 100 billion last year 
per capita income still is equivalent to only about 200 a year 
but has more than tripled in the decade families that once 
scrimped to buy a bicycle now own refrigerators color televisions 
and stereos 
the early euphoria is over however and the corrosive effects 
of inflation and corruption threaten the future of liberalization 
annual inflation is more than 30 percent in a nation that for 
decades banned price increases and profiteering is rampant 
democratic reform is another story gorbachev has held 
multiplecandidate elections and opened up the press with his 
glasnost policy but deng believes intellectual freedom should be 
doled out as economic reforms progress 
huge student demonstrations in past weeks illustrated the 
profound dissatisfaction of educated chinese with their government 
deng permitted the democracy wall movement of 197879 in which 
posters for democracy were displayed while it served his political 
purposes then he crushed it and threw the leaders in jail 
the official press is encouraged to be a watchdog but is not 
permitted to criticize communist party leaders or the system 
gorbachev will be shown the dazzling successes of gaige and 
kaifang chinas words for reform and opening to the outside 
world 
reform has produced 23 million entrepreneurs many operating 
from bicycles or roadside stands who did 35 billion worth of 
business last year 
vendors and family farmers freed from nowdefunct communes have 
combined to keep free markets stocked with fruit vegetables and 
meat afind 16000 joint ventures in china with a total commitment 
of 25 billion 
many are small textile or appliance factories that have created 
instant boomtowns in southern china near hong kong the capitalist 
enclave 
china also has glistening sheraton and hilton hotels 
restaurants ranging from kentucky fried chicken to maxims and 
shanghai factories producing volkswagen autos and mcdonnell douglas 
passenger planes 
four special economic zones have nearly a free hand in seeking 
foreign investment and are in cutthroat competition offering 
preferential treatment to foreign companies 
many of the bold experiments have been slowed by concern for 
inflation but not before they transformed concepts of socialist 
ownership and financing 
about 6000 enterprises have issued shares mostly to employees 
many economists see shareholding as the best way for moneylosing 
state factories to spur worker initiative and raise capital 
primitive stock markets have sprung up in several large cities 
and a nationwide stock exchange is being debated 
exchange markets for treasury bonds operate in 61 cities real 
estate markets are emerging as the government encourages private 
housing and sale of land to developers 
chinese peasants for millenia harnessed to their plows have a 
new mobility 
eighty million onetenth of the rural population have found 
jobs in the small industries that have provided much of the 
economic growth millions more have been drawn to cities by the 
booming construction and service industries 
old habits of state interference and the iron rice bowl of 
guaranteed employment refuse to die but factory owners have the 
right to hire and fire workers 
a bankruptcy law permits state factories to be closed for losing 
money although they seldom are many workers have contracts with 
their employers and at least in theory can quit if something 
better turns up when the contract is fulfilled 
the benefits of economic reform has been great but the bills 
are coming due and chinese leaders flinch at their size 
according to official figures the living standards of onethird 
of urban residents declined last year because of rising prices 
a nationwide mania for building and the states loss of control 
over credit have overheated the economy excessive growth has 
caused an energy crunch and shortages of raw materials which 
encourage profiteering 
small farmers once heroes are being blamed for four successive 
poor grain harvests because they would rather grow cash crops for 
the free markets than cheap grain for the state 
last month the government responded to the bad news with an 
austerity program that cut off investment credit canceled 
thousands of building projects and returned central control to wide 
areas of prices finance and foreign trade 
it also has put a moratorium on further reforms the end to 
price controls deemed essential to achieving balance between supply 
and demand 
unemployment theoretically nonexistent in a socialist state 
has become reality the government gives the rate as 2 percent but 
does not count millions of people laid off by the closures of rural 
enterprises whose credito or supplies dried up 
railway stations were clogged last winter with peasants trying 
to reach cities for construction jobs most of which already had 
been eliminated 
leaders have acknowledged their errors and say the reforms will 
continue when the current mess is cleared up 
deng the 84yearold father of the reforms told the president 
of togo recently if there had been enough vigilance three or 
four years ago things would be much better today 
deeply disturbing to the chinese are social problems that did 
not exist when everyone read from the same little red book and 
lived in the same egalitarian poverty 
widening income gaps contributed to a 13 percent increase in 
crime last year the number of larceny cases rose 64 percent 
elders are horrified by the materialism of the young and their 
more casual attitudes toward sex and pornography cases of venereal 
disease tripled in 1988 to 56000 
educated chinese long victimized by mao tsetungs 
antiintellectual policies are angered by a situation in which 
doctors and professors are paid the equivalent of 50 a month while 
illiterate street peddlers earn 1000 thousands want to go abroad 
for study or work and many will not return 
premier li peng the cautious technocrat who engineered the 
current economic slowdown has led the appeal for a return to the 
old values of sacrifice and thrift 
people should be ideologically prepared to live a hard life 
for a few years he said 
few are even the communist party is plagued by corruption as 
people use official powers to commandeer and resell scarce 
industrial and consumer goods 
one report from sichuan said 150 tons of government fertilizer 
for grain farmers was sold 26 times before it actually got to them

china and the soviet union were brothers in 
communism but the first summit since they fell out nearly 30 years 
ago will not be a family reunion 
the chinese determined to show independence from their onetime 
tutor in revolution have forced the soviets to make the overtures 
and concessions toward normal relations 
when mikhail s gorbachev comes to beijing on may 15 it will be 
deng xiaoping the 84yearold chinese leader who plays big 
brother because of both age and his pioneering of economic reforms 
the soviets are just beginning 
during the past year gorbachev pulled soviet troops out of 
afghanistan announced unilateral troop withdrawals from the 
chinese border and put pressure on the soviet ally vietnam to 
withdraw from cambodia after more than a decade of occupation 
vietnam has said it will do so by sept 30 
those actions met chinas three conditions for a summit with the 
soviet leader and moved closer to gorbachevs own goal of reducing 
international tension so he can focus on domestic economic problems 
china agreed to the summit almost grudgingly 
when eduard a shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister 
announced the date during a visit to beijing in february the 
chinese initially denied it and then issued a confirmation two days 
later 
ties between the two nations in trade foreign policy and 
cultural exchange have become close in the past decade but chinese 
leaders say they have no intention of resuming the alliance 
the main immediate value of the summit for china which is wary 
of an expansionist vietnam has been the concessions on cambodia 
diplomatic sources said the chinese were trying to extract new 
pledges even in the final weeks before gorbachevs arrival 
vietnams withdrawal plan does not include a un peacekeeping 
force or establishment of an interim government to oversee 
elections china is said to want both endorsed in the summit 
communique 
moscow seeks a general statement of principles guiding the 
relationship like the shanghai communique signed by president 
richard m nixon on his 1972 visit to china 
its not obligatory to mention cambodia in the communique 
said vv duhin cultural counsellor at the soviet embassy this 
document is designed for many years and cambodia is a problem of 
this year and next year 
igor rogachev soviet deputy foreign minister slipped into 
beijing quietly in late april hoping to resolve the matter a 
western diplomat described it as a game of chicken 
animosity and disagreement between the two countries have a long 
history from the 17th century to the early 20th china and russia 
contended for influence in the vast asian interior 
soviet agents helped organize the chinese communist party in 
1921 and gave it assistance but also tried to dictate strategy in 
a way that irked the revolutionaries especially mao tsetung 
josef stalin thought little of maos plan for revolution in the 
countryside the soviet dictator continued recognizing the 
nationalist chinese government even as maos peasant guerrilla army 
was sweeping to victory 
friction continued after the stalinmao alliance of 1950 the 
soviets insisted on special rights to ports and railways in 
northeastern china in return for military and technological aid 
embarrassing chinese leaders who claimed to have ended foreign 
control 
the split came in the early 1960s after the soviets refused to 
back china in its 1959 border conflict with india would not help 
recapture taiwan from the nationalists and scrubbed an agreement to 
help the chinese build a nuclear bomb 
a border dispute led to a brief but bloody clash in 1969 
pragmatism took precedence over ideology under deng and china 
resumed trade and other nonpolitical exchanges with the soviet 
union 
both gorbachev and deng like to be seen as international 
peacemakers and both have serious economic and political problems 
at home 
restless nationalist groups in the soviet union have been 
demanding autonomy or independence university students in beijing 
have demonstrated for democracy on an unprecedented scale 
deng already has done away with maos communes and shelved his 
theories of continuous class struggle 
by meeting gorbachev deng is addressing one of maos last 
remaining legacies the chinesesoviet estrangement that has 
affected the world political map for three decades

here is a chronology of major events in 
chinesesoviet relations since the peoples republic of china was 
established in 1949 
october 1949 the soviet union was the first foreign nation to 
recognize the peoples republic led by mao tsetung 
december 1949 mao mades his first trip to moscow and was 
snubbed by josef stalin who met the chinese revolutionary only 
after mao threatened to return home 
february 1950 after difficult negotiations mao and stalin 
signed a friendship treaty 
1955 the soviets left dalian or port arthur which they had 
occupied since wo february 1956 nikita khrushchevs speech criticizing 
stalin 
who died in 1953 surprised and angered the chinese communists 
they accused the soviets of rerld war ii 
visionism 
october 1957 the soviets agreed to furnish china with a sample 
atomic bomb the promise was retracted two years later after 
relations began to cool 
1958 khrushchev visited beijing to urge caution toward the 
united states in chinas conflict with taiwan over the offshore 
islands of quemoy and matsu but was rebuffed 
october 1959 khrushschev visited beijing for the 10th 
anniversary of the peoples republic talks with mao went badly and 
ref the 
campaign which began last year 
unlike the dozens of other national academies in rome the 
american academy receives no direct government financing it does 
apply for and receive some federal grants 
the endowment was great when mckim jp morgan william k 
vanderbilt and others put it together in the early 1900s and it 
wasnt bad in the 1940s and 50s said joseph connors the new 
academy director 
but as of the 70s and 80s it began to look very insignificant 
to the needs of the academy after the drop in the dollar in 1985 
its been very hard for us to pay our bills 
keeping all the academys fellows happy also has been difficult 
they find the modest stipends for a year of study and work do not 
go far in one of europes most expensive cities 
stipends range from less than 6000 to 11000 plus a room 
studio and daily meal at the academy 
this years literature fellow edward hirsch said he would have 
stayed home had not the university of houston where he teaches 
supplemented his stipend of about 8000 a predecessor novelist 
padgett powell left the academy early because he could not afford 
to stay 
its difficult to live on the stipend if youre alone very 
difficult if you have a spouse and impossible if you have a 
family said hirsch 39 who brought his wife and child 
criticism from the outside also crops up now and then there 
have been complaints which connors rejects that the academy is 
isolated overlooks rome in both senses of the word and is a clubby 
institute little known beyond the janiculum 
connors a 44yearold art and architecture historian from 
columbia university says he is trying to improve the financial and 
living conditions for fellows 
he said the lowest stipend will be raised next year from 5800 
to 7500 and he hopes to arrange apartment suites for families 
many fellows would like better food in the academy dining hall 
which they say suits a college cafeteria more than a city renowned 
for cuisine but most agree with hirsch that the academys benefits 
far outweigh the hardships 
aside from more money for the fellowships and higher quality 
of food its hard to know what the academy can do better he 
said 
being in rome has affected me as a writer americans have a 
poor sense of history and you cant walk around rome without being 
immersed in history 
its inspiring drinking at a cafe where goethe drank and 
standing in the cemetery where keats is buried theres no 
doubt ill be writing about rome in one way or the other for many 
years to come 
john obuck a 41yearold painter from new york said he 
sometimes misses the razzledazzle manhattan art scene but loves 
the soft roman light 
its so different from new york city he said i have a 
studio with a huge skylight so i can paint in the daylight i dont 
know how ill ever go back to artificial light 
each year the academy selects about 25 fellows from 1000 
applicants they are chosen by a jury of prominent artists and 
scholars in new york on the basis of submitted works proposed 
projects and interviews 
a few resident and visiting scholars also stay at the academy 
for a few months to work on their own projects and counsel younger 
fellows this year they have included brodsky mary mccarthy and 
harrison salisbury 
most fellows live and work in the main building a palazzo of 
marble and faded red stucco built at the turn of the century 
academy directors and visitors normally live up the road at the 
villa aurelia a 17th century palace in landscaped gardens and ilex 
trees that was garibaldis headquarters during the battle with the 
french in 1849 
the academy library considered one of the worlds finest for 
classical studies and archaeology is open to the public and 
attracts many researchers 
fellows generally are left on their own to pursue their 
projects there are no courses exams or graduation ceremonies 
in the spring the artists have a public exhibit the scholars 
give lectures and the composers present a concert

exxon corp chairman lawrence g rawl keeps a 
book about shipwrecks on a shelf of his sprawling sparsely 
furnished office but to the head of the nations biggest oil 
company the worst shipwreck of all happened on his watch and now 
hes paying the price of public rebuke 
the onetime petroleum engineer who took over exxons helm in 
january 1987 has agonized over the imagebeating the company has 
taken since an exxon supertanker hit a reef in valdez alaska and 
spewed 250000 barrels of gooey crude into pristine prince william 
sound the worst spill in us history 
rightly or wrongly the 60yearold executive has been accused 
by critics of mismanaging the disaster from the start particularly 
because he seemed to remain hidden from the press and public for a 
week afterward 
while the nation awaited word from exxon about the spill on that 
good friday morning in march the company chairman admits he was 
holed up at his house in a new york suburb 
i figured the best thing to do was stay by the phone so i 
spent the day on the phone at home basically rawl said in an 
interview in his spacious 51stfloor corner office in the exxon 
tower in midtown manhattan 
in fact rawl said he had to convince himself not to rush to 
alaska to take charge after aides telephoned him with the news a 
few hours after the exxon valdez grounded on bligh reef 
my first instinct is to become an operator my first instinct 
on anything is to go said rawl but he indicated in retrospect 
that may have been a mistake 
i had some advice that didnt make a whole lot of sense he 
said adding but i could have done anything if i wanted to go 
to alaska i mean ill go 
after consulting with company executives rawl said he decided 
his presence in valdez would detract from the critical first task 
of keeping the supertanker from leaking more oil 
rawl inherited the chief executive suite at the 107yearold 
company more than two years ago and is not well known to the 
outside world a career exxon executive whose personal earnings 
topped 9 million last year rawl says he is comfortable in the 
vast office 
a 10foot live ficus tree is the most prominent feature a 
bluejacketed book titled ships and shipwrecks leans on a shelf 
with a handful of others 
im not much for decoration ive been told that he said 
eyeing the bare walls everyone wants to decorate it for me 
for the first time in his 37 years with exxon rawl has had to 
publicly defend himself and his company against what he calls 
deep and virulent attacks something with which he is clearly 
uncomfortable 
attempting to convince an unbelieving public of the companys 
sincerity he says has become the most painful crisis of his 
executive career 
rawl was born and raised in new jersey the fifth of six 
children his father was a truck driver who worked in new york and 
his mother a housewife who held outside jobs during the depression 
after high school and a twoyear stint in the marines rawl went 
west to explore new territory his journey ended at oklahoma 
university where he got a degree in petroleum engineering in 1952 
that same year he joined exxon in houston since then he has served 
in a range of roles including vice president and president before 
he became chairman and chief executive 
but rawl whose hobbies include golf and fly fishing said he 
never had big plans for himself 
i wanted to get a job and make a pretty decent living and i 
never really aspired to doing much more than that he said 
rawl said he believes fate has guided his career and will 
continue to do so 
sometimes youre not sure whether its good or bad luck but 
theres been a lot of luck the executive said 
despite his new role in the limelight rawl remains an enigma to 
many wall street security analysts who follow the company 
this is the only company that analysts dont get a chance to 
sit with the operating management said frank p knuettel with 
the investment firm prudentialbache securities inc 
as to where and how the company is moving knuettel said 
frankly being so quiet its rather difficult to make a 
judgment he says many of his analyses are hit and miss 
stephen smith of bear stearns amp co said rawl is quieter 
than the average 
hes been a little less public about the companys plans 
there have been less analyst meetings since hes been there 
smith said 
rawl readily admits hes not the most effusive personality but 
dismisses accusations he has evaded the press or wall street 
scrutiny 
i know im not certainly not flamboyant i dont believe i 
could carry that off but im not hidden out the chairman said

george washington liked cornbread and his 
second cousin five times removed says his illustrious ancestor must 
have passed the taste on to him 
james buchanan iv an rampb musician from texas says he inherited 
from his greatgreatgreat uncle the 15th president of the united 
states not only his name but a lot of nice furniture 
including a teak desk that was a gift from the king of siam 
the notion of public service was thomas jeffersons legacy 
to his family which today includes many teachers says john works 
his greatgreatgreatgreatgreat grandson and a wall street lawyer 
the curator the musician and the lawyer are among descendants 
of 39 former presidents all but ronald reagan who will gather 
at federal hall in lower manhattan on sunday for the bicentennial 
commemoration of washingtons presidential inauguration 
the new york city commission on the bicentennial of the 
constitution said it would be the largest gathering ever of men and 
women with presidential bloodlines 
peter nissen a freelance researcher was the commissions 
official descendant hunter it took a lot of detective work he 
says buchanans family for example was particularly hard to 
locate 
phone calls to buchanans listed in mercersberg pa where the 
president was born first turned up the buchanan inn they asked 
if i wanted dinner and then buchanan tomatoes they grow 
hydroponic tomatoes said nissen 
eventually he got in touch with james buchanan iv in austin 
texas who is coming with his mother eleanor henry 69 
it sounds like a whole lot of fun said buchanan 40 ive 
got my tux ready for the presidential ball and all the parades and 
i chipped in with my sister to buy a new camera for my mother 
the presidential descendants include stockbrokers a high school 
student company executives lawyers writers a teacher and a 
former us representative to the united nations 
some of them describe their ancestors terms in office with 
glowing admiration while others offer a more dispassionate 
appraisal but all speak of their presidential forebears with pride 
robert fillmore norfleet 18 a senior at st christopher high 
school in richmond va and the greatgreatgreatgreat nephew of 
millard fillmore recently studied the 13th president in his us 
history class 
when you hear of millard fillmore you think of him as being an 
ineffective and mediocre person said norfleet a football and 
lacrosse player student council member and sports editor for the 
school newspaper 
but he noted that fillmore came from a very prestigious 
background was a smart man wellmannered and liked by a lot of 
people 
david b roosevelt 47 a new york stockbroker spoke of the 
strength and foresight of his grandfather franklin d 
roosevelt which he said enabled him to develop policies which 
although they may have seemed perhaps radical and at times severe 
and very unpopular were vital for this country 
he then tempered his words of praise with modesty we were 
taught to be proud of the heritage and accomplishments of our 
grandparents but to never use these for personal advancement or 
gain he said 
andrew jackson iv an assistant attorney general in knoxville 
tenn was impressed with his greatgreatgreat grandfathers 
honesty and patriotism 
i dont think he was the best president but i think he was up 
there with the better part of them he added 
his name sometimes prompts jokes jackson said i thought you 
were dead or youre looking fine to be 200 years old 
can harrison ruffin tyler the president of a chemical treatment 
company in ashland va really be the grandson of john tyler the 
10th president 
tyler explains my grandfather was 63 when father was born in 
1853 then my father was 75 when i was born in 1928 so it does 
add up 
john tyler who had 15 children by two wives set a 
presidential record that will never be broken noted the 
descendant he certainly was a family man 
one of the most common sentiments expressed by the presidential 
descendants is regret that they dont know more about their famous 
ancestors 
benjamin harrison walker 68 a vice president of an insurance 
company in new york said as a young man he was embarrassed to ask 
his grandmother about his grandfather benjamin harrison the 23rd 
president who died in 1901 
sadly i didnt talk to them he said 
one of the most distant of the presidential descendants to 
attend the bicentennial festivities is clement e conger of 
alexandria va who is the second cousin five times removed of the 
man whose inauguration is being honored 
sarah ball congers greatgreatgreatgreat grandmother was 
the first cousin of mary ball who was washingtons mother 
explained conger curator of the diplomatic reception rooms at the 
state department and former curator of the white house 
i consented rather reluctantly to go to the inaugural 
commemoration he said i felt someone with the name washington 
might have been a better representative 
but conger who is in his 70s is well chosen he is an expert 
on washingtons life from important facts about his presidency to 
trivial insights into his private life 
my mother was eminently interested in history conger said 
my brother didnt like cornbread so of course i didnt but my 
mother would say george washington ate cornbread and that meant 
the little conger boys should eat it 
i love cornbread now he added

ive got a plan he says as he leans against his old ford 
tractor if it works out im going to get my watermelons on the

up 
crosby a friendly man with a wiry build becomes excited as he 
talks about his crops and the 43acre dream farm where he and 
his family once worked as field hands however this could be the 
last spring for his dream and for a lot of other dreams like his 
at 33 lc crosby is a young black farmer and as such hes 
twice as likely to lose his land as his white counterpart 
in 1910 the nations 950000 black farmers comprised 14 percent 
of all farmers in this country now the remaining 35000 make up 
just 16 percent of the 23 million farmers in the united states 
according to the us census bureau the number of black farms 
declined by 42 percent between 1978 and 1982 white farms fell by 
only 24 percent during the same period 
unless this trend is reversed there will be no more black 
farmers in america by the year 2000 this dire prediction is 
contained in the us civil rights commissions 1982 report on the 
decline of black farmers in america 
yet while theres just a relative handful of young black 
farmers still operating the current median age for us black 
farmers is 60 the federal government is trying to force lc 
crosby off his land 
the fha farmers home administration has given him notice to 
vacate the premises because hes behind on his loan but were 
telling him to stay put and fight says george paris jr a 
field coordinator for the private nonprofit federation of 
southern cooperatives 
crosby bought his farm which includes a large pond and 
fiveacre pecan orchard at an fha auction in 1985 he bid 36500 
borrowing 31000 from the government 
my annual payment is 3800 he said i fell behind the 
second year now ive got the money to make the payment but the 
fha wants the whole 30000 
paris said hes heard that a wealthy white landowner whose bid 
was 10000 lower than crosbys covets the property 
its the same old story he said the fha is slowly 
changing but basically at the local level quite often its still a 
bunch of good ol white boys who look after each other 
paris father who worked for the fha for nearly 30 years and 
was one of the first black men ever to serve as an assistant county 
supervisor agrees with this assessment 
it was tragic blacks always got the last and the least 
said the elder paris adding that he saw hundreds of black 
alabamians lose their farms during the 30 years he workd for the 
fha 
i remember one time back in the 60s i was told outright 
by a white fha committee member in bullock county ala that a 
black farmer had been denied a loan because he was shooting off 
his mouth about civil rights 
under the fhas loan procedure a county supervisor makes a 
recommendation to a threemember county loan committee which then 
either approves or denies the loan fred bennett a 73yearold 
farmer in the mt zion community near greenville was the first 
black ever to serve on an fha county committee 
in this country the average blackowned farm contains fewer 
than 100 acres compared with an average of 440 acres for all us 
farms bennett and his wife lena own 500 acres which they slowly 
acquired over the past 40 years parcel by parcel 
my grandfather came to this area at age 12 shortly after he 
was freed from slavery bennett said he never owned land 
being a cash renter but ive found that for a black man in this 
country there is no greater security nor better avenue to 
independence than farming 
bennett who said he and his four brothers pooled their 
resources and pulled together toward a common objective 
acknowledged he is worried and saddened that this generation of 
young blacks isnt going into agriculture 
after the civil war the federal government promised the freed 
blacks 40 acres and a mule but hardly any of them got it he 
said our people should realize by now that theyve got to help 
themselves nobodys going to do it for them 
im very concerned that young blacks are turning their backs 
on farming at a time when life in the cities is getting worse 
every day 
the united farmers organization a nonprofit advocacy group 
based in charlotte nc estimates there now are fewer than 200 
fulltime black farmers aged 25 or under in the entire country 
officials at north carolina aampt state university who say they 
are getting 25 percent fewer agriculture students than they did 20 
years ago blame farmings poor image and the enormous difficulty 
young blacks face in amassing capital 
the continuing phenomenon of black land loss was the topic at a 
recent meeting sponsored by the university and the united church of 
christ 
greed and institutional racism are the major reasons blacks 
have been forced out of farming said the rev charles shelby rooks 
director of the churchs board of homeland ministries in his 
keynote address at the conference in greensboro nc 
in its report the us civil rights commission found that 
blacks were being illserved by the fha the us department of 
agricultures agency designed specifically to help poor farmers 
the commission noting that black farmers 90 percent of whom 
are in the south often are unable to deal with the ever more 
complex federal loan programs the commission called for serious 
government intervention 
last july as part of an omnibus farm bill passed by congress in 
1987 the fha launched its socially disadvantaged outreach farm 
ownership program 
so far said fha spokesman nolan kegley we have made 58 
loans to minority farmers under the program he said the loans 
totalling 46 million are to finance farm purchases for poor 
blacks and other minorities 
we recognize the problems of the past and were working on 
them at all levels kegley said since 1984 the percentage of 
fha loans to blacks has been steadily increasing 
he acknowledged when asked however that only 91 of the fhas 
1849 county supervisors are black in mississippi the state with 
the most black farmers eight of the 82 county supervisors are 
black in north carolina its only three of 79 
fha officials in those states say they have had little luck 
recruiting qualified blacks because the goverment pay scale isnt 
competitive

in alabama however eight of 57 county supervisors are black 
two of seven district supervisors are black and 49 of 203 county 
committee members are black 
george paris says the fha must make such acrosstheboard 
efforts in every state if black farmers are to have an equal chance 
to survive 
the new fha minority funding outreach program does little he 
said to help many of those black farmers already indebted to the 
federal government 
if they really want to help black farmers they should forgive 
their past debts and let them start over he added lord knows 
the fha has done little enough in the past to help small farmers 
paris organization is in the forefront of the effort to help 
black farmers stay on the land the federation offers counseling in 
crop planning and farm management it also helps poor farmers 
black and white wade through the intracacies of the fha loan and 
appeal procedures 
jerry pennick who heads the federations land assistance fund 
has helped draft a proposed minority farmers act that would 
provide emergency aid among other things it would create a 
special agency within the usda to deal with concerns of minority 
farmers and develop a special debt restructuring program for 
farmers who are less than 100000 in hock to the fha 
we hope to get the bill introduced this fall or early next 
year pinnock said the black congressional caucus is planning 
to push it we also have assurances of support support from some 
white congressmen 
black farmers such as lc crosby meanwhile are hanging on by 
a slender thread 
for others such as tim pigford a ruined thirdgeneration 
farmer from arcadia nc the thread has snapped 
i havent farmed since 1984 the year the hurricane blew 
through here said pigford who now works in a factory the fha 
never would loan me enough money to buy a farm just enough to rent 
out land to farm but the hurricane ruined me and now the 
government is trying to take my house 
pigford who testified in 1984 before a congressional committee 
investigating the fhas lending practices added that he thinks his 
chances are slim of ever getting back onto a tractor seat 
another young farmer george ammans who raises turkeys at 
kenansville nc says whites shouldnt think that black farmers 
are just looking for free handouts 
like bald eagles im a member of an endangered species he 
said if the government is willing to help eagles it oughta be 
willing to help me all i want is a chance to survive

roadblocks in the settlement of criminal fraud 
charges against drexel burnham lambert inc will delay states from 
levying fines and stripping the investment firms brokerage 
licenses state securities officials say 
nevertheless lawyers for drexel have met with regulators in all 
50 states to try to smooth a wave of expected punitive action 
against the brokerage house at the center of wall streets ongoing 
criminal scandals the regulators said 
state securities laws bar convicted or admitted felons from 
operating in the securities industry drexel has agreed to plead 
guilty to six crimes to resolve a range of fraud charges brought by 
the manhattan us attorneys office 
but legal challenges in new york to the federal judge who must 
approve the criminal pact and the separate settlement with the 
securities and exchange commission are delaying resolution 
indefinitely 
until drexel formally enters a plea states are powerless to try 
to punish drexel 
the states cant do anything until there is an order issued on 
some sort susan bryant oklahomas securities administrator who 
heads a panel of state regulators examining drexel said thursday 
but she added it probably will mean states will start 
negotiating a settlement with drexel even though there is no order 
yet 
the state officials met privately to discuss drexel during a 
conference of the north american securities administrators 
association in washington this week 
officials said they are studying punitive measures against 
drexel including fines suspensions and broad supervision and 
concessions that would permit the firm to retain brokers and do 
business such as municipal bonds with towns and cities 
states dont have to prove any individual investors bought stock 
in companies tied to the frauds alleged by the government in its 
settlements with the firm but there is broad belief that citizens 
in all states were affected 
in addition to the legal challenge to the impartiality of us 
district judge milton pollack regulators predict that indicted 
drexel bond salesman michael milken will try to block release of 
internal company documents that state officials may seek to obtain 
while drexel has agreed to cooperate with the states if milken 
succeeds in freezing documents state action could be further 
delayed said gw mcdonald assistant enforcement commissioner in 
californias department of corrections 
regulators said they plan to let classaction suits cover claims 
by investors who say they were defrauded by drexels actions about 
12 such suits have been filed around the nation to date in states 
including california new york and pennsylvania 
delaware where drexel remains a registered broker but has no 
offices could strip the firms license to do business and levy 
fines 10000 per violation the amount is dwarfed by the 650 
million the firm has agreed to pay the federal government 
if theyre out of the retail business in delaware it may not 
be significant said richard hubbard delawares top securities 
official but if new york or california revokes their license 
that would be a big problem 
but drexel has moved to avoid losing its license by selling 
about half of its 43office retail brokerage network which deals 
directly with individual investors to smith barney harris upham 
co the rest of the department is still on the auction block 
some state regulators said they would follow the secs lead 
since the commission did not strip drexels license they feel the 
states shouldnt take superceding action 
california home to drexels highyield junk bond division that 
does hundreds of millions of dollars in business has an 
insidertrading statute similar to the secs and could bar certain 
drexel employees and restrain its business if it can trace parts of 
the alleged frauds back to the state 
but some regulators said they would consider the broad nature of 
the sec pact which places drexel under unprecedented supervision 
for three years when they take action 
in addition banishing drexel from california for example 
would take a huge chunk out of the states securities industry 
to the extent that they cleaned up their overall act we have 
to take that into account californias mcdonald said 
added john baldwin securities director for utah they paid 
their pound of flesh there are class action suits out there why 
should i stab the dead

completed its 32 billion tender offer for texas eastern corp and 
has accepted payment for about 81 percent of outstanding texas 
eastern shares 
the buyout puts an end to a rival bid from coastal corp all the 
natural gas companies are based in houston 
preliminary results indicate that about 57 million texas eastern 
shares were validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the 
midnight wednesday expiration of panhandle easterns offer 
panhandle easterns offer included provisions to buy up to 80 
percent of texas easterns 608 million outstanding shares and a 
stock exchange at the same 53pershare value for the remaining 
shares 
the combination of the two companies will create a 27000mile

agreement with panhandle eastern instead on feb 21 
coastal spokesman robert w wells said the company would tender 
its 25 million shares of texas eastern common stock 
during panhandle easterns stockholder meeting wednesday 
chairman robert d hunsucker said about 500 corporate staff and 
other headquarters office jobs would be eliminated after the merger

two of the principals whose schools were part of 
whittle communications test of a commerciallysponsored news show 
for teens are taking a waitandsee approach to the prospect of a 
rival adfree service 
the comments thursday followed cable executive ted turners 
announcement that he planned to launch a daily news show for 
schools in august 
the service resembles whittles channel one program which 
recently completed a test run at six schools but turners program 
will contain no advertising while channel one does 
i dont know anything about the quality of the turner 
programming said principal stan jasinskas at eisenhower middle 
school in kansas city kan 
john rex stooksbury principal at central high school in 
whittles hometown of knoxville tenn also said he didnt want to 
take a position on the turner proposal before seeing the program 
i dont want to close the door on any innovations that might 
enhance our students education but i cant compare the two 
because i havent seen his program yet he said 
channel one a daily 12minute news show aimed at teens was 
tested at eisenhower central and four other schools over a 
sevenweek period ended last friday each program contained two 
minutes of commercials for jeans sneakers candy and other 
products 
the advertising sparked complaints from national education 
groups which said whittle should not be allowed to sell a captive 
student audience to big business 
whittle said the ads are needed to pay for the video recorders 
tv monitors in every classroom and satellite dishes that it gave 
each of the participating schools so they could show the program 
schoolwide every day 
the company is evaluating the test results to determine whether 
to expand the program nationally in the fall of 1990 
but turner who heads turner broadcasting system inc said he 
would start producing a 15minute news show for schools on aug 14 
and run it on his cable news network in the early morning hours 
each school day so teachers could record it for later use in class 
he said the program cnn newsroom would carry no advertising a 
move that some cable industry insiders said could undercut support 
for whittles adsupported show and reassert turners prominence in 
cable programming 
turner said he expected local cable operators would support his 
program by making free cable connections to high schools and help 
see that every school got a chance to receive the show 
eisenhowers jasinskas said turners approach sounds like a 
very interesting idea and said he would be openminded about it 
but he said the importance of giving schools equipment on the 
scale of the channel one program should not be underestimated when 
comparing the whittle and turner offerings 
eisenhower high was given 40 television sets and central high 
got 70 from channel one and the principals said the schools might 
not have otherwise obtained them 
central highs stooksbury said his school had no problems with 
the channel one commercials anyway and teachers and students miss 
having the program

another court battle involving northwest 
airlines shaped up when state commerce commissioner michael hatch 
ordered minnesota shareholders of the airlines parent not to sell 
their shares to hostile suitor marvin davis 
minneapolis attorney thomas a keller who is representing davis 
in minnesota said he planned to file a lawsuit today in us 
district court asking a judge to vacate the order issued thursday 
by hatch 
in a related development a vote on a state antitakeover bill 
aimed at placing roadblocks in the way of northwest suitors was 
delayed by legislators questions about the constitutionality of 
the measure 
under minnesotas existing antitakeover law hatch can block a 
securities offer within the state under certain conditions his 
order prevents the estimated 1900 shareholders of nwa inc in the 
state from selling their 13 million shares to davis whose offer 
of 27 billion or 90 a share has been rejected by the nwa board 
nwa chairman steven rothmeier said thursday the airline holding 
company is aware of or four friendly potential suitors but would 
not identify them he said a managementled buyout of northwest 
the nations fourthlargest carrier is not in the works 
davis acquisition inc the company davis set up to bid for nwa 
said hatchs suspension of its bid in minnesota will only serve 
to disadvantage and inconvenience minnesota stockholders who can 
sell their shares only in the open market at a discount 
but hatch said the order could hamper davis ability to 
negotiate loans to finance the purchase 
the practical effect is that lenders dont like to make loans 
to people who are in violation of securities laws he said 
hatch said he would consider lifting the suspension at any time 
if the billionaire oilman disclosed more details of his plan for 
running the airline the additional details which davis supplied 
thursday did not satisfy his request he said 
hatch is asking davis to explain how he will operate the 
carrier based in suburban eagan without layoffs or cutbacks in 
light of the major debt load he would incur through the takeover 
davis has denied he would make such cutbacks 
keller maintained that davis acquisitions original financial 
disclosure statement was sufficient under the states antitakeover 
law with additional information supplied at a tuesday hearing and 
on thursday keller said davis more than fully satisfied the laws 
disclosure requirements 
no more disclosures will be made because that would require 
getting into confidential proprietary information that would put 
us at a severe disadvantage visavis other bidders keller said 
the information submitted thursday concerned davis intention to 
substantially increase the capacity of passengerseat miles over 
the next six years keller said additionally the information said 
davis intends to enhance the utilization of the aircrafts fleet by 
improving scheduling he said 
on another front thursday the chairman of the state senate 
judiciary committee sen allan spear of minneapolis said he would 
give the antitakeover bill another hearing due to the concerns 
about constitutionality 
the bill includes provisions that would 
prevent a corporate raider from financing a takeover of a 
company with a substantial connection to minnesota by selling the 
companys assets 
give the metropolitan airports commission power to approve an 
acquisition of a major tenant of minneapolisst paul international 
airport such as northwest 
impose a state excise tax on golden parachutes the large 
severance payments corporate executives receive if they are fired 
or leave their jobs after their company is bought 
also thursday northwest said us district judge harry 
maclaughlin extended until may 11 his temporary restraining order 
prohibiting davis from disrupting contracts or contract 
negotiations at northwest the order had been scheduled to expire

eastern airlines wants to lease 14 planes to rival 
pan american world airways as it begins its newly announced 
restructuring plan 
the 966 million fiveyear lease would give pan am an option 
to extend the lease or to buy the 727200 planes at a price to be 
negotiated eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said thursday 
the agreement must be approved by the us bankruptcy court in 
new york which has had oversight of such deals since striketorn 
eastern filed march 9 for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
we had indicated we would be raising about 18 billion 
through assets sales ms ceremsak said this is certainly the 
first step in this direction for the new reducedsize airline 
eastern president phil bakes described the planned restructuring 
of eastern on monday after parent texas air corp ruled out a sale 
of eastern bakes said eastern would rebuild with a smaller airline 
and address its debts by slashing service by 29 percent and selling 
18 billion worth of assets 
easterns unions on strike since march 4 continue to hope the 
bankruptcy court and easterns creditors will call for sale of the 
airline bankruptcy judge burton r lifland has set a wednesday 
hearing on why eastern shouldnt be sold in its entirety to the 
highest bidder 
ms ceremsak said there was considerable industry interest in 
eastern assets such as planes gates and routes and that the 
beleaguered company was receiving good offers 
theres a tremendous demand right now for airplanes by other 
carriers that are expanding she said the delivery positions 
and orders are backed up in the factories 
she said she didnt have any information on other assets sales 
in the works but added there have been many interested 
parties obviously there are going to be other transactions 
easterns restructuring plan calls for a fleet of 157 aircraft 
if the 14 149seat 727 planes are leased to pan am at 115000 a 
month and another 21 of the 727 planes are sold to new york 
developer donald trump in the planned northeast shuttle sale that 
would leave eastern with 60 other excess aircraft for sale or 
longterm lease ms ceremsak said 
pilots union spokesman jb stokes said the unions oppose any 
transfer of eastern assets while hoping the bankruptcy court will 
approve a buyout of the company 
they can make all the plans they want stokes said i 
think they neglect to tell the people they must get approval from 
the bankruptcy court thats a fairly lengthy process and its not 
going to happen overnight 
the 365 million shuttle service sale also awaits approval by 
the court stokes said

a federal judge has dealt a defeat to texas 
air corp ordering arbitration in a dispute over seniority between 
pilots for subsidiaries continental airlines and nowdefunct people 
express airlines 
texas air bought people express in early 1987 and merged it into 
continental creating the problem of how to combine pilot seniority 
lists 
pilots for people express which had been based in newark sued 
texas air in us district court here alleging that the 
houstonbased airline company reneged on its promise to fairly 
combine the lists or turn to arbitration the promise had been a 
key part of the labor protection agreement included in the texas 
airpeople express deal 
us district judge nicholas h politan heard three days of 
testimony including that of people express founder and former 
chairman donald burr before ruling monday 
politan found that texas air had decimated its own case 
through vague and inconclusive testimony the judge rejected an 
argument by texas air that the labor protection agreement submitted 
to the federal department of transportation was unsigned and 
therefore not in force 
he ordered both sides to submit court papers next week outlining 
how the arbitration should be conducted 
the issue of seniority is crucial to the 750 former people 
express pilots still with texas air and the 3500 other continental 
pilots it determines pay flight schedules vacation schedules 
where the pilots fly out of and the types of planes they fly among 
other factors

south korea and taiwan need to do more to 
allow their currencies to rise in relation to the us dollar as a 
way of lowering huge trade surpluses the two nations are running 
with the united states according to a government report 
the report the treasury department sent to congress on thursday 
followed six months of negotiations the united states has held with 
both countries 
the united states has been pressuring the nations to allow their 
currencies to rise in value in relation to the dollar as a way of 
making their products more expensive on american markets and making 
us goods cheaper in their markets 
while saying that both nations have made some progress in 
boosting the value of their currencies the report contended that 
much more needs to be done 
the department said it would press forward with the negotiations 
in the hope of achieving further progress the negative findings 
were likely to increase pressure on the two governments in 
congress where lawmakers have long been unhappy with the trade 
practices of the two nations 
last october an initial treasury report had singled out taiwan 
and south korea for manipulating their currencies to gain an 
unfair competitive advantage in world markets 
taiwan and south korea have for many years used part of the 
money earned through their trade surpluses to buy and sell 
currencies on the open market to have an impact on the price of 
their own currencies in relation to the dollar 
by keeping their currencies from rising as much against the 
dollar as other currencies have they have been able to keep the 
prices of their exports to the united states from rising the 
practice has also made it harder for american industry to take 
advantage of a cheaper dollar in selling goods to taiwan and korea 
in 1988 the united states had a merchandise trade deficit of 
95 billion with south korea and 13 billion with taiwan meaning 
that the two countries accounted for 18 percent of americas total 
trade deficit last year 
the treasurys report to the congress on international 
economic and exchange rate policy said that the assessment six 
months ago that the us trade deficit would continue to improve 
this year had been clouded by recent developments such as rising 
oil prices 
the treasury did not forecast a new trade figure however many 
private analysts fear that the trade deficit which dropped 
dramatically in 1988 because of the decline of the value of the 
dollar against many major currencies could even begin rising again 
unless the dollar fell further 
the report was prepared under a provision of the trade act of 
1988 which requires the administration to look for cases of 
currency manipulation by american competitors in world trade and to 
embark on bilateral negotiations to halt such practices

norway is cautiously optimistic about its 
economy three bleak years after oil prices collapsed teaching the 
small nordic country that its oil wealth is neither infinite nor 
stable 
the situation is better than expected a budgeted 1989 
currentaccount deficit of 111 billion kroner 164 billion may 
become a surplus finance minister gunnar berge said in a state 
television interview 
tough government austerity measures including wage controls 
helped cut annual inflation to 43 percent in march from a 104 
percent peak two years earlier 
belttightening improved oil prices and strong markets for its 
metals timber and shipping industries turned a 445 million 
firstquarter 1988 trade deficit into a 14 billion surplus this 
year said officials 
experts expect norways gross national product to expand 19 
percent in 1989 an improvement on 1988s 07 percent rate but well 
off 1986s 42 percent figure 
while norways economy is performing better in some areas than 
its main trading partners bjoern skogstad aamo the finance 
ministers deputy warned that economic uncertainty is still 
genuine 
the countrys unemployment rate reached a postwar record it 
doubled in a year to about 4 percent last year as business 
bankruptcies soared from 1426 in 1986 to 3891 last year and 
consumer spending declined 
the minority labor government facing a sept 11 national 
election under its traditional slogan employment for all has 
forwarded the most comprehensive jobs package in norways history 
it also cut interest rates which were hiked in 1987 to more 
than 20 percent for some consumer loans to stimulate the nations 
ailing construction auto sales and other business 
this coastal nation of 42 million people was unprepared for 
oils boom and bust when the 1969 discovery of rich offshore 
reserves brought prosperity nearly full employment and eventually 
an overheated economy 
in 1986 the 840000 barrels of oil a day plus natural gas 
norway pumped represented 43 percent of its exports today it is 
europes secondlargest oil exporter after britain at 14 million 
barrels a day but low crude prices cut oils share of 1988 exports 
to 35 percent 
oil wealth relaxed credit and heavy private borrowing fanned an 
unprecented consumer spending spree which was abruptly 
extinguished by low oil prices and high interest rates 
norway learned the painful lesson that easy oil money inflates 
wages and costs at the expense of its traditional industries 
ability to compete internationally said roy halvorsen of the 
oslo stock exchange 
the idealists in business are being replaced by leaders whose 
goal is to turn a profit he said 
the business magazine nordic economic outlook said norways 
nonoil exports have increased 6 percent a year since 1986 partly 
because the decline in domestic demand has forced manufacturers 
to focus on production for export 
berge said his 19901993 economic plan due for parliamentary 
review in may will shield norway from unstable oil prices and 
dwindling petroleum reserves with an oil royalties trust geared 
toward stimulating traditional industry and research and toward 
eliminating foreign debt by the year 2000 
any oil revenues exceeding 1989 budget estimates of 85 
billion based on 14 per barrel of oil should go towards reducing 
norways foreign debt which stood at 175 billion in 1988 he 
said 
the oslo stock market recovered from the october 1987 global 
crash to set alltime records in april 1989 10 percent above 
precrash levels

bond dealer matthews amp wright group inc has 
agreed to settle civil fraud charges in connection with its 
underwriting of more than 1 billion in municipal bonds and the 
sale of 15 million shares of its own stock the government said 
thursdays settlement with the securities and exchange 
commission capped the first phase of an intense federal 
investigation into matthews amp wrights practices in selling 
municipal issues 
sec officials said the investigation of related municipal 
securities matters is continuing 
without admitting or denying guilt matthews amp wright its 
president and chairman george w benoit and roger j burns its 
chief financial officer agreed to settle civil charges brought by 
the sec that they violated antifraud and falsereporting 
provisions of federal securities laws 
under the settlement manhattanbased matthews amp wright will 
give up its brokerdealer license and agree to avoid future 
securities violations 
benoit 52 of pearl river will be barred from the securities 
business for at least four years and burns 51 of staten island 
will be barred for at least two years 
the settlement which remains subject to approval by a federal 
judge was filed thursday in us district court in manhattan 
two other men matthews amp wright executive vice president arthur 
abba goldberg 48 of jersey city nj and outside counsel 
bernard m altoff 58 of rye were not parties to the settlement 
and civil charges were filed against them the sec said 
the sec complaint charged that the four individuals and matthews 
amp wright carried out a fraud scheme to underwrite taxexempt 
municipal securities through a series of sham closings to 
retain favorable tax treatment 
the complaint also charged that matthews amp wright made false and 
misleading statements about the sham transactions to the sec and to 
the investing public when the firm sold 15 million shares of its 
common stock in august 1986 
the charges in the governments case stem from 26 municipal bond 
deals in 1985 and 1986 the firm has been out of the bond 
underwriting business for more than two years since its legal 
troubles began 
according to the secs complaint matthews amp wright used 
worthless checks to buy 26 municipal bond issues totaling 132 
billion in december 1985 and august 1986 before a federal tax 
loophole was closed making the bonds less attractive to investors 
no real purchase occurred and they missed the tax deadline 
explained david w parsons senior counsel for the sec in 
washington according to the complaint he added investors were 
not getting the taxexempt municipal securities they thought they 
were buying 
gary sundick the secs assistant director of enforcement 
noted however the commission is not making a determination as 
to taxability of interest on the bonds that was up to the 
internal revenue service he said adding that the circumstances of 
the bond sales created increased risks concerning taxation which 
should have been disclosed to investors 
the complaint charged that the worthless checks were kept out of 
normal banking channels and the bonds were warehoused through a 
banking concern on the pacific island of saipan until matthews amp 
wright sold them to the public 
last year a federal grand jury in guam charged goldberg with 
fraud bribery and obstruction of justice the case has since been 
transferred to california 
the sec case does not involve the firms bestknown deals 380 
million in issues underwritten for guam and the northern marianas 
in 1984 and 1985 officials said 
in addition the sec complaint charged that proceeds from 17 of 
the 26 bond issues were used to buy guaranteed investment contracts 
to ensure repayment of interest on the bonds rather than for their 
stated purpose to finance construction projects including 
lowincome housing 
sec officials would not comment on whether the projects were 
bogus from the start

did the great bull market on wall street 
secretly survive the crash of 1987 
has it now as in some sciencefiction movie sequel crawled out 
of the disasters rubble and begun to prowl the canyons of wall 
street once more 
those questions are being raised in many investors minds as the 
rally in stock prices that began in the waning weeks of 1987 
carries to new high after new high 
as of late last week the dow jones industrial average stood 
nearly 700 points or 40 percent above its low on black monday oct 
19 1987 
a 40 percent rise in 18 months compares pretty favorably with 
many a past rally that earned the bull market stamp as if to 
confirm its status the economy has kept growing at a robust rate 
showing scarcely any effects from a very scary financial event 
but one prominent money manager contends that people who think 
this way might be falling into a dangerous trap 
if you judge the stock market by price alone the bull appears 
to have revived concedes henry gailliot senior vice president at 
pittsburghbased federated research corp which manages assets 
totaling 37 billion 
when you apply other traditional criteria however it doesnt 
look at all like a bull market gailliot said in an interview 
in a bull market he says a broad array of stocks should be 
rising to keep pace with the narrow sample represented by the dow 
jones industrials but that hasnt been happening 
while the averages have hit new postcrash highs the number of 
individual stocks at new 52week peaks has been unimpressive he 
adds 
volume is not rising with price he also observes the 
rally to date continues to have the characteristics of a bear 
market rally we expect a new low below djia 1740 in price before 
this bear market is over 
for some time now gailliot like many other economists has been 
predicting a recession that has yet to give any sign of showing up 
what has confounded the forecasters he says has been 
persistent strength in spending by consumers long since 
overextended by the usual yardsticks 
since consumer spending accounts for twothirds of economic 
activity the consumer is the gorilla of our economy he 
observes 
if you dont get the consumer right you dont get the 
business cycle right 
consumers ability to keep spending has been stretched in the 
1980s gailliot says by devices such as low or no rate auto 
financing and home equity lines of credit these are marvelous 
innovations that do nothing but let the consumer go farther out on 
the limb 
at some point he says consumers will reach the stage where 
they want or are forced to retrench 
when the gorilla decides how much is enough he says then 
you get a recession

congress may subpoena bush administration 
officials as part of its inquiry into why a popular program that 
subsidizes food exports has apparently been halted with no official 
notice 
though the agriculture department denies that the export 
enhancement program has been stopped no sales using it have been 
completed since february and lawmakers allege that a 
justannounced grain sale to the soviets will be unsubsidized 
since the program started there has never been a twomonth 
hiatus said rep dan glickman dkan who heads the house 
agriculture subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed grains 
the holdup appears to be with the office of management and 
budget where officials say a review of the program is taking place 
when omb representatives failed to appear before his 
subcommittee thursday glickman said he may have subpoena them 
he said the administrations budget writers first would be given 
a chance to answer questions in writing but would be expected to 
respond quickly and satisfactorily 
kelly shipp press secretary to agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said the program has slowed down because of weather and 
stock conditions and because there is a new administration but it 
has not been suspended 
thomas scully associate director for legislative affairs at 
omb said director richard darman couldnt make the hearing because 
he had another obligation and no other policymaker at the budget 
office was qualified to speak 
meanwhile the agriculture department announced thursday that 
the soviet union will be allowed to purchase 24 million metric 
tons of grain this year instead of the 20 million previously 
negotiated lawmakers said the additional sales will not be 
subsidized 
only wheat has been subsidized in the grain sales to the soviet 
union huge amounts of corn have been sold to the soviets without 
subsidies 
the usda also said us and soviet negotiators concluded a 
twoday meeting about commodity purchases under a longterm grain 
agreement that specifies regular sales of grain and soybeans during 
the year the pact calls for such meetings twice a year 
in a separate announcement usda said the soviet union has 
bought an additional 150000 tons of corn which boosted total 
soviet purchases of us corn to 134 million tons moscow also has 
bought 4 million tons of wheat for delivery through sept 30 the 
end of the agreements sixth year 
according to usda the soviets also have bought 450000 tons of 
soybeans nearly 14 million tons of soybean meal and 507400 tons 
of grain sorghum for 198889 delivery 
but a member of glickmans subcommittee said the soviets went 
away from negotiations angry 
the soviets wanted to expand the amount to 30 million tons under 
the export enhancement program but were told their purchases would 
have to be unsubsidized said rep david nagle diowa 
attempts to contact soviet officials at their embassy in 
washington were unsuccessful 
shipp said the agreement does not stipulate whether the eep will 
be used during the sale she said the talks were about the amount 
of grain the soviets could buy not its price 
the eep was started four years ago to entice foreign buyers who 
were being lured away by countries that charged cheaper prices 
because of heavy government subsidies 
through the program buyers are given bonus quantities of 
commodities if they buy a certain amount the commodities come from 
the surplus stock purchased previously by the federal government 
from american farmers through other agricultural support programs 
the fate of the eep has been in question since april 18 when 
thomas kay the foreign agriculture service administrator told a 
senate subcommittee that the agriculture department must hold all 
new eep initiatives until the program had been reviewed by the omb 
the agriculture department says that under the program 8 
billion in farm products have been sold including wheat wheat 
flour vegetable oil barley barley malt semolina sorghum rice 
poultry feed dairy cattle eggs and frozen poultry 
congress considers the program vital to us strength during 
international trade negotiations known as the uruguay round which 
have been going on in geneva 
the us position is that countries should remove or drastically 
reduce subsidies that distort world prices and congress believes 
that the eep puts the united states in a stronger bargaining 
position

but the company is not expected to turn a profit for about a year 
and a half 
emhart had been fighting an unsolicited 24 billion takeover 
offer from topper lp a new yorkbased investment group that 
includes oil heir gordon p getty and the fisher real estate family 
of new york the topper offer amounted to 35 a share 
topper sold its emhart shares late last month effectively 
ending its bid 
black amp decker has been searching for a means to expand its 
market after failing to take over two other companies 
last year the company tried to take over american standard inc 
a new yorkbased maker of plumbing heating and airconditioning 
equipment but dropped the hostile offer after it was outbid by the 
new york investment firm kelson amp co black amp decker offered 24 
billion for that company 
in february black amp deckers attempts to acquire ostersunbeam 
appliances were thwarted when ostersunbeams parent company 
allegheny international inc accepted another offer 
black amp decker offered 260 million for the ostersunbeam 
subsidiary

as the strike gripping eastern airlines 
approaches the end of its second month boss frank lorenzo is 
hanging tough 
after rejecting buyout proposals and producing his own plan to 
shrink the airline lorenzo seems to be playing a waiting game with 
striking employees who after nearly two months on the picket lines 
may be under increasing pressure to find jobs again 
lorenzo also must contend with easterns creditors and with a 
federal bankruptcy judge who must approve the downsizing plan and 
is pushing for a sale of eastern in its entirety 
it really continues to be a game of brinksmanship said 
robert decker an airline industry analyst with duff amp phelps inc 
in chicago 
the strike has become the longest major walkout against a us 
airline since the industry was deregulated in october 1978 
after a 17month wage dispute easterns militant machinists 
struck the miamibased carrier on march 4 and were joined by pilots 
and flight attendants virtually grounding the airline 
lorenzo chairman of easterns parent texas air corp put 
eastern into chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors on 
march 9 
employees hopes were stirred april 6 when a group led by 
exbaseball commissioner peter v ueberroth agreed to buy eastern 
for 464 million hopes soared a few days later when the unions 
agreed to accept 210 million in wage concessions in exchange for a 
30 percent stake in the carrier under the ueberroth deal 
but the proposal collapsed over the unions demand that a 
powerful trustee be appointed to replace lorenzo as head of eastern 
before ueberroth took over a term the texas air chief flatly 
rejected 
lorenzo now insists that a sale of eastern in its entirety no 
longer is an option neither side will back down from their 
trustee positions although billionaire hotel executive jay 
pritzker trans world airlines chairman carl c icahn and others 
have expressed buyout interest 
instead the airline on monday detailed plans to operate at 
onethird its prestrike size and raise 18 billion by selling 
assets including planes airport gates and landing slots at 
unspecified locations 
i think that was lorenzos intention all along said 
andrew geller who follows the industry for provident national bank 
in philadelphia 
as a first step eastern announced thursday that it plans to 
lease 14 boeing 727200s to pan american world airways for 966 
million over five years subject to bankruptcy court approval 
eastern is expected to announce more deals for leasing and 
selling aircraft in the coming days according to sources close to 
the company 
the plan is reminiscent of what lorenzo did with easterns 
sister carrier continental airlines in september 1983 
after he put continental into chapter 11 he slashed the number 
of employees to around 4000 from 12500 and brought the airline 
out of bankruptcy protection as a nonunion carrier 
now due to 1985 amendments to the bankruptcy laws lorenzo 
would first have to negotiate further with eastern unions and 
demonstrate that he had no alternative but to cut jobs 
some experts say lorenzos downsizing strategy could be aimed at 
luring back striking pilots who would lose seniority if they took 
jobs at rival carriers 
under the plan which would cut eastern jobs from the prestrike 
31200 to around 17000 management reckons it would need about 
1700 pilots the airline says it is hiring and training new pilots 
at the rate of around 200 a month 
its the airline version of voodoo economics said jack 
bavis head of easterns pilots union and its also designed to 
intimidate the 3300 eastern pilots into abandoning the picket line 
and returning to work 
some observers say it may be difficult for lorenzo to convince 
creditors and us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland that the 
airline will be able to recruit 1700 pilots in a reasonable period 
of time 
joel zweibel the lead attorney for the committee representing 
easterns creditors told the associated press the panel would need 
about two weeks to form a judgment on easterns plan 
there are still rumblings about a possible sale of the entire 
airline 
lifland plans to hold a twicepostponed hearing next wednesday 
on the issue of selling eastern in its entirety icluding its 
northeast shuttle service the company already has agreed to sell to 
developer donald trump for 365 million 
union officials and financial advisers continue to screen 
potential bidders for eastern union sources said thursday they 
have held discussions with five suitors they consider credible 
the pilots union leadership told its members late thursday that 
pritzker has submitted his bid for the carrier and that icahn has 
requested confidential financial information from the bankruptcy 
court as a prelude to making his buyout offer

reregulation is a real prospect facing 
the domestic airline industry if current trends continue unabated 
an airline executive warned 
edward beauvais chairman of phoenixbased america west 
airlines painted a generally grim picture of the industrys 
future with fewer owners meaning lessened competition and higher 
fares 
beauvais told the aviationspace writers associations annual 
news conference thursday that deregulation initially created a 
highly competitive industry with low fares and a robust growth rate 
but he said competitive balance has been destroyed by the 
concentration of ownership 
in addition he said entry barriers to gaining a market share 
such as sophisticated computer reservation systems access to 
restricted airports such as new york citys laguardia and 
washingtons national and multibilliondollar orders for new 
planes by the major airlines have made it even more difficult for 
the smaller carriers 
if something isnt done youve got an oligopoly with very 
high fares and little competition beauvais said 
that could create a groundswell of public opinion that could 
mean the industry could experience reregulation he said if 
the barriertoentry problems are not resolved that will happen 
beauvais said concern over the situation is starting to register 
in washington but that it will take such things as even higher 
prices and theyre going to get a lot higher and several major 
failures to bring concerted reform efforts 
the ongoing problems of strikebound eastern airlines including 
unsuccessful sale efforts amid chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization are part of that he added its riveting the 
attention of washington on our industry right now he said 
beauvais said he does not think the airline will fly again 
im not sure eastern can be successful as a smaller company he 
said easterns management recently proposed a plan to rebuild as a 
smaller carrier and sell around 18 billion in assets 
as for his own 5yearold airline beauvais said were not a 
buyer and were not a seller we certainly dont think a hostile 
takeover would be possible were not a classic target 
america west posted a 1007 million firstquarter profit on 
wednesday compared with a 1632 million loss for the same period 
last year

the seven regional bell phone companies would 
be allowed to manufacture telecommunications equipment and begin 
offering information services such as electronic yellow pages 
computer data bases and home shopping and banking under a bill 
introduced in the house 
the bill cosponsored thursday by reps al swift dwash and 
tom tauke riowa would lift some restraints that were imposed on 
the companies when the bell system was broken up by a federal 
consent decree in 1984 
rep john dingell dmich introduced a nonbinding resolution 
in the house last year that called for allowing the baby bells back 
into manufacturing and information services and it had 205 
cosponsors 
the bell companies claim federal regulation is limiting us 
telecommunications competitiveness overseas and is depriving 
consumers of the latest in communications advances 
other countries are racing ahead with telecommunications 
research and development but we stand with our hands tied behind 
our back tauke said in a statement 
pacific telesis group chairman sam ginn called the bill a 
milestone in the history of telecommunications policy and 
commended congress for taking this first step toward bringing 
us consumers and businesses timesaving conveniences and 
competitive tools that other countries now enjoy 
nynex corp said lifting the restrictions was essential to the 
enhancement of competition in both domestic and global markets 
ameritech chairman william l weiss said it was a critically 
important step forward 
bellsouth corp also hailed the bill but said it also imposes 
restrictions that will further delay the wide availability of 
information services including the provision of electronic 
publishing 
jerry w friedheim president of the american newspaper 
publishers association which would face heavy competition in 
electronic classified ads said the bill would result in less 
not more information being provided to american homes 
electronically 
the swifttauke measure includes provisions designed to protect 
consumers and orders the fcc to assure compliance 
the bell companies must provide other information service 
providers with nondiscriminatory access to their phone lines 
the fcc must determine that a bell company does not hold 
monopoly power over electronic publishing services such as 
electronic yellow pages or telephone exchange service in its area 
it also limits revisions to the yellow pages to once a month for 
the first two years 
the bell companies could provide electronic publishing outside 
their service areas without restriction 
the bill would supersede us district judge harold greenes 
oversight of the bell companies said ed senn an aide to tauke 
it would not apply to american telephone amp telegraph co nor 
would it repeal restrictions on telephone companies from providing 
cable tv programming senn said 
atampt has opposed the regional bell companies entry into 
longdistance and manufacturing as long as they retain control over 
local phone networks atampt spokesman herb linnen said atampt didnt 
think the bill was necessary because the consent decree was working 
linnen said it was startling that one part of the bill 
appears to exempt the telephone companies from antitrust law with 
respect to some of the activities they want to enter 
the bills attempts to prescribe certain safeguards against 
abuse in manufacturing and information services strike us as 
futile given the bills other provisions that would remove 
antitrust protections linnen said 
the bill also requires the bell companies to provide 
nondiscriminatory procurement in the manufacture of telephone 
equipment and bars the phone companies from using proceeds from 
regulated telephone service to subsidize information services or 
manufacturing and vice versa 
the fcc also must assure that telephone customers do not pay for 
failed information services or manufacturing ventures and that 
investment costs cannot be assigned to phone customers unless the 
customers will benefit 
the bill also requires the fcc to regulate any transfer of 
assets between enterprises or credit arrangements 
the bill calls for unspecified penalties and fines for 
violations

former teamsters president roy lee williams 
died today at his farm home after a lengthy bout with emphysema and 
heart problems 
williams 73 was released from federal prison in september 
after serving three years of a 10year sentence for attempting to 
bribe a senator over trucking legislation 
williams served as international president of the teamsters 
union from 198183 
he was forced to resign as teamsters chief after he and four 
codefendants were convicted in december 1982 for trying to bribe 
former us sen howard cannon of nevada to influence trucking 
deregulation cannon was not charged in the case 
though he maintained his innocence during the 1982 trial 
williams acknowledged his role in the conspiracy case during 
testimony in 1985 in a kansas city trial he was cooperating with 
federal authorities investigating the mob in an attempt to have his 
own sentence reduced 
williams testified that while he was a kansas city labor leader 
before his elevation to the teamsters presidency he had been under 
the control of nick civella the reputed crime boss in kansas city 
at the time 
he said he received payoffs of 1500 a month from civella for 
seven years until he became teamsters president he said civella 
who has since died played a key role in his election to the union 
presidency 
williams also testified by videotape in a federal court trial in 
new york against mob fitures accused of fixing his election as 
teamsters president and that of his successor jackie presser who 
died last july three codefendants were acquitted of that charge 
in may 1988 but convicted of unrelated charges

the oliver north trial jury began its second 
week of deliberations friday yielding no signal on its progress 
no notes no words to the judge and no requests for clarifications 
or to rehear testimony 
there also was no word on the jurors intentions for a saturday 
session last week a day after receiving the case the jury 
deliberated for 3 hours in the morning then took the rest of the 
weekend off 
the jurors schedule has not varied it begins with their 
arrival from a downtown hotel at 820 am then juice and pastry 
and a 9 am start at noon a caterer arrives with lunches chosen 
individually by each juror from a menu 
on friday the order got mixed up the caterer delivered the 
wrong lunches and the jurors went back to work until 1230 when 
the right food arrived 
north took advantage of the jurys 9to4 pace on thursday with 
a quick trip to deliver a speech to the bankers club of cincinnati 
presumably for the same 2000025000 fee he has received for 
other recent appearances 
the former national security council aide spoke about 
traditional values and received a standing ovation according to 
bankers club members who heard his speech 
steven doherty an ohio state university sophomore from 
cincinnati said north spoke highly of former president reagan the 
clubs next scheduled guest booked for september 
protesters picketed outside the club before the speech 
we dont care whether north sees us or not said roy silver 
organizer for the central american task force were 
demonstrating against the bankers club for giving him 25000 
while there are homeless people in this city sleeping on the 
streets 
the bankers club did not disclose norths fee 
youre all a bunch of procommunists shouted a welldressed 
businessman at the demonstrators 
the north jury has before it 12 criminal charges most of which 
accuse north of lying or withholding information about his and the 
nscs support for the guerrillas fighting the leftist nicaraguan 
government 
north is accused of lying to congress to cover up his role in 
secretly assisting the contras and lying to the attorney general 
about aspects of the diversion of funds to the contras from the 
iran arms sales he also faces charges that he accepted a 13800 
home security system and converted 4300 in travelers checks from 
a contra leader to his own use 
meanwhile a twojudge panel of the us court of appeals 
rejected a petition by 10 news organizations seeking access to a 
stipulation that was presented to the jury at the end of the trial 
but not made available to the public 
the appeals court sent the issue back to the judge in the north 
case for a hearing on national security issues involved saying it 
cannot make a decision without having such a record 
the stipulation summarizes highly secret intelligence 
interceptions concerning a ciaassisted november 1985 shipment of 
hawk missiles from israel to iran norths lawyers referred in 
closing arguments to the stipulation in an effort to show that 
knowledge about the operatiion was not limited to north but was 
known widely among top us officials

a 400 million blend of bigleague 
filming and hollywood stargazing debuts monday when floridas top 
entertainment resort opens the disneymgm studios theme park a 
135acre playground with diversions that range from doityourself 
music videos to a 1950s sitcom set 
the complex at walt disney world combines working movietv sound 
studios with backstage tours for the public a mixedmedia 
ridethrough show and other special effects adventures 
it is a theatrical environment that is very close to the 
original conception by walt disney michael eisner walt disney 
co chairman said in an interview its been on the shelf since 
the 1940s and is the culmination of a company dream this 
attraction is unlike anything else we have 
its all themed to the golden age of hollywood in the 1930s and 
1940s when tyrannical cigarchomping moguls ran studios and art 
deco dominated the building scape 
mom dad and the kids can walk through recreations of 
palmlined hollywood boulevard and graumans chinese theater peek 
at movies under production take a role in a television show make 
their own music videos get a screen test and rub elbows with the 
stars at the brown derby restaurant 
movie and tv production began last summer with the superboy 
syndicated tv series and parts of several largescreen films while 
construction continued on the tourist portion 
the event was preceded by glitzy parties and previews that 
included a television special a parade of famous hollywood actors 
and actresses on the boulevard and live tapings of a mew mickey 
mouse club tv series 
dick nunis president of walt disney attractions said he 
believes bringing a bit of hollywood to florida will reinvigorate 
the resort already visited annually by an estimated 25 million 
people that reportedly pump about 2 billion into the areas 
economy 
we talked of doing a studio tour when walt was alive said 
nunis weve wanted to do this for a long long time its a 
dream come true 
disney will get a years jump on some formidable competition in 
the highstakes family entertainment business in which the company 
founded by the late cartoonist has emerged as one of the undisputed 
leaders universal studios florida is building a rival 500 million 
complex to be finished next may 
just a few miles away universal is billed as the nations 
largest working studio outside of hollywood movie and tv 
production already is under way at the 440acre facility owned by 
mca inc and rank organization plc of london 
universal will feature what it calls a total experience of 
hollywoodstyle filmmaking to the public making the visitor a 
participant in the action it expects to attract up to 6 million 
visitors a year 
despite their wellpublicized rivalry disney and mca officials 
insist the competition is good for each other as well as florida 
where familyoriented entertainment has become one of the dominant 
industries 
weve always had competition from sea world busch gardens 
cape canaveral boardwalk and baseball and many others eisner 
said we welcome competition its good for central florida 
disney does things in its own way and we feel comfortable that we 
will have our niche in the community 
the disneymgm theme park is the centerpiece of a 1 
billionplus renaissance of the 27400acre resort in the pine 
woods and citrus groves of central florida once populated largely 
by alligators and armadillos before it opened 18 years ago 
not that a rebirth is needed 
were having a phenomenal year in both hotel occupancy and 
theme park attendance said disney world publicist charlie 
ridgway 
after achieving a record 34 billion in revenues and 522 
million in profits in fiscal 1988 disney has on tap a number of 
openings at its florida resort this year besides the studios 
on schedule to open this fall is part of what it calls the 
largest conventionhotel complex in the southeast making their 
debut this summer will be typhoon lagoon the worlds largest 
water park and the pleasure island nighttime entertainment 
district 
built for the teenage crowd nunis says typhoon lagoon will 
make all other water attractions as obsolete as disneyland made

unilever the european consumer products 
conglomerate friday said it dropped its plan to purchase the 
faberge and elizabeth arden lines of toiletries cosmetics and 
fragrances for 155 billion from riklis family corp 
negotiations on a definitive pact broke down because the riklis 
group sought significant changes in the structure and terms of 
the transaction which would have involved unilever in substantial 
additional costs according to an announcement from unilever 
united states inc the us arm of the britishdutch household and 
consumer products giant 
the proposed allcash acquisition from new york investor 
meshulam riklis riklis family corp had been approved in principle 
on feb 10 
details of a formal agreement had been expected to be worked out 
during talks that were to be concluded within 90 days 
at the agreed price the acquisition of faberge and elizabeth 
arden would have been an important step forward in our strategy for 
personal products a unilever spokesman said they now appear 
to be available only with a construction and price which do not 
represent reasonable value to our shareholders 
unilever spokesman david lustig declined to disclose the riklis 
demands saying he was prohibited from doing so by a 
confidentiality agreement 
the riklis group also refused to comment 
under the february agreement unilever was to buy all of faberge 
inc except for the mcgregor apparel group which comprises 
clothing lines such as botany 500 wonderknit and billy the kid 
among some of the name brands of faberge and of its independent 
subsidiary elizabeth arden that unilever would have gotten were 
visible difference chloe lagerfeld flawless finish aqua net and 
brut 
it had been expected that as part of the acquisition unilever 
would gain the faberge name and faberge inc would switch its name 
to mcgregor it had not been specified whether the faberge and 
elizabeth arden lines would be folded into unilivers us division 
or its british or dutch companies called unilever plc and unilever 
nv respectively 
faberge was bought by the riklis group in 1984 for about 180 
million the holding company acquired elizabeth arden for 700 
million at the end of 1987 other riklis holdings include samsonite 
luggage and culligan water softeners 
through acquisitions and internal growth unilever for several 
years has been building its personal products operations around the 
world it has targeted several segments of the market for further 
expansion among them the prestige end of the fragrance and beauty 
aid business 
two years ago unilever bought chesebroughponds inc for 31 
billion thereby acquiring many widely known personalcare 
products including several prestige or expensive lines such as 
the prince matchabelli fragrance collection unilever also owns 
elizabeth taylors passion scents 
lustig said the prestige portion of the personal products 
business appeals to unilever because it has been growing strongly 
and has not been fully exploited particularly in the far east and 
other parts of the world 
prestige items account for an estimated 8 billion or 20 
percent of the overall personal products market

wheat futures prices closed sharply higher friday 
on the chicago board of trade as speculation continued on what 
position the bush administration will take on whether to continue 
subsidized grain sales to foreign countries 
corn futures were lower oat futures rose and soybeans fell as 
rains continued in illinois and iowa 
wheat prices climbed as word spread of a second us economic 
policy committee meeting in washington on the issue of subsidized 
grain sales 
everyone is waiting to hear a final decision said ted mao 
an analyst for shearson lehman hutton inc in new york wheat is 
more a political market than a drought market 
the export enhancement program was begun several years ago as a 
means of reducing us grain stockpiles but stocks were drained to 
such low levels last year that some officials want to end the 
program 
soybeans were pushed lower by word that the brazilian dock 
strike was breaking up after dockworkers gave their tentative 
approval to a courtordered pay raise 
corn prices were affected by heavy rains in the corn belt 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 12 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 417 cents a bushel corn was 1

some state securities regulators say they are 
ready to go easy on drexel burnham lambert inc the wall street 
firm that has pledged to admit to felonies and pay millions in 
fines to resolve federal civil an criminal fraud charges 
they paid their pound of flesh there are class action suits 
out there why should i stab the dead said john baldwin utahs 
securities director and president of the north american association 
of securities administrators 
state securities officials met here friday to discuss punitive 
action against drexel which faces losing its state brokerage 
licenses and fines for its role in the wall street insider trading 
scandals 
state laws generally bar convicted or admitted felons from 
operating in the securities industry drexel has agreed to plead 
guilty to six crimes and pay 650 million in penalties to resolve a 
range of fraud charges brought by the justice department 
but legal challenges in new york to the federal judge who must 
approve the criminal pact and a separate settlement with the 
securities and exchange commission are delaying resolution of the 
federal case indefinitely 
until drexel formally enters a plea the states are powerless to 
punish drexel 
the states cant do anything until there is an order issued of 
some sort susan bryant oklahomas securities administrator who 
heads a panel of state regulators examining drexel said thursday 
but she added it probably will mean states will start 
negotiating a settlement with drexel even though there is no order 
yet 
anticipating a wave of punitive action lawyers for drexel have 
met with regulators in all 50 states 
were eager to come to a satisfactory resolution in this 
matter drexel spokesman steven anreder said friday in new york 
we understand the states concerns and interests 
regulators said they are studying punitive measures against 
drexel including administrative fines suspensions and 
supervision and concessions that would permit the firm to continue 
doing business such as selling municipal bonds with towns and 
cities statebystate monetary settlements are another possibility 
california home to drexels highyield junk bond division that 
does hundreds of millions of dollars in business has an 
insidertrading statute and could bar drexel employees and restrain 
its business if it can trace back to the state part of the frauds 
alleged by the federal government 
delaware where drexel is a registered broker but has no 
offices could strip the firms license and levy fines 10000 
per violation an amount dwarfed by the 650 million the firm has 
agreed to pay the federal government 
losing its license may not matter to drexel because it is 
quitting the retail brokerage business selling about half of its 
43office network to smith barney harris upham amp co the rest of 
the department is still on the auction block 
anreder said the decision was not motivated by the possibility 
of losing its brokerdealer license but by declining business due 
to bad publicity and a weak wall street business environment 
we intend to retain our brokerdealer license in every state 
we do transactions with people and you just may as well be 
registered it makes it much easier he said 
while states dont have to prove any individual investors bought 
stock in companies tied to the alleged frauds it is widely 
believed that citizens in all states were affected as such states 
could file civil lawsuits against the firm seeking restitution 
but regulators said they plan to let classaction suits cover 
claims by investors who say they were defrauded by drexels 
actions about 12 such suits have been filed in states including 
california new york and pennsylvania 
in taking action they also said they would consider the broad 
nature of the sec pact which places drexel under unprecedented 
supervision for three years and forces it to overhaul its 
management and compliance procedures 
to the extent that they cleaned up their overall act we have 
to take that into account said gw mcdonald assistant 
enforcement commissioner in californias department of corrections 
its fair to say the states will rely on the investigations 
that have taken place to date he said 
mcdonald said he expects some regulators to follow the secs 
lead because the commission didnt strip drexels brokerage 
license they feel the states shouldnt either 
regulators also predict that drexel bond financier michael 
milken who is fighting sweeping fraud and racketeering charges 
may try to block release of internal company documents that state 
officials may seek to obtain further delaying investigation of 
drexels activities

colt firearms maker of the gun that won 
the west was put on the auction block friday but the companys 
parent denied a threeyear struggle with striking workers prompted 
the decision 
its a going business and its profitable and of course it 
has a history of quality products said michael g dunn a 
spokesman for colt firearms parent colt industries inc 
dunn said senior officials at new yorkbased colt industries 
decided to sell the firearms division so they could concentrate on 
the companys aerospace automotive and industrial service 
operations 
a continuing strike and the recent loss of a contract to produce 
m16 rifles for the military didnt prompt the action he added 
dunn declined to say whether privately held colt industries had 
received any bids or how much the company is asking for the unit 
morgan stanley group inc has been hired to evaluate any offers 
analysts said proceeds from the sale could be used to help 
retire debt incurred when colt industries management mounted a 
660 million leveraged buyout a year ago 
maeda klein a vice president with donaldson lufkin amp jenrette 
estimated colts outstanding debt at 18 billion 
the 1100 employees at colt firearms two plants in hartford and 
west hartford were informed of the decision friday morning 
i think it might be a good omen said robert madore 
president of united auto workers local 376 the union represented 
about 1000 bluecollar workers who walked off their jobs on jan 
24 1986 in a dispute over wages and benefits 
i think maybe a new face a new owner might turn it around 
madore said he said the union could make an offer to buy the 
company but he cautioned that such a move hasnt yet been 
discussed with the membership 
colt has managed to keep its plants operating by hiring 
replacement workers and using about 200 strikers who crossed picket 
lines 
the dispute is now before the national labor relations board 
where the union is seeking about 40 million in back wages and job 
reinstatement 
klein said a change in management could help end the walkout 
maybe theres an easy way out if you bring in a new company 
culture she said 
but state rep joseph a adamo dwest haven said the sale 
could very well leave those striking workers in the lurch it 
could be devastating 
the colt company was founded in hartford in 1836 by samuel colt 
the inventor of the first successful repeating pistol the pistol 
had a cylinder of several chambers that could be discharged in 
succession by the same locking and firing mechanism 
it was after the entrepreneurs death in 1862 that his company 
manufactered the sixshooter that every cowboy carried in his 
holster and was said to have won the west 
in addition to the m16 rifle the standard armyissue rifle 
still used today colt manufactures the colt 45 handgun the king 
cobra magnum revolver and the ar15 rifle 
colt had produced the m16 rifle for the army since 1964 but in 
october 1988 the army announced that it was dropping colt after it 
was underbid for a contract to produce about one million rifles by 
fn manufacturing inc of columbia sc fn manufacturing is owned 
by the belgian firm fabrique nationale sa 
colt gained national attention in march when it voluntarily 
decided to halt the sale of its semiautomatic rifles in response 
to public outcry to the murder of california schoolchildren by a 
man using a similar assault weapon

campeau corps board of directors friday announced a 
realignment that establishes campeau as a holding company for its 
real estate and retailing operations in the united states and 
canada 
the restructuring of the torontobased corporation came as the 
result of a process that has been in the works since campeau 
acquired federated department stores inc in a 67 billion hostile 
takeover last may 
robert campeau will continue as chairman and chief executive 
ronald w tysoe formerly executive vice president and president of 
campeau us will take over as president and chief operating 
officer of the newly restructured company 
tysoe replaces james t roddy whose resignation was disclosed 
thursday 
roddy 45 and a veteran of the retail business worked closely 
on the takeover of federated there was no word on roddys plans 
and an announcement friday from campeau said only that he was 
leaving to pursue other career interests 
carolyn buck luce a campeau senior vice president who had been 
involved with financial nuts and bolts of the federated purchase 
also submitted her resignation 
retail industry analysts said the changes in the corporate 
parent should have little direct bearing on campeaus department 
store businesses 
federated operates abraham and straus bloomingdales burdines 
and other chain stores also under campeaus corporate umbrella is 
allied stores corp which campeau acquired in 1986 for 34 
billion allied and federated have headquarters in cincinnati 
pamela stubing an analyst with moodys investors service inc 
said the changes at campeau could end up being beneficial for 
allied and federated 
im told that the people at the alliedfederated level 
will have more say in daytoday operations and strategies going 
forward said stubing i think thats good theres always a 
danger when there are decisions being made one level removed 
she said moodys doesnt intend to initiate a review of the 
ratings it has assigned to allied and federated debt on account of 
campeaus restructuring moodys is a leading credit rating agency 
and its opinions can influence the interest rates corporations are 
charged to borrow money 
im just waiting for the second half of the year to see how 
that transpires she said noting that the second six months of 
the calendar year is the most important time for retailers 
campeau said the reorganization reflects the evolution that 
began in 1985 with our decision to grow beyond our canadian real 
estate roots and to acquire certain prime us retail interests 
we have made tremendous progress in the last year in 
accomplishing our strategies for asset acquisition and 
restructuring as well as debt reduction and corporate financing 
the company stated 
under the restructuring separate subsidiaries will report to 
the campeau holding company these are federated and allied which 
together form the department store group ralphs grocery co the 
california supermarket unit campeau development corp the us 
real estate group and campeau canada the canadian real estate 
development concern 
two additional executive changes were announced 
paul campbell currently senior vice president for the eastern 
region of campeau corp has been named president of the 
restructured campeau canada which comprises all of the companys 
commercial real estate and shopping center interests in canada 
russell s davis executive vice president and chief financial 
officer of federated and allied will expand his responsibilities 
and also become chief financial officer for the campeau holding 
company he succeeds roger ashton who resigned to return to a 
partnership position at a toronto accounting firm 
in a separate announcement campeau reported its financial 
results for the year ended jan 31 1989 
campeau said its net loss came to 34 million in the latest 
period an improvement from a loss of 196 million in the 13 months 
ended jan 31 1988 
revenue from continuing operations rose to 867 billion 
boosted by the acquisition of federated and ralphs compared to 
353 billion in the 13month period a year earlier

the dollar rose sharply against all major 
currencies except the canadian dollar friday despite central bank 
intervention and further indications that the us economy is 
losing steam 
gold prices took a tumble republic national bank of new york 
quoted a bid price for gold of 37750 a troy ounce as of 4 pm 
edt down from thursdays late bid of 38230 
a commerce department report showing the governments chief 
economic forecasting gauge slipped 07 percent in march failed to 
halt the dollars rise both at home and abroad 
the drop in the index of leading indicators which marked the 
first backtoback declines in more than a year was interpreted as 
another sign the economy is cooling and analysts predicted the 
slowdown will become more pronounced later this year 
dealers also noted that coordinated central bank intervention 
begun by the swiss central bank and followed by the central banks 
of the united states britain west germany italy and france 
failed to stem the dollars rise 
the dollar has been firm all day its just ignoring the 
numbers said earl johnson a vice president at harris trust and 
savings bank in chicago 
even though the federal reserve appears unlikely to tighten 
credit by hiking interest rates johnson said investors still feel 
us interest rates are attractive higher interest rates make 
dollardenominated securities more attractive 
jack barbanel a senior vice president at gruntal amp co also 
noted that foreign investors continue to view the us economy as 
relatively strong 
possibly they feel that even if we have a slowdown that leads 
to a recession theyre much better off with dollars because if the 
us goes into a recession we will really have a global 
recession he said

bachelors david pitassi and wally klemp dont 
have babies but theyre covering the bottoms of infants with a 
disposable diaper they say is cheaper and better than the 
betterknown competition 
move over pampers luvs and huggies the diaper entrepreneurs 
say here come drypers 
the foursize patentpending diaper has what their company 
calls a double lockaway core that absorbs moisture and wicks 
it from the babys skin the core is made of paper fluff and two 
parallel bands of superabsorbent material that can soak up to 100 
times its weight in liquid 
unlike the hisandhers diapers that have a more absorbent 
material in the front and bottom the dryper core runs down the 
middle of the entire diaper making it applicable for both girls 
and boys klemp says 
we think our product has better features says pitassi 
he and klemp and a third partner terry tognietti began 
marketing drypers last summer and they debuted on houston grocery 
shelves in september 
sales are exceeding expectations the company claims its 
reporting monthly sales of about 1 million and has captured 12 
percent to 20 percent of the market in cities where drypers are 
sold 
although thats more than veragon hoped for it remains well 
below the dominance of procter amp gamble co maker of pampers and 
luvs and kimberlyclark corp maker of huggies so veragons 
founders are happy but reserved 
we dont want to grow faster than we can control klemp 
says production at a new houston plant already is running 24 hours 
a day seven days a week to fill orders for new orleans and all of 
texas 
the 33 billion national diaper business is not new to the 
veragon partners 
pitassi and klemp both 30 formed a diaper company vmg 
products in vancouver wash in 1984 
i was working for procter amp gamble selling diapers and saw the 
diaper business was growing the country was going through a baby 
boom it just represented a tremendous opportunity pitassi 
recalld 
for us you had two big groups procter amp gamble and 
kimberlyclark and here we had come along with the same quality 
if not better diaper for a better price he says 
vmg now the thirdlargest diaper maker grossed millions months 
after production began within a year however the two lost 
control of the operation in a hostile takeover they ventured out 
on their own again 
tognietti 31 learned the diaper business during nine years 
with procter amp gamble which introduced disposable diapers in 1961 
with pampers and helped design pampgs genderspecialized luvs 
diapers 
cincinnatibased procter amp gamble is the nations largest 
producer of disposable diapers claiming 47 percent of market 
dallasbased kimberlyclark is no 2 with about 30 percent 
the top two are locked in a court battle procter amp gamble is 
suing its main competitor for patent infringement accusing 
kimberlyclark of copying the design of its highly successful 
superabsorbent pampers for use in superabsorbent huggies 
pitassi says selling drypers close to the factory saves the 
company transportation costs and enables veragon to charge an 
average of 1 less per box of diapers than the competition 
veragon picked houston as its manufacturing center over six 
other southwest cities partly because of tax abatements and ardent 
wooing by the houston economic development council 
the heart of the companys 80500squarefoot headquarters is a 
2 million diaperassembly machine that combines 15 raw materials 
the machine dubbed drypers one churns out 350 diapers a minute 
the company eventually may diversify and produce other paper 
products but for now drypers is the main focus 
no question our baby is drypers klemp says

billionaire hotelier jay pritzker and other 
suitors formally have submitted bids for strikebound eastern 
airlines but the carrier remained locked friday on its planned 
course of cutting operations and selling 18 billion in assets 
another potential buyer surfaced friday with the release of a 
statement purportedly from a group of new york financial 
institutions indicating they were prepared to pay 1 billion for 
eastern but only if the deal included assets sold by the airline 
since its 1986 acquisition by texas air corp 
pritzker the chairman of hyatt corp informally offered around 
500 million for miamibased eastern several weeks ago according 
to sources close to the situation 
jack bavis the head of easterns pilots union told his 
membership late thursday that pritzker submitted a bid wednesday to 
federal bankruptcy court eastern boss frank lorenzo the airlines 
unions and major creditors 
bavis also said trans world airlines chairman carl c icahn has 
requested confidential financial data on eastern as a prelude to 
making an offer for the nations seventhlargest carrier 
the consortium of new york financial institutions meanwhile 
said it had submitted an offer to the bankruptcy court and examiner 
david shapiro that would provide more than 1 billion for 
acquisition and startup costs for eastern airlines and additional 
unspecified assets 
a brief statement issued by the consortium gave few details and 
a person listed as spokesman in new york did not immediately return 
a telephone call shapiro also did not immediately return a call 
seeking confirmation of the proposal 
the statement said the offer would give the unions a substantial 
equity stake in eastern with equivalent representation on the board 
of directors the consortium would provide more than 500 million 
in working capital to fund the first six months of operation under 
the plan the statement said 
the offer requires that no eastern assets would be sold and 
assets transferred to parent texas air and sister carrier 
continental airlines starting in early 1986 would be returned 
us bankruptcy judge burton r lifland has called a hearing for 
next wednesday to address the question of whether eastern should be 
auctioned in its entirety including the pre1986 assets 
edward beauvais the chairman of america west airlines said 
thursday his carrier still was interested in buying easterns 
northeast shuttle service if the planned 365 million sale to 
developer donald trump falls through beauvais said the 
phoenixbased airline had lined up tentative outside financing and 
is prepared to bid 600 million to 700 million for the shuttle and 
a bevy of aircraft 
an associate of pritzker in his chicago office said he was out 
of the country and unavailable for comment details of his formal 
bid werent available 
while confirming that the airline had received an offer from 
pritzker eastern spokesman robin matell insisted there are still 
no bona fide offers to buy eastern 
easterns parent texas air corp is not having any discussions 
with any potential buyers matell said in a telephone interview 
from miami were moving ahead with our rebuilding plan and are 
making good progress in discussions with the creditors committee 
and the court regarding our business plan to get eastern back in 
the air 
easterns managers recently detailed plans to operate at 
onethird the airlines prestrike size and raise 18 billion by 
selling assets including planes airport gates and landing slots 
at unspecified locations 
as a first step eastern announced plans thursday to lease 14 
boeing 727200s to pan american world airways for 966 million 
over five years 
eastern is expected to announce more deals for leasing and 
selling aircraft in the coming days according to sources close to 
the company 
all transactions and any sale of the entire airline must be 
approved by federal bankruptcy court in new york where eastern 
filed for chapter 11 reorganization and protection from creditors 
on march 9 
easterns machinists union struck the carrier on march 4 after a 
long wage dispute and were joined by pilots and flight attendants 
virtually grounding the airline and draining its cash reserves 
pritzkers representatives presented an informal proposal to the 
creditors committee on april 14 that called for pritzker to buy 
easterns fleet of around 250 planes for an unspecified cash 
payment and lease them back to eastern said sources close to the 
situation 
in addition pritzker would pay eastern around 100 million 
cash receive all easterns stock except for an unspecified share 
to be owned by its unions and would forgive 185 million in debt 
eastern is owed by texas air the sources said 
lorenzos agreement with exbaseball commissioner peter v 
ueberroth to sell eastern for 464 million fell through april 12

mobil corp long a proponent of doing business 
in south africa said friday it was leaving the raciallydivided 
nation after 90 years of business there and will take a net loss of 
140 million on the move 
the withdrawal of mobil the largest american company doing 
business in south africa leaves 135 other american companies still 
operating there according to the washingtonbased investor 
responsibility research center a notforprofit association funded 
by institutional investors 
the oil giant said it was selling operations once valued at more 
than 400 million to general mining union corp ltd for more than 
155 million in cash plus 10 million that was expected to be the 
operations 1989 profit 
after adjustments for taxes and accounting the company will 
record a net book loss of 140 million on the sale 
the rand has fallen a great deal over the last few years and 
that has reduced the dollar value of the company in south africa 
said mobil spokesman john lord the loss will be included in the 
companys secondquarter earnings report lord said 
in a prepared statement earlier in the day new yorkbased mobil 
had said the price exceeded mobils estimated present value of the 
south african operations future earnings 
mobil chairman allen e murray blamed us foreign policies 
including a 1987 law that eliminated certain tax credits for us 
companies doing business in south africa ultimately forcing the 
pullout 
the law was ill conceived and had a serious economic 
impact on us murray said 
the sale expected to be concluded by june 30 includes a 
refinery and retail and commercial petroleum marketing networks 
twelve mobil affiliates are involved in the sale doing business in 
south africa namibia botswana swaziland and lesotho mobil said 
mobil stock closed at 5075 a share on the new york stock 
exchange down 50 cents from thursdays close 
this was a difficult decision because we continue to believe 
that our presence and our actions have contributed greatly to 
economic and social progress for nonwhites in south africa 
murray said 
but we had to weigh business considerations including the 
impact of recently enacted and proposed us legislation and 
regulations which have made it more and more difficult for us to be 
fully competitive there 
congress in late 1987 passed a bill by rep charles b rangel 
dnew york eliminating a tax credit that allowed us companies to 
deduct taxes paid to south africa against taxes owed to the us 
government 
murray said that as a result of the change earnings in south 
africa were taxed twice and the effective tax rate on south african 
earnings by us corporations was 72 percent 
mobils 1988 profit was 21 billion on revenue of 549 
billion its foreign petroleum earnings totaled 12 billion up 5 
percent from 1987 
mobil had insisted since 1986 when exxon corp the biggest us 
oil company left south africa that it would not bow to pressure to 
disinvest in the last four years more than 170 american firms have 
withdrawn from that country because of south africas race 
policies most sold their operations at what were considered low 
prices to south africancontrolled business 
two resolutions were to be presented by church groups at mobils 
annual shareholders meeting in may asking the company to divest its 
holdings in south africa 
mobil employed almost 2800 people in south africa and had been 
a symbol of foreign business reluctance to leave the country 
despite widespread condemnation of the whiteled governments 
suppression of the black majority in the system known as apartheid 
nevertheless mobil has received a no 1 rating in the last two 
years by a group that monitors us companies adherence to the 
socalled sullivan principles a set of voluntary 
antidiscrimination guidelines for companies doing business in 
south africa 
mobils agreement with gencor continues mobils equal 
opportunity policies and fund the mobil foundation at 3 million a 
year at least until 1994 the foundation provides education 
housing and other assistance mostly to black south africans 
the sale leaves mobil which does not export crude or products 
to south africa without any holdings in south africa including 
licensing or franchise operations murray said 
antiapartheid groups cheered the move 
mobil succumbed to antiapartheid pressure said diane 
bratcher of the interfaith center on corporate responsiblity an 
association of religious institutional investors that has targeted 
mobil since the 1970s 
whether theyll say that or not thats why they are 
selling their assets 
mobil and other companies have maintained they are doing more 
good by staying in south africa but antiapartheid groups claim 
the companies indirectly support racist policies 
so even though they are doing good in other areas they are 
paying high taxes that are used to sustain apartheid bratcher 
said

g heileman brewing co officials have 
discussed buying a minority interest in the stroh brewery co 
touching off speculation about a possible merger between two of the 
nations largest beer companies 
but analysts question whether such a deal could clear federal 
antitrust laws 
stroh officials several weeks ago announced their willingness to 
sell a minority interest in the detroitbased company the 
thirdlargest brewer in the united states 
the speculation about a merger was touched off when murray 
cutbush president and chief executive officer of la crossebased 
heileman disclosed thursday that representatives from his company 
were in detroit to meet with stroh officials 
heileman which was bought by australias bond corp in 1987 is 
the nations no 5 brewer with a 1988 estimate of 154 million 
barrels 
lacey logan a stroh spokeswoman said friday that stroh is in 
the process of finding an international minority investment partner 
or partners for opportunities available to stroh outside of the 
united states 
she said that stroh has been having ongoing meetings with a 
number of international brewers 
stroh shipped an estimated 206 million barrels in 1988 far 
behind the 405 million shipped by the miller brewing co which is 
the countrys second largest brewer 
anheuserbusch cos inc was no 1 with a 1988 estimate of 785 
million barrels 
industry analysts have predicted competitors of anheuser and 
miller might need to consolidate in order to challenge the 
companies on a national level 
stroh and heileman would be a sensible merger said robert 
weinberg an industry analyst and professor of marketing management 
at washington university in st louis 
heileman has a lot of volume but not good infrastructure 
he said stroh has good infrastructure but they dont have a lot 
of volume 
youre looking at creating a brewer the approximate size of 
miller he said 
one major obstacle however could be antitrust laws which 
blocked earlier attempts by heileman to buy both the jos schlitz 
brewing co and pabst brewing co schlitz was later bought by stroh 
if i were a smaller company i would be squealing like a 
pig weinberg said 
if such a merger were proposed he said a critical issue would 
be whether the combination of stroh and heileman would increase 
competition within the industry or reduce it 
in his remarks thursday to the wisconsin wholesale beer 
distributors association cutbush predicted that a third major 
player would emerge in the us brewing industry within five years 
and he said heileman intended to be that player 
its a long way between the beginning of negotiations and the 
completion of negotiations said jerry steinman publisher of the 
industry newletter beer marketers insights and a lot of 
negotiations never bear fruit

precious metals prices dropped sharply friday as evidence of a 
slowing us economy continued to mount 
the decline was led by gold which tumbled on new yorks 
commodity exchange to a new low for the may contract 
on other markets wheat prices rose while corn and soybean 
prices fell cattle prices rallied but hog prices retreated and 
energy prices were mixed 
gold settled 540 to 620 lower with the contract for delivery

lower with may at 5601 a troy ounce platinum settled at 2170

the selloff was largely a response to the commerce departments 
report friday that the index of leading economic indicators plunged 
07 percent in march it was the second consecutive decline in the 
index and the sharpest in eight months 
precious metals especially gold are traditionally seen as safe 
investments during periods of rising inflation an economic 
slowdown would likely result in less inflation 
platinum prices had risen sharply earlier in the week and 
although supply factors are bullish there is a lot of 
uncertainty in the amount of demand said george anagnos of 
thomson mckinnon securities inc 
analysts attributed the drop in silver prices to the commodity 
exchanges report of a relatively large amount of the metal 200 
million ounces in exchangeapproved warehouses the stockpile 
equals about 20 months of demand anagnos said 
wheat closed sharply higher on the chicago board of trade as 
speculation continued on what position the bush administration will 
take on whether to continue subsidized grain sales to foreign 
countries 
corn futures were lower oat futures rose and soybeans fell as 
rains continued in illinois and iowa 
soybeans also were pressured by word that the brazilian dock 
strike was breaking up after dockworkers gave their tentative 
approval to a courtordered pay raise 
corn for may delivery was boosted by rumors of a major sale to 
the soviet union after the close the agriculture department 
announced the sale of 105 million metric tons of corn to the 
soviets 
wheat settled 5 cents to 12 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in may at 417 cents a bushel corn was 1 cents 
lower to cent higher with may at 269 a bushel oats were 
cent to 3 cents higher with may at 178 a bushel soybeans were 3 
cents to 7 cents lower with may at 722 a bushel 
cattle prices were up while hogs and pork bellies fell on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
cattle futures tried to go lower early in the session but 
rallied late an indication that cattle prices may have found a 
longawaited bottom said dale durchholz an analyst with 
agrivisor services inc in bloomington ill 
hog prices were pushed lower by commercial selling and ideas 
that wholesale porkproduct prices would decrease next week 
cattle settled 35 cent lower to 63 higher with june at 7145 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 70 cent higher with 
may at 7652 cents a pound hogs were 03 cent to 45 cent lower 
with june at 4662 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 47 cent 
to 1 cent lower with may at 3137 cents a pound 
petroleum futures settled mixed on the new york mercantile 
exchange as traders sold before the expiration of gasoline and 
heatingoil contracts 
crude prices were weak in anticipation of the restart of 
production at the brent oil field in the north sea production was 
cut by a platform accident last week

petroleum futures finished mixed friday with 
gasoline falling for the second straight day after the recent steep 
rise in prices 
the may gasoline contract declined sharply as it expired friday 
on the new york mercantile exchange the contract closed 391 cents 
lower than thursdays session at 7421 a gallon other contract 
months lost between 105 and 013 cents 
crude oil finished mostly higher on the exchange but the june 
contract fell 50 cents to end the day at 2042 a barrel the july 
contract remained flat at 1934 a barrel 
heating oil was mixed with the may contract gaining 034 cent on 
the expiration of the contract to finish at 5220 cents a gallon 
gasoline has been the focus of market attention recently because 
of expectations of tight supplies for the summer driving season 
largely because of new higher octane regulations scheduled to take 
effect soon 
but worries of even tighter supplies following the spill off the 
alaskan coast last month and a north sea explosion recently have 
sent prices zooming at the wholesale and retail levels 
analysts have said however that although there might be a 
tightness in the gasoline market this summer a supply shortage is 
unlikely

junk bond financier michael r milken 
who is fighting federal racketeering and fraud charges has vowed 
to join another battle raising money to revive a dying 
massachusetts shipyard 
milken who was charged last month in a 98count indictment 
capping an extensive government investigation made a surprise 
appearance thursday before 700 former shipyard workers at the sons 
of italy hall here 
milken told the group that he and drexel burnham lambert inc 
the investment firm that has agreed to dismiss him could easily 
secure the millions of dollars in capital and bonds needed to 
finance an employeeowned shipbuilding and repair operation at 
quincys fore river shipyard 
by june 30 the money will be lined up for the yard he said 
milken said he would help with the shipbuilding venture but his 
role in the venture was unclear 
drexel officials said milken was instrumental in putting 
together the firms commitment 
the firm has since agreed to disassociate itself from milken 
under an april 13 landmark civil fraud agreement with the 
securities and exchange commission settling charges including 
insider trading milken also is barred from any business dealings 
with drexel employees 
the pact signed april 13 is pending approval by a federal 
judge but drexel already has placed milken on leave of absence 
drexel vice president pat flanagan said milken would have no 
official involvement in the quincy deal in the future 
but milken was introduced to the exshipyard workers as the man 
who would make the deal work milken said that while drexel would 
manage the deal he would make sure the project went through 
it was unclear whether milkens appearance and comments would be 
considered a violation of the sec agreement a drexel spokesman had 
left the office late friday and could not be reached for comment

the midwest stock exchange in an attempt to 
capture a share of the afterhours trading of us stocks is 
proposing a second computerized trading session officials said 
thursday 
the new trading session from 330 pm to 5 pm cdt would be 
for the trading of portfolios and not for individual customers 
said vice president roger hendrick 
the midwest exchange is currently open from 830 am to 3 pm 
cdt most of the stocks traded on the exchange are also traded on 
the new york stock exchange 
the exchange applied wednesday to the securities and exchange 
commission for approval 
hendrick estimated that stock portfolios traded after hours 
equal 10 million to 20 million shares daily but the activity is 
not reflected in reported trading volume and the volume is 
difficult to accurately measure 
hendrick said the portfolios traded in the late afternoon will 
be required to consist of at least 20 stocks none of which may be 
greater than 10 percent of the value of the portfolio 
brokerage firms trading portfolios will send their transactions 
electronically into a computer at the midwest exchange which will 
record the trade 
currently such trades are registered on the london stock 
exchange to comply with new york stock exchange rules that member 
brokerages trade on recognized exchanges when it is closed 
hendrick said the midwest exchange will charge a fee to record 
the portfolio trades which are recorded free of charge in london

the smaller hollandbased company has infringed on two steelcase 
patents one granted in 1980 and the second in 1984 
both are for panel electrical wiring systems according to the 
lawsuit 
steelcase insists the lawsuit is neither related to nor in 
retaliation for an earlier one filed by haworth now before the us 
supreme court 
while both lawsuits involve the electrical system in the two 
companies panel systems steelcase spokesman peter jeff said 
theyre different patents and different issues its the same 
church but its a different pew 
haworth the nations thirdlargest office furniture maker sued 
steelcase in 1985 claiming the industry leader was infringing on 
haworth patents when it designed made and sold certain prewired 
office panels 
us district judge richard enslen last year ruled in favor of 
steelcase but a federal appeals court reversed that opinion in 
january ruling for haworth steelcase appealed to the nations 
highest court 
steelcase could end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars to 
haworth if the ruling stands 
haworth spokesman richard planck said thursday the company would 
have no comment until it receives formal notification of the 
lawsuit

mai basic four inc which designs and 
makes business computers said friday that earnings dropped nearly 
62 percent in the first three months of 1989 due in part to efforts 
to acquire prime computer 
other factors contributing to the decline were a slowdown in the 
midrange computer industry and a softened dollar overseas the

earnings for the second quarter ended march 31 declined to 24 
million or 16 cents per share from 63 million or 42 cents per 
share for the same quarter last year 
although our period earnings declined compared to last year 
through prudent expense controls we were able to achieve an 
operating income margin of 128 percent for the six months ended 
march 31 1989 an excellent result in the context of the current 
industrywide slowdown said william b patton jr president and 
chief executive officer 
revenue for the quarter declined from 1054 million in 1988 to 
1047 million this year the company said 
the company said prime computers resistance to a mai tender 
offer made last year contributed to the earnings decline it noted 
that the delaware chancery court has set a may 24 hearing on 
company motions to invalidate primes takeover defense 
mbf remains committed to acquiring prime at the earliest 
possible time said company chairman bennett s lebow 
orders for company products declined 5 percent in the first six 
months of the companys fiscal year compared to the same period a 
year ago primarily because of lower european sales patton said
