israels leftleaning labor party voted 
by an overwhelming majority thursday to reenter negotiations with 
the hardline likud bloc on forming a joint national unity 
government 
the decision was a reversal of the partys 110member executive 
bureau which last week voted against further talks 
it also was seen as a boost to the leadership of foreign minister 
shimon peres who pushed hard for a vote in favor of new 
negotiations 
if this were not the vote people would say it was a personal 
defeat so i suppose its a personal triumph peres told reporters 
after the results were announced 
the vote of the central committee was 637 to 348 just under 
1000 of the committees more than 1300 members attended the 
session in this tel aviv suburb 
both peres and the partys no 2 man defense minister yitzhak 
rabin made emotional pleas in favor of reopening talks with likud 
they pledged however that they would agree to join a coalition 
government only if it would advance the peace process and was 
committed to reforming the electoral system 
for 11 years the likud has been in power peres told the 
committee almost all that is dear to us has been affected what 
should we do be proud and go home or try to find a solution and 
change the system 
he added virtually screaming into the microphone i did not 
come to arrange negotiations but to examine our souls 
likud first came to power in 1977 and likud and labor have 
governed israel in an uneasy coalition since inconclusive elections 
in 1984 
israeli elections nov 1 again ended indecisively with likud 
winning 40 seats to labors 39 the remaining 41 seats were divided 
among smaller parties 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of likud has been asked to form a 
new government and needs the support of labor or several of the 
smaller parties to achieve a majority in the 120seat parliament or 
knesset 
intense bargaining has been going on since the election 
on thursday talks were held between likud leaders and the tehiya 
party a nationalist party with three seats in the new parliament 
and a tentative agreement was signed that would give a tehiya member 
the energy ministry portfolio israel television reported 
likud officials also met with three other small parties but no 
agreements were reached israel radio said

despite the urging of parole officials 
governor buddy roemer has refused to grant clemency to wilbert 
rideau a convicted murderer who became a nationally recognized 
prison editor 
i wish somebody would tell me what to do and id do it 
rideau said in a telephone interview thursday a day after roemer 
rejected the state pardon boards recommendation for a reduction of 
sentence 
rideau 47 is serving life in the state prison for a 1961 lake 
charles bank robbery during which he kidnapped three employees shot 
and wounded two of them and killed the third by cutting her throat 
rideau was arrested shortly afterwards and confessed in front of 
television cameras he spent 10 years on death row until the us 
supreme court struck down the states capital punishment law in 1972 
the boards second recommendation of reduced sentence would have 
made rideau eligible for parole in rejecting it roemer cited the 
strenuous objections of rideaus prosecutors and victims 
rideau who has won numerous national prizes as editor of the 
prison news magazine the angolite said he thinks he was turned down 
because his success with the magazine has kept him in the limelight 
weve got a system that encourages anonymity it encourages 
prisoners to do nothing not to distinguish themselves he said 
if you want to get out of prison youre supposed to keep your 
mouth shut and let everybody forget about you he said 
rideau said he is not sure what to do next since the pardon 
board agreed with him it would add nothing to get another hearing 
rideau said he can only hope that roemer will change his mind 
i would love to meet the man rideau said i wish i could 
sit down with him anything he wants to know let me present my 
side 
although serving life rideau is frequently on the road 
traveling under guard to lecture at state universities appear on 
national television shows and cover state board meetings for the 
magazine 
he and other editors have been singled out for national 
recognition by the american bar association private foundations and 
other organizations

pet shop owner patricia lopes says she 
doesnt mind kissing dogs but shed rather not perform 
mouthtomouth resuscitation again 
all i thought about was what do i do with the tongue lopes 
said tuesday after reviving a greyhound with cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation 
lopes who runs a pet grooming store said she had just finished 
bathing and clipping the toenails of escape a 13yearold retired 
racer when the dog collapsed saturday 
she heard a thud and turned to find the dog sprawled out on a pet 
table tongue hanging out and eyes rolled back 
when she could find no pulse lopes said she assumed the dog had 
had a heart attack and began cpr a procedure designed to restore 
normal breathing and heartbeat 
lopes pressed on the dogs chest and cupped her hands over the 
dogs mouth to breath air into its lungs 
after a few minutes i heard a cough and then a gurgle i 
continued working on her until she could breathe on her own said 
lopes 
now it seems funny doing mouthtomouth with a dog at the 
time though i was only thinking about how to keep the dog alive 
she said 
lopes said she took a cpr course after a friend developed heart 
problems and it was the first time she put her training to use 
the dog owned by roger roy of acushnet is recovering at home 
and is being treated with nitroglycerin lopes said tests showed 
escapes heart suffered some damage she said 
escapes veterinarian ted sherman of fairhaven said it is 
difficult to say whether ms lopes actions saved the dogs life or 
whether the heart resumed beating on its own 
sherman called ms lopes response admirable but cautioned 
against untrained people performing cpr on animals he said the best 
thing to do is call an animal hospital

lewis 53 filed for bankruptcy nov 8 citing debts of more than 
3 million and income of about 5000 a month hagemeyer said

hagemeyer said 
lewis bankruptcy petition lists a residence valued at 30000 
near nesbit miss and other personal property worth about 6000

responding to inquiries from bankruptcy trustee george emerson 
lewis said a contract he signed eight years ago puts his income from 
the movie at 200000 to 250000 
emerson asked if lewis expected to perform any consulting work or

filed against him for more than 450000 with interest he now owes 
about 950000 the attorney said 
lewis went to trial on tax evasion charges in 1984 but was 
acquitted of charges he intentionally hid money from the irs at the 
time the irs said he owed the government more than 650000

east germany once the soviet unions staunchest 
ideological ally has embarked on an unprecedented campaign of 
censorship aimed at bridling the spread of the kremlins new reform 
policies 
the seriousness of the campaign became clear nov 20 when east 
germanys communist government slapped a firstever openended ban 
on a soviet publication a magazine called sputnik 
the campaign has pitted east germanys aging and conservative 
leaders in the most dramatic form yet against reformers in the 
soviet union whose reexaminations of soviet history have led to a 
public debate on a scale unheard of in east germany 
east german leaders have long resisted president mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness and other reforms on 
grounds that such critical discussions of problems in east germany 
are unnecessary 
recent speeches by communist party leaders have reiterated the 
governments rejection of the soviet reforms course 
however the recent actions have signaled the boldest moves yet 
by the government to distance itself from the debate in moscow and 
to insulate the nations population from the popular changes 
gorbachevs policies enjoy enormous support among east germans 
who hope his influence will bring about change in one of eastern 
europes most tightly controlled societies 
east german party leaders have occasionally blocked the 
distribution of newspapers from warsaw pact neighbors in the past 
during the 1968 prague spring in czechoslovakia and the early 
periods of labor unrest in poland 
selected issues of soviet magazines have also been blocked but 
until the decision on the monthly magazine sputnik no outright ban 
had ever been imposed on a soviet magazine 
the decision was followed quickly with an order removing five 
soviet films dealing with stalinist themes from theaters across the 
country 
authorities also canceled an east berlin cabaret production that 
poked fun at the governments reluctance to accept gorbachevs 
reform policies 
the banning of sputnik followed its publication of articles 
critical of the late josef stalin and germanys communists before 
adolf hitler took power in germany in 1933 
stalin who died in 1953 holds a special place in official east 
germany as a liberator in world war ii and as the soviet leader who 
helped found the new communist nation in 1949 
east german leaders were outraged over an article in sputniks 
october issue that suggested that stalin had been a mere puppet of 
hitler after the two nations signed a mutual nonaggression pact 
in 1939 and that germanys communists had indirectly aided hitlers 
rise to power by not joining together with social democrats to 
stop him 
the sputnik article also charged that german communists followed 
stalins order to stop all antifascist propaganda after the 
pact was signed 
nazi germany invaded the soviet union in 1941 
distribution of the october sputnik was ordered halted shortly 
after it appeared in east germany 
these historical issues go to the very root of their 
communist east german leaders existence said stefan heym a 
prominent east german author told the associated press in east 
berlin 
these articles upset the picture of the world they want to 
depict 
erich honecker the east german leader along with a substantial 
number of the nations ruling politburo members were members of the 
prewar german communist party and pride themselves on having fought 
fascism 
honecker was imprisoned by the nazis and thousands of communists 
were slain shortcomings of the movement or of party leaders at the 
time have not been a matter for debate in the east german media 
in an article defending the sputnik ban the communist party 
organ neues deutschland charged that the publication not only 
distorts soviet history but the history of the german communist 
party 
the magazine and we say this openly defames german 
communists 
while carefully emphazing that sputnik was not an official 
organ of the soviet communist party neues deutchland added that 
distorted visions of soviet history distributed here are 
incompatible with our friendship with the soviet union 
soviet officials defended the magazine saying it mirrors a 
plurality of opinion in the soviet press

marxist guerrillas called the polisario 
front have been fighting for 13 years for independence of the 
western sahara near where two us aid planes came under missile 
attack on thursday 
morocco occupied most of the former spanish sahara in 1976 after 
claiming it as moroccan since early in the century 
algeria immediately recognized the polisario fronts struggle for 
independence and about 70 nations mostly members of the 
nonaligned group followed suit 
mauritania occupied the southernmost third of the territory in 
1976 but gave up its claim to the area in 1979 and morocco annexed 
it 
the polisario with extensive help from algeria and libya waged 
an aggressive guerrilla war 
with a heavily armed guerrilla force of 20000 men polisario 
almost captured the mauritanian capital nouakchott in 1976 
disrupted phosphate mining at the sahara mining center of bou craa 
and attacked shipping off the atlantic coast with heavily armed 
rubber boats 
morocco deployed virtually its entire 120000member army and 
guerrilla activity nearly came to a halt 
but the operation was expensive in money and lives and by 1986 
morocco had lost about 15000 men matched by losses on the 
polisario side 
this year algeria polisarios main foreign backers decided it 
had more to gain by reaching a direct understanding with morocco 
and the united nations has been mediating peace talks between 
morocco and the guerrillas 
under a tentative agreement about 2000 un peacekeepers would 
monitor a referendum that would result in western saharas 
independence or affiliation with morocco

holiday chimes may sound a somber note for 
families grieving over the loss of a child but a psychiatrist 
suggests survivors start new traditions in memory of the departed 
families in mourning have to be told it is all right to have 
fun says abby l wasserman writing in the december issue of 
american journal of diseases of children 
laughter is the best medicine for helping the bereaved cope 
with their loss having a good time does not mean that the parents 
loved their child any less she said 
in fact they may be showing more love because by enjoying 
themselves they are bringing their family closer together 
in getting through the holidays families must decide what is 
comfortable ms wasserman said 
changes can make things less painful she said a different 
tree with different decorations opening the presents at a different 
time a different menu for dinner 
some families put a small christmas tree on the childs grave 
ms wasserman said others light a candle or order special plants or 
flowers 
accompanying her article are some dos and donts for 
those spending time with bereaved parents during the holidays 
do 
talk about special qualities of the child they have lost 
allow them to express as much grief as they are feeling 
reassure them that they did everything they could 
pay attention to surviving siblings 
but dont 
say you know how they feel unless you have lost a child 
say the parents should be over the loss 
change the subject when they mention their dead child 
say they can always have other children 
point out that at least they have other children 
ms wasserman a child psychiatrist at washington university 
school of medicine in st louis says religion can be a source of 
comfort but she cautions that surviving children might misinterpret 
some explanations 
in one case she said the behavior of a 4yearold boy was poor 
after his brothers death 
when asked about this behavior change for the worse he replied 
that he was not going to be so good that jesus would want him this 
child had been told that his brother was so wonderful that jesus 
wanted him to live with him in heaven ms wasserman said 
the compassionate friends an international organization 
dedicated to helping parents overcome the loss of a child recently 
sent out holiday suggestions to its 600 us chapters 
sometimes the toughest part of all is the anticipation said 
therese goodrich director of groups national office in suburban 
oak brook 
you turn on the television and people are telling you to get 
the shopping done its all around us she said in a telephone 
interview thursday 
some people like to buy a gift that their child would have 
liked and then give it to the salvation army or a church group 
other suggestions include urging families to change their holiday 
routines mention the loss of their children in christmas cards and 
discuss them when they feel comfortable with the subject 
mrs goodrich whose 14yearold daughter was killed by a car in 
1971 says the first holiday without a child is the hardest 
when a child dies our priorities get shook up we want to show 
a little more love she said i think people just need to be 
gentle with themselves thats the main thing

president reagan in a twilight assessment 
says mikhail s gorbachev has never shown any reason to be 
mistrusted and in fact is steering the kremlin away from its old 
goal of a oneworld communist state 
in what was probably his final white house news conference 
reagan said trust but verify remains his byword in dealing with 
the russians but he offered an optimstic assessment of how 
ussoviet relations stand at the end of his eightyear tenure in 
office 
the path remains open and the pace of peace continues he 
said 
for half an hour reagan fielded questions thursday night in an 
east room decorated with christmas trees hung with silver tinsel he 
said it was the russians not he who have changed but his old 
anticommunist fire was dampened 
on a pressing domestic issue reagan said he would be deeply 
disappointed if presidentelect bush after assuming office next 
month raised taxes to help cut the deficit which grew to 155 
billion this year 
but he quickly added i dont think its going to happen 
the chief executive also told reporters the united states 
ultimately will have to negotiate with iran to win release of 
american hostages in lebanon we would be ready to talk with 
them he said of the iranians 
in addition he said plo chairman yasser arafat did not go far 
enough in saying his organization accepts the existence of israel as 
a state and condemns terrorism in all forms 
he has left openings for himself where he can deny that he 
meant this or meant that that sounded so cleancut reagan said 
on a day after his fifth and final meeting with gorbachev reagan 
opened the meeting with reporters by reading a warm statement on the 
state of superpower relations 
asked if he believed gorbachev was trying to make the soviet 
union a less threatening nation reagan replied without hesitation 
yes i do 
and i think he recognizes that their massive buildup has been 
responsible for the great economic crisis that he faces there in the 
soviet union reagan said 
asked pointblank if he trusted gorbachev reagan said he 
hasnt shown me any reason yet that i shouldnt 
however reagan said the motto trust but verify is one that 
properly guides soviet policy too and said he did not think 
gorbachev would gamble on believing that he shouldnt protect his 
own interests also 
whether or not the united states and soviet union ever become 
allies as they were during world war ii reagan said it was 
entirely up to the kremlin 
it could happen he said if it can be definitely established 
that they no longer are following the expansionist policy that was 
instituted in the communist revolution that their goal must be a 
oneworld communist state 
the president said certainly there are indications the 
kremlin is moving that way 
i do think that there is evidence that they dont like being 
the pariah that they might want to join the family of nations and 
join them with the idea of bringing about or establishing peace 
he said he would like to see that happen 
reagan seemed cool to gorbachevs call for a ceasefire in 
afghanistan followed by a united nationssponsored peacekeeping 
force and broadbased government im not sure the un would like 
that or that the un is prepared to do such a thing reagan said 
moreover he said it would be unacceptable to stop arming the 
afghan rebels unless the sovietbacked regime ended military 
operations 
the president said he was very grateful for gorbachevs 
announcement of a 500000 cutback in soviet troop strength but said 
moscow still would have superiority in conventional weapons 
reagan also expressed confidence that bush believed as he does 
that contra forces fighting the government of nicaragua are freedom 
fighters and worthy of continued us support 
on the subject of american hostages in lebanon reagan said the 
united states ultimately would have to negotiate with iran because 
the iranians control the kidnappers 
concerning that prospect he said there are conditions that 
have to be met also there anytime that they are ready to come 
forward on an open basis we would be ready to talk to them 
we cannot enter into negotiating in the sense of what kind of 
ransom to pay or youre just encouraging more hostagetaking but 
there are other channels he said 
later spokesman marlin fitzwater elaborated well be glad to 
talk but weve never been able to get them to do that 
reflecting on the highs and lows of his presidency reagan said 
his greatest burden was to have to order troops into danger 
to where their lives are threatened to where their lives are 
taken he later expanded that noting the continued captivity of 
hostages in the middle east 
his greatest joy he said without hesitation was the economic 
recovery the longest ever during peacetime 
fitzwater refused to say the news conference was reagans last 
one but nancy reagan said it was

taking office nearly eight years ago president 
reagan said the leaders of the soviet union themselves had said they 
would commit any crime to achieve world domination now hes 
inviting mikhail gorbachev to come visit him in california 
with reagan fresh from his fifth meeting with gorbachev in less 
than four years it was inevitable that a reporter at what may be 
his last white house news conference would remind him of what he 
said about the soviet leadership at his first one 
on jan 29 1981 just nine days after he was inaugurated reagan 
told reporters i know of no leader of the soviet union since the 
revolution and including the present leadership that has not more 
than once repeated their determination that their goal must be 
the promotion of world revolution 
furthermore he said the soviet leaders have openly and 
publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will 
further their cause meaning they reserve unto themselves the right 
to commit any crime to lie to cheat in order to attain that 
thursday night reagans words were different 
that was four leaders back before this one he said i 
think there have been some changes 
asked directly whether he trusted gorbachev the president said 
he hasnt shown me any reason yet why i shouldnt 
quickly he added as he so often does that his motto is trust 
everybody but cut the cards his remarks were sprinkled however 
with complimentary references to the soviet leader 
at the end of his private meeting with gorbachev on governors 
island in new york harbor on wednesday reagan handed the soviet 
leader a photograph with the inscription that they had walked a 
long way together to clear a path for peace 
and so we have he told the news conference 
reagan never met as president with any of the three other soviet 
leaders who held office and died during his administration leonid 
brezhnev yuri andropov and konstantin chernenko 
but he has met with gorbachev in geneva in 1985 in reykjavik 
iceland in 1986 in washington in 1987 and both in moscow and on 
governors island in 1988 
he seemed eager to keep in touch saying the soviet leader had 
invited the reagans to travel to moscow and that the reagans had 
reciprocated with an invitation to the gorbachevs to visit 
california 
the outgoing president and his wife will live in los angeles 
after his term ends jan 20 and say they will also spend time at 
their ranch in the santa ynez mountains north of santa barbara 
gorbachev has never been to california 
in the course of superpower summitry during his second term 
reagan said there has been a serious movement and even some 
breakthroughs 
he applauded gorbachevs offer to reduce soviet troop strength by 
half a million troops but said there was still room for 
negotiations on the subject because the soviets would retain an 
advantage in troops in europe 
the path remains open and the pace of peace continues the 
president said 
asked whether he believed gorbachev was transforming the soviet 
union into a less threatening nation he replied yes i do 
he said gorbachevs hasty return home prompted by the 
devastating earthquake in armenia was a sad final note to what 
has been an otherwise successful and i use the next words 
advisedly happy and historic visit to the united states 
asked to assess gorbachevs longterm chances for political 
survival reagan said well i realize and i think we all should 
that he is battling a bureaucracy because whether its a russian 
bureaucracy or one of our own the first rule of bureaucracy is 
protect the bureaucracy 
and it would mean some great changes for some of the 
nomenklatura as they call their bureaucracy there if he 
institutes the reforms that hes talking about he continued 
but on the plus side for him its very evident that the 
people of the soviet union are on his side and i have to believe 
that the nomenklatura is going to have to think twice with regard to 
how far they would go in trying to block him when the man in the 
street over there wants the things that have been seen 
greater than

reflecting on the peaks and valleys of his 
presidency ronald reagan said his toughest burden has been sending 
young americans into battle and laboring to win the release of 
others held hostage 
at two different points in his nationally broadcast news 
conference thursday night reagan talked of difficult moments in the 
oval office 
asked what task he had found most difficult the president 
quickly cited the sending of troops into combat 
saying that i think i am prouder of them than of anything that 
has happened during his nearly eight years in office reagan 
added i dont think theres anything tougher than to have to 
order these magnificent young men and women in our military into 
danger 
thats got to be something that any president would hesitate on 
and have to say was the greatest burden he said 
at another point reagan cited the continuing captivity of nine 
americans held by proiranian elements in lebanon saying it was 
one of those things you go to bed with every night 
during reagans presidency more than 200 us military personnel 
were killed during a bombing of a marine barracks in beirut 
lebanon several thousand troops were sent into combat during the 
invasion of grenada in which 19 american soldiers were killed and 
37 crewmen aboard the uss stark were killed in the persian gulf when 
their ship was struck by missiles fired by an iraqi fighter 
when asked what he most enjoyed about the presidency reagan 
replied that there are a number of things to miss 
but reagan said let me simply say one i enjoyed the most is the 
economic recovery 
when i came here for almost half a century the debate on the 
capitol hill in the congress had always been between more big 
spending programs more power for the federal government more 
intervention in private affairs by the federal government as 
against those who were preaching less he said

on a return to his home state senate 
majority leader george j mitchell visited the only precinct that he 
didnt carry in novembers election judging by the reception he 
might win even its votes the next time around 
the tiny bethel chapel in talmadge was filled with half again as 
many adults as voted in the race mitchell lost there 1812 but 
won in the other 672 precincts capturing 81 percent of the 
statewide vote 
i wanted to head up here and find out what i was doing wrong 
mitchell told the gathering in this outpost of rural eastern maine 
mitchell who followed up his election victory by winning the 
threeway majority leaders race last week had written letters to 
talmadge residents inviting them to the meeting he was applauded 
repeatedly inside the church a white wooden building surrounded by 
a mustardseed farm and several people told him they looked forward 
to seeing him running for president 
boy youd never know i only got 12 votes for all that told me 
they voted for me mitchell said 
local citizens said they held nothing against the senator a 
democrat but that his challenger republican jasper s wyman was 
more in tune with the pentecostal communitys beliefs especially on 
abortion wyman is the director of the conservative christian civic 
league of maine 
abortion was the issue here said dawn coffin the pastor who 
welcomed mitchell 
rev coffin in her introduction reminded mitchell that the 
success of majority rule in the united states is the ability to 
listen to the minority thank you for listening to a very small 
minority here she told him 
the toughest questions for mitchell came from talmadge resident 
walter heim he attacked mitchell presidentelect bush and others 
who dont oppose abortion in all instances as being in the same 
league as pimps prostitutes and witches 
mitchell said he opposes federal funding for abortion but was not 
against the supreme courts ruling which gives women the choice he 
told heim it was regrettable that he was associating people of 
different viewpoints with scurrilous characters 
the senator explained that he is a roman catholic but i dont 
know when life begins 
mitchell fielded questions on local issues and the uscanada 
freetrade pact which he opposed in the senate and afterward 
joined the congregation for sandwiches and sweets in a basement 
social hall 
some of the people apologized for heims attack explaining that 
he was not a native of maine heim himself allowed that he was 
impressed by mitchells visit 
he comes here exposing his flank said heim hes quite a 
guy 
mitchell chatted with heim reporting afterward that another 
facet of the encounter had been revealed 
he said i was a private and i always wanted to get an 
officer this was my chance mitchell who was an officer in the 
army counterintelligence corps in the mid1950s said with a laugh 
mitchell said another older man came up and said boy ive 
had a lot of politicians come around before the election but youre 
the first one to come around after the election

college is sifting through a bonanza of presidential baubles 
including the trademark jellybean jar and a cowboy belt buckle 
proclaiming the buckaroo stops here 
president reagan has a deep affection for eureka college and 
remains consistently in touch with us said george hearne the 
colleges president 
the school of 460 students about 20 miles east of peoriairport news 
conference saying the quake which registered 69 on the richter 
scale had extremely grave consequences devastation and grave 
loss of life 
armenian church officials in new york who are in contact with 
people in the region said the death toll may be as high as 70000 
although he had only one working day in new york gorbachev 
said i and my delegation believe that this was a very important 
day 
the highlights of the visit were gorbachevs announcement before 
the un general assembly that he planned a major reduction in 
soviet troop strength over the next three years and his superpower 
luncheon with president reagan and presidentelect bush 
gorbachev the first soviet chief to visit new york in 28 years 
said his un speech and a later reception gave him the opportunity 
to set out our views on the world today and on the prospects 
of the worlds development 
gorbachev called the governors island session with reagan and 
bush a good meeting held in an open and trusting atmosphere 
he said the one word he would use to characterize it was 
continuity and said all parties walked away confident that 
our relations will expand and improve on the basis of cooperation 
on the basis of mutual respect for each others interests 
gorbachev later added i think i would be remiss in my duty if 
i went home without saying how much we are grateful to new yorkers 
for the hospitality and feelings of friendship that they have been 
expressing over these days so to all new yorkers our very warm 
gratitude we value that very much

an attractive new production of aida at the 
metropolitan opera avoids the visual silliness of the two 
productions that arrived before it this one makes dramatic use of 
the stage elevator to change sets 
the opening night of the new aida a met opera guild benefit 
was tastefully conducted by james levine and gloriously sung by 
leona mitchell as aida placido domingo as radames fiorenza 
cossotto as amneris sherrill milnes as aidas father amonasro and 
paul plishka as the high priest 
domingo sounded sterling throughout he surprised this listener 
by taking the optional lower ending not the high c at the end of 
celeste aida 
miss mitchell singing her first aida at the met bloomed into 
full vocal glory in the third act she had longing in her voice in 
o patria mia and some beautiful pianissimos her voice has 
matured marvelously and still has youthful freshness 
in many operas the love music is in the first act before things 
start to go wrong in aida the love music is in act 4 after 
things have gone so wrong that aida and radames are sealed in a 
vault to die their duet was so beautiful that the audience didnt 
immediately break the spell with huge applause at the end of it 
miss cossotto who made her met debut as amneris in 1968 is a 
fine musician using her voice to brilliant advantage her stage 
personality while not flamboyant is striking placing amneris 
royal but hopeless love for radames in the foreground in the first 
two acts miss mitchells more retiring demeanor put aida in the 
background 
milnes was in brilliant voice and form amonasro may be a captive 
but hes full of vitality and vibrant with plans plishka sang with 
admirable authority 
the costumes by dada saligeri were mostly white trimmed with 
gold domingo began a hero in all gold and ended disgraced in a 
dark striped tunic 
some scenes were played near the front of the stage in front of 
a wall with huge bas reliefs of two seated egyptians then this 
would lift for a scene using more of the stage 
the most dramatic theatrical stroke is having amneris room in 
act 2 sink out of sight first soldiers are seen standing on top of 
the set thats descending then a platform for the king and amneris 
is revealed then all the citizenry now joined at ground level by 
the soldiers wait for the triumphal entry scene 
in the final scene the elevator is used again so the audience 
sees aida and radames in the vault and amneris in a temple above 
them 
there is no silly dance in act 1 while radames receives his armor 
and no fight to the death during the triumphal entry scene there is 
a dance there by choreographer rodney griffin of philadelphia 
making his met debut but it isnt silly 
gianni quaranta who is italian and won an academy award in 1987 
for art direction for a room with a view designed the sets 
sonja frisell a native of great britain who was on the staff of la 
scala for 15 years did stage direction 
both making met debuts proved to be stars of the show

the us warplane that crashed into an 
apartment building in west germany killing four people has one of 
the best safety records in the air force inventory 
the a10 thunderbolt ii is an older model groundattack plane 
designed to be highly maneuverable at low speeds and low altitude 
and to carry a lot of bombs and ammunition 
the air force said the crash was the 14th serious socalled 
class a accident since oct 1 when the current fiscal year began 
although it was the first involving an a10 
at the same point in the last fiscal year the service had 
experienced nine class a accidents 
among the 14 accidents recorded since oct 1 have been two 
involving the new b1b bomber one involving a b52 bomber and one 
involving an f16 fighter in spain last monday that killed the 
general in charge of air force personnel in the mediterranean 
the air force says it is impossible to predict what type of 
safety record it will post for the year based on little more than 
one months passage during fiscal 1988 for example the service 
experienced a grim record for its f16 jet fighter and yet finished 
the year by posting one of its best overall safety records in 
history 
nonetheless it is true that our mishap rate has suddenly 
spiked up and we dont know why said one air force official who 
asked not to be identified 
we continue to examine our training procedures maintenance and 
everything else 
wednesdays crash involved an a10 on a training flight that 
inexplicably slammed into an apartment building in remscheid west 
germany killing at least four people injuring dozens of others and 
destroying homes for more than a block 
the a10 is designed to support soldiers on the ground by 
attacking enemy tanks and other highpriority targets the 
thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with the air 
force in 1977 the plane is no longer in production but the air 
force has more than 700 of them in its inventory 
statistically the a10 over time has been the safest fighter or 
attack plane currently in the inventory the aircraft has chalked up 
a major accident rate of less than 4 class a mishaps per 100000 
flying hours over its lifetime which now consists of more than 
175 million flight hours 
a class a mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or 
damage exceeding 500000 to an aircraft 
in the fiscal year ended sept 30 the air force lost three 
a10s for a mishap rate of 137 per 100000 flight hours by 
comparison the a7 had a mishap rate of 604 per 100000 flight 
hours the f16 a rate of 680 per 100000 flight hours and the 
b52 a rate of 204 per 100000 flight hours 
the overall air force rate for the last fiscal year was 163 
serious mishaps per 100000 flying hours representing 55 total 
accidents just slightly worse than the services alltime best of 
153 set in fiscal 1986 
the surge in air force accidents over the past month comes at a 
time when the other military services continue to report stable 
rates 
the navy for example which enjoyed its safest year ever in 
fiscal 1988 is on track toward an even safer year since oct 1 
the navy has experienced only four class a accidents it recorded 37 
in all of fiscal 1988 or more than three per month on average

a new survey shows that overhaul of the federal 
income tax is increasing the bite on corporations which is just 
what congress intended 
one thousand corporations surveyed by tax analysts paid about 7 
billion more into the federal treasury last year than they did in 
1986 when the tax laws underwent major revisions 
the 1000 companies spread out among 49 industries paid an 
average of 2472 percent of their earnings in federal income tax in 
1987 the study found that compares with 2154 percent in 1986 and 
2094 percent the previous year 
three out of four corporations paid a higher rate last year than 
the year before while a portion of the increase is due to higher 
earnings in 1987 most is attributable to the new tax law said tax 
analysts a virginiabased research and publishing organization 
tax reform is working said forrest d marovelli of tax 
analysts more corporations are paying higher taxes fewer are 
avoiding taxes 
a major goal of the 1986 tax overhaul was to shift a greater 
portion of the tax burden from individuals to corporations over 
five years the total shift is expected to be about 125 billion 
the most significant corporate changes enacted were repeal of the 
special treatment of capital gains toughening of the alternative 
minimum tax repeal of the investment tax credit and restructuring 
of depreciation allowances the general corporate tax rate was cut 
from 46 percent to 33 percent which benefited all companies 
however because different types of corporations took advantage 
of different provisions under the old tax law there are significant 
variations in how they are faring under the new law said mark 
starcher of tax analysts 
for example a reduction in longterm accounting provisions more 
than doubled the average tax rate paid by aerospace companies from 
156 percent of earnings to 367 percent the study found on the 
other hand apparel and furniture companies are paying generally 
lower taxes because they have the lower tax rates but lost 
relatively little in the other tax changes 
according to the tax analysts calculations the automobile 
industry paid the lowest tax rate last year a negative 693 
percent while construction was highest at 589 percent both 
situations were exaggerated by special circumstancs marovelli said 
general motors corp the largest us automaker had a onetime 
tax writeoff that made the entire industrys situation look worse 
than it was without gm marovelli said the industry would have 
paid 17 percent 
the high rate on the construction industry reflected the same 
accounting changes that affected the aerospace industry as well as 
a curtailment in use of installment sales which in the past had 
produced a tax savings for that industry 
other industry figures from 1987 included insurance 14 percent 
paper 19 percent drugs 221 percent banking 236 percent 
railroads 239 percent petroleum refining 249 percent lumber 
292 percent textiles 294 percent services 317 percent 
tobacco 331 percent apparel 349 percent commercial printing 
35 percent newspapers 367 percent and retail groceries 371 
percent 
tax analysts bases its calculations on corporate filings with the 
securities and exchange commission 
citizens for tax justice a laborfinanced tax research group 
reached similar conclusions in a study of profitable corporations 
released in september that study concluded the number of profitable 
companies that paid no federal tax was cut by more than half last 
year to 16 and that the 250 companies surveyed paid an average 
of 221 percent

a prisoner being taken to a mental hospital used 
two pieces of beef jerky shaped like a gun muzzle to hold a police 
chief hostage for about 40 minutes before he was subdued while 
praying authorities said 
he was pretty cunning cisco police chief billy rains said 
thursday after the ordeal it felt like a real gun 
rains said he was taken hostage by the prisoner who had once 
been treated as a manicdepressive at the wichita falls state 
hospital wednesday night in the bathroom of an austin service 
station 
rains and eastland county jail administrator john blair had 
stopped at the service station on their way to austin state 
hospital where the 58yearold prisoner was being committed at the 
request of relatives 
however the prisoner who was not handcuffed got into an 
armlock with rains in the gas station bathroom 
he was trying to grab my gun and he told me he had a derringer 
in my back rains said 
but the 22caliber derringer the man claimed to be holding 
turned out to be two rounded pieces of beef jerky one on top of the 
other to simulate a double barrel covered with a bread wrapper 
rains said 
at first rains said he didnt believe the prisoner had a gun 
but then he said i felt something else in his hand i couldnt 
tell what it was 
the man who works as a truck driver is a gun enthusiast and 
does own a derringer rains said 
blair rushed to assist rains after his call for help but was held 
at bay by the prisoner who stood behind the police chief 
we just simply didnt know for sure and it wasnt the time to 
take a gamble blair said 
while blair and rains attempted to calm the prisoner an austin 
police department hostage negotiator and special mission team were 
called to surround the bathroom 
the man who was not identified by police attempted during the 
40minute standoff to convince the officers he did not need to go to 
the state hospital 
he was trying to convince us that god was going to cure his 
mental illness blair said 
blair and two austin officers finally subdued the man after he 
dropped to his knees and began praying 
no charges had been filed thursday against the prisoner who was 
transported to the state hospital after surrendering an austin 
police spokesman said 
rains said he may ask eastland county district attorney bill 
dowell to file charges against the man 
had he had a real gun he probably would have shot me in the 
back rains said

the name of nebraska gov kay orr is among the 
latest to surface on a long list of candidates to be secretary of 
agriculture in the bush administration according to some farm 
organization officials 
us trade representative clayton yeutter once a favorite in the 
usda guessing game has indicated he will return to the private 
sector when president reagan leaves office next month because of 
that decision there does not appear to be a frontrunner for the 
agriculture post 
according to one source who demanded anonymity yeutter may have 
changed his mind after bush named carla hills as white house trade 
representative she is a veteran washington insider but has little 
handson agricultural experience 
but the source said thursday that yeutter might be persuaded to 
take the usda and help with agriculturerelated issues during 
difficult times still ahead in multinational trade negotiations 
under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
john lewis a washington spokesman for the american farm bureau 
federation said he sees no clear favorite among the dozen or so 
names that have been mentioned for the usda post 
i think the bag is so full now there isnt any more room for 
new names lewis said 
among those believed to be in the running are robert delano a 
virginia farmer and former federation president and dean kleckner 
its current chief 
asked about the possibility bush might name a woman to head the 
department which traditionally has had men in all but a few senior 
positions lewis said he had heard orr mentioned as a candidate 
it would certainly be a very interesting appointment lewis 
said in a telephone interview in the eyes of some people it 
might even be revolutionary personally i think it would be 
refreshing but im not sure its the time or place i dont know 
a second nebraska republican rep virginia smith also has been 
mentioned for the usda post a seventerm veteran of congress smith 
is the ranking gop member of the house appropriations subcommittee 
for agriculture 
cheryl cook a spokeswoman for the national farmers union here 
said she had not heard either woman mentioned for the job but added 
we could do a lot worse than either virginia smith or kay orr 
thats for sure 
cook said she thought bushs choice would be someone who 
listens to his boss and follows the path set by the 1985 farm law 
and reagan administration policy calling for reduced federal support 
for farmers and subsidies for commodity exports at levels below the 
cost of production for family farmers 
some of those contacted thursday said missouri farmer peter c 
myers the current deputy secretary to outgoing agriculture 
secretary richard e lyng has come on strong recently as a 
potential successor to lyng and has been gaining support among some 
republicans on capitol hill 
rep tom coleman also of missouri has been in the running too 
along with former iowa rep cooper evans and seymour johnson a 
mississippi soybean farmer 
the list also includes rep charles stenholm a conservative 
texas democrat who gave president reagan a helping hand in some of 
his early congressional budget battles 
another recent addition to the speculation is wayne d angell a 
member of the federal reserves board of governors angell a 
kansan has a long background in banking and family agriculture 
ellen haas executive director of public voice for food and 
health policy said her favorite would be yeutter because of what 
she termed his very strong consumer record 
but she added the direction this bush administration will go 
is not likely to be proconsumer from the trend of the appointments 
so far probably it will be more centrist 
environmental and conservation advocates are sitting well no 
matter who bush puts in charge of usda says robert j gray policy 
director for the american farmland trust 
gray said he would like to see myers get promoted to the top job 
because of his record during the reagan years as a supporter of 
sound conservation policies including the conservation reserve 
program established by congress in the 1985 farm law 
that programs goal is to take up to 45 million acres of highly 
erodible cropland from production by 1990 and protect it for 10 
years by planting grass and trees more than half the goal has been 
met 
but gray said he expected the program will be continued 
regardless of whom bush taps to head the department

the coast guard in deciding to close two of 
its largest shiptraffic control centers failed to consider safety 
and environmental factors and incorrectly estimated the cost 
savings a government study has concluded 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
said economics was the main reason for closing the facilities known 
as vessel traffic services in new york and new orleans harbors yet 
because of incomplete recordkeeping the coast guard was not sure 
how much money it actually would save 
because the coast guard did not consider such information it 
does not know if it made the correct decision in closing the new 
york and new orleans facilities two of the three largest in terms 
of vessel activity said the report 
the gao said the closings will save about 35 million mainly 
due to lower personnel costs that is 228000 more than the coast 
guard itself had estimated 
the shiptraffic control facilities are similar to air traffic 
control systems they use a combination of radar radio and 
closedcircuit cameras to monitor vessel traffic in waters where the 
possibility of accidents is high 
the cuts were part of a plan to pare 1060 military and civilian 
jobs nationwide in the coast guard and save the government about 48 
million the new york facilities on governors island was closed last 
july while new orleans was decommissioned in march 
the coast guard chose new york and new orleans because they would 
take less time to close and because it believed it could close the 
new york and new orleans vtss with a minimum of public 
resistance the report said 
new orleans is the nations busiest harbor handling more than 
212000 vessels in fiscal 1987 while new york is the third busiest 
with traffic of about 157000 vessels in the same period 
the report criticized the coast guard for failing to consider a 
number of relevant factors in the closings including prevention 
of accidents and fatalities and protection of the environment 
through prevention of oil spills and accidents involving hazardous 
cargoes 
although it took issue with the methods used by the coast guard 
in reaching the closure decision the gao did not specifically say 
the closures were a mistake

a jewish group and a congressman say a justice 
department decision to allow some soviet jews into the united states 
under parole status rather than as refugees sends the wrong signal 
to moscow 
another jewish organization however said attorney general dick 
thornburghs decision thursday to grant parole status to as many as 
2000 soviet emigres a month is a welcome step 
in order to receive refugee status a person has to show a 
wellfounded fear of persecution 
granting parole instead of refugee status sends an incorrect 
message that jews are not being persecuted in the soviet union 
said rep charles schumer dny a member of the house judiciary 
committees immigration subcommittee 
by denying refugee status to soviet jews its prematurely 
sending a signal that the situation of jews in the soviet union has 
so changed that theyre not being persecuted and that just isnt 
so said karl zukerman executive vice president of the hebrew 
immigrant aid society 
zukerman said those rejected for refugee status are subjected to 
persecution that is indistinguishable from those accepted into 
the united states 
the reagan administration last summer stopped granting automatic 
political refugee status to soviet jews and other soviet citizens 
it said budget concerns were largely responsible for the change 
those paroled into the united states must pay their own way 
while transportation and resettlement costs for refugees are paid in 
part by the government 
the state department told the hebrew immigrant aid society that 
it will have about 27 million available during fiscal 1989 to pay 
for transporting only 12000 soviet jews said zukerman 
being paroled into the country is less desirable than being a 
refugee because it doesnt entitle an immigrant to become a legal 
resident or to seek us citizenship 
jewish organizations say 173 soviet jews have been denied refugee 
status by us officials in rome since september the organizations 
also say a growing number of other jews seeking visas from the us 
embassy in moscow have been told to expect delays of a year or more 
to relieve some of the pressure thornburgh said he would parole 
up to 2000 soviet emigres a month into the united states 
thornburgh also ordered immigration and naturalization service 
commissioner alan nelson to temporarily transfer a russianspeaking 
ins officer to the us embassy in moscow to handle refugee 
applications rather than waiting until early january when the 
quarterly process normally begins 
thornburghs announcement and especially his order to resume 
processing refugees in moscow is a welcome signal said a 
statement issued by the union of councils for soviet jews 
protests concerning the recent treatment of soviet jews by the 
ins are finally being addressed 
the group said however that without further clarification 
his response is inadequate granting parole status ignores 
us human rights policy and the long history of soviet antisemitic 
repression of jews 
thornburgh also said he has asked as part of a longerterm 
solution that the justice departments office of legislative 
affairs work with the state department in developing a legislative 
proposal to resolve the problem

president reagan defending the us refusal to 
allow plo chairman yasser arafat to speak to the united nations in 
new york says the arab leader hasnt yet clearly recognized israel 
we are willing to meet with him and talk with him and im 
sure the israelis would be when once and for all it is clearcut 
that he is ready to recognize israels right to be a nation 
reagan said thursday in a nationally televised news conference 
the president said arafats statement wednesday in stockholm 
that the palestine liberation organization accepts israel and 
rejects terrorism in all its forms was ambiguous 
he has left openings for himself where he can deny that he 
meant this or meant that that sounded so cleancut reagan said 
you could quote to him oh you said this but hes still in 
a position to say well yes but wait a minute i also said this 
and then you find that the second this kind of reduces or 
nullifies the first this 
the united states has said it will not deal directly with the plo 
until it explicitly recognizes israels right to exist and renounces 
terrorism 
in a nov 15 declaration in algeria the plos parliament did not 
specifically recognize israels right to exist although it accepted 
three un resolutions that do so 
and it did not directly renounce terrorism although it commited 
the plo to the cairo declaration of 1985 which limits attacks 
to military targets in israel 
israel has rejected the nov 15 declaration by the palestine 
national council as doubletalk

president reagan says the united states 
eventually will have to negotiate with iran to gain the release of 
american hostages held in lebanon but insisted the us government 
would not consider paying any kind of ransom 
were looking at every channel that we can find to try and get 
them and i imagine that the ultimate is going to have to be somehow 
a negotiation with iran because they have control of those 
people he told a news conference thursday 
we are hopeful that there can be avenues that would open for 
the release of the hostages he said we cannot enter into 
negotiating in the sense of what kind of ransom to pay or you are 
just encouraging more hostagetaking 
and in perhaps his last white house news conference reagan 
repeated that he did not believe his administration was bargaining 
with terrorists when it entered into the irancontra affair 
we were not negotiating with them in the socalled irancontra 
affair at all we were heeding a plea from some individuals and 
these people were among those who were planning ahead to have a 
government after the death of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
khomeini remains the spiritual head of iran 
reagan said he would be willing to negotiate with tehran with 
which washington has had no formal diplomatic ties since the 197981 
hostage crisis 
there are conditions that have to be met also there anytime 
that they are ready to come forward on an open basis we would be 
ready to talk to them reagan said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater speaking to reporters 
immediately after the news conference said reagan was not referring 
to any new circumstances under which the united states would 
negotiate with iran saying the terms that reagan alluded to are 
the same conditions that weve been talking about all along 
we have said that there would have to be authoritative 
representatives of the government of iran to negotiate with and 
that they would have to acknowledge this publicly fitzwater 
said 
well be glad to talk but weve never been able to get them to 
do that the spokesman said 
fitzwater said that releasing us hostages held captive in 
lebanon by proiranian elements was not a precondition to 
discussions with tehran 
anita stockman a state department spokeswoman also said that 
the administration has always maintained that we are prepared to 
talk with the iranians if it is somebody that is serious and 
somebody in authority 
we have extended an invitation to meet in a serious setting 
and have not gotten any response to that she said we have 
maintained all along that any one with influence with the 
kidnappers and that includes the iranians should use it to win 
their freedom 
the state departments office for counterterrorism says that as 
of oct 5 1988 15 foreign hostages remain in lebanon nine 
americans three britons an irishman an italian and a belgian

here is the transcript of president reagans 
news conference thursday night 
president reagan weve got to stop meeting like this well as 
most of you know president gorbachev has had to return to the 
soviet union due to the enormity of the tragedy in armenia and in a 
phone conversation this morning i conveyed to him the deep sympathy 
of the american people and our anxiousness to provide any 
humanitarian assistance we possibly can 
the nature of president gorbachevs departure is unfortunate and 
provides a sad final note to what has been an otherwise successful 
and i use the next words advisedly happy and historic visit to the 
united states 
it was in this spirit that yesterday at lunch i presented mr 
gorbachev a memento of our first meeting an inscribed photo of the 
walk we took together in geneva in 1985 the inscription read 
simply we have walked a long way together to clear a path for 
peace 
and so we have it was exactly one year ago today that an event 
here in this room spoke to the epochmaking nature of what has been 
achieved the signing of the first treaty to eliminate an entire 
class of us and soviet nuclear missiles 
even in the short year since then weve had the moscow summit and 
mr gorbachevs visit here in our negotiating agenda of regional 
conflicts human rights bilateral exchanges and arms reductions 
weve seen a serious movement and even some breakthroughs and 
yesterdays address to the united nations by president gorbachev was 
not only a part of this process it was the result of this process 
and i congratulate him on it 
on a personal note nancy and i were delighted that the 
gorbachevs extended an invitation for us to visit moscow and as we 
have done before each of us expressed the hope that they would 
visit us in california 
so the path remains open and the pace of peace continues as i 
said yesterday this means our responsibilities have grown not less 
but more serious we must remain resolute and without illusion and 
we must speak candidly about fundamental points of difference we 
must especially maintain our military strength but we must also 
continue our course of vigorous diplomatic engagement 
i cannot tonight attempt to put all these events in perspective 
or still less to claim credit for any person or administration let 
it be enough to say this that since 1985 extraordinary things have 
happened and nothing more extraordinary than the sight yesterday of 
a president of the united states and a future president of the 
united states and a president of the soviet union standing 
together in new york harbor under the protective gaze of the statue 
of liberty 
our hope our prayer remains the same as that heard on the lips 
of so many millions who looked up once as we did yesterday to see 
the outstretched lamp of liberty and who felt for the first time 
its warmth and glow a prayer that someday freedom will light the 
world and become the blessing and birthright of every people 
everywhere 
and helen you have the first question

question the world is applauding the initiative that the new 
detente that you and president gorbachev have initiated but on the 
debit side as you leave office the nation is saddled with a 26 
trillion debt an enormous deficit caused perhaps by the tripling 
of military spending and tax cuts how does all this jibe with the 
goals that you set eight years ago and id like to follow up 
answer helen i have to tell you it is incorrect to say that 
all of this happened because we cut taxes and the things that have 
happened in these last few years i have said many times and 
pointed out that over 58 years in which the opposing party held 
the house of representatives 54 of those 58 years and in those 
years there were only eight scattered years in which there was a 
balanced budget 
and i was among a great chorus out on the hustings speaking out 
against this consistent and constant deficit spending and each 
time the answer came back that it was necessary to maintain 
prosperity and the other part of the answer was and its 
meaningless because we owe it to ourselves now beginning in 
1965 in the middle 60s when the when president johnsons 
program of the war on poverty was put in place in the 15 years from 
then until 1980 the budget increased just about five times what it 
had been 15 years before and the deficit increased to 58 times what 
it had been so we came in inheriting literally deficit spending 
built into the structure of government 
now with regard to the tax cuts yes the rates were cut but 
since 1981 our revenue from those taxes has increased by 375 
billion and our projection and weve been very accurate on our 
projections our projection for 1990 and the budget were working 
on now calls for another 80 billion increase in our revenues with 
the rates as they presently are 
if you look back beyond us to coolidge and his tax cuts if 
youll look to the kennedy tax cut in his administration which was 
very similar to the one that we later put in in every case it did 
not reduce the government revenues it raised them so it is 
maintaining this and continuing to get back to a reduced spending 
because the spending increase while the revenue was increasing 375 
billion the spending increase was close to 100 billion more than 
that increase in revenues 
q mr president some of your former associates claim that you 
deliberately created a larger deficit in order to dismantle the 
compassionate social programs for the poor the sick the needy the 
handicapped the elderly which you didnt like is that true 
a no helen it is not true and that is i guess political 
propaganda also actually the reductions that we have made have not 
been made in the actual basic spending i have cut the increases 
that were asked for but also we have taken action to vastly 
improve the business management of government when i came here 
there was a program one program i found out about it when i was 
governor a program in which the administrative overhead was so 
great that it cost 2 to deliver 1 to a needy person 
now this is the thing one of the things that weve been trying 
to correct but actually there has been an ongoing increase in 
college the aid to college students there has been an ongoing 
increase in housing with all of the talk about the need for housing 
that has been increased and i could go on about all the other 
programs that they have weve simply tried to keep the increase 
from being as much as was being asked for and actually our defense 
spending and what we asked for regardless of the cuts that were 
then made in it the ones that i asked for the annual budgets for 
defense were less than the projected budgets necessary for defense 
for five years the five years that president carter had projected 
ahead of what was going to be needed for defense and he projected 
more than we asked for

q mr president mr gorbachev yesterday announced a major 
cutback in soviet troop strength and he talked generally about 
nations relying less on military might do you think that mr 
gorbachev is trying to remake the soviet union into a less 
threatening country 
a yes i do and i think he recognizes that their massive 
buildup has been responsible for the great economic crisis that he 
faces there in the soviet union and yes he has proposed this but 
even so there still will be room for some negotiations on arms 
because this still leaves them with a superiority in the amount of 
conventional weapons that they have 
q mr president if i may follow up aside from the conventional 
forces where the soviets do retain this advantage is there an area 
where the united states might be able to make a unilateral cutback 
in arms itself 
a well were still way below them in that but we have 
announced our willingness to continue and to well before he ever 
made this move and were very grateful for this i appreciate it 
very much but we have proposed that the next negotiations with 
regard to military and between us should be in the area of 
conventional weapons 
q mr president george bush has been receiving advice on all 
fronts it seems to raise taxes i wondered if you think he can 
hold the line and not raise taxes for a full four years and if he 
should cave in and raise them would you be deeply disappointed in 
him 
a yeah i would be deeply disappointed and i dont think its 
going to happen because i think he is aware as i am that rates 
reduced actually increase the economic growth of the country and 
provide an incentive for more earnings today the top 5 percent of 
earners when i hear these people start talking about the upper 
levels of income the top 5 percent of earners in this country at 
this much lower rate of taxation are paying a bigger share of the 
total revenue from the income tax than they were paying before at 
the higher rates because theres now an incentive to go out and not 
look for tax shelters and so forth 
q sir if i could follow up do you really feel its possible 
simply to grow out of the deficit or is it necessary if youre 
not going to raise taxes to cut social security benefits and 
medicare benefits

a we dont have to touch social security and we dont have to 
have taxes we have as ive said we are were on a line right 
now that is bringing the deficit down there was no way anyone 
could ever pull the rug out and have the deficit solved in one year 
but the deficit will be reduced down under the grammrudman scale 
that were following to 100 billion and by 1993 the budget will 
be balanced if we continue observing this thing 
andrea 
q mr president this is your final news conference with us you 
say and at your first news conference you said that the soviets 
would commit any crime would lie would cheat would steal to 
achieve their political goals now tonight you are celebrating 
your joint progress with president gorbachev and celebrating a 
speech in which he renounced the use of force by the soviet union to 
achieve foreign policy goals do you think that he has really 
changed and to the extent that he has changed have you changed 
what have you learned over these eight years that may have changed 
your view of the soviet system 
a i know so many of you quoted this in that first press 
conference of mine and sam i think it was your question 
q she stole my question 
a yes but none of you ever thought to give the complete 
answer i said in their own words this was their philosophy and 
it was in writing that there was no crime all of these things were 
not a crime if they advanced the cause of socialism now i didnt 
make that up thats what they said i think theres been a change 
that was four leaders back before this one and i think there have 
been some changes i one we just talked about earlier of his cut 
in armaments 
q mr president to follow up what about the changes in your 
own thinking granted that they have changed and that mr gorbachev 
is a very different kind of soviet leader but do you think in any 
way that your previous views might have been rigid or poorly formed 
a well andrea there were differences in these leaders and 
there is a situation now where many of the things that theyve 
preached have been proven unsound and thats why their economy is in 
such great trouble but i must say i have never met with one of 
those leaders that was comparable to this man or had the approach 
that he has but he knows that i feel that that well we put it 
this way as ive said my philosophy is trust everybody but cut 
the cards 
q i was going to ask that but let me just now ask you whats 
the toughest thing that youve had in your job whats been the 
toughest part of these eight years and i have a followup 
a laughter you realize how much time youre stealing with 
these followups away from others that want to ask a question 
well there 
q yeah yeah 
a i think there have been many tough things i dont think 
theres anything tougher than to have to order these magnificent 
young men and women in our military today and i think im prouder 
of them than of anything that has happened to have to send them 
into danger to order them to go some place where their lives are 
threatened and their lives are taken thats got to be something 
that any president would hesitate on and i have to say was the 
greatest burden

q all right let me ask the other side then what have you 
enjoyed most what is the thing youre going to miss the most 
a well there are a number of things to miss but let me i 
dont want to get into a lecture here let me just simply say on 
enjoyed the most is the economic recovery when i came here for 
almost half a century the debate on the hill in the congress had 
always been between more big spending programs more power for the 
federal government more intervention in private affairs by the 
federal government as against those who were preaching less 
well now today and for a long time the very question that was 
asked here about the deficit the argument on the hill today is not 
more spending the argument is how best can we reduce the deficit 
q comment personally sir i mean personally as president 
a well i appreciate very much the fact of being a party to this 
economic recovery we were in a disaster situation when we came here 
trude 
q mr president until recently the united states has been 
reluctant for the soviet union to play a significant role in the 
middle east but now with mr gorbachevs new cooperation or 
openness how do you suppose you could use him to expedite the peace 
process 
a well i think that once again here were going to have to see 
whether this is still acceptable to the parties that are to be 
involved in the direct negotiations actually we talk an 
international gathering or something but the middle east which is 
still technically in a state of war that must be resolved between 
the nations of the middle east in direct negotiations and if we can 
help bring that about then i would welcome anyone who wants to help 
q in light of his speech yesterday at the un are there any 
new steps that we can take to reduce the to continue the arms 
reduction process 
a oh yes i we have long said that as soon as we once settle 
this issue of the start agreement i have said that i think our next 
goal must be to now engage in negotiations on reducing conventional 
weapons 
q mr president one question and no followups laughter 
a this man deserves a hand laughter 
q now that youre leaving the white house or will soon what is 
going to become of the contras the resistance forces in nicaragua 
without you here as their champion and do you have a commitment 
from presidentelect bush to carry on the same policy line that you 
have for supporting the nicaraguan resistance 
a jerry obviously i do not try to pin him down he is the 
presidentelect and he will be the president when he takes over but 
i do believe knowing him and what he and our association together 
for all these years i believe that he agrees with me that the 
contras are freedom fighters and they are trying to achieve 
democracy in their country which is now a communist totalitarian 
government

q mr president youve made a career lately of using an old 
russian proverb trust but verify but given that verification 
can never be 100 percent science given that there are always a few 
percentage points where you just cant be sure do you trust general 
secretary gorbachev for those few points 
a well ive said right now with regard to the inf treaty we 
have worked out verification provisions that are greater than 
anything that has ever been done before between us and i think that 
there is a reasonable chance that a very reasonable chance that 
we can continue to have that kind of verification 
one of the first things that i talked over with mr gorbachev in 
geneva when we first met was that i said to him we both didnt have 
great military pauses well how did i say it chuckles put 
it that we that we didnt mistrust each other because of our great 
military we had our military because we mistrusted each other and 
that our negotiations should be aimed at removing the causes of 
mistrust and i have to say its pretty much followed that pattern 
q well what i want to know is do you trust gorbachev 
a he hasnt shown me any reason yet that i shouldnt but 
again as ive said thats why i kept referring to doveryai no 
proveryai trust but verify and he knows that and thats 
neither one of us i dont i dont think that he would gamble on 
believing that he shouldnt protect his own interests also 
q mr president at your meeting with mr gorbachev yesterday 
you toasted the things that he and vice president bush will 
accomplish you spoke this evening about the grave economic crisis 
that mr gorbachev faces what is the us assessment of his 
longterm chances for political survival 
a well i realize and i think we all should that he is 
battling a bureaucracy because whether its a russian bureaucracy 
or one of our own the first rule of bureaucracy is protect the 
bureaucracy and it would mean some great changes for some of the 
nomenklatura as they call their bureaucracy there if he 
institutes the reforms that hes talking about but on the plus 
side for him its very evident that the people of the soviet union 
are on his side they want this this perestroika and this glasnost 
that he has talked about very much and i have to believe that the 
nomenklatura is going to have to think twice with regard to how far 
they would go in trying to block him when the man in the street over 
there wants the things that have been seen 
let me go over here for a minute ive been kind of onesided 
q mr president you could help mr gorbachev in clearing up a 
domestic political problem that is afghanistan how to pull out 
of there with honor he suggested at the un yesterday an inplace 
ceasefire a cessation of outside military aid some people think 
this could lead to a partition of afghanistan whats wrong with 
that it would save lives it would help mr gorbachev

a well theres one thing if were talking about disarming the 
mujahadeen remember that there is still a military force in 
afghanistan that was organized by the puppet government established 
by the soviet union and they are a force that has been fighting 
along with the soviet and side by side against the mujahadeen if 
you want to get around to disarming both sides you cant suddenly 
disarm the mujahadeen and leave them at the mercy of this already 
military management 
q but mr gorbachev proposed at the un yesterday sending in a 
un peacekeeping force just to do this 
a well youd have to take up with the un i this is 
something rather exceptional that hes asking on that and im not 
sure that the un would like that or that the un is prepared to 
do such a thing 
q what would you like 
a i think that the weve got to recognize that if the afghan 
people are going to be able to state and create the government they 
want then that puppet government has got to be ready and willing to 
step down and not have some kind of a compromise thing in which it 
remains as a government with compromising with the others lets 
let them start from scratch and build the government they want 
q mr president let me bring you back to the middle east 
youve got very little time left and mr arafat of the plo seems 
to be inching towards the kind of conditions you and mr shultz have 
said he should isnt this perhaps not time to go the inch in his 
direction and start some kind of talks with mr arafat rather than 
as mr shultz did close the door on him 
a no weve been watching very closely and for example weve 
thought in the last few days that there was a statement that came 
out of that meeting in sweden that appeared to be cleancut and not 
with the things around the edge that then diffused what seemed to be 
a pledge but we had to wait until his press conference and what he 
said and i have to say that again he has left openings for 
himself where he can deny that he meant this or meant that that 
sounded so cleancut its up to him we are willing to meet with 
him and talk with him and im sure the israelis would be when 
once and for all it is clearcut that he is ready to recognize 
israels right to be a nation that he is ready to negotiate on 
behalf of the palestinian people for a homeland for them and so 
forth and this is all 
now the thing about george shultzs decision id like to call 
to your attention there is a law passed by the congress with 
regard to the conditions for granting a waiver to someone to come in 
and meet with the united nations or participate in what theyre 
doing and there is no way under that law that mr arafat qualifies 
as yet and the day that he does and it is clearcut then he we 
can grant that visa but as i say he is barred by the terms of that 
law and the only way that the and the secretary of state has full 
power under that law its his decision to make and he can only 
grant a waiver if an individual meets certain requirements and 
arafat doesnt

q well to follow up and be just as clearcut did he not in 
his statement say that he accepts the un articles and that he 
recognizes israel what is the fine line that he hasnt crossed 
a what were still analyzing is then as he went on other 
things in which its a case and this has happened before certainly 
with the same individual you could quote to him oh you said this 
but hes still in a position to say well yes but wait a minute i 
also said this and then you find that the second this kind of 
reduces or nullifies the first this 
q in your opening statement you made reference to our military 
strength sir a principal element of this nations strength is our 
nuclear deterrent and during your administration sir numerous 
nuclear production plants have been allowed to decay including 
plants that produce plutonium and tritium sir what have you 
directed your aides to do about the problem and how serious is the 
threat particularly since there are plants now in colorado and 
south carolina which have not been allowed to reopen due to safety 
problems 
a and we have made it very plain that we will not allow those 
plants to reopen until they meet the requirements and constitute no 
danger to the citizens of this country and that it just has to be 
that cold turkey now i dont think that we can be blamed for the 
deterioration that certainly began long before we were here 
q mr president if i could follow up isnt it true that you 
have left presidentelect bush a tremendous financial and national 
security challenge not only in getting these plants back in 
operating order but also in devising ways that we can dispose of 
our nuclear waste 
a no we are working on that and we have been and weve made 
more progress than i think were given credit for on that and hell 
have to continue were doing those things and i dont think that 
the problems are all money 
bill 
q mr president do you have any reason to believe that the 
american hostages who are still being held in the middle east will 
be released after you leave office 
a i dont think that anyone that takes over this office is going 
to give in nor did i it is that is again one of those things i 
should have said to your question bill that it that you go to bed 
with every night and we are hopeful that there can be avenues that 
would open we cannot enter into negotiating in the sense of what 
kind of ransom to pay or youre just encouraging more 
hostagetaking but there are other channels were not advocating 
that any individual as some have take it upon themselves to try to 
get them out but were looking at every channel that we can find to 
try and get them and i imagine that the ultimate is going to have 
to be somehow a negotiation with iran because they have control of 
those people

q so you would be willing to do this negotiation with iran 
sir is that right either now or before you leave office or after 
mr bush takes over you are willing to negotiate with iran over the 
hostages 
a there have got to be some changes there too we were not 
negotiating with them on the socalled irancontra affair at all 
we were heeding a plea from some individuals at that time all of 
you were kind of heralding the day in the media that was going to 
come within a week that the ayatollah would no longer be the head of 
government because of his health and these people were among those 
who were planning ahead to have a government 
q are you going to do it now 
a what 
q are you going to do it now sir 
a there are things conditions that have to be met also there 
any time that they are ready to come forward on an open basis we 
would be ready to talk to them 
q the united states and the soviet union were once allies during 
world war ii do you see that the beginning that have been made here 
with you and mr gorbachev resulting in a situation where we would 
once more count the soviet union as an ally and have a free and open 
trade with them on a largescale basis 
a i think that is all dependent on them if it can be definitely 
established that they no longer are following the expansionist 
policy of that was instituted in the communist revolution that 
their goal must be a oneworld communist state now if that has 
definitely been given up and certainly there are indications that 
we could see that we can anticipate bringing such a thing about 
then i do think that there is evidence that they dont like being 
the pariah that they might want to join the family of nations and 
join them with the idea of bringing about or establishing peace 
q is that something you want sir 
a yes one of the first things that i ever told him when we met 
i said there are two of us here in this room just two men and 
i said we its a unique situation between us we have the 
power to start world war iii or between us we have the power to 
bring peace to the world a lasting peace and apparently weve 
been working in that direction 
q mr president if the soviet union makes good on it and does 
reduce us sic troop strength theres talk on capitol hill that 
perhaps the us can follow suit and in the process reduce our 
defense spending and make an impact on the budget deficit do you 
foresee that as a realistic possibility 
a no if ive i guess i wasnt switching signals here fast 
enough at the very beginning of this are you suggesting that the 
defense spending is 
q if soviet troop posture leads to some cuts on our own and that 
this would help to reduce the deficit people are already looking 
some democrats thinking that this may help us to reduce the deficit 
a well once again i must repeat that cant happen with our 
defense spending until we have reached a parity and at which then 
both sides can continue the reduction of weapons and keeping it at a 
parity but that is not true today they the dropping of 500000 
military personnel still leaves them with five million under arms 
they have they still outnumber us in tanks and artillery weapons 
after they make these cuts so we havent achieved parity but at 
least if he goes through with that and succeeds in that he is 
going to bring it down to a range where i think that he would see 
that we could proceed and continue then mutually reducing arms 
between each other 
the press thank you mr president merry christmas 
the president thank you merry christmas to you all

shoddy construction of adobe brick and 
prefabricated concrete buildings caused the high earthquake death 
toll in soviet armenia a woodpoor republic located where giant 
plates of earths crust collide scientists say 
when they need a new room they just mix up some mud and start 
stacking it brian tucker californias acting state geologist 
said thursday they are not learning the lesson that buildings 
that are just mud fall down 
a similarsized quake in the los angeles area where building 
codes are stringent probably would kill no more than 1000 people 
said tucker who spent two years conducting research east of the 
armenian quakes epicenter 
earthquakes dont kill people buildings do seismologist 
roger bilham of the university of colorado at boulder added during a 
news conference at the american geophysical unions fall meeting 
wednesdays severe quake centered in the caucasus mountains 
region near the sovietturkish border registered 69 on the richter 
scale reports indicate tens of thousands of people died 
its a tragedy for all the people of my country said lev 
zonenshain a soviet institute of oceanology geologist attending the 
geophysics convention 
tucker said many armenian village huts are adobe while buildings 
in cities often are unreinforced masonry or tiltup prefabricated 
structures made of concrete slabs that are simply hooked together 
village homes have thick mud and rock ceilings for insulation 
in winter and they kill when they collapse tucker said 
while urban armenian construction practices have improved 
somewhat they are still not up to california building codes he 
added 
zonenshain agreed that many urban armenian buildings are 
unreinforced and said they are built from stony blocks of volcanic 
material 
armenia lacks enough trees for widespread use of wood buildings 
which better withstand quakes said us geological survey scientist 
bob hamilton president of the geophysical unions seismology 
section 
a 69 earthquake that is shallow in the crust in that part of 
the world often does a lot of damage because of the nature of the 
construction he said 
soviet scientists were aware of the threat of major quakes in the 
region between the black and caspian seas but many of their studies 
suggesting which areas are most vulnerable are not made known to 
the authorities or judged by any councils of scientists said 
george purcaru of the institute of meteorology and geophysics in 
frankfurt west germany 
zonenshain denied the allegation saying we have special 
councils organized for quake prediction and they have power to 
tell authorities to improve construction practices 
bilham said the caucasus mountains were created by the collision 
of the eurasian plate of earths crust on the north and the arabian 
plate on the south the quake occurred along the boundary of the 
eurasian plate and a microplate crunched in between the two 
giant plates he said the boundary also underlies parts of iran and 
turkey 
in 1667 a major quake killed an estimated 80000 people in the 
caucasus mountains region bilham said 
that jolts magnitude was between 7 and 75 and great quakes 
measuring about 8 on the richter scale rock the region roughly every 
1000 years so 69 is not a very big earthquake for that 
region purcaru said 
zonenshain said the epicenter of wednesdays quake was in an area 
known as a seismic gap which had a lull in major quake activity 
for about the last 50 years seismic gaps are where the lack of 
quakes lets stress build up on faults making the area more likely 
to experience a big quake 
they may have been complacent in the last 50 years because they 
didnt have big earthquakes in that period said seismologist 
mansour niazi a native iranian and seismologist at lawrence 
berkeley laboratory 
purcaru said the jolt probably was caused by thrust or 
dipslip motion in which compression by the plates makes ground 
on one side of a fault move upward over ground on the other side 
similar quakes included the 64magnitude san fernando quake in 
los angeles in 1971 which state officials say killed at least 58 
people and last years 59magnitude whittier narrows quake which 
with its aftershocks killed eight southern californians

israeli warplanes blasted guerrilla 
positions friday in hills overlooking this coastal town near beirut 
as they tried to rescue trapped paratroopers who landed by 
helicopter before dawn police said 
they said at least one israeli soldier was killed and two others 
wounded in a clash between the israeli landing party and guerrillas 
of a prosyrian palestinian faction and a leftist lebanese group 
other israeli troops have been captured but we do not know 
their number yet it seems the israelis are surrounded said a 
police officer in naameh he cannot be named under standing rules 
there was no immediate confirmation from israels military 
command which usually issues its communiques only after its 
operation has been completed 
gunboats cruised off naameh as five helicopter gunships hovered 
overhead apparently waiting to evacuate the israeli commandos who 
landed on naamehs bluffs at 210 am the spokesman said 
eight fighterbombers thundered in from the clear mediterranean 
sky at dayrteak to blast hilltop targets east of naameh in 15 
bombing sorties police said 
they are attacking roughly at 15minute intervals obviously 
trying to help break the noose around their trapped paratroopers in 
the naameh hills the spokesman said 
the assault began at 640 am black smoke billowed from stricken 
targets perched in olive groves above naameh police said 
naameh is nine miles south of beirut and 16 miles north of sidon 
provincial capital of south lebanon ambulances were dispatched from 
both cities after the attack 
the area is controlled by the syrianbacked popular front for the 
liberation of palestinegeneral command and leftist militiamen of 
druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive socialist party 
many cars were seen speeding out with honking horns from the 
stricken bluffs to the coastal highway linking beirut and sidon 
they were believed rushing casualties to hospitals in both cities 
distant thuds of explosions could be heard in beirut as the 
planes staged israels 24th air raid on lebanon this year 
fighters of the popular front and their druse allies unleashed a 
screen of shoulderfired sam7 missiles known as strellas against 
the raiding jets but no hits were scored police said 
they said israeli pilots released hot air balloons to deflect the 
heatseeking missiles 
the popular front headed by former syrian army capt ahmed 
jibril is armed by syria and funded by libya it is at odds with 
yasser arafats mainstream palestine liberation organiztion 
dozens of guerrillas and militiamen all toting shoulderfired 
rocket propelled grenades were seen running to positions along 
naamehs beach as five israeli helicopter gunships hovered opposite 
the coastal town at 815 am 
theyre going to land troops one guerrilla was heard 
shouting as he raced to the beachstrip 
panicky shopkeepers hurriedly lowered their shutters as hundreds 
of naameh residents scurried to take shelter in basements 
at least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in israels 23 
previous air raids on lebanon since jan 3

the writer traveled to cuba to cover the visit of 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev which was canceled 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at a small park near the seashore ofelia espinosa 
says sales at her newsstand of soviet magazines were negligible two 
years ago 
now she says she prepares for a stampede whenever certain 
soviet publications translated into spanish arrive particularly the 
monthly sputnik and the weekly news of moscow 
the difference between now and two years ago is glasnost 
president mikhail gorbachevs experiment with allowing open debate 
on issues once rarely discussed outside kremlin walls 
glasnost has helped boost sales for ms espinosa she says she 
gets about 60 copies each of the two magazines per delivery 
theyre gone in about five minutes she says recalling the time 
not long ago when the same publications were discarded for lack of 
buyers 
today was to have been the day gorbachev began a threeday visit 
to cuba offering an opportunity to measure his appeal among 
ordinary cubans but he cut short his threenation trip thursday and 
rushed back to the soviet union from new york to supervise relief 
efforts in earthquakestricken armenia 
for cubans who sense that marxism is here to stay but who are 
eager for a more flexible system the soviet leader is the most 
promising development in years 
several cubans privately confess their admiration for gorbachev 
they hope for sovietstyle reforms in cuba where outspokenness is 
discouraged and the economy has stagnated for years 
however millions of other cubans appear to have retained their 
allegiance to cuban leader fidel castro who has made no secret of 
his disdain for gorbachevs reforms 
he has left the impression that he is worried the system in place 
for 70 years in the soviet union could unravel under gorbachevs 
leadership 
castro has insisted cuba will never accept any reform that 
reeks of capitalism his inflexible stand has led to speculation 
about a possibly serious sovietcuban rift 
despite the tension cuban authorities had planned for gorbachev 
the grandest reception ever staged for a visiting luminary with a 
projected 500000 lining the parade route 
us and cuban analysts agree that the foundation of sovietcuban 
friendship remains solid castro helps the soviets collect political 
support worldwide and the soviets lavish an estimated 5 billion in 
annual economic aid on cuba 
some westerners however believe the soviet union has been 
dissatisfied with cuban economic performance for years it is not 
known if gorbachev has pressured cuba to impose capitaliststyle 
reforms to revive the cuban economy 
with the postponement of gorbachevs visit the answer probably 
will not be forthcoming for now

demands for new peacekeeping missions could 
force the financially strapped united nations into insolvency in 
1989 according to a report by un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar 
the un chiefs pessimistic assessment was released thursday 
before he left for oslo norway to accept the 1988 nobel peace 
prize on behalf of un peacekeepers worldwide 
the nobel includes a cash prize worth about 390000 but that 
wont make much of a dent in the 4501 million in unpaid dues that 
un members owe the united states owes 3373 million 
un officials havent announced how the award money being 
collected saturday will be used 
on wednesday soviet president mikhail s gorbachev spoke to the 
general assembly and called for a new un peacekeeping force in 
afghanistan to oversee establishment of a broadbased government 
un officials already are drafting plans for a 7500member 
peacekeeping force to monitor southwest africas transition to 
independence plans also are under way to send 2000 peacekeeping 
troops to monitor an independence referendum in western sahara 
perez de cuellar predicted that in 1989 the united nations will 
collect 7793 million but will spend 8039 million ending the 
year with a loss of 246 million 
he based his projections on current payment patterns 
the united nations has yet to leave behind the spectre of the 
financial crisis throughout 1988 the organization has confronted 
the possibility of imminent bankruptcy which it has narrowly 
managed to avoid so far perez de cuellar wrote in the report 
only 79 of the 159 member states had paid all their dues as of 
nov 30 he said of the 80 member states still in arrears 40 
owed more than their 1988 assessments he added 
assuming next years payment patterns are like 1988 the un 
chief said the organization would manage to avoid insolvency but 
only by once again utilizing its reserves to meet cash requirements 
at many points during the year 
the united nations has a contingency reserve fund of about 210 
million that must be replenished as soon as new dues are paid the 
united nations often dips into this fund to start new peacekeeping 
operations or to meet operating costs 
the financial situation of the united nations could rapidly and 
dramatically deteriorate should any additional demands be placed 
upon these depleted reserves to meet the cash requirements for 
existing or new peacekeeping operations the report says 
president reagan said in september that the united states would 
gradually repay all its dues it has withheld money in recent years 
to protest what the reagan administration saw as mismanagement 
overstaffing and an antiwestern bias at the united nations

the earthquake that devastated several cities and 
wiped out villages in soviet armenia may have also doomed priceless 
medieval art and early christian churches in the region an art 
historian said 
that area is full of medieval monuments and churches said 
lucy der manuelian professor of armenian art and architecture at 
tufts university some are over a thousand years old 
wednesdays earthquake destroyed twothirds of leninakan a city 
of 250000 people 30 miles from the epicenter and wiped out the 
nearby village of spitak a soviet tv correspondent said early 
estimates put the death toll at 50000 to 70000 
atop a mountain less than a mile from leninakan is a 7th century 
church called st stepanos which contains rare wall paintings a 
domed church made of rose and browncolored volcanic stone st 
stepanos is a priceless treasure manuelian said 
she fears it may have been destroyed becaues it is so close to 
the quakes center but she said she has not been able to find out 
also within a few miles of leninakan is an 11th century marmashen 
church and a 13th century monastery called harich which has a 
museum that may contain priceless medieval gospel manuscripts 
manuelian said 
across the border from armenia in eastern turkey are the ruins of 
the 9th century capital city of armenia called ani scholars 
believe that citys 10th century cathedral may have been the 
inspiration for romanesque and gothic architecture in western 
europe she said 
armenia was the first country to make christianity its official 
religion in the year 314 manuelian said its early stone churches 
are of special interest because some scholars believe that europeans 
learned the building techniques used on their towering cathedrals 
from the armenians 
the soviets have been spending million of rubles to restore 
these armenian churches manuelian said whatever is destroyed 
of medieval armenian architecture is a terrific loss because the 
ones in turkey arent being taken care of

toshiaki yui of nomura securities said the nikkei rose in spite 
of the waitandsee mood because of lingering bullishness from the 
nikkei index having achieved the 30000point level for the first 
time on wednesday and the rise of the dollar after the soviet 
unions announcement of an arms reduction 
minor stocks have been attracting participants recently which 
is likely to help the market accumulate strength he said 
yui said the nikkei index has been strong because the japanese 
economy is expanding whereas the united states continues to run 
large trade and budget deficits 
volume traded on the markets first section was estimated at 1 
billion shares

a year after the palestinian 
uprising began israeli soldiers believe they are gradually 
regaining control of the streets despite ongoing clashes 
talks with soldiers in both the gaza strip and the west bank 
indicate morale is much improved since the chaotic early days of the 
uprising when thousands of palestinians joined demonstrations 
against israels 21year occupation 
today the best evidence things have changed is that 
confrontations are usually limited to skirmishes with small groups 
of arab youths who appear only long enough to hurl a stone before 
vanishing into the narrow alleyways 
in the beginning we used to face crowds of 5000 people now we 
are dealing with at most about 100 said lt col micha whose 
infantry unit recently returned to this squalid refugee camp of 
70000 
micha recalls that in december 1987 his unit was transferred from 
lebanon and thrust into the riots without training or the necessary 
tools 
we got here and we suddenly had no weapons to use no 
artillery no tanks said micha whose full name was not disclosed 
in keeping with army policy 
we had clubs and they had sticks and we battled like gangs 
officers were simply told to make the situation quiet and there was 
a lot of gray in the orders so every soldier had his own method for 
dealing with the population 
at least 320 palestinians have been killed in the rebellion since 
it began dec 8 1987 in the west bank and gaza strip eleven 
israelis also have been slain and 7000 palestinians wounded during 
the same period 
in recent interviews army commanders attributed the drop in 
large protests to improved crowd control devices such as plastic 
bullets which are less lethal than live ammunition and allow 
soldiers to use rifles more freely 
the army also has developed fendermounted teargas launchers 
rooftop guns that fire rubber bullets hot marbles or gravel and a 
wagon equipped with a scoop to remove roadblocks 
soldiers feel they have an answer there is no longer such 
frustration and feelings of impotence the soldiers feel they 
control the situation said col segev who commands troops in 
nablus the west banks largest town 
taunted by demonstrators who hurled provocative insults as well 
as stones and bottles soldiers sometimes lost control beating 
detainees or smashing houses and cars 
in one case last spring in kfar salem village soldiers used a 
bulldozer to bury alive four palestinians the four were rescued by 
witnesses minutes later 
the army said 45 soldiers have been courtmartialed since last 
december for using excessive force more soldiers have been 
disciplined through less formal trials the army will not say how 
many 
brig gen ehud gross the chief army education officer 
described the number of violations as minor when compared to the 
thousands of soldiers who have been sent to the occupied areas 
israeli newspapers say the army has an average of 10000 troops 
deployed each day in the occupied territories several times the 
preuprising level 
in an interview gross emphasized repeatedly that the army 
believed excessive force would have a boomerang effect 
if we want to bring some tranquility some peace to the area 
the less we create polarization and hatred by revenge the more 
chances there are for better future understanding he said 
the new emphasis on restraint is contained in a twoday course 
instituted recently to prepare soldiers for duty in the occupied 
areas and in a new briefing kit prepared for commanders 
gross said the armys mission was to restore enough order to 
enable the government to make its decisions free from pressure or 
under the least amount of pressure possible 
he claimed the army can cope with the mission and we can 
fulfill it

a former director of the federal reserve bank 
of new york has been indicted on insider trading charges for a 
scheme to leak secret interest rate figures to a nowbankrupt 
brokerage firm 
a federal indictment returned thursday charged former new jersey 
bankers association president robert a rough with conspiracy to 
commit fraud in the first insider trading case involving government 
securities prosecutors said 
it was also the first time in the 75year history of the federal 
reserve that a director has been charged with fraud said samuel a 
alito jr the us attorney for new jersey 
we believe this is an isolated case alito said but we 
will prosecute it vigorously to try to insure it isnt repeated in 
the future 
rough 49 received 47000 in interestdeferred loans from the 
nowdefunct bevill bresler amp schulman inc investment firm in 
exchange for the rate information the indictment charged he was a 
member of the federal reserve bank part of the feds regional 
network from 1982 to 1984 
rough was charged with conspiracy to commit wire and securities 
fraud two counts of bank fraud one count each of wire fraud and 
securities fraud and two counts of making false statements to banks 
he faces 29 years in prison if convicted on all counts and fines 
totaling 141000 alito said 
rough is accused of relaying the information by telephone from 
his executive suite at the national bank of sussex county where he 
served as president and once from the new york feds boardroom just 
after a meeting prosecutors said at a news conference 
bevill bresler made millions of dollars in government securities 
trades based on roughs advance word about decisions made by the 
federal reserve and recommendations offered by the new york fed on 
the discount rate the indictment said 
the discount rate is the interest rate the federal reserve 
charges on loans to commercial banks changes in the discount rate 
can have a strong impact on world financial markets and affect 
interest rates paid by consumers 
roughs attorney michael himmel said rough would enter a plea 
of not guilty and vigorously contest the charges 
roughs home telephone number was unlisted and he could not be 
reached for comment he resigned earlier this year as president of 
the national bank 
the new york fed is one of 12 regional banks in the federal 
reserve system all of which make recommendations every two weeks on 
whether the discount rate should be changed the national federal 
reserve board has the final say in setting the rate 
word that discount rate information had been leaked first 
surfaced in april 1987 prompting the fed to tighten its rules on 
disclosing the rate 
the allegations came to light during the trial of gilbert c 
schulman bevill breslers president on fraud charges after the 
firms 144 million collapse in april 1985 three other principals 
who pleaded guilty in the firms collapse in exchange for their 
cooperation testified about roughs allegedly passing on the 
information 
schulman a longtime friend of roughs is serving an eightyear 
sentence for securities violations 
schulman testified that rough approached him for the 47000 in 
loans which were repaid to buy a chunk of stock in the national 
bank of sussex 
no arraignment date has been set

researchers say simple health care measures could 
save most of the 500 us children who die each year of diarrhea a 
problem rarely considered lifethreatening in this country 
new research suggests that diarrhea accounts for 10 percent of 
all preventable deaths in us youngsters ages 1 month to 4 years 
old said dr meishang ho of the national centers for disease 
control in atlanta 
the key here is early treatment ms ho said in a telephone 
interview thursday 
diarrhea is a common cause of childhood deaths in developing 
countries but such deaths generally are thought to be rare in more 
economically advanced nations 
however ms ho and her colleagues identified 5539 diarrhea 
deaths among youngsters ages 1 month to 4 years nationwide during 
the years 1973 through 1983 
deaths were most common among children younger than 1 year 
blacks and youngsters living in the south the researchers reported 
in todays journal of the american medical association 
thirtyeight percent of the deaths occurred after the child had 
reached a medical facility suggesting either the youngsters got 
help too late or got the wrong treatment ms ho said 
she estimated that 80 percent to 90 percent of the diarrhea 
deaths in the united states could be prevented 
diarrhea can be fatal if it causes severe loss of fluids and 
electrolytes body salts such as sodium and potassium that are 
necessary for normal functioning of nerves and muscles including 
the heart ms ho explained 
lost fluids need to be replaced with electrolyte solutions 
containing glucose a form of sugar she said the solutions can be 
bought readytodrink at grocery and drug stores without 
prescriptions she said 
infants who cant keep the fluids down or who lose more than they 
keep should be taken to a doctor ms ho said 
parents need to be taught the dangers of severe diarrhea she 
said as well as ways to give appropriate fluids when the need 
arises and when to see a doctor if that strategy fails 
it shouldnt be hard to acquire those skills if it is pushed 
by health caretakers its not pushed enough in this country she 
said 
in an editorial accompanying the study dr john snyder of 
childrens hosptial in boston called the overall findings 
troubling especially since black victims outnumbered whites 
four to one 
he agreed that educational efforts would be the most direct and 
immediate answer to this grave problem 
many different organisms can cause diarrhea including bacteria 
and parasites but a type of virus called rotavirus causes onethird 
of all childhood diarrhea cases requiring hospitalization the 
researchers said 
bacteria and parasites can be avoided with careful handwashing 
and food preparation but rotaviruses are virtually inescapable and 
almost everyone gets infected by them at some point during 
childhood ms ho said

the air force has no plans to ground the a10 
attack plane despite two crashes in arizona and west germany that 
occurred within hours of each other leaving six people dead and 51 
injured 
i can tell you from this standpoint were not tying the two of 
them together davismonthan air force base spokeswoman carol ann 
keck said here following thursdays crashes 
an a10 thunderbolt ii assigned to a royal air force base in 
england smashed into an apartment house in remscheid west germany 
at 130 pm local time 730 am est killing six people and 
injuring 51 authorities said 
ten hours later an a10 based at davismonthan crashed on the 
tohono oodham reservation near tracy about 80 miles west of tucson 
officials said the pilot who ejected was in good condition at the 
base hospital 
both jets were on training missions 
the tactical air command said in a statement late thursday that 
it would not ground the a10which statistically is the safest 
fighter or attack plane currently in the air force inventory 
the air force however suspended all tactical training flights 
in europe until tuesday 
witnesses to the remscheid crash said the twinengine jet hit the 
top floor of an apartment building a davismonthan spokesman said 
there was no immediate word on what caused that accident 
we cant speculate on what caused the accident said capt 
mark besich we have a board of officers formed to investigate 
and theyll determine that the board left for the crash site 
besich said the pilot of the singleseat airplane capt michael 
nutterfield 29 of hutchinson kan gave no indication of what the 
problem had been 
a helicopter picked nutterfield up at 6 pm and flew him to the 
hospital said besich who had no specifics on the pilots injuries 
like many west germans indians on the reservation have 
complained for years about lowlevel military flights objections 
center on the noise and the possibility of crashes said andrew 
patricio vice chairman of the tohono oodham legislative council 
one of these days it the aircraft might fall in one of these 
communities on top of a house he said 
you can see them flying practically at windowlevel said 
patricio thats been an issue for the last 10 years i dont 
think theres ever going to be an agreement 
the a10 is designed to support soldiers on the ground by 
attacking enemy tanks and other highpriority targets the 
thunderbolt first flew in 1975 and became operational with the air 
force in 1977 the plane is no longer in production but the air 
force has more than 700 of them in its inventory 
the aircraft has chalked up a major accident rate of less than 
four class a mishaps per 100000 flying hours over its lifetime 
which now consists of more than 175 million flight hours a class a 
mishap is one in which there is either a fatality or damage 
exceeding 500000 to an aircraft 
in the fiscal year ended sept 30 the air force lost three a10s

finance minister kiichi miyazawa resigned today 
becoming the first cabinetlevel casualty in a widening scandal over 
conflicting statements about his involvement in questionable stock 
purchases 
i have many regrets but we are not getting anywhere without 
clearing this deadlock miyazawa told a news conference after 
submitting his resignation to prime minister noboru takeshita 
miyazawa who is also giving up his position as deputy prime 
minister said he is stepping down to help pave the way for passage 
of sweeping tax reform bills 
i feel that accomplishing tax reform is my mission and i did 
not want to stand in the way of completion of the tax reform 
bills miyazawa said personally i hope the tax reform bills 
will be passed soon and it doesnt matter what happens to me 
takeshita said he would assume miyazawas post as finance 
minister the prime minister is expected to shuffle his cabinet in a 
few weeks but takeshita declined to say how long he would hold the 
finance portfolio 
opposition parties in parliament have been stalling debate on the 
tax reform demanding first that miyazawa resign 
miyazawa has been under fire for giving conflicting accounts 
about his alleged involvement in the scandal one of miyazawas 
former aides bought shares of recruitcosmos co before they were 
registered to trade over the counter and sold them immediately for 
a 20 million yen 163000 profit 
miyazawa is the most important figure to fall so far in the 
fivemonth scandal which has shaken public confidence and 
implicated a range of influential figures in business and government 
public support for takeshitas government has dropped to 18 
percent from 30 percent when he assumed office a year ago according 
to a survey released today by the masscirculation newspaper 
mainichi shimbun 
but political analysts said the resignation has been anticipated 
for some time and would have minimal economic and political impact 
we knew he had to go sooner or later said masumi ishikawa a 
commentator for the national daily asahi shimbun he must have 
judged politically that now is the right timing to quit to give the 
impression that he is sacrificing himself for the sake of tax bills 
rather than taking blame for the scandal 
opposition parties responded to the resignation with mixed 
signals 
tsuruo yamaguchi secretary general of the largest opposition 
group the japan socialist party said the resignation was well 
overdue but that his party did not intend to participate in 
parliamentary debate on the tax reform package 
since the finance minister who is in charge of carrying out 
the tax reform resigned the tax reform bills start again from 
scratch he said 
komeito or the clean government party however said in a 
statment that miyazawas resignation had cleared the way for 
fullfledged deliberations on the tax legislation 
the legislation japans first sweeping overhaul of its tax 
system since the end of the world war ii has been a top priority 
for the liberal democratic party for a decade 
successive administrations have failed to pass the reform due to 
a lack of public support and strong resistance from opposition 
parties former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone under whom 
miyazawa also served as finance minister staked his political 
career on tax reform and lost 
the new package simplifies corporate and personal income tax 
scales and introduces a 3percent sales tax

the abrupt departure of mikhail gorbachev 
elicited sympathy and sadness from those who were dropped from his 
itinerary but others fed up with two days of gorbylock had few 
regrets 
the mood is very sad said elaine fink principal of ps 6 
the manhattan grammar school that had hoped to host the soviet 
leaders wife raisa thursday afternoon its a lesson in 
disappointment for us all 
the lesson was echoed at each planned stop by the gorbachevs on 
their final day in manhattan the soviet leader returned home a day 
early to lead relief efforts for victims of a massive earthquake 
that ravaged armenia 
i think the only thing we can say is to express sympathy for 
the earthquake victims said john ross head of public relations 
at the metropolitan museum of art another big apple tourist sight 
missed by gorbachev 
the soviet presidents admiring american hosts managed to squeeze 
in one last event just before he boarded his plane at kennedy 
international airport just after noon thursday former astronaut 
james b irwin presented gorbachev with a soviet flag that went to 
the moon in 1971 with the apollo 15 mission 
irwin said he and his crewmates david r scott and alfred 
worden signed the flag which was one of a number of foreign flags 
carried by the moonwalkers 
gorbachev and his wife also had planned a short stroll through 
central park before their museum visit and a morning stop at the 
javits convention center for a soviet trade show 
i guess ill just go do some christmas shopping and go home 
said john chrystal chief operating officer of bankers trust co of 
des moines iowa who was invited by gorbachev to attend the trade 
event 
chrystals uncle roswell garst owned the iowa farm that nikita 
khrushchev visited in one of the high points of his 1959 american 
tour 
yes we are disappointed but who can argue with an 
earthquake asked parks commissioner henry stern who was to be 
gorbachevs host in the park we hope he can come back another 
time 
for the new york city police department sympathy and sorrow gave 
way to relief over savings officials figured the visit cost 
613000 in overtime the extra day would have put that figure at 1 
million 
the sighs of relief also came from the transportation department 
which battled mild gorbylock caused by gorbachevs motorcade 
and stifled traffic in midtown manhattan wednesday 
were doing better now said joe obrien a spokesman for the 
department 
also bumped by the change in plans was billionaire developer 
donald trump whose invitation to have gorbachev visit the opulent 
trump tower was rejected trump was among a group scheduled for 
dinner thursday night at the soviet mission instead the closest he 
came to the soviet leader was a glimpse of a gorby lookalike on 
tuesday

the immigration chief today said she 
will chop airport officials into 1000 pieces and feed them to 
the sharks if they dont stop smuggling entertainers out of the 
country 
miriam defensor santiago head of the commission on immigration 
and deportation said some officials of her agency have made 
fortunes providing fake permits allowing filipinos to work abroad as 
entertainers 
officials say many of those who leave the country illegally are 
recruited by criminal organizations in japan and elsewhere and end 
up working as prostitutes 
im going to chop you into 1000 pieces mrs santiago said 
during a television interview ill throw you and feed you to the 
sharks in manila bay however i doubt if the sharks would eat you 
out of a sense of professional courtesy 
mrs santiago claimed immigration officials at manilas ninoy 
aquino international airport had been faking arrest reports to fool 
her into believing they were cracking down on illegal activities 
these cid employees thought they could get away with it she 
said shaking her finger at the camera i know for a fact that 
these employees have been presenting alleged arrests to me in a 
misguided attempt to lull me into a false sense of ignorance about 
what is going on at the airport 
mrs santiago a former judge said her employees have been 
making fortunes from these illegal rackets at the airport right 
under my nose 
in september retired maj gen cesar tapia resigned as director 
of security at the airport because he said he was powerless to stamp 
out corruption there among immigration and customs agents 
in november evergisto macatulad resigned as airport general 
manager the third airport chief to quit since president corazon 
aquino took office in february 1986 
the countrys law enforcement chief meanwhile has ordered an 
investigation into allegations that police and soldiers are involved 
in car theft rings 
maj gen ramon montano commander of the philippine 
constabulary issued the order thursday after the highway patrol 
reported at least five military officers belonged to a car theft 
ring known as the silver edition 
a highway patrol report said the five were identified by gang 
members arrested in a series of raids in the manila area 
allegations that police and soldiers were involved in criminal 
gangs have been widespread in the philippines for years 
on sunday montano ordered the dismantling of permanent military 
checkpoints at the edge of manila and warned soldiers against 
shaking down travelers for money and goods 
the checkpoints were established to prevent communist rebels and 
rightwing extremists from entering manila 
but travelers and bus companies have complained that armed 
troopers extort money and supplies from passengers and operators

with pravda headlining our pain and tragedy on 
its front page and television showing soldiers digging for 
schoolchildren in piles of rubble soviet media have covered the 
devastating earthquake in armenia with unprecedented detail and 
urgency 
helpless sobbing people are climbing on the wreckage of an 
apartment house from which can be heard heartrending cries for 
help pravda reported today in a dramatic departure from its 
typical dry reports of communist party decrees and speeches 
powerless without anything they can do the living 
superstitiously run back and forth the story said 
driven by destruction that has killed tens of thousands of 
people soviet authorities are using the media to broadcast urgent 
appeals for everything from heavyduty cranes to blood 
officials also are emphasizing the need for national cooperation 
in coping with the tragedy in an attempt to use the disaster to 
stop the ethnic strife that has killed at least 60 people in armenia 
and neighboring azerbaijan this year and sent 180000 fleeing their 
homes in fear of mobs 
parts of both republics were being patrolled by soldiers and 
tanks when the quake hit 
reproaches and mutual offenses are thrown away in the 
aftermath of such a tragedy azerbaijani health minister ta 
kasumov said on national television thursday there is a saying 
among the azerbaijani people the pain unites he said 
our hospitals are ready to take patients and wounded from 
armenia and they will be surrounded by special care and 
attention kasumov promised that would be a stark contrast to 
recent weeks when medical care and food supplies had been denied to 
whole neighborhoods of armenians in azerbaijan 
the focus of much of the soviet reporting has been on the 
rescuers rather than victims 
television journalists spoke sadly of tens of thousands of dead 
thursday but their film showed crunched and crushed buildings 
rather than childrens mangled bodies reporters interviewed 
officials about the rescue effort instead of grieving parents 
broadcasters spoke of half the city of kirovakan being leveled 
but they showed no aerial photos indicating the extent of the 
damage nor were there pictures of tent cities being erected to 
shelter families left homeless by the quake 
most soviet photographers aimed their cameras at the relief 
effort evacuation of victims by military helicopters cranes 
clearing away destruction and volunteers rushing to donate blood 
a few of the photographs published in moscow and sent abroad by 
the official news agency tass show grieving women in spitak and 
mothers and their bundled children huddling around campfires in the 
remnants of downtown leninakan 
tass photographer sergei chistyakov said his agency sold one such 
dramatic photo to the french photo agency sipa for 2500 for its 
exclusive use outside the soviet union i hate to sell pictures of 
the tragedy he said but we are on selfaccounting now and 
they say we must 
soviet enterprises are switching to a new economic regime where 
they must turn a profit 
todays reports in the national newspapers were the first to 
detail the suffering of the victims the story was given remarkable 
prominence 
pravda ran a photo of a partially collapsed building on its front 
page a spot normally reserved for pictures of happy workers and 
politicians 
the relative speed of the coverage is also remarkable in a nation 
that until recently ignored natural disasters 
just last week it left unreported the hijacking of a bus full of 
30 schoolchildren until foreign news agencies learned of it through 
air traffic control communications on the hijackers plans to fly to 
israel 
the earthquake was first reported in one of the most unlikely 
sources of news on the soviet union the islamic republic news 
agency of iran 
but shortly thereafter soviet seismologists confirmed it to 
questioning reporters still it was not until eight hours after the 
quake hit that tass called it a disaster 
and it was not until thursday when president mikhail s 
gorbachev cut short his trip to new york to oversee relief efforts 
that officials began to speak of thousands of dead 
part of the delay can be explained by the destruction itself 
chistyakov said tass photographers based in yerevan reached the 
damaged area via military helicopter while the tass correspondents 
were stuck on the blocked highway as a result he said tass had 
pictures ready to transmit before it had a story

french president francois 
mitterrand met today with eight leading czechoslovak dissidents the 
first such meeting by a western leader on an official visit to 
prague 
leading human rights activists had voiced fears before 
mitterrands twoday visit started thursday that it would be 
exploited by the communist authorities to mute recent western 
criticism of the jailing and repression of independent activists 
but banned playwright vaclav havel who wrote an open letter to 
mitterrand last week regarding those fears said after the 75minute 
breakfast at the french embassy that the president was very 
wellinformed about the situation in czechoslovakia 
i am very satisfied with this conversation havel said it 
is the first time a head of a state officially met independent 
activists it is a new phenomenon which is very important for us 
havel a leading signatory of the charter 77 human rights 
document also expressed satisfaction that mitterrand lauded the 
1968 prague spring reforms in a dinner speech wednesday 
the speech was printed in full this morning in the communist 
party daily rude pravo 
its the first positive mention of the prague spring in rude 
pravo in 20 years havel said smiling 
charter 77 spokesman milos hajek another dissident present at 
the meeting called mitterrands mention of the prague spring 
excellent 
others attending the meeting at the french embassy were charter 
77 signatories jiri dienstbier petr uhl ladislav lis rudolf 
battek and vaclav maly a banned roman catholic priest 
karel srp leader of the independent cultural group the jazz 
section was the eighth man present 
the meeting took place a day before communist authorities permit 
a demonstration called by charter 77 and four other independent 
groups to mark the 40th anniversary of international human rights 
day 
for the first time since 1969 authorities have given permission 
for the independent gathering 
havel said he was sure this was connected with mitterrands visit 
the day after he leaves they could not do what they did with 
other independent demonstrations havel said 
in october hundreds of police with water cannon tear gas 
batons and dogs broke up a crowd of about 5000 who defied a ban on 
a rally called by the same five groups to mark 70 years of 
czechoslovak independence 
another demonstration protesting the 1968 invasion that crushed 
reform in czechoslovakia was also broken up by police in august

meant to celebrate love the towns namesake

tentatively approving the statue of a mother with a child at her

they like love and loveland but wanted the statue to have another 
home customers at the wig shop also protested 
the commission is scheduled to take a final vote on the statue

city and state officials are engaged in a rat race 
for the control of a potentially pesky problem of rampant rodents 
the city is starting a decadelong excavation and reconstruction 
project that some experts say could have rats overrunning the city 
at odds are the director of rodent control for boston and an 
ratcontrol expert hired by the state a professor from bowling 
green state university in ohio 
the officials are arguing over a report released recently by the 
state that city officials claim excludes them from rat control plans 
and does not focus enough on early prevention 
we question what will happen if our plans dont jibe said 
sam wood director of the city inspectional services department 
the way the report is written its like people will call us with 
complaints and well have to decide if its a complaint about a city 
rat or a state rat 
william jackson on the faculty at bowling green was hired by 
the state to develop a plan to curb the spread of rats when 
excavation begins downtown in 1990 the 45 billion project 
includes a plan to build a third tunnel under boston harbor and 
transform the central artery from a sixlane elevated highway to an 
eight to 10lane underground expressway 
jackson and his firm biocenotics issued a report on a plan to 
eradicate the thousands of rats expected to be uprooted from their 
homes during construction 
jacksons plan calls for placing rat bait around three rodent 
control zones along the construction route according to the plan 
the baiting would begin 60 and 90 days before construction 
the plan also calls for an education program to inform residents 
on rodentproofing and sanitation negotiations with utility 
agencies and public agencies about rat control 
wood charged that jacksons team ignored the citys sevenpoint 
plan issued last summer that outlined the need for early prevention 
constant monitoring by city inspectors and an emergency team to 
respond to resident complaints 
wood claims that jacksons plans concentrate on underground 
rodent control efforts but do not allow the city enough staff to 
respond to problems that arise when rats escape after construction 
jackson was en route from bowling green to boston on thursday and 
was not available for comment 
central artery project director william v twomey said thursday 
that jackson and his firm were hired because state officials 
believed a rat control expert was needed to develop an overall 
perspective of the rodent problem 
im surprised at mr woods comments he said the report 
is peppered with references to working with city officials we want 
to work with them and take their plans into consideration

scientists are retreating from studies 
indicating more than four basic forces of nature run the universe 
citing a major flaw in experiments that suggested gravity is 
slightly countered by a fifth force and enhanced by a sixth 
as yet theres no convincing evidence said robert parker of 
the la jollabased scripps institution of oceanography a 
participant in a research group that now questions its own findings 
richard hughes a physicist at los alamos national laboratory in 
new mexico put the case more strongly 
there are only four forces in nature read my lips no new 
forces he said 
the scientists from scripps los alamos atampt bell laboratories 
in new jersey and other institutions backtracked on statements they 
made last july when they reported strong evidence suggesting sir 
isaac newtons 301yearold law of gravity was wrong now they say 
the evidence is inconclusive 
thats because their measurements of gravity inside a drill hole 
in greenlands ice sheet could have been flawed by variations in the 
density of rock beneath the ice parker concluded in a study 
his calculations show our results do not need new forces of 
nature and can be explained by the existing law of gravity 
parker said wednesday during the american geophysical unions fall 
meeting 
scientists believed for decades that there were only four 
fundamental forces that govern the behavior of all matter in the 
universe they are gravity electromagnetism which creates light 
electricity radio waves and microwaves the strong force which 
holds the center of atoms together and the weak force which lets 
some atoms decay radioactively 
but in 1986 an analysis by purdue university physicist ephraim 
fishbach suggested the existence of a very weak fifth force that 
slightly counteracts gravity over distances of roughly 10 to 1000 
yards the theory gained support from gravity measurements made at 
varying depths inside a mine shaft by frank stacey of the university 
of queensland australia 
subsequent gravity measurements made on a north carolina 
television tower and in the greenland ice hole also suggested there 
was a sixth force that was different than gravity but gave a 15 
percent to 4 percent boost to gravitys attraction between objects 
that were 1600 to 5500 feet apart 
the mine tower and ice studies all found slight deviations from 
newtons law which says the gravitational attraction between two 
objects decreases with the square of the distance between them for 
example when two objects that were one foot apart are moved two 
feet apart the gravity they exert on each other should become only 
onefourth as strong 
oceanographer alan chave of atampt bell labs said planned gravity 
measurements at varying levels within the ocean should avoid that 
problem and help researchers determine whether the new forces are 
real 
if the fifth and sixth forces exist they might cause inertially 
guided missiles to miss their targets by slight distances said los 
alamos physicist michael nieto thats why the air force conducted 
the tv tower experiment 
nieto believes that even if the forces found in the experiments 
are real they are not distinct forces of nature but simply show 
gravity is more complicated than newton thought 
existence of fifth and sixth forces also means the masses of 
the planets and stars as well as the universes mass and age would 
have to be recalculated the geophysical union said in a news 
release 
such forces also would change scientists understanding of the 
evolution of the universe in its earliest stages after it formed 
in the gargantuan explosion called the big bang said nieto 
physicists believe that before the big bang the four known 
forces existed as a single unified force but that in the 
explosion they instantaneously diverged into separate forces and 
matter came into being 
the ultimate goal of modern physics is to find an elegant 
theory of everything that explains all the forces and matter 
that make up the universe and how they evolved from the unified 
force

a downtown hospital is investigating the theft of 
16000 prophylactics that has officials puzzled since the condoms 
are given away free in the first place 
the missing condoms discovered wednesday by officials at grady 
memorial hospitals family planning clinic temporarily crippled a 
program that distributes about 500000 condoms a year 
its amazing they did clean us out said grady clinics 
director dr robert hatcher on thursday maybe those condoms are 
in the right hands now 
police believe the theft occurred tuesday night hatcher said he 
found his offices trashed and telephones missing when he arrived at 
work wednesday morning 
then we found out that in our supply room 16000 condoms had 
been stolen we ended up with no condoms hatcher said but most 
of our patients maintain a supply at home were just telling them 
to be careful 
news of the theft prompted an eatontown nj condom 
manufacturer ansellamericas inc to replace the clinics supply 
free of charge 
hatcher said each day his clinic dispenses about 2000 condoms 
roughly 40 to 160 per patient and encourages clients to pass the 
condoms on to family members and friends 
our hope is that those stolen condoms are used so they help 
prevent unplanned pregnancies and unwanted infections he said 
hatcher who has served at the grady clinic for 25 years said 
the condom theft was a first he urged the bandits to come back 
and see us again and well be glad to help

bidding goodbye after a fourweek visit soviet 
human rights activist andrei sakharov called the united states a 
wonderful country but said he had no desire to move here 
i think that my fate is completely bound up with the country 
where i was born and i want to live there sakharov said thursday 
night before boarding a jet to paris and a possible meeting with 
polish solidarity leader lech walesa 
the 67yearold nobel laureate also called for an international 
effort to aid victims of the massive earthquake that struck soviet 
armenia killing tens of thousands of people 
sakharov arrived in the united states nov 4 as a soviet delegate 
to the international foundation for the survival and development of 
humanity an organization formed this year by soviet and american 
scientists to foster cooperation on arms control hunger pollution 
and other issues 
during his stay he visited relatives in the boston area 
attended a private dinner in new york and met with president reagan 
in washington he also underwent tests at massachusetts general 
hospital where doctors determined he did not need a heart pacemaker 
it was sakharovs first visit to the west and he and others 
hailed it as a symbol of change in the soviet union 
just by being able to make the trip he achieved a lot said 
joshua rubenstein northeast regional director for amnesty 
international he showed he could come and that soviet security 
was not threatened as has always been argued 
sakharov is a symbol for people who were persecuted from the 
late 1960s until the 1980s said stephen f cohen professor of 
soviet studies at princeton university its a sign to people in 
the soviet union that its now possible to protest official policies 
and still travel freely and move in high circles 
sakharov who helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb previously 
was barred from traveling abroad because of his past scientific 
work he was also restricted to the industrial city of gorky for 
seven years because of his outspoken opposition to soviet 
intervention in afghanistan 
in 1986 soviet leader mikhail gorbachev personally called him 
back to moscow since then sakharov has generally supported 
gorbachevs perestroika or political and economic restructuring 
while speaking out against some trends including the growing 
concentration of power in gorbachevs hands 
using his stepdaughter tatiana yankelevich as a translator 
sakharov said before his departure at logan international airport 
that support for perestroika should be very strong but by no means 
unconditional 
he warned that perestroika still faces many obstacles and that 
the reforms cannot yet be called irreversible 
he praised gorbachevs announcement wednesday of unilateral troop 
cuts saying the soviet leader has taken a very important 
initiative that will broaden international support for him and 
therefore strengthen his position in the soviet union 
sakharov who received the nobel peace prize in 1975 for his 
human rights activities plans to attend a celebration in paris of 
the 40th anniversary of the united nations universal declaration of 
human rights he said he may also meet with walesa in france before 
returning to moscow

amid a hasty departure mikhail s gorbachev 
paused to thank new york for its friendliness and speak 
optimistically of the prospects for world peace 
the road ahead will be tough but we will go ahead and we will 
i believe be building on what has been achieved if we act as we 
have been acting and also maybe add something new the soviet 
leader said thursday as he headed back to moscow after a disastrous 
earthquake in the soviet south 
he flew out of new york a day earlier than scheduled and canceled 
planned visits to havana and london because of the massive quake 
centered in armenia that killed tens of thousands of people 
although his stay was brief 45 hours the communist leader 
dazzled world leaders with a dramatic troop reduction proposal and 
captured the hearts of new yorkers who gathered by the thousands 
along manhattan streets to wave and cheer his speeding motorcade 
the warm feelings were not lost on gorbachev who said the kind 
of hospitality he experienced showed an increasing friendliness 
and willingness to cooperate on the part of the soviet people and 
the american people 
we believe that this may have been one of the most important 
things that happened on this day of our stay in america gorbachev 
said before leaving from kennedy international airport 
gorbachev explained his abrupt departure at an airport news 
conference saying the quake which registered 69 on the richter 
scale had extremely grave consequences devastation and grave 
loss of life 
although he had only one working day in new york gorbachev 
said i and my delegation believe that this was a very important 
day 
the highlights of the visit were gorbachevs announcement before 
the un general assembly that he planned a major reduction in 
soviet troop strength over the next three years and his superpower 
luncheon with president reagan and presidentelect bush 
gorbachev the first soviet chief to visit new york in 28 years 
said his un speech and a later reception gave him the opportunity 
to set out our views on the world today and on the prospects 
of the worlds development 
gorbachev called the governors island session with reagan and 
bush a good meeting held in an open and trusting atmosphere 
he said the one word he would use to characterize it was 
continuity and all parties walked away confident that our 
relations will expand and improve on the basis of cooperation on 
the basis of mutual respect for each others interests 
gorbachev later added i think i would be remiss in my duty if 
i went home without saying how much we are grateful to new yorkers 
for the hospitality and feelings of friendship that they have been 
expressing over these days we value that very much 
he had planned to visit the first soviet trade show in the united 
states central park and the metropolitan museum on thursday 
gorbachevs wife raisa canceled a visit with children at an upper 
east side elementary school

from june 1985 to june 1987 samoluk said 
mrs moran is charged with forcible rape of a child under 16 
years old and indecent assault and battery on a child under 14 on 
various dates samoluk said the forcible part of the charge involved 
a sharp instrument and threats made to the children that their

a gynecologist charged by the state medical 
board with gross immorality for allegedly performing 
sexualenhancement surgery on women without their knowledge says 
hes eager to answer the charges 
dr james c burt of dayton was cited thursday with violating 
several provisions of the medical practices act in 78 instances 
involving 33 patients dating to march 1966 said lauren lubow a 
spokeswoman for the 12member board 
burt 67 also is being sued by two former patients who claim he 
performed sexualenhancement surgery on them without their knowledge 
in an interview with a dayton television station thursday burt 
said he had not been notified by the medical board of the charges 
against him 
im looking forward to answering whatever charges burt told 
wdtntv i feel that when the truth comes out that i will be 
totally vindicated 
ms lubow said burt who was banned by the board from surgical 
practice in november has 30 days to seek a public hearing on the 
charges failing to do so would permit the board to construe those 
allegations as having been proven she said 
burt faces possible penalties ranging from reprimand to 
revocation of his license 
burts techniques came under fire in october after cbs west 
57th street program investigated his surgical procedures 
that report and the medical boards citation also referred to 
burts 1975 book surgery of love in which he admitted he had 
performed reconstructive surgery aimed at enhancing sexual pleasure 
without his patients knowledge 
in his book burt wrote one doesnt have to go into the 
complexity of sexuality with the patient and her partner one merely 
does the operation of coital area reconstruction in many 
hundreds of these patients the patient had not been informed that 
anything more had been done to her than delivery and episiotomy and 
repair 
the board said burt conducted experimental surgeries that 
included rotation of the vagina away from the bladder and internal 
genitalia and extension of the vagina to align it with the 
clitoris an external tissue that responds to sexual stimulation 
the procedures in many cases resulted in complications 
complaints of sexual dysfunction infection a necessity for 
corrective surgery and chronic pain the board said

the us navy has ordered the former 
captain of the uss dubuque courtmartialed for allegedly failing to 
rescue vietnamese refugees who claim they later resorted to 
cannibalism a spokesman said today 
the spokesman lt cmdr kevin mukri said no date had been set 
for the proceedings against capt alexander g balian 48 of los 
angeles but that they would probably be held at subic bay naval 
base 50 miles west of manila 
balian was relieved of his duties in august after vietnamese 
refugees claimed the dubuque failed to render assistance when their 
boat crossed paths with the warship in the south china sea on june 9 
united nations officials said 52 of the refugees later reached 
the philippines but 58 people died during the 37 day voyage 
survivors said two vietnamese died of starvation but that three 
others were slain and eaten by fellow passengers 
mukri said rear adm roger l rich commander of us naval 
forces in the philippines ordered the courtmartial after reviewing 
findings of an investigation conducted at subic and in the persian 
gulf the dubuques destination when it spotted the vietnamese boat 
the investigation which corresponds to a civilian grand jury 
probe was completed oct 28 and forwarded to rich on nov 7 mukri 
said it found that the vietnamese vessel was out of food and water 
and with an inoperative engine and sails when it encountered the 
dubuque 
balian claimed that the boat was seaworthy and that the crew 
provided food water and navigational directions 
mukri said balian faced seven charges including failure to 
render assistance to a vessel in distress and failing to determine 
the condition of the vessel mukri said balian who is now in 
sasabo japan could be dismissed from the navy and imprisoned for 
two years on each charge if convicted 
mukri said the investigation determined that the dubuque failed 
to provide food water and clothing even though some of the 
refugees were naked dehydrated and weakened from their ordeal at 
sea 
he said balian was also charged with failing to rescue a 
vietnamese refugee who jumped into the water and tried to swim to 
the port side of the dubuque 
mukri said another vietnamese tried to climb a rope ladder on the 
side of the dubuque but the crew shook it and he fell back into the 
sea 
the dubuque also did not report the location of the vietnamese 
vessel by radio so that other ships in the area could render 
assistance mukri said 
quoting the report mukri said the vietnamese vessel left vietnam 
on may 22 by the time it encountered the dubuque on june 9 there 
were 83 men women and children including one infant still alive

israeli jets bombed guerrilla posts today 
and gunboats sent commando reinforcements ashore in what police said 
was a mission to rescue paratroopers captured after landing in this 
coastal town 
police and the israeli military said one israeli officer was 
killed and three soldiers were wounded in nine hours of air naval 
and ground fighting about 50 miles north of the israeli border 
it was believed to be the deepest israeli incursion into lebanon 
since september 1983 during the lebanon war the israelis did not 
say why they launched a paratrooper raid on the town 
police said eight prosyrian guerrillas were killed and 16 
wounded 
the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command the apparent target of the attack said only two of its 
fighters were killed and six wounded it claimed in a communique 
that it was holding 17 israelis and that another israeli was held by 
syrian troops 
police and israeli military sources said four israelis were 
trapped at one point in the fighting but were rescued the israeli 
army said no israeli soldiers were left behind when the fighting 
ended 
lebanese police said syrian troops fired at attacking israeli 
jets and sent troop reinforcements to the embattled areas but they 
said there was no evidence the troops were directly involved in the 
ground combat 
the fighting which police said involved handtohand combat 
raged for nine hours near an abandoned maronite catholic monastry 
above naameh nine miles south of beirut 
palestinian guerrillas ambushed an israeli force of about 50 
paratroopers who landed helicopters in a ravine below the monastry 
at 210 am one police spokesman in naameh said 
militiamen of druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive 
socialist party joined the battle an hour later police said 
israeli warplanes then thundered in from the mediterranean 
blasting guerrilla posts above naameh in at least 20 sorties the 
israeli military said an unspecified number of guerrilla command 
posts and other targets were destroyed 
guerrillas fired shoulderfired sam7 missiles known as 
strellas at the raiding jets but no hits were scored police said 
they said israeli pilots released hot air balloons to deflect the 
heatseeking missiles 
convoys of syrian military trucks and armored personnel carriers 
rolled southward into the embattled areas on the coastal highway 
after israeli reinforcements stormed ashore about 10 am in landing 
craft two miles south of naameh 
there was no evidence the syrian troops were involved in the 
actual combat 
israel radio however quoted lebanese sources as saying syrians 
opened fire on israeli troops as they landed on the coast but 
stopped firing once the force was fully ashore 
israeli gunboats cruised off naameh and five helicopter gunships 
hovered overhead apparently waiting to evacuate the paratroopers 
the spokesman said 
palestinian guerrillas and the leftist lebanese militiamen were 
seen firing at the helicopters from jeepmounted antiaircraft guns 
along naamehs beach 
the spokesman said the dead israeli officer commanded the 
reconnaissance battalion of israels golani brigade an elite

cancer rates are decliningbut the disease remains 
the second leading cause of premature death in the united states 
according to the centers for disease control 
in 1985 the last year for which statistics were available 
cancer accounted for the loss of 195 million years of potential 
life americans would have had if they had lived to age 65 the 
atlantabased cdc said thursday in its weekly report 
only injuries with a loss of 22 million years ranked higher 
the cdc counts years of potential life lost to various causes 
as a way of measuring premature mortality using age 65 as a 
statistical benchmark the actual life expectancy is higher 
since 1968 the mortality rate from cancer for americans under 55 
has dropped significantly from 43 deaths per 100000 people in that 
age group in 1968 to 35 in 1985 over that same time the annual 
rate of potential life years lost has fallen as well from 1074 
years lost among every 100000 people to 926 
all of that leads to some guarded optimism that cancer rates 
in younger people are in fact declining said dr richard 
rothenberg a cdc cancer specialist 
in the 1985 figures the highest rate for potentiallife years 
lost to cancer was among black males at 1208 years per 100000 
such people following were white males 949 black females 877 
and white females 841 
but while proportionately fewer people are dying early of cancer 
the population is growing particularly baby boomers now ages 
2442 thus cancers toll in the total number of years of 
potential life lost has remained virtually constant for two 
decades the cdc noted 
understanding the basis and public health implications of this 
decline in cancer death rates requires further investigation 
the cdc said noting that such efforts should include study of 
cancer incidence and survival among younger americans 
additionally rothenberg said researchers have another concern 
with improvements in other areas of medicine such as treatment of 
cardiovascular disease americans are living longer so the cancer 
rate for people over 65 is increasing 
it sounds simplistic but it means theyre living long enough 
to get cancer he said

nato foreign ministers today said the 
enormous changes under way in the soviet union offer an 
unprecedented opportunity for improved international relations 
we will continue to seize every opportunity to cooperate in the 
search for political solutions to eastwest differences the 
ministers in a statement ending a twoday meeting of the north 
atlantic treaty organization 
but they also urged tangible and lasting changes from the 
soviet union to help solve the problems dividing east and west 
the statement cited the announcement wednesday by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev that the soviets will unilaterally 
reduce their armed forces by 500000 troops or nearly 10 percent 
and withdraw some conventional weapons from eastern europe the move 
would still leave the warsaw pact with more conventional weapons and 
troops in europe than nato has 
secretary of state george p shultz stressed again that the 
allies must maintain a strong defense effort even in the wake of the 
soviet initiatives 
being encouraged doesnt mean that you just go bananas and 
forget about what got you here and so you want to keep doing the 
things that are constructive he told a news conference 
shultz who has met with nato ministers in brussels and elsewhere 
over 6 years on the job was attending his last alliance session 
the alliance it seems to me is in a very strong position 
he said its cohesive its informed about what is taking place 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said we cannot base our 
security on the good or bad intentions or personality of the soviet 
leaders 
we look upon mr gorbachev with sympathy and encourage his 
reform efforts while they lead to more human rights and a more 
responsible conduct of foreign affairs and a reduction in military 
capability he said 
gorbachevs address wednesday at the united nations the 
ministers said represents the starting point of a new approach by 
the soviet union to the size and structure of their military forces 
and programs 
sir geoffrey howe the british secretary of state for foreign 
affairs said the speech was filled with realism and good sense 
it does offer up encouraging prospects for seeking new 
solutions to old problems he told reporters 
the officials said in their statement they welcomed gorbachevs 
move this implicitly acknowledges our longheld view that 
redressing the conventional imbalance is the key to more security 
and stability in europe 
the carrying out of these measures the statement said would 
be a very important first step in this direction and reduce but not 
eliminate the imbalances in conventional forces 
the implementation of the cuts it said would provide a very 
favorable impetus to the conventional stability negotiations 
the ministers on thursday unveiled their position for the 
conventional stability talks due to begin early next year in 
vienna austria the talks will cover the 16 nato nations and seven 
warsaw pact countries 
dutch foreign minister hans van den broek told reporters that 
after gorbachevs speech the climate for the conventional 
negotations has considerably improved much needs to happen but 
things are looking up 
gorbachev made his surprise announcement a day before the 
ministers were scheduled to meet at nato headquarters in brussels 
in their final statement the ministers said their talks took 
place amid clear signs of change in the internal and external 
policies of the soviet union and of some of its allies 
promising prospects are opening up for an improved eastwest 
dialogue it said 
we are encouraged by this trend which if sustained would 
provide us with an unprecedented opportuity to shape a better 
international environment reflecting our basic values and the 
aspirations of our peoples the statement said 
in a separate statement the ministers addressed eastwest trade 
saying it must contribute to constructive eastwest relations 
and remain consistent with broad allied security concerns 
it said trade with the soviet union and its allies must be based 
on commercially sound terms and mutual advantage preferential 
treatment must be avoided it said 
it also cautioned against economic help that will improve the

officials today revised the death 
toll from the crash of a us air force jet in remscheid to five 
after discovering that a postman counted among the dead was 
hospitalized with severe burns 
the us military refused to speculate on the cause of the crash 
thursday and opened an investigation 
however the west german air force chief of staff horst 
jungkurth told reporters in bonn he believed the crash was caused 
by human error 
he said the a10 aircraft was known as highly reliable and that 
the chances of a technical problem were not very high he said 
the pilot may have become disoriented when he tried to climb in 
heavy cloud cover 
witnesses said the plane flew low over a school and struck the 
top floor of an apartment building before bursting into flames 
black smoke billowed from the crash site in this central city of 
130000 today burnedout cars lined the street for more than a 
block many buildings were either destroyed or heavily damaged 
the remscheid city spokesman wilhelm ellerbrake told reporters 
officials mistakenly reported that six people died in the crash 
because they were not aware that the postman was moved to a hospital 
in neighboring bochum 
ellerbrake identified the five dead as the lone pilot of the us 
plane two women aged 86 and 76 and two men aged 35 and 30 
the us air force identified the pilot as capt michael p 
foster 34 it did not give his hometown 
peter becker a civil defense official in north rhine westphalia 
state said workers were searching for more victims at least 40 
people were treated and released but 11 remained hospitalized from 
injuries 
us air force major gen marcus anderson said the pilot of the 
a10 thunderbolt ii jet had reported in a last radio transmission 14 
minutes after leaving the west german air base at norvenich that he 
had run into bad weather 
he was trying to get out of it by moving up that was the last 
transmission anderson said today 
in the course of doing so climbing the mishap aircraft did 
not come out from the top of the clouds and continued in a descent 
and ultimately crashed we do not know why he said 
anderson said an air force investigation team was trying to 
determine the cause of the crash but said the probe could take up 
to 30 days to complete 
he said the plane was fully loaded with 1800 gallons of fuel 
asked about eyewitness reports that one of the planes two jet 
engines was on fire before it crashed anderson said witnesses 
sometimes become confused he also apologized for what he said was 
a delay in notifiying local authorities that the aircraft was 
carrying ammunition 
that is standard procedure to notify authorities as quickly as 
possible we did have some delay and we regret that very much we 
will investigate what the cause was he said 
there are no plans to ground the a10 aircraft unless 
investigators determine it had a technical problem anderson said 
before thursdays crash 12 military accidents this year had 
claimed 95 lives in west germany 
the us air force said it was suspending all tactical training 
flights in europe until tuesday the west german air force suspended 
lowlevel training flights until the end of the year and called on 
its allies to do the same 
opposition political parties called for a ban on lowlevel 
flights and sharp cuts in air exercises 
opposition to lowlevel flying grew in august when italian stunt 
planes collided and crashed into a crowd of spectators at an air 
show at the us air force base in ramstein seventy people were 
killed

here are excerpts from the official 
englishlanguage communique issued by the nato foreign ministers 
friday at the end of their twoday meeting at the nato headquarters 
our meeting has taken place amid clear signs of change in the 
internal and external policies of the soviet union and of some of 
its allies promising prospects are opening up for an improved 
eastwest dialogue we are encouraged by this trend which if 
sustained would provide us with an unprecedented opportunity to 
shape a better international environment reflecting our basic values 
and the aspirations of our peoples 
among the most promising recent developments is the address made 
by president mikhail gorbachev at the 43rd un general assembly 
which indicates the extend of change in soviet policies 
we will continue to seize every opportunity to cooperate in the 
search for political solutions to eastwest differences with a view 
to promoting our ultimate aim of a just and lasting peaceful order 
in europe 
in the pursuit of this endeavor we look for further tangible and 
lasting changes addressing directly the issues dividing east and 
west we reiterate our willingness to work closely with the soviet 
union and its allies in the search for ways to ease and finally 
overcome the painful division of europe 
we will continue to evaluate closely the current developments in 
eastern europe where pressures for movement toward political and 
economic reform are mounting while welcoming progress achieved in 
certain areas we need to take a realistic view of developments 
the soviet union and other eastern countries still have to meet 
fully their obligations on human rights nevertheless we are 
encouraged by the recent introduction or announcement of important 
measures in this field 
in the defense area we express the hope that president 
gorbachevs address also represents the starting point of a new 
approach by the soviet union to the size and structure of their 
military forces and programs which both in the nuclear and 
conventional fields still exceed any reasonable defense need 
we attach particular importance to the csce conference on 
security and cooperation in europe process which provides a road 
map for stable and constructive relations between east and west and 
for a dynamic evolution in europe 
we note with regret that a number of governments in the east 
still continue to ignore important provisions of the helsinki final 
act and the madrid concluding document full implementation of the 
undertakings contained in these documents including full respect 
for human rights is an essential requirement for genuine peace and 
enhancement of mutual confidence 
we will continue to strive for the conclusion of the csce 
followup meeting in vienna in the immediate future with a 
substantial and balanced concluding document 
arms control is an integral part of alliance security policy in 
expressing full support for the united states position in the start 
strategic arms reduction treaty negotiations ie its aim to 
reach a 50 percent reduction in the strategic nuclear forces of the 
us and the soviet union we welcome the substantial progress 
achieved including preliminary agreement on key elements and look 
forward to a timely successful conclusion of these negotiations 
we reaffirm the importance of the inf intermediaterange nuclear 
forces treaty and welcome its smooth implementation 
we look forward to beginning as soon as possible conventional 
stability negotiations within the framework of the csce process 
with the objective of establishing a secure and stable balance of 
forces at lower levels between the 23 members of the two military 
alliances in europe we want a situation in europe in which force 
postures as well as numbers and deployments of weapons systems no 
longer make a surprise attack and a largescale offensive action a 
feasible option an option which we have never possessed or desired 
our vision remains a continent where military forces should only 
exist to prevent war and to ensure selfdefense not for the purpose 
of military aggression and not for the purposes of political or 
military intimidation we therefore welcome the latest pronouncement 
by the soviet leadership regarding significant reductions of soviet 
conventional forces in europe and restructuring of the remaining 
forces 
this implicitly acknowledges our longheld view that redressing 
the conventional imbalance is a key to more security and stability 
in europe implementation of these measures would be a very 
important first step in this direction and reduce but not 
eliminate the conventional imbalances in particular it would 
provide a very favorable impetus to the conventional stability 
negotiations 
the conventional stability talks will be accompanied by distinct 
negotiations on further confidencebuilding measures among the 35 
csce participants such negotiations will have to build upon and 
expand on the results of the stockholm conference which marked a 
significant step toward increasing transparency and contributed to 
greater confidence and predictability of military activities in 
europe we look to the countries of the warsaw treaty organization 
and other participating states to reciprocate this effort 
the member states participating in the mbfr mutual and 
balanced force reduction talks emphasize their agreement to the 
continuation of these talks until a new mandate for negotiations on 
conventional stability has emerged they also agreed these talks 
should be concluded before the start of new negotiations 
we reiterate our full commitment to the goal of an early 
conclusion of a truly worldwide comprehensive and effectively 
verifiable ban on chemical weapons 
we reaffirm our commitment to share fairly the risks burdens 
and responsibilities as well as the benefits of our participation 
in the alliance this commitment to equitable sharing is a 
fundamental principle of the alliance and a prerequisite for 
maintaining its cohesion and solidarity we all attach great 
importance in an evolving political trade and economic environment 
to maintaining balance and equity in our partnership

pope john paul ii urged today that the rights 
of minorities be respected but he also condemned any recourse to 
violence to advance their claims and lashed out at terrorist groups 
acting in their name 
may those who follow the inhuman path of terrorism hear my 
voice to strike blindly kill innocent people or carry out bloody 
reprisals does not help a just evaluation of the claims advanced by 
the minorites for whom they claim to act the pope said in his 
message for the roman catholic churchs world day of peace 
the message sent to world leaders each year was titled to 
build peace respect minorities 
vatican officials said the message was in general terms and that 
john paul had no specific ethnic racial religious or national 
group in mind although his words seemed directed at a number of 
situations in the world 
the pope acknowledged that delicate problems arise when a 
group seeks independence or greater political autonomy 
i wish to state that in such delicate circumstances dialogue 
and negotiation are the obligatory path to peace he said adding 
that a refusal to enter into dialogue can open the door to 
violence 
he also declared that states that perpetrate or tolerate acts 
aimed at endangering the lives of minorities violate the 
fundamental law governing the social order 
in situations of real injustice he said it may be the duty of 
groups which have emigrated to demand justice for oppressed in their 
homelands but he called for care especially when it is difficult 
to have objective information 
the church marks its world day of peace on jan 1 but the popes 
message is traditionally issued in advance

the city council of the black 
township of soweto has agreed to halt evictions and write off 
arrears stemming from a massive 3yearold rent boycott prominent 
antiapatheid activists said today the activists who met with the 
council for several hours included anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu miners union leader cyril ramaphosa and others who in the 
past have refused to negotiate with the black councilors of the 
township near johannesburg 
the rent boycott launched to press a broad range of grievances 
against the government has evolved into one of the most effective 
forms of protest still available to blacks under a 30monthold 
state of emergency 
authorities have used numerous tactics in futile attempts to 
break the boycott including latenight eviction raids such as one 
in august 1986 which led to the deaths of nearly 30 blacks in a 
confrontation with police 
the new council took office following nationwide municipal 
elections oct 26 which were the target of an illegal but successful 
boycott by blacks about 115 percent of eligible voters in soweto 
cast ballots 
south africas black majority is excluded from parliament and 
black local councils have been denounced by activists as subordinate 
extensions of the whitedominated political system 
the new council seeking to differentiate itself from its 
predecessor proceeded to rehire municipal workers fired during a 
strike and said it wanted to consult with community leaders to 
resolve problems facing the township of 25 million people 
todays meeting came two days after south africas highest court 
ruled that previous soweto councils had no legal authority to 
collect rent from occupants of the thousands of homes built in the 
1940s and 1950s by the city council of johannesburg at that time 
there was no separate black administration in soweto 
the rev frank chikane secretarygeneral of the south african 
council of churches and leader of the activists delegation said 
the councilors agreed that because of the court ruling no sowetan 
was required to pay any of the millions of dollars of rent withheld 
during the boycott 
chikane said further negotiations would take place to determine 
whether some residents should now be awarded ownership of their 
houses and what type of rent or service charges should be paid in 
the future in the interim he said residents should not pay any 
rent 
the rent boycott was launched in townships south of johannesburg 
in 1985 and spread to dozens of communities nationwide overdue rent 
in soweto alone is believed to exceed 100 million 
chikane and tutu indicated the new council was viewed more 
positively by activists than its predecessors 
they told us our grievances were their grievances said tutu 
the activists said in a statement that negotiations with the 
council would continue only if it were able to guarantee community 
leaders were not harassed or detained as they consulted with 
residents 
one of the consequences of the fivemonth municipal workers 
strike was an accumulation of trash on roadsides throughout soweto 
the council will launch a cleanup campaign saturday and it drew 
praise from the normally critical local newspaper the sowetan for 
a proposal to pay children to join the effort

murray sams jr said thursday 
the broward circuit court lawsuit accuses the fair and the rides 
owner the james e strates shows of orlando of careless and

inspect the ride repair the crack and warn the public of the 
allegedly hazardous conditions

and could not comment 
the fairs attorney steven reininger said the fair probably 
will argue that strates was an independent contractor charged with 
the responsibility to maintain safe rides

a us locustspraying plane was shot down 
near where marxist rebels have been fighting morocco for an 
independent western sahara and officials said all five people 
aboard were presumed killed 
a second dc7 also from the us agency for international 
development was damaged in thursdays antiaircraft missile attack 
over mauritania but was able to land at a remote airstrip in 
morocco no one aboard that plane was injured 
marxist guerrillas of the polisario front may have fired at the 
fourengine propellerdriven planes official sources in this north 
african country said on condition of anonymity 
the guerrillas are known to have been armed with sovietmade sa6 
and sa7 surfacetoair missiles both the moroccan and mauritanian 
armed forces also have such antiaircraft missiles 
no one immediately claimed responsibility and a us embassy 
spokesman in rabat said an investigation was under way 
the five crew members of the downed aircraft all of whom are 
american citizens are presumed dead an aid statement from 
washington said 
both aircraft were owned by t amp g aviation of chandler ariz 
and were under contract to aid to spray insects said t amp g coowner 
sergio tomassoni who was in the other plane that was hit 
tomassoni 64 spoke with reporters by telephone from his hotel 
room in agadir morocco 
he identified those aboard the downed plane as joel blackmer 46 
and blackmers son frank kennedy 21 both of phoenix ben rossini 
49 tempe ariz frank hederman 47 cody wyo and wes wilson of 
nebraska tomassoni did not know wilsons age or hometown 
tomassoni described the twohour trip in the crippled plane to 
the next airfield as hairy 
we were just flying along at about 11000 feet when all of a 
sudden the first airplane was hit tomassoni said we saw the 
smoke and a big ball of fire one of the engines was in flames the 
plane started losing altitude and then the right wing blew off i 
knew they were in trouble but we had problems of our own 
we were 25 to 30 feet above the ground most of the way we had 
a load of insecticide aboard and we dumped it and were able to gain 
some altitude tomassoni added we made an emergency landing at 
an airfield in a town about 80 miles south of agadir 
a caller identifying himself as madjid abdullah polisarios 
north american representative in washington said the front will 
do everything possible to shed full light on this tragic and 
unfortunate incident 
we are not sure really who shot it down he said in a phone 
call to the associated press in new york the polisario front has 
no interest in creating problems with the united states 
he said morocco must assume responsibility for the attack because 
it directed civilian planes over an area with a huge 
concentration of polisario troops 
the area where the plane was shot down is 650 miles southwest of 
rabat the moroccan capital 
the dc7s were used for spraying locust swarms in senegal which 
borders mauritania to the south aid spokesman bart kull said in 
washington locust infestations have ravaged much of northern africa 
this year 
the planes left dakar senegal earlier thursday and were bound 
for agadir when they came under fire from groundtoair missiles 
the embassy spokesman said 
moroccan government officials said the two planes were attacked 
while they were flying at an altitude of 10000 to 11000 feet in an 
international navigation corridor over bir moghrein northern 
mauritania 
the moroccan sources said officials were trying to locate the 
downed planes wreckage which they said could have scattered over a 
wide area 
mauritania lies east of the western sahara a former spanish 
colony morocco annexed part of the western sahara in 1976 and the 
remaining territory three years later when mauritania withdrew from 
it 
for 13 years the desolate border region has been the scene of a 
guerrilla war waged by the polisario front to establish an 
independent western sahara 
the united nations is mediating talks between morocco and the 
rebels 
in washington fbi spokesman ray mcelhaney said his agency was 
checking to see if it might have jurisdiction to investigate in 
1986 congress passed the omnibus diplomatic security and 
antiterrorist act which made it a crime for any terrorist group to 
assault or kill an american anywhere in the world

nobel laureate andrei d sakharov today called for 
more steps to reduce the size of the soviet military and appealed 
for massive help for the victims of the earthquake in the armenian 
republic 
sakharov arriving to attend a celebration marking the 40th 
anniversary of the universal declaration of human rights said one 
way to cut down the soviet military would be to limit the length of 
service for soviet draftees 
commenting on soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs offer 
wednesday to cut the red army by 500000 men and withdraw thousands 
of tanks and troops from eastern europe he said it was a major 
decision but only a beginning 
the human rights activist and nuclear physicist said reductions 
in manpower and weapons can be done and will change in a major way 
the international situation gorbachev is going in this direction 
and this is very important i would have liked to see bigger cuts 
but what was done is important 
sakharov 67 spoke at a 90minute news conference at the soviet 
embassy 
he twice sidestepped questions about the political implications 
of a meeting he is expected to have with solidarity leader lech 
walesa who left poland for paris today to attend the anniversary 
celebration 
speaking about wednesdays devastating earthquake in armenia 
sakharov said volunteers were needed from all over the world to help 
victims he said he was certain soviet authorities would welcome all 
the help they could get 
all other things have to take second place sakharov said 
including the ethnic unrest between armenian and the neighboring 
azerbaijan republic that has forced an estimated 180000 people to 
flee the two republics 
sakharov a founder of the soviet dissident movement talked at 
length about gorbachevs political and economic restructuring known 
as perestroika saying it cannot yet be called irreversible 
for the west he said the failure of perestroika would be 
dangerous there will be a loss of internal stability in the 
soviet union and therefore of stability in the world because the 
pendulum would swing the other way in an expansionist direction 
sakharov said 
he said the west should support perestroika but not 
unconditionally 
sakharov arrived from boston where he had been visiting 
relatives he was to be joined tonight by his wife yelena bonner 
who was en route from moscow mitterrand invited the recent winners 
of the nobel peace prize walesa won the prize in 1983 sakharov in 
1975

the national geographic society is winding down 
its centennial year facing financial problems with staff reductions 
planned and some book publications curtailed 
the cutbacks were disclosed in a memo to staffers from gilbert m 
grosvenor chairman of the society 
grosvenor said he would strive to make the staff reductions 
primarily through attrition and the transfer of regular staff 
members 
spokeswoman barbara moffett said today reductions are needed in 
the wake of a financial report showing a sharp decline in the 
societys yearend picture 
the reductions could affect about 100 of the societys 2500 
workers according to the washington post 
two childrens book series will be affected by the cutbacks ms 
moffett said 
books for world explorers is being discontinued she said a 
second series books for young explorers will still be published 
but the volumes offered will be reprints of classics from the 
past she said with no new one being developed for the time being 
grosvenors memo thursday noted that the society has employed a 
large number of people on special projects in recent years and 
such personnel will normally be phased out as these activities are 
completed 
indications are that the society will complete 1988 about 2 
million in the black compared to a 29 million surplus last year 
the society which publishes national geographic magazine has 
had large expenses this year including a major effort to improve 
geography education expenses for its birthday celebration and a 
costly holographic cover a threedimensional representation 
produced with a laser on its december magazine 
in addition grosvenor said in his memo that direct mail 
promotion seems to have reached a saturation point for society 
membership 
and the nations demographics are changing he pointed out the 
decline in the nations birth rate has reduced the audience for some 
society publications aimed at children for example

responding to treatment for pneumonia and may miss only one court 
session a court spokeswoman said today 
kathy arberg the spokeswoman said brennan is continuing to 
improve and is resting comfortably 
brennan at 82 the oldest member of the court was taken to the 
bethesda naval medical center in suburban maryland on thursday after 
visiting a doctor at the us capitol court spokeswoman toni house 
said 
justice brennan was admitted with pneumonia she said he 
is being treated with antibiotics and doctors expect him to respond 
very well 
ms house added his illness is not expected to affect his work 
except for the monday dec 12 session 
the court is scheduled to begin a fourweek recess after issuing 
orders and possibly announcing decisions monday 
ms house declined to answer other questions concerning the 
justices health or his hospitalization 
a spokesman for the medical center would confirm that brennan is 
a patient there but declined to offer any information about his 
condition 
a court employee who spoke only on the condition of anonymity 
said brennan left his court office in the early afternoon suffering 
from a fever and the chills 
brennan participated in the courts oral arguments wednesday and 
reportedly has enjoyed good health recently 
his last hospitalization occurred in august 1987 when he checked 
into the mayo clinic in rochester minn for tests on his prostate 
gland

not malignant and no surgery is required brennan said in a

for three decades the courts leading liberal light brennan is 
now one of three liberal octogenarian justices thurgood marshall 
and harry a blackmun are 80 
by comparison the average age of the courts conservative 
justices is about 60 
such demographics have fueled speculation about presidentelect 
bushs impact over the next four years on a court deeply divided 
over such politically explosive issues as abortion and affirmative 
action 
supreme court justices are appointed to life terms by the 
president the appointments must win senate confirmation

a teenager accused of slaying his 
parents brother and sister with an ax must be tried as an adult 
because of public safety concerns the minnesota supreme court ruled 
today 
the supreme court justices unanimously affirmed a ruling of the 
state court of appeals in the case of david brom 17 of rochester 
the ruling said the state had met its burden of proving by 
clear and convincing evidence that dfb brom is unamenable to 
treatment in the juvenile court system consistent with the public 
safety 
a lower court judge had ruled that brom should be tried as a 
juvenile 
brom is accused of killing his parents bernard and paulette 
brom both 41 his sister diane 13 and a brother ricky 11 the 
bodies were found feb 18 in the familys home north of rochester 
each had died of multiple blows with an ax authorities said 
brom was 16 at the time of the slayings he turned 17 on oct 3 
the court of appeals concluded that the lower court judge had 
misinterpreted the effect of a 1980 amendment to juvenile criminal 
justice law the appeals court decided that keeping brom in the 
juvenile court system was inconsistent with the legislatures intent 
there can be no doubt that the offenses here are heinous and 
that the only fair response of the criminal justice system as a 
matter of law must be referral to adult court the appeals court 
said 
brom was arrested feb 19 and has been undergoing treatment at 
the oaks treatment center in austin texas a facility for severely 
disturbed children 
if found guilty in juvenile court he would have been subject to 
state custody until his 19th birthday a conviction of firstdegree 
murder in adult court carries a mandatory life sentence with 
eligibility for parole after 17 years

an inspection prompted by last years fatal 
london subway fire found many weaknesses in fire safety precautions 
and emergency preparedness in new yorks subways 
eleven of the subway systems 48 escalators lack sprinklers 
about one quarter of the token booths inspected have inadequate 
emergency communications equipment and about half the fire 
extinguishers that are supposed to be along the tracks are missing 
or empty according to a report on the inspection released thursday 
the fire in the london underground which killed 31 people began 
when someone dropped a lighted match on a wooden escalator the new 
york subway system does not have wooden escalator treads 
after the london fire the new york city transit authority 
reactivated an old contract to install sprinklers at all 48 
escalators at a cost of 57 million but a month later called off 
the project because of budget concerns 
the new york subway system has not had a fire like the one at 
kings cross station in london but it averages 5000 blazes a year 
mostly minor car and track fires caused by rubbish 
larry reuter the transit authoritys vice president for rapid 
transit said that since the audit his agency has made safety 
improvements and plans more 
the audit found 11 of the subway systems escalators are not 
equipped with sprinklers and warned that inadequate cleaning allows 
flammable debris and grease to build up beneath them 
there have been three escalator fires in the past five years two 
in escalators without sprinklers both apparently were sparked by 
cigarettes although smoking is illegal in the subway system 
since the audit the transit authority has intensified its 
escalator maintenance reuter said 
the audit also found that of the 118 token booths checked 28 had 
neither a working emergency communication system nor a substitute 
auxiliary phone these systems are used to contact the transit 
authority command center which is responsible for calling the fire 
department 
reuter said an 118 million contract to replace the transit 
booth communications systems has been awarded 
transit authority president david gunn wrote in his response to 
the inspection that the authority is trying to deter thefts of fire 
extinguishers 
locking or otherwise securing extinguishers in the tunnels was 
deemed unacceptable he said police stakeouts also are 
utilized this situation is still being studied

the kentucky court of appeals today ordered 
the state board of claims to hold hearings on a group of claims 
filed against the state after the 1977 beverly hills supper club 
fire that killed 165 people 
the board had dismissed the claims without notice in 1987 saying 
it had the inherent power to do so and that it would not have 
been liable to the claimants anyway 
but the appeals court said in a precedentsetting opinion that 
the board and similar administrative agencies unlike courts have 
no inherent powers 
the board of claims is entirely a creature of the legislature 
there is no explicit grant of authority in kentucky law giving 
the board the power to take on an adversarial role and dismiss 
claims on its own motion the court said in a 21 ruling 
the board was created by the general assembly to handle damage 
claims against state agencies which under the kentucky constitution 
cannot be sued for negligence 
the fire on may 28 1977 led to years of litigation against 
dozens of companies that manufactured materials used in the 
construction or furnishing of the club at southgate just across the 
ohio river from cincinnati ohio 
in july 1985 general electric co became the last of 14 
defendants in a federal civil suit against aluminum wiring 
manufacturers to reach settlements totaling 14 million settlements 
by other defendants had totaled 30 million by 1984 
the appeals court upheld campbell circuit court which earlier 
had consolidated the claims by the estates of seven people into a 
single case and ordered it back to the board for hearing the board 
appealed that ruling 
failure to give the claimants notice of dismissal or to allow 
them to respond with legal arguments was a violation of the 
constitutional guarantee of due legal process the appellate panel 
said

as president reagan held what is likely to be 
his last white house news conference many of the reporters 
questions sounded hauntingly like those at his first one but many 
of the answers were different 
the first question when reagan met reporters on jan 29 1981 
was about relations with iran in the aftermath of the long captivity 
of american hostages that had ended on the day of his inaugration 
nine days before 
he said then i dont know whether reconciliation would be 
possible with the present government or absence of a government in 
iran 
one of the last questions thursday night was about relations with 
iran as american hostages continue to be held by radical moslem 
forces in lebanon with whom the iranians are believed to have 
influence 
the president said anytime that they are ready to come forward 
on an open basis we would be ready to talk to them 
the contrast between the two answers was one mark among many of 
the changes that nearly eight years in office have wrought on reagan 
there is no fixed timetable for presidential news conferences so 
this does not have to be the last before reagan leaves office on 
jan 20 in fact white house spokesman marlin fitzwater declined to 
rule out the possibility of another 
the first lady however beseeched reporters on tuesday be 
nice its his last one 
for his own part reagan opened the meeting with reporters by 
cracking weve got to stop meeting like this and when a 
reporter prefaced a question by saying that the session would be the 
presidents last reagan did not demur 
in any event many of the questions and answers had a distinct 
tone of summing up 
with reagan fresh off his fifth meeting with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev it was inevitable that someone would remind 
him of his most famous words at the january 1981 session 
reagan told reporters then i know of no leader of the soviet 
union since the revolution and including the present leadership 
that has not more than once repeated their determination that 
their goal must be the promotion of world revolution 
furthermore he said the soviet leaders have openly and 
publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is what will 
further their cause meaning they reserve unto themselves the right 
to commit any crime to lie to cheat in order to attain that 
thursday night reagan said that was four leaders back before 
this one i think there have been some changes 
asked directly whether he trusted gorbachev the president said 
he hasnt shown me any reason yet why i shouldnt 
reagans to lie to cheat line was one of many memorable 
phrases to come from his news conferences an institution that took 
on an increasingly theatrical tone during the former actors 
administration 
it was at a news conference on feb 21 1985 that he said he was 
not advocating the overthrow of the nicaraguan government or at any 
rate not if the present government would turn around and say all 
right if theyd say uncle 
it was at a news conference on april 9 1986 that he 
characterized libyas moammar gadhafi as this mad dog of the 
middle east 
and it was at a news conference on june 11 1987 in venice 
italy that he said he thought the dollar could decline further 
within reason at a time when his administration was trying to 
keep it from sliding at all 
the first reagan white house news conference like most in the 
early days of his administration was held in a workmanlike 
auditorium in the old executive office building next door to the 
white house 
in mid1982 the sessions were moved to the more ornate if less 
comfortable east room on the glittering state floor of the executive 
residence 
a further refinement was instituted in 1984 instead of 
addressing reporters with his back to the east wall of the room 
reagan switched to the west side giving him a chance to make an 
entrance down a hallway visible through an open door 
our people just got tired of seeing me in the same set he 
cracked at the time 
thursday night the entrance was even more dramatic than usual 
because of christmas decorating at the white house reagan could not 
pop out of the blue room as he usually does but had to enter the 
hall from the red room which is farther away 
despite the changes in trappings however it was the flow of the 
news that set the tone of the news conferences from turmoil in 
central america and lebanon to the irancontra arms and money 
scandal and the battles over the budget deficit 
at that first news conference there were seven questions about 
relations with iran thursday night there was one 
in january 1981 there was one question about relations with the 
soviet union thursday night there were five 
the news conference also showed there is one thing reporters have 
learned in eight years of trying to pin reagan down to specifics 
nearly every reporter thursday night took advantage of the 
opportunity to ask a followup question 
at the first conference in 1981 none of them did

two brothers led a gang that sold 100 
million in cocaine a year and used violence to control the streets 
and drive off competing dealers prosecutors said 
robert dread smith 32 a jamaicanborn alien was among 23 
people named in a 72count federal indictment unsealed thursday if 
convicted he faces a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a 
108 million fine 
smith has been in custody since august on charges that he killed 
one man and wounded another in a 1986 street shooting his trial on 
those charges is set for january 
smith his brother everton 29 and other members of the gang 
routinely used violence to maintain control over those who sold the 
drugs including crack and to keep them from reporting their 
activities to police said us attorney michael baylson 
the defendants 16 of whom were in custody this morning were 
charged with violating federal drug racketeering and firearms laws 
edward leary in charge of the fbi office here said the acts the 
defendants allegedly committed are tantamount to those of an urban 
terrorist group which has violently sought to satisfy its own greed 
by preying upon those addicted to illegal narcotics 
they had little or no regard for anyone who stood in their 
way leary said they have oppressed children into doing their 
bidding and have threatened the fabric of life in this community 
smiths gang allegedly handled an annual average of 2000 pounds 
of cocaine plus an unknown quantity of marijuana said samuel 
billbrough who heads the philadelphia office of the federal drug 
enforcement administration a pound of cocaine sells for about 
11000 wholesale and the retail price is roughly five times that 
making the gross sales more than 100 million yearly billbrough 
said 
all the defendants are charged with conspiracy to manufacture 
cocaine base commonly called crack and to distribute cocaine 
crack and marijuana 
the smiths and two others also are charged with engaging in a 
continuing criminal enterprise in violation of the federal drug 
kingpin law which carries a maximum life sentence

solididarity leader lech walesa today made his first 
foreign trip since polands martiallaw crackdown seven years ago 
and told reporters it was time to leave the stalinist system behind 
after seven years here i am at the dawn of something new 
said a smiling walesa after his arrival at charles de gaulle airport 
walesa who was permitted to accept the invitation of president 
francois mitterrand to join observances of the 40th anniversary of 
the universal declaration of human rights said he was looking 
forward to meeting soviet physicist andrei sakharov another nobel 
peace prize laureate invited by mitterrand to saturdays ceremonies 
we both still feel he and i the breath of stalin at our 
backs walesa said speaking polish through an interpreter the 
stalin era is over now i am waiting for the return to pluralism and 
the restoration of rights 
before leaving warsaw walesa told reporters there are several 
elements which cause hope that everythings going to be better 
but he said problems remained such the governments monopoly on 
trade unions and its handling of social political and economic 
problems 
that is still the breath of stalin it was not communism it 
was him and we have to end it by way of evolution and not 
revolution 
id like to reach an agreement at last on pluralism and to 
finish the stalinist system for good he said 
walesa also was to confer with french trade unionists the mayor 
of paris and cardinal jeanmarie lustiger leader of the french 
roman catholic church before returning monday 
walesa bundled in a thick coat and sporting a frontbilled fur 
cap received cheers of bravo lech when he arrived at warsaws 
central train station from gdansk earlier in the day 
crowds also gathered around him and historian bronislaw geremek 
at the airport with parents holding up children for a better view 
geremek a senior solidarity adviser was accompanying walesa on 
the trip 
in a departure from past practice the statecontrolled media 
treated walesa as a public figure instead of as a private citizen 
his departure for paris was listed by the official pap news 
agency as one of its top stories of the day 
it was the first time since the imposition of martial law in 
poland in december 1981 that walesa received permission to travel 
abroad 
the issuance of a passport to him monday coincided with 
increasingly positive treatment of walesa in the official press 
since he appeared in a nationwide television debate nov 30 
walesa was viewed by supporters as having handily won the debate 
with official unions chief alfred miodowicz and the 
nonconfrontational tone of his remarks drew praise even from 
normally hostile government officials 
the solidarity leader last left poland in october 1981 also to 
visit france 
walesa has led solidarity since the inception of the first 
independent trade union in the soviet bloc in august 1980 
walesa had insisted geremek a french medieval scholar who speaks 
french fluently accompany him also making the trip with walesa was 
andrzej wielowieyski vice president of the warsaw club of catholic

on horseback and oxdrawn wagons 
afrikaners paraded into the city friday to celebrate the 150th 
anniversary of the white pioneers trek into the countrys heartland 
the march held seven days before the official anniversary was 
organized by rightwing white groups they object to the upcoming 
governmentbacked ceremony which has been billed as open to all 
races 
nearly 1000 whites dressed in 19th century pioneer outfits 
arrived in downtown pretoria to mark the great trek the 1838 
journey by afrikaners away from the britishruled cape colony into 
the countrys uncharted interior 
altogether about 3000 people attended the parade with wagons 
arriving from several locations across the country 
the great trek is the most momentous event in afrikaner history 
stories about hardships on the journey and battles with african 
tribesmen have taken on mythical proportions for the dutchdescended 
afrikaners who dominate the government 
today we remember how our ancestors built this country into a 
civilized area where its safe for whites to live said dann 
combrink 62 
combrink wearing a leather vest and widebrimmed hat was 
accompanied by his wife in a period costume that included a bonnet 
and a fulllength lavender and white dress with lace trim 
this a day afrikaners should be together said combrink 
organizers said blacks were not welcome at fridays ceremony or 
at an evening gathering at the voortrekker monument a huge granite 
structure on a hill overlooking the capital 
the great trek marked the coming of our oppression the 
stripping of our rights said a 45yearold black man who asked to 
be identified only as george when i see this i am very angry 
very bitter 
the 100th anniversary commemoration held in 1938 is regarded as 
the catalyst that united the afrikaners and gave impetus to their 
political organizations ten years later the afrikanerdominated 
national party came to power and began codifying their apartheid 
policies of racial segregation 
but the two separate trek celebrations illustrate the fracture 
between rightwing afrikaners who oppose all concessions to the 
countrys black majority and presidents pw bothas national 
party which calls for gradual race reforms and limited 
powersharing 
fridays ceremony was organized by the afrikaner peoples guard 
a rightwing cultural group the contingent that received the 
loudest applause was from the neonazi afrikaner resistance 
movement led by the charismatic eugene terreblanche 
most members of terreblanches group opted not for the 19th 
century attire of their ancestors but wore khaki outfits with 
swastikalike emblems on the shoulders 
terreblanche and his followers received sustained cheers as they 
rode around church square in the city center in front of the 
courthouse where five black antiapartheid leaders were sentenced to 
prison thursday on treason and terrorism convictions following a 
controversial trial 
the governmentsponsored trek left cape town on aug 27 for the 
870mile trip to pretoria despite the governments announced 
intention of opening the celebrations to all races few nonwhites 
have participated 
the government functions will dominate the next week leading up 
to the day of the vow a national holiday on dec 16 
on that day in 1838 the afrikaners vowed to make the date 
forever holy if they defeated a hostile zulu tribe they did so in 
the battle of blood river and the day remains the most revered in 
afrikaner history

served 20 months in a greek jail for arms smuggling his extradition 
was approved by the greek supreme court in 1984 but never carried 
out alzomar was sentenced to another 20 months in 1987 for having 
a knife in his jail cell 
on tuesday greece put alzomar on a plane to libya justice 
minister vassilis rotis said greece did not extradite him because 
alzomar was acting in the struggle for the independence of his 
country referring to the palestinian fight for a homeland in 
israelioccupied territory 
both greek and other western intelligence officials believe 
alzomar belongs to the terrorist group of abu nidal

things that are constructive shultz said in a final appeal for 
unity within the north atlantic treaty organization 
he stressed that even with the soviet cutbacks to be carried out 
over two years the warsaw pact still would retain an enormous 
advantage in battle tanks artillery and other armaments 
they will be significant and make a difference shultz said 
but they leave a situation still very assymetrical we shouldnt 
forget that 
for instance shultz said reading from data compiled by nato on 
conventional forces the warsaw pacts edge in divisions would be 
reduced to 2911 from 2991 in tanks to 2181 from 2761 and 
in artillery to 1741 from 230 to 1 
in a similar vein nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner told 
reporters we cannot base our security on the good or bad 
intentions or the personality of the soviet leaders 
the former west german defense minister added you know that we 
look upon mr gorbachev with sympathy and encourage his reform 
efforts while they lead to more human rights and more responsible 
conduct in foreign affairs and a reduction in military capability 
but woerner said nato must keep its defenses strong and 
modernize weapons even while negotiating cutbacks with the warsaw 
pact in talks expected to open next month in vienna 
as a group the foreign ministers pledged we will continue to 
seize every opportunity to cooperate in the search for political 
solutions to eastwest differences 
however they also urged tangible and lasting changes from 
the soviet union to help solve the problems dividing east and west 
soviet forces stationed in europe which nato estimated at 22 
million still exceed any reasonable defense need and moscow 
and its allies still have to meet fully their obligations on human 
rights 
the ministers on thursday announced the broad outline of the 
position nato will take in the conventional stability talks with the 
warsaw pact once a 35nation human rights conference in vienna is 
concluded 
in a separate statement nato reaffirmed that trade with the 
soviet union and its allies should be based on commercially sound 
terms and mutual advantage 
the statement rejected any notion of providing preferential 
treatment to the soviets who are eager for western technology to 
help carry out gorbachevs perestroika program of reconstructing the 
soviet economy 
the western ministers said they wanted to avoid contributing 
further to soviet military capabilities by extending concessions 
in the arms area dutch foreign minister hans van den broek told 
reporters that after gorbachevs speech wednesday to the un 
general assembly in new york the climate for the conventional 
negotations has considerably improved much needs to happen but 
things are looking up

china on friday honored the 40th anniversary of 
the united nations declaration of human rights although questions 
remain about this nations commitment to such concepts 
fei xiaotong a wellknown sociologist was quoted by the 
official xinhua news agency as saying that china actively supports 
the development of human rights 
fei speaking at a forum to commemorate the un declaration 
said chinas constitution guarantees individual rights including 
freedom of religion and equality before the law 
he noted however that the struggle for human rights should 
concentrate not on individual freedoms but on fighting colonialism 
racism and foreign invasion 
the report was the latest in a series of articles in the official 
press stressing chinas position that collective rights are more 
important than individual liberties 
a xinhua report this week said china believes that civil 
liberties rights of minorities and women belong to the internal 
affairs of a country and advised other countries not to meddle in 
those questions 
an article in the nov 28 issue of beijing review an official 
weekly softpedaled discussion of individual liberties human 
rights it said were a key part in the efforts of third world 
countries to establish a new economic order 
by pushing such a policy china can justify both its criticism of 
apartheid in south africa and its rejection of accusations about its 
policies in tibet or its oneparty state 
it is no good to force one countrys standards on another 
fridays xinhua report said interference in a countrys internal 
affairs on the pretext of human rights should be strictly 
forbidden 
western human rights groups have persisted in criticizing chinas 
record 
in february the washingtonbased group asia watch said chinese 
authorities tortured tibetan activists seeking independence from 
china and performed forced abortions on members of minority groups 
proindependence tibetans have rioted twice in the past two 
years leaving dozens dead in lhasa the regions capital 
the asia watch report quoted one tibetan as saying if one 
speaks forcefully if one gives an account of tibet as being 
independent they apply cattle prods 
earlier this year the us congress also criticized china for 
its actions in tibet 
an amnesty international report in april accused china of denying 
prisoners access to lawyers or their families in earlier years the 
londonbased group has called for the release of wei jingsheng 
chinas most prominent dissident who as a leading member of the 
democracy movement was jailed in 1979 
last week one of weis former associates ren wanding who spent 
four years in jail for his views renewed his call for free 
elections in china 
ren who was freed in 1983 also appealed to the united nations 
to intercede on behalf of his fellow dissidents like wei still 
imprisoned 
the un declaration on human rights was passed in 1948 and 
guarantees political economic and cultural rights as well as the 
right of selfdetermination sovereignty and territorial 
independence 
china signed the declaration in 1971 when it joined the united 
nations this year marked the first time china has honored the 
document

the plain english campaign on friday bestowed eight 
golden bull awards for what it regarded as particularly 
undistinguished examples of doubletalk and obfuscation 
this year has been a record year for gobbledygook we could 
have given out hundreds of bulls without any problem said 
chrissie maher who helped start the campaign nine years ago 
she cited the latest regulations for claiming state public 
assistance for housing saying they lengthened many forms by over 
a half yet the government minister who introduced them claimed they 
would simplify the system the truth is that the forms are now so 
long they deter people from claiming 
one of the 6inchhigh golden bulls went to sooner snacks ltd 
for a letter to a customer who complained that her potato chips were 
purple 
potato varieties with pigmented skins owe their color to 
anthocyanins dissolved in the cell sap of the periderm and cells of 
the peripheral cortex the letter said 
when a chip is discolored the letter added it is difficult to 
say whether this is due to a process of active migration of the 
anthocyanin from the periderm and cortex or to primary protection 
within the flesh of the tuber 
the department of health and social security was cited for its 
response to a widows inquiry about her pension 
it explained that basic retirement pension based wholly or 
partially upon the contributions of her late husband cannot be paid 
in full to a widow who is getting such a benefit she can only be 
paid the balance of basic retirement pension and increase for 
putting off retirement which is left after taking off her war 
widows pension or the part of the basic retirement pension which 
is based purely on her own contributions plus any increase for 
putting off her retirement whichever is the more favorable 
lloyds bank won a bull for a counter indemnity form which said 
iwe jointly and severally undertake in the event of any claim 
being made upon you thereunder or under any increase or decrease 
thereof or extension or renewal thereof whether for the same or for 
a greater or less amount which you may hereafter make or agree to 
at myour request and in the event of the validity of such claim 
being disputed by meus from time to time and so on for more 
than 100 words before reaching the end of the sentence

gas leaked past a caulked seal in the nozzle of 
a rocket booster used to launch space shuttle discovery in 
september but a nasa official said friday that this was anticipated 
by the design and is a nonproblem 
royce mitchell manager of the booster program at the marshall 
space flight center said in a telephone interview that an 
examination of the disassembled discovery solidfuel rockets showed 
the engines worked as expected and that the gas leakage has been 
seen in testing and is considered a normal event 
were very happy with these motors mitchell said 
mitchell said engineers examining the disassembled rocket parts 
found that gas seeped between panels of ablative material in the 
nozzle of one of the two boosters 
the national aeronautics and space administration official said 
the nozzles of the solid rocket boosters are lined with panels of 
ablative material that is designed to burn away during the firing of 
the rocket this action keeps extreme heat from penetrating the 
interior of the rocket nozzle 
between the panels of ablative material mitchell said engineers 
designed in a small gap to allow for thermal expansion 
as just one more little protection we inject an rtv room 
temperature vulcanizing silicone in there he said from time 
to time we get some gas past this thermal filler 
but he said the rocket booster nozzle is designed to accommodate 
this gas leakage and that the leak seen on the discovery rocket 
engines was not unexpected or damaging two oring seals are the 
primary protection against leak of the gas and neither of these 
seals showed that they had been touched by superheated gas or flame 
mitchell said that during fullscale tests of the rocket motor 
an unfilled 10inch gap was left between the ablative panels of the 
nozzle to demonstrate that were tolerant to a leak through that 
gap 
not even the sheen was taken off the surface of the o rings 
mitchell said of the test 
the accident that destroyed challenger which blew up 73 seconds 
after liftoff from the kennedy space center in january 1986 was 
blamed on the leak of gas or flame from a field joint of a solid 
rocket booster 
since then the rocket engines have been redesigned and tested 
with fullscale firings the discovery launch in september the 
first shuttle mission since challenger used the new rocket design 
mitchell said engineers are only now beginning to examine the 
engines used last week for the launch of space shuttle atlantis but 
that no problem has been found with those rockets 
this is a good motor he said were ready to fly again 
the next shuttle flight is scheduled for january

an aging liberal bloc on the supreme court 
anchored by ailing justice william j brennan is prompting renewed 
speculation on the impact presidentelect bush will have on the 
courts future 
brennan hospitalized thursday with pneumonia was reported 
friday to be improving at the bethesda naval medical center court 
spokeswoman toni house said he may miss little time on the bench 
since the high court begins a fourweek recess monday 
brennan 82 is the courts oldest justice and senior member in 
terms of service 
he is two years older than the courts two other most consistent 
liberals justices thurgood marshall and harry a blackmun both 80 
aside from brennans current bout with pneumonia the three have 
appeared to be in good health and have given no signs they plan to 
step down anytime soon 
including justice john paul stevens 68 the average age of the 
courts liberal bloc is over 77 
by contrast the average age of the five more conservative 
members is slightly under 60 
that group includes three appointees of president reagan sandra 
day oconnor 58 named in 1981 as the first woman on the high 
court and antonin scalia 52 and anthony m kennedy 52 both 
named during reagans second term 
in addition reagan elevated william h rehnquist 64 to chief 
justice to succeed warren e burger 
the ninth justice byron r white 71 an appointee of president 
kennedy votes more often with the conservatives on key issues 
while brennans illness lends new drama to conjecture about the 
high courts future bush may have a more immediate impact on the 
lower federal courts 
bush is expected to search out conservatives to fill the existing 
41 federal court vacancies 32 trial judgeships and nine appeals 
court posts there could be many more for the president to fill over 
the next four years 
observers doubt that bush will be as devoted to conservative 
ideology as reagan who made 375 judicial appointments filling more 
than half the total 
guessing bushs likely supreme court appointees is a parlor game 
with conflicting clues 
the presidentelect has said he likes moderate people with 
conservative views 
he also pledged during the campaign to pick judges who will 
interpret the constitution not legislate from the bench 
i will appoint judges who dont reserve all their sympathy for 
criminals who understand that victims have rights too bush said 
as further evidence of bushs conservative leanings he supported 
reagans unsuccessful attempt to place robert h bork on the high 
court 
bork opposed for his conservative ideology was defeated last 
year in a bruising political battle in the democraticcontrolled 
senate 
associates of bush are quick to point out that the 
presidentelect was a close friend of the late potter stewart a 
moderate justice with much the same upperclass lineage 
asked if bush was likely to pick someone closer to stewart than 
bork if there is a supreme court vacancy bush spokeswoman sheila 
tate declined to speculate 
thats a pothole over which i will leap she said 
a republican strategist who requested anonymity predicted bush 
will not choose anyone who is anathema to the movement 
conservatives the republican ideologues who rallied around bork 
that strategy may rule out attorney general dick thornburgh the 
former governor of pennsylvania whose conservative credentials have 
been questioned 
thornburgh himself said in a recent interview with the associated 
press that judicial restraint is a qualification for the bench 
he said he favors picking the best person available 
bush also has said he will not impose a litmus test on judicial 
appointees antiabortions would like assurances that the next 
justice if given the chance will vote to overturn the high courts 
landmark roe vs wade decision of 1973 that legalized abortion 
nationwide 
legal experts offer a crosssection of names including some 
moderates when asked to speculate on likely bush choices for the 
high court 
the largest group consists of federal judges and includes the 
following reagan appointees to the bench 
patrick e higgonbotham 49 an appeals court judge in texas 
praised for his intelligence he could face conservative opposition 
because of a 1986 ruling that threw out antiabortion laws 
ralph k winter jr 52 an appeals court judge in connecticut 
j harvie wilkinson iii 44 an appeals court judge in virginia 
kenneth w starr 42 a judge on the prestigious and important 
federal appeals court in washington dc and another in the 
prominent coterie of youthful conservatives picked by reagan 
pamela a rymer 47 a federal judge in los angeles since 1983 
possibilities from outside the judiciary include 
james a baker 58 bushs close friend and choice to be 
secretary of state but gop insiders doubt baker is interested in 
becoming a justice 
sen orrin g hatch rutah 54 one of the nations most 
conservative lawmakers who led the defense of bork during the senate 
confirmation battle

removed from his colon in july 1985 
the 67yearold first lady had her left breast removed in october 
1987 after a cancerous tumor was detected 
huttons statement also included a plug for the importance of 
such routine examinations 
the first lady continues to emphasize the importance of 
mammography breast xray for early detection of cancer of the 
breast the mammogram remains the most essential diagnostic test for 
early detection of a malignancy he said 
huttons statement said reagan will have a colonoscopy a chest 
xray a cat scan a cardiac stress test and a pulmonary function 
evaluation 
the first lady will have her second mammogram since undergoing 
the surgery an operation known as a modified radical mastectomy in

stepfather the late dr loyal davis of chicago 
in the presidents initial cancer surgery doctors removed the 
twoinch cancerous polyp and nearly two feet of colon as well as 
the surrounding tissue 
since the 1985 surgery reagan has undergone five colonoscopies 
to check for any recurrence of cancer in that procedure a long 
flexible instrument that uses fiberoptic technology is inserted in 
the large intestine to allow doctors to see inside the bowel 
each time except for the last such test in anuary doctors found 
small fleshy growths known as polyps and removed them in each 
procedure the polyps were found to be noncancerous 
the growths generally cause no serious symptoms but if left 
alone can grow into cancerous lesions

students at a conservative 
christian school were given national rifle association coloring 
books on gun safety friday and the superintendent dismissed any 
criticism as ridiculous and nonscholarly 
the christian liberty academy distributed the sixpage books to 
students from kindergarten through fifth grade 
theyre constantly being exposed to guns on tv at the movies 
in the comics of every newspaper said the rev paul lindstrom 
superintendent of the 325student school and its affiliates and 
homeschooling program which involve a total of 25000 pupils 
if we get good feedback well order more books for other 
schools he said 
children coming across an actual gun will be inquisitive nine 
chances out of 10 theyll pick it up and finger it chances are they 
will get hurt lindstrom said 
we teach them to honor their father and mother and god by not 
playing with it 
my gun safety book features two children who find a handgun 
on a table if children find a gun the book stresses they should 
leave it alone leave the scene and tell their parents 
some educators and law enforcement officials believe such a book 
takes the wrong approach because it assumes guns will be available 
to children some critics say the nra the nations strongest 
advocate of the rights of gun owners should have no role in 
educating youngsters 
but tracey martin who heads the coloring book project for the 
nra said the organization has promoted gun safety for 117 years and 
the book is just part of our continuing obligation 
lindstrom also dismissed criticism of the effort 
its a kneekerk reaction that is ridiculous and 
nonscholarly he said 
the conservative activist who spent 10 days in an atlanta jail 
after protesting at abortion clinics in august said hes interested 
in the safety of children 
i dont have any great love for the american civil liberties 
union but if the aclu comes out with a coloring book that says you 
shouldnt go with strangers who offer candy ill use that coloring 
book in the school lindstrom said 
im an educator im interested in the message lindstrom 
said we use books from all kinds of publishers they might have 
all kinds of political agendas 
ms martin said said friday from nra headquarters in washington 
that the christian liberty academy got the books through jim 
zangrilli an nra board member in the west chicago suburb of oak 
park 
she said the organization has not formally started a campaign to 
distribute the books 
we havent done any promotion of it we dont really have the 
classroom kits finished yet she said 
however public schools in minnesota iowa nebraska and 
pennsylvania have requested copies she said declining to name 
specific schools without their permission the book also is being 
considered by chicago public school officials said school board 
spokesman ken moses

an elementary school music teacher 
has agreed to stop teaching religious christmas carols because a 
jewish parent complained it violated her childs constitutional 
rights officials said 
sandy miller will not teach carols such as silent night or 
god rest ye merry gentlemen for the rest of the holiday season 
officials of colorado springs school district 11 said thursday 
school district officials said they will try to determine whether 
carols are appropriate for district classrooms spokesman paul kemp 
said 
were asking our attorneys to research it legally and well 
take a look at our curriculum adoption policy in the area of music 
and see if we are meeting the needs of all children kemp said 
miller and the parent who complained about the carols sari 
escovitz declined to comment 
the constitutionality of singing religious christmas carols in 
school involves the same first amendment concerns that have led the 
us supreme court to bar officially sanctioned school prayers said 
richard collins a professor and specialist in constitutional law at 
the university of colorado at boulder 
the question is is this schools involvement in the christmas 
season extensive enough to constitute religious observance 
collins said it depends on the coerciveness of the school and the 
depth and seriousness of the observance

a senior mongolian official on friday 
welcomed soviet president mikhail gorbachevs pledge to reduce 
soviet troop strength in this central asian country and said the 
process already has begun 
first deputy foreign minister daramyn endon said all the soviet 
troops could be pulled out if relations with china continue to 
improve 
we dont think there is a need for foreign troops endon told 
a news conference 
he said mongolia and its close ally the soviet union had 
decided to cut a large portion of the soviet garrison in mongolia in 
order to strengthen mutual understanding and trust with other asian 
countries especially china 
gorbachev told the united nations on wednesday he planned to 
reduce the soviet army by nearly 10 percent and unilaterally reduce 
the soviet troop presence in east europe and mongolia 
endon refused to say how many soviet troops will be withdrawn or 
by when he said military experts have yet to make those decisions 
i can only say that a large part of the soviet troops will be 
withdrawn he said the process has already begun and will 
continue until the end 
the presence of about 1 million soviet troops along chinas 
border including those inside mongolia has been one of the major 
obstacles to ending the nearly 30yearold chinesesoviet rift 
last year the soviet union withdrew one division containing about 
12000 troops from mongolia leaving about 50000 by western 
estimates they are believed to be confronted by an equal number of 
chinese soldiers on the opposite side of the 2900milelong 
chinesemongolian border 
endon praised recent improvements in chinesemongolian relations 
that have accompanied the warming trend between beijing and moscow 
he said there has been much progress toward normalization of 
government and party relations the two countries signed trade and 
consular agreements in 1986 
he said mongolias foreign minister will visit china next year 
for the first time since the chinesesoviet split 
endon noted that during the 1950s when mongolia and china were 
on good terms mongolia did not station any troops along its border 
with china he said mongolia ideally would be able to cut its own 
military forces if relations with china continue to improve 
instead of sending our young men to the army we could use them 
in the building of socialism he said

la coupole the landmark left bank restaurant where 
struggling young artists like chagall and picasso traded their 
paintings for hot meals reopened friday after eight months of 
renovations restoring its 1920s decor 
la coupole is more than a restaurant its an institution 
said jeanpaul bucher la coupoles new owner 
bucher president of the groupe flo chain of brasseries known for 
good food fair prices and quick service said the coupole 
machine still had to be oiled and would get off to a slow start 
so as not to disappoint regular customers 
the menu still features house specialities like lamb curry steak 
tartar and baked alaska and there are welcome additions from flos 
nouvelle cuisine fare prices have been held down bucher said and 
the lamb curry served with three tasty chutneys can be had for 15 
la coupole has been a watering hole for artists and 
intellectuals movie stars and politicians since it opened 61 years 
ago with jean cocteau man ray andre derain and louis aragon on 
hand for the champagne 
a decade later ernest hemingway and willian faulkner nursed 
double scotches there while henry miller and lawrence durrell played 
chess long into the night 
the postworld war ii generation of existentialists made la 
couple their haunt until his death in 1980 jeanpaul sartre 
lunched there daily with simone de beauvoir 
the coupoles main dining room is a classified historical 
monument and renovations of its vintage 1920s decor cost an 
estimated 5 million 
on hand for the inaugural lunch of foie gras scallops chicken 
fricasee and an orange mousse cake washed down with vintage medoc 
wines was rene lafon 91 the coupoles original owner 
entering the restaurant i was very happy to find my coupole 
he said 
the famed 32 pillars wrapped with original but mostly unsigned 
canvasses painted by artists from the school of paris turned out 
to be a pandoras box 
under the cracking plaster workmen found a type of emerald green 
stone that looked like marble though it was once the rage of paris 
and still adorns the facade of some of the citys loveliest 
buildings repairs were no easy matter this manmade stone is no 
longer manufactured 
the paintings themselves had been darkened beyond recognition by 
60 years of smoke and cooking grime they are now more resplendent 
than ever thanks to four wellpositioned spotlights on each post 
we can really see the enormous variety of styles and colors 
adopted by painters of the school of paris marie lyse de 
castelbajac head of the restoration team told the associated press 
she said very few of the paintings are signed and are thus a 
mystery that is unlikely ever to be solved 
one painting has picasso colors but its forms are pure 
modigliani so its hard to say for sure whose it is she said 
i guess that will always be part of la coupoles charm

refugees in this camp where 
the palestinian uprising began a year ago were shut inside their 
shacks under military curfew friday but they said jailings and 
economic hardship wouldnt halt their rebellion 
we are preparing for a long struggle palestinians have reached 
a point of no return said a medical official in jabaliya the 
largest and most militant camp in the gaza strip 
jabaliyas narrow dirt alleys were deserted friday except for a 
few goats picking through garbage piles the occasional roar of an 
army jeep was the only sound breaking the silence a few residents 
peered from the windows of their cement and corrugated tin huts 
on dec 9 1987 the camp was the site of the first demonstration 
in what came to be known as the intefadeh or uprising about 
1000 palestinians shouting death to the israelis and chanting 
islamic slogans hurled stones at soldiers troops opened fire 
killing 17yearold hatem abu sisi 
since then more than a dozen residents have been killed in 
clashes and more than 1000 treated for gunshot and beating 
injuries the camps 60000 refugees have been confined to their 
homes for 116 days in the past year and money is tight 
most young men are in jail the next generation has taken their 
place said the medical official speaking on condition of 
anonymity the stonethrowers are now 13 and 14 years old 
palestinians throughout the occupied territories seem to have 
settled in for a long confrontation with israel while trying at the 
same time to maintain some normalcy 
this has become our way of life said a 24yearold teacher 
for handicapped children who would only give his first name emad 
scores of members of his extended family were gathered in the 
lush backyard of his home in gaza citys middleclass rimal 
district in the past year it has become a clan custom to meet 
during strikes and curfews to help pass the time emad said 
the uprising has touched even the youngest emad said he pointed 
to his nephew ahmed a 2yearold with curly blond hair who was 
hiding shyly behind one of the adults the first word he learned 
was soldier not mother or father emad said 
emad said he had planned to get married on saturday but had to 
postpone the wedding because of fridays indefinite curfew which 
confined the gaza strips 650000 residents to their homes 
at ahli arab hospital a fiveminute drive away doctors had 
settled into their strike day routine during strikes called by 
the plobacked underground leadership the casualty toll usually 
rises in part due to increased army raids 
in the beginning we were completely overwhelmed by the number 
of casualties said a senior surgeon who refused to be further 
identified he said 4200 patients had been admitted in the past 
year most with injuries sustained during the uprising 
now all doctors are on duty on strike days elective surgery is 
postponed and patients with light injuries are sent home to free 
beds 
on friday only few clashes were reported in gaza and by midday 
doctors had only treated four beating victims 
in the west bank refugee camp of balata four palestinians were 
wounded after moslem noon prayers arab hospital officials said 
the relative calm was in part the result of the curfews and 
heavy army presence dozens of jeeps patrolled gaza citys streets 
and foot patrols combed jabaliya and the nearby shati camp 
the low level of violence also indicated that palestinians are 
shifting their emphasis from street confrontations to 
nationbuilding as the uprising enters its second year the 
palestine national council declared a palestinian state during a 
nov 15 session in algiers 
as part of the effort local popular committees run by proplo 
activists organize anticrime patrols provide first aid visit 
families of those killed and settle disputes 
israel has outlawed the committees but activists said the groups 
continue to function taking the place of the old leadership of clan 
heads and and israeliappointed officials 
we will have a state but we dont expect it quickly said 
sammy 26 a top activist in the outlawed shabiba youth movement of 
plo chief yasser arafats fatah group in the meantime its 
important to show we are a nation

the executive director of the naacp said today 
that presidentelect bush told him he intends to appoint a black to 
his cabinet 
hooks a democrat spent about 30 minutes with bush discussing a 
range of issues of concern to blacks including judicial and cabinet 
appointments hooks called the session very cordial 
asked if bush had pledged to name a black to a highlevel job 
hooks said i think i do remember him saying there would be a 
black in the cabinet hooks then said it was his distinct 
recollection that he said he intends to do that 
hooks said he suggested to bush that the presidentelect convene 
a white house conference on race and poverty after the inauguration 
next month 
on thursday bush met with 60 black republicans who had 
campaigned for his election 
joshua smith a businessman from rockville md said the group 
expressed concern that a black has yet to be tapped for the cabinet 
but said the meeting was frictionfree 
we have great hopes he said we have confidence he is 
going to follow through on his promise 
arthur fletcher a washington businessman and official in the 
nixon and ford administrations said there is reason to believe 
there could be a black appointed to one of the domestic cabinet 
jobs still unfilled 
vacancies remaining include those at the departments of health 
and human services housing and urban development energy interior 
veterans affairs and the newly created drug czar 
bush according to smith told the black supporters that we 
will over the term be pleased he did not make any specific 
commitments as to numbers and individuals 
fletcher said one problem facing bush is that there are so few 
black republicans qualified for administration jobs 
they would have to look all over the place said fletcher 
who called the dearth of black republicans a tragedy and called 
for steppedup gop recruitment of blacks 
the blacks said they were pleased with the energetic session they 
had with lee atwater tapped to be the new republican national 
committee chairman 
since the election bush has appointed nine people to 
cabinetlevel posts and selected a handful of others for powerful 
jobs 
among those selected are one woman carla hills named as the 
us trade representative and one hispanic holdover education 
secretary lauro cavazos 
while blacks have been mentioned for leading jobs they have not 
been given any of them 
alan keyes a former state department official who ran 
unsuccessfully for the us senate in maryland this year was 
thought to have a good chance of becoming un ambassador the 
position was given instead to thomas pickering a career diplomat 
who has served as ambassador in el salvador israel nigeria and 
jordan 
dr louis w sullivan president of the morehouse school of 
medicine in atlanta is under consideration for secretary of health 
and human services 
sullivan said he has told bush transition aides he was interested 
in the no 1 job at that department but not in the second job 
robert woodson a black businessman from north carolina is in 
the running for secretary of housing and urban development but the 
leading prospect appears to be rep jack kemp rny 
in other transition developments 
rep john paul hammerschmidt dark is being pushed for the 
job at the veterans department rep sonny montgomery dmiss 
chairman of the house veterans committee and rep gerald solomon 
rny wrote bush in support of hammerschmidt 
a group of western senators is recommending four people for the 
post of interior secretary the prospects include richard richards 
a onetime rnc chairman rep barbara vucanovich rnev warren 
morton former speaker of the wyoming house and rep john rhodes of 
arizona 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said bush may be making his first serious misstep by 
prolonging speculation over whether former sen john tower will be 
appointed defense secretary for weeks there has been speculation 
that tower is the leading contender for the job 
sen jake garn rutah who flew on the space shuttle says he 
is not interested in running the national aeronautics and space 
administration among others reortedly in the running are sally 
ride the first american woman in space william graham science 
adviser to president reagan and frank borman former president of 
eastern airlines and an exastronaut

the arab league said friday it will campaign to 
make the palestine liberation organization an observermember of the 
united nations putting the organization on a level with switzerland 
and the vatican 
we are now going to try and get a resolution that would make 
the palestinian state an observermember of the united nations 
clovis maksoud the leagues us and un representative said at a 
news conference 
the session was called primarily to discuss next weeks special 
un general assembly meeting in geneva at which plo chairman yasser 
arafat will speak arafat was denied a us visa on grounds he has 
been involved in terrorism 
the league formed in 1945 comprises 21 arab states and 
palestine which it says is represented by the plo 
the plo is currently one of two groups with permanent observer 
missions to the united nations the other being the southwest 
africa peoples organization the current status recognizes their 
claim to represent peoples 
the new designation would rank the plo among nonmember 
states elevating the status of the palestinian people in 
israelioccupied territory 
maksoud said there would be no point in trying to make the plo a 
full member because it could not win approval by the united states 
in the security council but he added maybe this can be a 
transition to full membership at a later date 
the nonmember states are monaco north and south korea san 
marino switzerland and the vatican 
discussing the israeli raid friday at naameh 50 miles inside 
lebanon maksoud called it a preemptive strike against the peace 
option and timed to coincide with the first anniversary of the 
start of uprisings in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
this is a signal of further oppression yet to come maksoud 
said this is unprovoked violence by israel there has been no 
provocation it is an attempt to destabilize lebanon and to continue 
its illegal occupation of the south of lebanon 
maksoud criticized president reagans comment at his news 
conference thursday night that arafats statement wednesday saying 
the plo accepts israel and rejects terrorism in all its forms 
was ambiguous 
we consider that mr arafats statements have been clear 
unequivocal and categorical he said there isnt any 
ambiguity 
maksoud said that to include the uprising within the context of 
terrorism as the reaction of the united states seems to include is 
mindboggling and unacceptable

officials and employees of usa today are 
concerned about an unusually high number of miscarriages among women 
working in its newsroom 
some employees at the newspapers suburban washington 
headquarters fear that a reported 14 miscarriages among 100 women 
employees over the past 15 months may be partially attributed to 
several months of construction work in the offices or to prolonged 
exposure to video terminals 
editor peter prichard said friday that the company is giving 
close attention to the matter 
senior editor wanda lloyd who confirmed only that there have 
been some miscarriages said certainly the company is 
concerned about anything to do with employees im concerned im 
very concerned 
but she also said this is an internal matter and a very 
personal matter for the women involved were still looking into it 
and we dont really have any more to say 
the washington post on friday reported that 14 miscarriages had 
occurred among usa today employees since september 1987 
scientists say about one in seven pregnancies ends in a 
miscarriage and that there have been studies of about a dozen 
cluster occurrences in the united states and canada since 1980 a 
common thread in the incidences was the use of video terminals in 
the offices although no direct link has been made between their use 
and pregnancy problems 
a usa today reporter who asked not to be identified said the 
company brought in experts on video terminals to discuss any danger 
they might pose and has been taking an informal survey of employees 
to determine the extent of the problem 
management also has sent out a memo telling employees not to talk 
about the miscarriages the employee said 
the sheer magnitude of the construction work caused a lot of 
concern the reporter said guys with jackhammers were breaking 
up walls right next to your head youd walk in to find your 
terminal covered with dust and there were weird smells very 
pungent odors 
allen j wilcox an epidemiologist who has studied miscarraiges 
for the national institute of environmental health sciences said he 
had no personal knowledge of the usa today cases but they appear to 
be significant enough to merit study 
he said however it was possible the occurrences were only 
coincidence and it is likely no cause will ever be proved extensive 
epidemiological studies would be required to determine whether there 
was any common cause he said since a number of factors could have 
contributed to each case 
the post did not say how many staff members had been pregnant 
but one employee said there were no successful pregnancies among 
women working on the two floors that have been undergoing 
rennovation since april 
gannett co inc which owns the internationally distributed 
newspaper recently hired a consultant to test materials being 
installed during renovation the post reported 
theres a lot of concern in the building about the 
construction especially among women who have miscarried said 
peter johnson a general assignment reporter interviewed by the 
post he said the company appeared to be genuinely concerned 
about the problem 
everyone is real frightened a women who had a miscarriage 
and who asked not to be identified was quoted by the post as 
saying you dont know whats going on its really an ordeal

a sweeping plan to stop the pollution of lake 
okeechobee was endorsed by water directors friday but they delayed 
adopting details of the regulatory program until february pending 
more hearings 
the plan envisions strict limits on farm runoff into the lake 
limits that some farmers say could drive them out of business 
the nine board members of the south florida water management 
district voted unamimously to approve a resolution supporting limits 
on the overall pollution content of the 700squaremile lake the 
nations largest freshwater lake outside of the great lakes system 
the policy change comes in the wake of increasing phosphorus 
pollution over the last two decades that has spawned deadly algae 
blooms wiping out fish and native plant species one recent reading 
found phosphorus levels at a historic high in the nations largest 
freshwater lake outside of the great lakes system 
water from the lake flows into the loxahatchee national wildlife 
refuge into everglades national park and to waterconservation 
areas that recharge the biscayne aquifer southeastern floridas 
primary water supply 
michael finley superintendent of everglades national park said 
that the plan could prevent the lake from becoming little more than 
a retaining pond for polluted water 
but if its finessed delayed and circumvented then its going 
to be the year 2002 and the nutrient front phosphorus will still 
be a cancer moving south and we will have lost more of floridas 
resources finley said 
one factor prompting the toughened standards was a federal suit 
filed by us attorney dexter lehtinen accusing the district and the 
state of failing to protect water quality in the interconnected 
water system of the lake kissimmee river and everglades national 
park 
lehtinen had said he might consider dropping the suit if the 
district adopted the new standards but spokeswoman diane cossin 
said friday that the office would wait until it could examine the 
final plan 
the biggest potential losers in the battle over phosphorus 
pollution which comes principally from fertilizer and cow manure 
are the sugar cane growers and dairy farmers who surround the lake 
philip parsons representative of the florida sugar cane league 
said the new rules may drive cane growers in a few areas out of 
business although most would be able to survive the runoff limits 
he complained about the direction of policy however saying its 
aim seemed to be to force growers and dairy farmers to retain their 
runoff on their property 
if you say that to the city of miami the city of miami 
wouldnt exist what are you going to do tear down the public 
library and build a retaining pond parsons said 
environmentalists who support the district plan said the 
situation cannot be compared with city sewage disposal 
this is a scarce resource said joseph podgor of friends of 
the everglades you cannot equate lake okeechobee to a trash 
dump 
the districts pollution management plan would require all 
lakeside farms to decrease the phosphorus content of their runoff at 
least onefifth by 1991 and they must meet interim goals before 
then some dairy farms would have to cut phosphorus levels by more 
than 80 percent 
the district was required to submit a draft plan to the state by 
december under the states surface water improvement and management 
act

a geraldo rivera show with former lobbyist paula 
parkinson talking about a previously reported and denied alleged 
incident with vice presidentelect dan quayle has been yanked by the 
parent company 
after a careful review the tribune entertainment co has 
determined that the geraldo program titled washington 
confidential will not be broadcast the company said in a 
statement friday 
tribune is exercising this discretionary right as a matter of 
programming judgment geraldo rivera did not agree with this 
decision but he understands it 
i am very angry rivera was quoted as saying in fridays 
editions of usa today about the decision thursday on the show taped 
nov 3 it is censorship and it is appalling to me even when it is 
my friends that are doing it 
the show featured parkinson talking about what she had previously 
said about quayle in washingtonian magazine rivera said the 
show also featured allegations of affairs by former president nixon 
and rep jack kemp rny 
rivera told the newspaper the decision had less to do with the 
content than other recent shows especially one geraldo show 
with nazi youth in which riveras nose was broken and a special on 
satanic cults that was panned 
i think theyre running scared because of all the geraldo 
bashing rivera said i think they are reacting to the very 
negative critical reaction to us

a federal judge ruling in the nations first case 
challenging the constitutionality of the emergency housing 
preservation act upheld the law in an opinion favoring lowincome 
tenants in a gentrifying neighborhood 
although other courts do not have to follow its example the 
ruling could influence other challenges to the 1987 act which was 
designed to protect rentcontrolled federally subsidized private 
housing for low and moderateincome families an attorney for the 
plaintiffs said friday 
attorney daniel burke called thursdays ruling a victory for rent 
rights of the poor who are threatened by an increasing number of 
young professionals moving into renovated innercity neighborhoods 
us district judge james moran issued his ruling in a 
classaction lawsuit filed on behalf of 600 residents of a north 
side building 
the act prohibits private owners of federally subsidized housing 
from immediately charging higher market prices for rent if the 
change would result in a reduction of available low and 
moderateincome housing 
the case moran ruled on involved owners of a 209unit apartment 
building who sought to pay off a federally insured mortgage 20 years 
early 
the partnership that owns the building known as the 833 buena 
joint venture gave the us department of housing and urban 
development 18 million in january to pay off the mortgage and then 
sent eviction or rentincrease notices to the 600 residents 
believing the paidoff mortgage had exempted them from the 
regulations 
the owners maintained that the housing preservation law was 
unconstitutional and deprived them of their property without due 
process 
and in any event they said they paid up before the president 
signed the bill on feb 5 burke said 
but moran noted that the law clearly had a retroactive effective 
date of nov 1 1987 and said hud had made a conscious choice to 
ignore a legislative demand in accepting the prepayment said 
william wilen another attorney for the plaintiffs 
morans ruling means the building will remain under hud 
regulatory control it means rent increase proposed in february were 
unlawful burke said 
the buildings owners did not return phone messages friday and 
their attorney ellen babbitt refused to discuss the case 
burke called the ruling an influential decision in that its 
the first decision of any court on the constitutionality of the 
act he said 
other courts are not bound by this judgment but we think it 
will affect their decisions on similar challenges to the law he 
said 
wilen said one similar case is pending in federal court in 
raleigh nc 
what the law provides is that an owner who wishes to prepay a 
federal mortgage has two options one is to prove to hud that the 
prepayment and resulting rent increases would not have a harmful 
effect for housing opportunities for lowincome people and 
minorities burke said 
under that option owners would have to demonstrate that 
theres a surplus of lowincome housing in their neighborhood 
he said 
if they cant establish that they can ask for additional 
financial incentives from hud such as an increase in subsidies 
that would still keep them under federal jurisdiction the attorney 
said 
the owners of the buena building did neither he said

sunspot activity that peaks in about a year 
could be the second most intense since galileo first saw the solar 
eruptions in 1610 and might knock satellites off course cause 
scattered blackouts and disrupt phone calls and radio broadcasts 
scientists say 
sunspots are relatively cool dark 1200 to 
60000milediameter eruptions that appear where the solar magnetic 
field is most intense they emit solar flares explosions that send 
protons xrays electrons and other radiation streaming outward 
sometimes causing magnetic storms on earth by disrupting the earths 
magnetic field 
most effects are subtle rare flickering of lights and poorer 
connections for satelliterelayed phone calls or television shows 
so the average guy on the street wont know if were in the throes 
of a major magnetic storm forecaster joe kunches said friday 
they may notice the disturbance but they wont know why 
often wrongly blaming the phone company for noise on longdistance 
lines he said by phone from the space environment services center 
in boulder colo the governments forecasting agency for the 
storms 
the average person also might not get his favorite radio 
station as well as he likes or might notice the northern lights 
or aurora borealis farther south than usual nasa physicist kenneth 
schatten said during the american geophysical unions annual meeting 
in san francisco 
a sofar successful prediction that the current solar cycle would 
be exceptionally large was issued in early 1987 by yale universitys 
sabatino sofia and schatten of the national aeronautics and space 
administrations goddard space flight center in maryland 
a nasa news release said some scientists believe the solar 
maximum or peak of the cycle might be the biggest since 1610 
when italian astronomerphysicist galileo galilei first observed 
sunspots 
but schatten and sofia predicted this cycle wont be quite as 
large as the 195859 solar maximum and we have no reason to 
change that schatten said thursday 
schatten said the sunspot cycle lasts about 11 years with the 
previous maximum in late 1979 the last minimum in september 1986 
and the upcoming maximum expected as early as late 1989 much 
earlier than the 1991 date originally forecast 
magnetic storms are not dangerous to people on earth but they 
pose a potentially lethal proton radiation hazard for spacewalking 
astronauts and spacecraft electronics said schatten and ron zwickl 
head of research at the boulderbased space environment laboratory 
excess ultraviolet light from solar flares heats earths 
atmosphere expanding it to produce drag that can make satellites in 
low orbits fall to earth prematurely they said the us spacelab 
fell to earth after an intense solar flare in 1979 
some key missions may be affected forcing nasa to plan 
spacecraft launch dates and adjust orbits to minimize the problem 
zwickl said 
if there had been a man on the moon in august 1972 during a 
flare of protons he would have absorbed a lethal dose of 
radiation zwickl said adding that proton emissions in the cycle 
should peak between 1991 and 1993 
sometimes magnetic storms cause major blackouts as was the case 
in upstate new york about a decade ago zwickl said 
kunches said xrays from flares disrupt military and other 
communications that cross polar areas or bounce signals off the 
layer of earths atmosphere called the ionosphere 
zwickl said no one knows why solar maximums vary in intensity

a 9yearold boy who was struck by a car and 
killed while riding his bicycle carrying two vials of cocaine lived 
a tumultuous life that included a brush with death at age 4 and a 
drug entanglement two months ago 
he was a nice boy full of humor he was really active busy 
but he really didnt do anything bad said barbara butler an 
instructor at bethany house ministries a church center in francisco 
martinezs neighborhood 
the last time ms butler saw francisco was nov 29 the day he 
was struck by a car while pedaling his bicycle on a busy fourlane 
road in suburban ross township he died of head injuries monday at 
allegheny general hospital in pittsburgh 
francisco was only 4 when his mother larita welch martinez then 
25 dropped him to safety from the second story of a burning 
tenement housing drug addicts and alcoholics in boston 
the rev hurshel langham of boston who caught francisco that day 
in january 1983 remembered francisco as friendly and intelligent 
the thing that amazed me was how he was able to survive in 
there with all of the drunks and junkies i was totally impressed 
that he could live in that environment and be so well contented 
said langham 
ms martinez was convicted of arson for allegedly setting the 
fire which killed four people she was sentenced to life in prison 
and francisco was sent to live with his grandparents in pittsburgh 
two months ago police searched the home francisco lived in with 
his grandparents and an aunt and uncle after family members told 
police sept 2 that the aunt 20yearold renee welch was acting as 
a drug courier and planned to get drugs in new york according to 
records in allegheny county court 
ms welch would not let officers search her bedroom after police 
left francisco went to his aunts bedroom but his uncle and 
grandparents stopped him as he tried to leave and found 40 bags of 
heroin and cocaine in his clothes 
the aunt who was charged with multiple drug offenses and 
corrupting a minor is free on bond awaiting trial 
meanwhile ross township police sgt frank zotter said 
investigators are looking for links between the vials francisco was 
carrying when he was struck and drug residue found in containers 
taken from the aunts bedroom 
tests also showed francisco had alcohol in his blood when he was 
struck family attorney joseph k williams iii said the boy was 
asthmatic and had been taking cough syrup that contains alcohol 
the boy had been seen riding his bike erratically on the same 
highway in the days before he was struck and police were responding 
to a similar report when the fatal accident occurred zotter said 
the teenage driver was charged with leaving the scene of an 
accident 
the bike seemed to be one of the few constants in franciscos 
life 
on a nice day hed bring his bike down and park it and play out 
back said sharon brown a worker at bethany house ministries 
he loved his bike

nato should be cautious about soviet proposals 
for deep reductions in european troop levels because krelim leaders 
believe they still could win a war with fewer soldiers than they 
have now a congressional study said friday 
the report by a trio of congressional agencies was completed 
before the announcement of troop reductions made wednesday by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachev in a united nations speech said the soviet union 
would reduce its military forces 10 percent worldwide that would 
include the withdrawal of some soviet troops and tanks from eastern 
europe 
fridays report was prepared by the general accounting office 
the office of technology assessment and the congressional research 
service it was done in response to last years pentagon budget 
bill which ordered a wideranging study of the military balance 
between the north atlantic treaty organization and the soviet union 
and its warsaw pact allies 
the study sounded four major warnings about the onging 
ussoviet efforts to negotiate lower levels of troops and military 
power in the european theater the cautionary notes were based on 
the possibility of a soviet attack on nato 
the study said 
first because the soviets do not believe that they must have 
superiority across the theater in order to achieve victory caution 
must be exhibited in any agreement for force reductions 
it noted the soviets now enjoy at least a 2to1 advantage in 
many major measures of military might but it noted that soviet 
writings suggest that the soviets could have a force advantage 
across the theater of as little as 125 to 1 or even parity and 
still achieve victory 
any overall symmetrical reduction in forces would not be to 
natos advantage given that lowering the density of forces by 
soviet calculations would aid the attacker and make rapid advance 
and maneuvers easier 
unless all equipment is disabled or destroyed the soviets 
could agree to force reductions knowing that a dramatically reduced 
division would be capable of regneration in a few weeks 
finally nato should not expect any significant unilateral 
reductions on the part of the soviets either to promote good will 
or to pressure nato into an equivalent response that would not 
also be in the soviet unions own military and political interests 
the report studied soviet military attitudes toward the west and 
concluded that soviet planners believe that they have a marginal 
advantage in the conventional balance in europe today although they 
are far less optimistic about the future 
the soviets dont believe they need a numerical advantage to win 
a military attack the study said instead the ability to mass at 
decisive places and times with sufficient forces to achieve their 
objectives is the key 
while the soviets have roughly a 2to1 manpower advantage now 
the soviets apparently have concluded that a 15to1 force 
advantage or even parity across the entire theater may be 
sufficient to enable their forces to achieve a 3 or 4to1 force 
advantage on a few breakthrough sectors and 4 to 8to1 advantage 
at the tactical point of penetration the study said 
the study was prepared by a variety of experts including 
comptroller general charles bowsher head of the gao former arms 
negotiator jonathan dean rep charles bennett dfla chairman of 
the house armed services seapower subcommittee lawrence korb 
former assistant secretary of defense and james woolsey former 
undersecretary of the navy 
the report offered no clear answer to the question of who is 
ahead nato or the warsaw pact it noted that neither side has 
such an overwhelming advantage that its victory would be assured 
but it added that most scenarios favor the warsaw pact as the 
victor rather than nato nato has a chance of success but it needs 
to address its many shortcomings to enhance that chance 
the study said despite problems in measuring the nato and 
warsaw pact force balance the experts agreed that natos peacetime 
deterrent position is good and that its conventional capabilities 
have improved over the last decade but they should be better 
if the soviets struck quickly nato likely could do a good job of 
defending the west the study said but in a long fight the balance 
might swing toward the warsaw pact because of nato shortcomings in 
logistics and stockpiles of weapons and ammunition

key lawmakers warned on friday that the 
drawnout selection process is politically weakening john tower 
george bushs expected choice for defense secretary but bushs 
incoming chief of staff said such delays are unavoidable 
john sununu refused to discuss whats behind the delay however 
towers supporters and a transition source who declined to be named 
said it was primarily an fbi check believed to be delving into the 
former texas senators personal life and allegations made by his 
exwife 
if being thorough in the system creates a problem then you 
have to accept that sununu said in an interview i cant 
imagine anybody who is criticizing us who would suggest to us that 
we find a shortcut through a system that ought to be allowed to 
cover all the details as efficiently and as effectively as you can 
tower who was an arms negotiator for president reagan after 
retiring from the senate has long been considered the top candidate 
for the pentagon post 
you always wish things could go faster sununu said and 
yet in todays world the worst thing you could do is to do things 
quickly rather than thoroughly and that applies to all appointments 
not just the tower one 
sen john mccain rariz a backer of tower and adviser to 
presidentelect bush on defense said they fbi are checking 
allegations and rumors womanizing drinking involvement in defense 
contracts 
they seem to be surfacing all the time mccain said in an 
interview all allegations have to be put to rest so there is no 
embarrassment at a later date from their viewpoint i wouldnt do 
anything different its just sad that its harming john tower to 
some degree 
mccain said towers former wife obviously has been feeding 
the rumors and provding grist for the mill 
a source close to bush commenting only on condition he not be 
named said i think just that the fbi checks are taking a long 
time john tower had a messy divorce and his wife has suggested 
17000 different problems and every single one of those has to 
be checked out 
bush said this week he was disinclined to believe allegations 
about tower 
sununu who will step down soon as governor of new hampshire 
said on other subjects in the interview 
he will not return to new hampshire in two years to run for 
office i want to be chief of staff for eight years with this 
president i want to give him the best eight years a president has 
ever had he said sununu still has money left over from his 
gubernatorial campaign and said some day i might come back to 
new hampshire and run for office governor or senator or whatever 
direct access to the oval office will be guaranteed to the chief 
of staff deputy chief of staff and the national security adviser 
as for vice presidentelect dan quayle sununu said they bush 
and quayle are going to work out their arrangement and obviously 
whatever the vice president bush decides is the way to work will 
be the way we work 
on tower sen mccain expressed concern about the delay saying 
the longer it takes theres bound to be an impact on his stature 
i dont think its significant now but it could be if it drags on 
much longer more than a week or two then i think it starts 
becoming serious 
similarly sen william cohen rmaine said i think anyone 
who is allowed to hang out as the designated nominee without any 
confirmation from the presidentelect is bound to suffer a thousand 
wounds 
i think they should move quickly to resolve the position and 
if its going to be tower it should be in the very near future and 
if its not going to be tower they should say so 
cohen said he too understood the nomination was being delayed 
by background checks moreover he said bushs team has been 
debating whether the pentagon chief should be a managerial type or a 
policy maker 
i think they have come to the conclusion the secretary should 
be the policy maker and that the deputy should be the manager 
cohen said 
i have talked to tower and i think he would like to have a 
strong manager as a deputy the senator added he tower is not 
going to be dealing with the minutiae of procurement reforms 
as for towers personal life cohen said he has known tower since 
1978 
i dont think john tower professed to be a saint to anyone but 
i dont think thats what were looking for he said he had never 
witnessed any excess in drinking or anything else by tower 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said in a speech if tower is named defense secretary 
he will come into office in a weakened position for one thing 
with all that twisting in the wind questions will be raised about 
how much confidence the president has in him 
mccain said he still expected tower to get the job cohen said 
barring any unforeseen disclosures in the fbi investigation that 
we have not already heard about i would expect him to be the 
nominee 
a top aide to bush speaking privately said i still think 
its a 75 percent bet

a conservation group friday unveiled an attempt 
to wrap the message of tropical forest conservation in a rap music 
videotape 
the sixminute videotape made by the us affiliate of the world 
wildlife fund should be seen by 5 million to 7 million kids next 
year in 50000 schools said grace m lieberman member of the fund 
staff and coauthor of the teachers manual that accompanies the 
tape and other materials 
interspersed with shots of exotic animals birds plants and 
reptiles in the jungles of peru and brazil a group of youngsters 
about 10 years old dances through new york city streets and the 
botanic garden on the mall in washington 
the lyrics reveal the rocky metrics pulsing beat and sustained 
rhyme of typical rap numbers 
the redeyed frog has suction pads to cling 
they climb vertically i guess thats their thing 
howler monkeys now they got the style 
their howls can be heard over half a mile 
and thats a caiman waiting a while 
for its prey to come its related to the crocodile 
the teachers kit was made in cooperation with the smithsonian 
institution whose traveling exhibition service is sending a 
tropical forest exhibit to 14 cities 
the fund will give 1000 copies of the tape and teaching 
materials to host institutions in those cities others will be asked 
to pay 20 per kit or 5 for the tape alone 
conservationists say 27 million acres of forest an area bigger 
than austria are lost around the world each year through logging 
and conversion to farmland threatening the existence of thousands 
of exotic species not even studied yet by scientists local 
environmental damage and exacerbation of the greenhouse effect 
warming of the earth 
we surveyed teachers across the country and they told us in a 
world of mtv we couldnt use film strips and slide shows and hold 
students attention said ms lieberman 
the idea for the tape came from the rap video idea advanced by 
staffer sally russell who produced the tape 
a grant of 75000 from chevron corp supported the project

the former captain of a us warship 
whose alleged failure to help a boatload of starving vietnamese 
refugees apparently forced them to resort to cannibalism will be 
courtmartialed a navy spokesman said friday 
capt alexander g balian 48 of los angeles was relieved of 
his duties in august after vietnamese refugees claimed the uss 
dubuque did not assist them when it met up with their boat in the 
south china sea on june 9 
united nations officials said 52 of the refugees later reached 
the philippines but 58 died during the 37day voyage survivors said 
two vietnamese died of starvation but three others were slain and 
eaten by fellow passengers 
us navy spokesman lt cmdr kevin mukri said friday that the 
commander of us naval forces in the philippines rear adm roger 
l rich ordered the courtmartial after reviewing findings of an 
investigation conducted at the us subic bay naval base and in the 
persian gulf the dubuques destination when it spotted the 
vietnamese boat 
mukri said no date had been set for the courtmartial but it 
probably would be held at subic bay 50 miles west of manila 
the investigation which corresponds to a civilian grand jury 
probe was completed oct 28 and forwarded to rich on nov 7 mukri 
said it found that the vietnamese vessel was out of food and water 
and with an inoperative engine and sails when it encountered the 
dubuque 
balian claimed the boat was seaworthy and that the crew provided 
food water and navigational directions 
mukri said the investigation determined that the dubuque failed 
to provide food water and clothing even though some of the 
refugees were naked dehydrated and weakened from their ordeal at 
sea 
he said balian faced seven charges including failure to render 
assistance to a vessel in distress and failing to determine the 
condition of the vessel he said balian who is now in sasabo 
japan could be dismissed from the navy and imprisoned for two years 
on each charge if convicted 
balian also was charged with failing to rescue a vietnamese 
refugee who jumped into the water and tried to swim to the port side 
of the dubuque mukri said he said another vietnamese tried to 
climb a rope ladder on the side of the dubuque but the crew shook 
it and he fell back into the sea 
the dubuque also did not report the location of the vietnamese 
vessel by radio so that other ships in the area could render 
assistance mukri said 
quoting the report mukri said the vietnamese vessel left vietnam 
on may 22 by the time it encountered the dubuque on june 9 there 
were 83 men women and children including one infant still alive 
the report said 
filipino fishermen later rescued the refugees they were taken to 
the philippine island of palawan where they were cared for by 
filipino and un authorities 
one of the refugees 10yearold hung quoc tran was reunited 
late last month with an aunt and grandmother in el dorado ark 
about 120 miles south of little rock

all he was suffering from seconddegree heart block a potentially 
fatal disruption of the hearts electrical system 
cardiologists implanted into roths upper chest one of 
medtronics latest pacemakers a doublelead model that stimulates 
both of the hearts pumping chambers 
i feel fine roth said thursday things are coming along 
nicely once you get the unit in there it stabilizes quickly all of 
a sudden my hands and feet are warm again 
in the late 1950s roth then a biomedical engineer worked with 
samuel hunter a st paul surgeon to develop what was called the 
hunterroth bipolar electrode they worked with animals in a 
laboratory at st josephs and in a north minneapolis garage that 
was the center of medtronic inc operations in those days 
roth said he has been out of the engineering business for many 
years and now works as a financial consultant 
he said his heart block condition was first diagnosed 15 years 
ago but didnt progress until about a year ago he was planning to

soviet dissident andrei sakharov and polish 
solidarity leader lech walesa each making his first visit abroad 
since winning the nobel peace prize arrived friday to join a human 
rights celebration 
the two men who were planning to meet for the first time during 
the weekend were invited by president francois mitterrand for 
ceremonies marking saturdays 40th anniversary of the universal 
declaration of human rights 
mitterrand un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and 
unesco director general federico mayor were scheduled to speak 
saturday at the palais chaillot overlooking the seine that will be 
attended by hundreds of dignitaries human rights activists and 
politicians 
in oslo perez de cuellar on friday accepted the 1988 nobel peace 
prize check on behalf of the un peacekeeping forces 
sakharov on his way back to moscow following a fourweek visit 
to the united states arrived friday morning at charles de gaulle 
airport and was to be joined by his wife yelena bonner on friday 
night for the couples first trip together outside the soviet union 
walesa allowed to leave poland for the first time since martial 
law was declared in 1981 arrived friday night at the same airport 
and told reporters he was looking forward to meeting sakharov 
we both still feel he and i the breath of stalin at our 
backs walesa said speaking polish through an interpreter 
after seven years here i am at the dawn of something new he 
said the stalin era is over now i am waiting for the return to 
pluralism and the restoration of rights 
at a 90minutelong news conference at the soviet embassy 
sakharov called for more steps to reduce the size of the soviet 
military the 67yearold physicist said one way to do this would be 
to limit the length of service for soviet draftees 
commenting on soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs offer 
wednesday at the united nations to cut the red army by 500000 and 
withdraw thousands of tanks and troops from eastern europe he said 
it was a major decision but only a beginning 
he said reductions in manpower and weapons can be done and will 
change in a major way the international situation gorbachev is 
going in this direction and this is very important i would have 
liked to see bigger cuts but what was done is important 
sakharov who helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb previously 
was barred from traveling abroad because of his past scientific 
work he was also restricted to the industrial city of gorky for 
seven years because of his outspoken opposition to soviet 
intervention in afghanistan 
in 1986 gorbachev personally called him back to moscow since 
then sakharov has generally supported gorbachevs perestroika or 
political and economic restructuring while speaking out against 
some trends including the growing concentration of power in 
gorbachevs hands 
he twice sidestepped questions about the political implications 
of the meeting he is expected to have with walesa who is being 
allowed by polish authorities to make his first trip abroad since 
the military crackdown on the independent union seven years ago 
in an interview published thursday in the daily le monde walesa 
said he believed authorities granted him the visa because poland 
seeks better relations with the west and france can facilitate 
this 
walesa who won the nobel prize in 1983 on thursday told the 
french daily liberation that he was looking forward to meeting 
sakharov the 1975 prize winner 
walesa will confer with french trade unionists paris mayor 
jacques chirac actor yves montand culture minister jack lang and 
cardinal jeanmarie lustiger leader of the french roman catholic 
church walesa and sakharov will meet mitterrand and premier michel 
rocard on saturday 
the universal declaration of human rights adopted without 
dissent by the un general assembly on dec 10 1948 is the basic 
document under which member nations pledge to safeguard life and 
liberty and abolish torture and slavery 
the united nations commemorated the annniversary thursday by 
honoring antiapartheid activists nelson and winnie mandela and four 
other rights advocates

sowetos new city council will stop 
evicting residents of the black township who have taken part in a 
3yearold rent boycott and will not force them to pay back rent 
antiapartheid activists said friday 
the delegation of activists made the announcement after meeting 
with the black council for several hours the delegation included 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu miners union leader cyril 
ramaphosa and others who in the past have refused to negotiate with 
the council 
the rent boycott is one of the most effective forms of protest 
still available to blacks under the 30monthold state of emergency 
the boycott was launched in 1985 to press a broad range of 
grievances against the government overdue rent in soweto alone is 
believed to exceed 100 million 
authorities have used numerous tactics to try to break the 
boycott including latenight eviction raids such as one in august 
1986 which led to the deaths of nearly 30 blacks in a confrontation 
with police 
fridays meeting came two days after south africas highest 
court the appeal court in bloemfontein ruled that previous 
councils of the township had no legal authority to collect rent from 
occupants of the thousands of homes built in the 1940s and 1950s by 
the city council of neighboring johannesburg at the time there was 
no separate black administration in soweto 
the rev frank chikane secretarygeneral of the south african 
council of churches and leader of the activists delegation said 
the councilors agreed that because of the court ruling no sowetan 
was required to pay any of millions of dollars of rent withheld 
during the boycott 
chikane said further negotiations would take place to determine 
whether some residents should now be awarded ownership of their 
houses and what type of rent or service charges should be paid in 
the future 
he and tutu indicated activists viewed the new council more 
positively than its predecessors 
they are people who want to do good people who honestly 
believe they can change the system chikane said whether they 
can it subject to an apartheid parliament remains to be seen 
they told us our grievances were their grievances tutu said 
under south africas system of apartheid the nations 26million 
black majority has no say in national affairs black local councils 
have been denounced by activists as subordinate extensions of the 
whitedominated political system 
sowetos new council took office following nationwide municipal 
elections oct 26 which were the target of an illegal but successful 
boycott by blacks about 115 percent of the eligible voters in 
soweto cast ballots 
the new council seeking to distance itself from the old ones 
proceeded to rehire municipal workers fired during a strike and said 
it wanted to consult with community leaders to solve problems facing 
its 25 million residents 
one of the consequences of the fivemonth municipal workers 
strike was an accumulation of trash on roadsides throughout soweto 
the council is launching a cleanup campaign saturday and drew 
praise from the normally critical local newspaper the sowetan for 
a proposal to pay children to join the cleanup 
the activists said in a statement friday that negotiations with 
the council would continue only if it were able to guarantee that 
community leaders were not harassed or detained as they consulted 
with residents

the solar panels on the secret spy satellite 
launched by the shuttle atlantis failed to swing open the first time 
ground controllers commanded them to and air force officials 
briefly feared the mission might fail an industry magazine reports 
but with two astronauts standing by to take a spacewalk if 
necessary a second set of radio commands freed the panels and the 
satellite was successfully deployed high over the soviet union 
aviation week amp space technology reported in its dec 12 issue 
the panels are needed to absorb sunlight which powers the 
satellites batteries 
the magazine citing defense department sources said deployment 
of the 500 million martin marietta radar satellite took place on 
the shuttles fifth orbit or about seven hours after it was 
launched at 930 am est on friday dec 2 
after the astronauts used the shuttles robot arm to release the 
satellite they kept their spaceship close enough to watch the 
deployment and were able to visually confirm when it was fully open 
to its 150foot span 
had it not air force lt col jerry l ross and navy cmdr 
william m shepherd were prepared to take a spacewalk to repair or 
retrieve the satellite 
the magazine said navy cmdr robert l gibson first maneuvered 
the shuttle to a point about 3 miles from the lacrosse then to 
about 5 miles away then further at 5mile increments 
these maneuvers were witnessed by a network of amateur 
astronomers linked by computers around the world and headed by ted 
molczan of toronto canada according to the magazine 
it said the astronomers observed closeformation flight between 
the atlantis and the lacrosse on their sixth and seventh orbits by 
dec 6 just before the shuttle returned to earth members of the 
group in australia observed the lacrosse about 180 miles from 
atlantis the magazine said 
the mission was the third entirely classified shuttle flight and 
neither nasa nor the air force released any information about its 
purpose however it was widely reported even by the official 
soviet news agency tass that the lacrosse was being deployed to 
observe soviet and eastern european military operations through 
darkness or cloud cover 
such information would be valuable for verifying soviet arms 
compliance the satellite would also serve as a radar eye for 
the new b2 stealth bomber

frightened eastern long island residents 
stayed inside behind drawn curtains after four men were shot on four 
successive nights including three injured by shots fired through 
their windows police said friday one person was killed 
the shootings in two long island communities have enough in 
common to point to one gunman police say but they have not figured 
out a motive 
the victims apparently do not know one another police said but 
they believe the four were not shot at random 
residents have begun shutting themselves in after dark drawing 
their curtains and responding to callers with extreme caution 
police said officials refused to predict that the sniper would 
strike again friday night but extra patrols were deployed and 
state county and local police held a meeting to coordinate their 
investigation 
all the shootings have occurred after dark most around 
dinnertime within a twomile radius in flanders and riverhead the 
victims all men in their 30s were shot with either a smallcaliber 
rifle or a lightweight shotgun 
i dont at this point think we have a random sniper loose in 
the streets who is just shooting away at anyone he sees said 
riverhead police chief lawrence grattan 
the two villages are about 75 miles east of new york not far 
from the exclusive beach communities called the hamptons frequented 
in summer by the citys wealthy 
you dont know where hes going to go next said barbara 
bouchard of riverhead a neighbor of one of the victims 
an anonymous caller believed to have been the gunman contacted 
riverhead police after the first shooting monday and said death 
to drug dealers and crooked cops according to a source involved 
in the investigation who spoke on condition of anonymity a similar 
call came after the second shooting on tuesday he said 
but police said none of the victims was known to have dealt drugs 
we think there is a reason for these shootings a perverted 
type of thing the source said 
the gunman seems to know the area well enough to be a local 
resident police theorized that he left a car at a distance from the 
scene and approached his targets on foot 
the shootings occurred this way according to police accounts 
about 640 pm monday bernard heaney 30 of south jamesport 
stepped outside his autocustomizing shop in flanders to see why his 
dog was yelping the dog had been shot other shots rang out and 
heaney fell fatally wounded by a 22caliber rifle 
on tuesday at 605 pm richard jensen 34 a carpenter was 
watching television with his wife and three children at his home in 
riverhead when a shotgun blast came through the window jensen had 
his hands clasped at the back of his head and the birdshot blew off 
the middle finger of each hand he also suffered scalp wounds he 
was listed in satisfactory condition friday 
theodore squires 39 a sign painter was wounded in the 
shoulder by a shotgun at his home in riverhead about 1050 pm 
wednesday squires had answered a knock at the door but saw no one 
he closed the door and started to draw the kitchen curtains when a 
shotgun blast through a window in the door hit him in the shoulder 
he was hospitalized in serious condition 
about 615 pm thursday donald crump 31 was shot in the jaw 
with a lightcaliber rifle bullet by someone firing through a window 
as he ate his dinner with his mother and nephew in the living room 
of his home in flanders the slug came out his neck and lodged in a 
wall he was treated for his wound and released

former white house aide oliver l north began 
using iranian armssale proceeds to arm nicaraguan rebels two months 
before he told congress the diversion had started irancontra 
prosecutors said friday 
a substantial quantity of weapons were bought for the contras 
in december 1985 from money left over from the aborted sale by 
israel of hawk missiles to iran in november 1985 irancontra 
prosececutors said in filing in norths case 
the prosecution evidence contradicts norths congressional 
testimony last year that the idea of diverting armssale profits to 
the contras was first suggested to him in january 1986 by iranian 
arms dealer manuchar ghorbanifar 
the weapons for the nicaraguan rebels known as contras were 
purchased from what was left of a 1 million fund that north told 
israel to place in a swiss bank the money was to cover the expenses 
that arms dealer richard v secord would incur when selling 80 hawk 
missiles to iran 
the deal broke down after the first shipment of 18 missiles 
because the iranians were dissatisfied with the weapons they 
received 
as a result a substantial windfall was left in the account 
of lake resources a panamanian company controlled by secord 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh said in the filing in us 
district court 
aided by this infusion of cash which the 1987 congressional 
irancontra report estimated was 800000 the enterprise shipped 
a subststantial quanity of weapons to the contras in december of 
that year walsh said 
thus the events of november afforded north his first 
opportunity to exploit arms sales to iran in order to support the 
contras the stage wa set for the diversion of 1986 walsh said 
during his testimony before the housesenate committee hearings 
on the irancontra affair north said the idea of using armssale 
profits to help the contras was mentioned by ghorbanifar during 
discussions held to set up the february 1986 sale of 1000 tow 
missiles to iran 
recalling the jan 22 1986 meeting in london north said 
ghorbanifar suggested several incentives to make that february 
transaction work and the attractive incentive for me was that 
residuals would flow to support the nicaraguan resistance 
ghorbanifar agreed to pay 10000 for each of the 1000 tow 
missiles which were to be purchased from the defense department 
through the cia 
at a meeting in washington the next day north in a critical 
misrepresentation told two cia officials and a pentagon officer 
that secord would pay the cia 6000 per missile or 6 million in 
all when he well knew that 10 million was the negotiated 
price 
the cia eventually set the price at 3700 per missile for 
reasons unrelated to norths statements walsh said 
in his latest summary of evidence in the case walsh said 
prosecutors will demonstrate at trial that north played a 
significant role in directing expenditures from the enterprise 
through witnesses such as willard zucker an american lawyer who 
operates a swiss financial company 
north and secord are charged along with former national security 
adviser john m poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim with 
conspiring to divert more than 14 million in armsforhostage 
profits to the contras poindexter secord and hakim are to be tried 
separately after north 
walshs filing was made as us district judge gerhard a gesell 
concluded seven days of closed hearings to consder norths 
objections to censoring sensitive information from 395 prosecution 
exhibits 
the independent prosecutor in a separate filing suggested a 
procedure under which uncensored documents could be shown to jurors 
the judge and the witness without revealing the contents to 
spectators 
the arms deals continued but by the summer of 1986 fissures 
began to develop in norths scheme after the iranians learned they 
were being overcharged as much as 600 percent apparently when they 
obtained a price list for spare parts 
north asked the cia to generate a phony price list to 
extinguish the complaints 
when confronted by cia officer charles allen with ghorbanifars 
complaints norths reaction was to question the trustworthiness 
of ghorbanifar 
thus north repeatedly failed to disclose the true origin of 
the inflated prices his own efforts to generate a surplus for the 
contras instead he attempted to cover his tracks and blame the 
problem on ghorbanifar walsh said 
in early october 1986 allen warned thencia director william 
casey and deputy director robert gates that he suspected north and 
secord were diverting profits to the contras allen also warned that 
ghorbanifar might go public with allegations concerning the 
pricing of the weapons 
north was fired from the national security council staff and 
poindexter resigned in late november 1986 after the diversion was 
confirmed in a memo unearthed by attorney general edwin meese iiis 
investigation

bond was set at 1 million friday for a 
man who is charged in a 1986 slaying and is a halfbrother of the 
rev jesse jackson 
noah robinson has been in jail without bail since september when 
he was charged in the death of leroy hambone barber and turned 
himself in to authorities bail had not been posted by late friday 
afternoon 
indictments accuse robinson a greenville native and 
selfdescribed millionaire of hiring a group of el rukn street gang 
members to travel to greenville and kill barber a former employee 
in one of robinsons companies 
robinson 46 also is charged with conspiring to kill a witness 
to barbers killing five el rukn members also are charged 
robinson has maintained that he is a victim of a political 
conspiracy caused partly by the success of his halfbrother 
robinson and jackson share the same father but the former 
democratic presidential hopeful has said he has had no recent 
contact with his halfbrother 
last week robinsons lawyers asked that robinson be granted bail 
under a state law that requires defendants be released when two 
terms of court had been completed without trial 
circuit judge james moore said friday that he agreed with the 
argument because of the courts concern for a fair trial 
moores decision marked the end of a threemonth legal battle 
over the issue of robinsons right to be granted bail 
moore said robinson would be required to put up 500000 in the 
form of a surety bond plus 500000 in the form of a personal 
recognizance bond moore added that robinson would be required to 
remain in greenville county until his trial scheduled to begin jan 
16 
a personal recognizance bond means a defendant is liable for the 
amount of the bond but he does not have to offer documentation that 
he has the money 
moore also agreed friday that the murder charges against robinson 
and the charges involving the attack on the murder witness should be 
tried separately to avoid prejudice

the head of the naacp said friday that 
presidentelect bush who has yet to name a black to any highlevel 
position has pledged to put a black in his cabinet 
bush meantime reiterated his promise to make the cabinet 
representative of women and minorities stay tuned he told 
reporters 
the vice president continued his string of meetings with various 
interest groups he spent about 30 minutes with benjamin hooks of 
the naacp before a session with 13 conservatives including edwin 
feulner jr president of the heritage foundation and paul weyrich 
of the free congress foundation 
feulner said the conservatives urged bush to place people of 
their philosophical bent in high positions 
in effect what we urged was that he make sure that all parts of 
the conservative coalition continue to have a stake in his success 
once he becomes president he said 
bush was also encouraged to make greater use of his veto power to 
prevent an erosion of power from the executive branch 
conservatives do not want to see congress attain too much power 
particularly in foreign affairs weyrich said 
also among the conservatives on bushs schedule was robert 
woodson a black businessman from north carolina who has been 
mentioned as a possible secretary of housing and urban development 
rep jack kemp rny is thought to have the inside track for that 
job 
hooks a democrat said his meeting with bush was very 
cordial the two discussed personnel appointments in all levels of 
government and the judiciary as well as issues of concern to 
blacks he said 
asked whether bush had made a commitment to place a black in the 
cabinet hooks replied to the best of my recollection i think i 
do remember him saying there would be a black in the cabinet 
hooks then said he had a distinct recollection that he said he 
intends to do that 
bush has named about a dozen people to top jobs in his 
administration so far only one of them female and none of them 
black 
hooks a vocal critic of the reagan administrations civil rights 
policies said he was confident that his group would have better 
relations with bush 
i expect a much better civil rights record from mr bush he 
said 
hooks said he asked bush to think about convening a white house 
conference on race and poverty next year an idea he said bush 
promised to consider 
meantime robert teeter codirector of the bush transition 
office said he still was trying to decide whether to accept the 
post of deputy white house chief of staff under john sununu but 
that he has been assured direct access to bush if he does take it 
teeter whose polling data and strategy advice helped propel bush 
to victory in november said he will decide in the next few days 
whether to take the job or return to his home in michigan with his 
wife and two children i dont know what im going to do yet he 
said in a telephone interview 
in talks with bush he said it has been agreed that he could 
fill the dual role of presidential counselor and deputy chief of 
staff

west germans on friday demanded 
curbs on nato military flights over this densely populated country 
to halt the toll from crashes that have killed 100 people this year 
several nato members including the united states temporarily 
suspended training flights after thursdays fiery crash of a us 
warplane that killed five people but there were calls for permanent 
cuts 
the governor of the state where the a10 thunderbolt ii crashed 
said he will take the issue to the federal parliament another 
governor urged chancellor helmut kohl to negotiate with nato allies 
on any given day in west germany the sky is filled with the 
screechings and rumbles of hundreds of jets and helicopters and 
massive opposition has been fueled by recent tragedies 
even before thursdays fatal crash in remscheid 12 major 
accidents of military aircraft had killed 95 people this year they 
included 70 who died from an air show crash in ramstein in august 
the resistance took on added urgency after the a10 plowed into 
remscheid a city of 130000 about 15 miles east of duesseldorf 
the pilot capt michael p foster 34 of seal beach calif 
and four people on the ground were killed and 50 others were 
injured two dozen homes were destroyed 
the exact cause of the crash was under investigation but west 
german air force gen horst jungkurth said the pilot may have 
become disoriented when he tried to climb in heavy cloud cover to 
get out of bad weather 
however the state prosecutor for north rhinewestphalia joerg 
bachmann said witnesses reported seeing one of the planes two 
engines on fire before it crashed 
capt ron hahn a spokesman for the us air force team that went 
to remscheid after the accident said pilot error is one of the 
conclusions they air force investigators could come to but there 
is no way to comment on the likely cause ahead of that 
meanwhile state interior minister herbert schnoor accused us 
military officials of hindering initial rescue operations 
it took hours before the fire department found out from the 
americans what was in the aircraft he told regional radio wdr 
at first there was concern that there could be radioactive 
material on board 
the jet designed to support ground forces and fight tanks was 
carrying 1000 rounds of 30mm training ammunition when it crashed 
us air force officials said one rescuer said ammunition 
periodically exploded after the initial crash hindering rescue 
operations 
us ambassador richard burt and west german defense minster 
rupert scholz visited the site friday burt denied the flight was a 
lowlevel mission saying the a10 was flying between 2500 feet and 
3300 feet before it began to descend 
in west german military parlance lowlevel flights range from 
250 to 500 feet above the ground and are restricted to seven rural 
areas in the country but the number of training accidents in recent 
years has aroused widespread concern in a country of 61 million 
people with an area smaller than texas 
oskar lafontaine the popular leftist governor of saarland 
state said on kohl a conservative christian democrat should start 
to work immediately for a ban on lowlevel training flights and mock 
air battles over inhabited areas 
i am calling for negotiations with the allies as well as a 
corresponding decision for the german military towards the goal of 
eliminating any danger to the populace lafontaine told reporters 
in the state capital of saarbruecken 
johannes rau the social democratic governor of north 
rhinewestphalia state where the accident occurred said he will go 
to parliament to seek a reduction of lowlevel flights over his 
state 
i hope that finally all lowlevel flights over densely 
populated areas will be banned not just until christmas but 
permanently rau told reporters 
bernd wilz a leading christian democrat in parliament said he 
and many of his party colleagues are demanding a 30percent 
reduction in lowlevel training missions 
seven nato nations including west germany fly a combined 70000 
lowlevel training flights in this country each year more than in 
any other nato land according to the defense ministry in bonn 
the west german defense ministry said it will bar training 
missions below 10700 feet until the end of the year and called on 
the nations allies to observe a similar moratorium 
defense ministry spokesman winfried dunkel told a news conference 
in bonn that the united states had agreed to the temporary 
suspension to be lifted in january

a couple who was able to move into a house 
through a county rent subsidy were packing to leave it friday three 
months after their garden collapsed into a sinkhole of decaying 
automotive batteries and they learned they were living on one of 
californias toxic superfund sites 
i thought we had gone through the toughest part said patrick 
piazza when we got this place i thought we were finally on the 
right track and we could settle 
county officials made a bureaucratic mistake when they moved 
piazza and his family into the home last march said marice ashe 
director of health education for contra costa county 
no one should live there she said 
she said tests showed that lead levels in the ground around the 
property which has been on the states toxic cleanup list since 
1986 were not seriously high but were on the borderline of posing 
a health threat to the piazza children kevin 12 crystal 4 and 
patrick jr 3 have been living in temporary quarters while the 
move is arranged 
the piazzas spent five years living in a 25yearold school bus 
and a hotel before county housing authorities helped them move into 
the 850amonth house last march the piazzas paid 167 of the 
monthly total the county subsidized the rest 
piazza said owner john thomas sr warned him there was a very 
slight contamination in the back behind the fence but thats at 
least 50 feet away and i knew the kids wouldnt be playing back 
there 
so they relaxed and planted a vegetable garden in the front yard 
on sept 10 piazza left the water on in the garden overnight he 
awoke to find a hole about three feet deep and six feet wide where 
the garden had been and a sinkhole filled with old automotive 
battery parts its now about 15 feet wide piazza said 
i was so shocked it took a few minutes for me just to get my 
thoughts together he said it caused a lot of scared confusion 
in our minds because we didnt know what it had done to us or our 
kids 
here we had been growing vegetables on top of all those things

a lawyer for eight arizona sanctuary 
workers told a federal appeals court friday the defendants believed 
the central american aliens they aided were refugees with a right to 
live in the united states 
attorney michael tigar told a threejudge panel of the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals that a trial judge in tucson ariz 
improperly barred the sanctuary workers from presenting evidence of 
their beliefs concerning the refugees from strifetorn nations 
a government attorney urging the court to uphold the convictions 
of all eight defendants said it was clear the workers never 
believed they were acting legally and knew that smuggling aliens was 
against the law 
there was no immediate ruling on the appeal at a news conference 
following the court session one of those convicted peggy 
hutchison vowed that the sanctuary movement would go on regardless 
of the outcome of the case 
we have a duty to respond to the violated in our midst she 
said 
the eight including five clergymen were convicted on various 
charges of conspiracy transporting and harboring and aiding illegal 
entry of aliens in a highly publicized 1986 trial all received 
probation several other defendants were acquitted pleaded guilty 
to misdemeanors or won dismissal of charges 
donald m reno who prosecuted the case in tucson said their 
conspiracy was clearly illegal 
in this case these defendants were methodically smuggling 
these aliens into the united states he said everything they 
were doing was surreptitious and clandestine 
he said the defendants had falsified documents and urged aliens 
to lie to immigration officers when asked about their country of 
origin 
tigar of the university of texas law school at austin described 
for the judges his interpretation of the law governing refugees 
anyone who is a refugee has the right to have that status 
recognized regardless of his mode of entry into the country he 
said refugee status is something you have because of something 
that happened to you in your country of origin 
he said all of the defendants had offered to prove at trial that 
all the people they assisted were eligible for refugee status 
reno however accused tigar of arguing a legal fiction that 
refugees are entitled to reside here 
tigar also argued that the defendants first amendment rights 
were violated when a government informant secretly recorded church 
services and bible classes where sanctuary was discussed 
reno responded that none of that evidence was ever used at the 
trial but said it was proper because the church had been 
transformed from an appropriate exercise of religion on sunday to 
a criminal enterprise on monday 
ms hutchison said the defendants believed they were acting 
legally 
when immigration authorities violate the rights of those 
seeking asylum we have a responsibility to protect those rights 
she said it is humane it is moral and it is legal and we will 
continue until the violation stops 
supporters of the defendants presented to reporters a woman now 
seeking asylum vilma mendez said she was imprisoned and tortured in 
el salvador for belonging to a union

vice presidentelect dan quayle said friday 
that congress shouldnt try to greatly reduce us military spending 
in response to a soviet pledge to cut troop strength 
lets not forget that the reason that were making success with 
the soviet union and the world is because we have been able to 
negotiate from a position of strength he said 
quayle who developed a reputation as a hardliner on defense 
issues while in congress said that even if mikhail s gorbachev 
follows through on a promise to reduce soviet troops by 500000 the 
soviets still will have a very significant advantage in troops 
and weapons in europe 
i hope that the congress doesnt try to undercut us and to take 
away that position of strength he said i hope that the 
congress doesnt respond and say well we can dramatically cut 
defense spending 
quayle commenting on a wide range of topics in an interview with 
reporters from his home state of indiana denied suggestions he has 
been swayed by presidentelect bushs transition team in making 
staff appointments and other decisions 
referring to the appointment of time correspondent david 
beckwith who was more closely associated with bush to be his press 
secretary quayle said it was at my initiative the appointments 
i make will be my appointments and i will be making those decisions 
on what i think is best for me and the administration 
quayle said he would be a very close personal confidential 
adviser to the president during bushs term and also would focus 
on his duties as a member of the national security council as 
overseer of the administrations space council as president of the 
senate and as a promoter of education and job training programs 
asked why he had left antidrug efforts off his list of 
priorities since bush had led reagan administration programs in 
that area quayle said his role had not been determined under new 
legislation that calls for appointment of a drug czar 
he steered clear of speculation over whom indiana gov robert d 
orr will appoint to fill the senate seat that quayle will vacate 
saying hell make a good choice a choice i will support 
the vice presidentelect also met friday with conservative eagle 
forum leader phyllis schlafly bush national security aides donald 
gregg and sam watson and assistant secretary of state elliott abrams 
quayle told reporters outside his house that in the meeting with 
abrams whom he characterized as an old friend they discussed 
central america abrams area of specialty at the state department 
quayle declined to specify what direction the bush administration 
will take on the nicaragua situation and aid to the contra rebels 
saying those will be major issues and major strategy well have 
to formulate but that he could not elaborate on it this early 
abrams whose irancontra testimony revealed he had deceived 
congress about the secret operation to assist the nicaraguan rebels 
told quayle he definitely was leaving government to return to 
private life the senator said 
quayle said the hardest adjustment hes had to make since 
becoming bushs vice presidentelect is learning to live with the 
tight security detail that tracks his every move 
the father of three said he misses just sort of now being able 
to get in the car and drive down to wendys drivein and get a 
milkshake with the kids if you want to 
we consider ourselves a strong durable family he continued 
when you get tested you actually become close and you become 
strengthened in many ways but it is different 
quayle said the criticism and ridicule he received during the 
campaign were difficult to deal with but we knew it was unfair 
and wrong we knew in due time things would be adjusted you dont 
like it but its part of the political system

the un chief accepted the 1988 nobel peace 
prize check friday on behalf of un peacekeeping forces but he 
said they are threatened because the united states and other 
countries wont pay their dues 
i dont know how were going to cope financially secretary 
general javier perez de cuellar said before receiving the prize 
money of 416000 a fraction of the 450 million in dues owed by 
un members 
in some ways its embarrassing because it forces me to say 
publicly that the united states still owes the united nations almost 
350 million said the un chief 
yesterday i had a meeting with american congressmen who 
complimented me on the peacekeeping forces he said i didnt 
want to make a joke but i told them i thought it would be kind of a 
posthumous homage to the united nations we wont have enough 
funds because you are not paying your contribution 
asked when the un would pay its own peacekeeping force bills to 
norway denmark britain canada and other countries that provide 
troops perez de cuellar said they are all understanding they 
think we are honest people but unfortunately not everyone is 
honest with us 
commenting on soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs call for a 
un force to monitor a truce as soviet troops leave afghanistan he 
said first of all let us see if a ceasefire is possible it 
is of course not a very simple question 
on saturday perez de cuellar receives the traditional gold medal 
and certificate from the norwegian nobel committee in a ceremony at 
oslo universitys aula hall 
the check handover friday broke with tradition it is usually 
awarded after the ceremony on dec 10 the anniversary of the death 
of swedish philanthropist alfred nobel inventor of dynamite 
but the un chief was flying to paris immediately after the 
ceremony to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the un human 
rights convention 
perez de cuellar cited progress on un efforts to end the 
iraniraq war and conflicts in afghanistan the western sahara 
southern africa and elsewhere 
i have the impression that all of a sudden so many countries 
have discovered that the united nations is really an extremely 
useful mechanism for maintaining peace he said 
the first un peacekeeping operation was in the middle east in 
1948 since then half a million men have served in 15 separate 
operations and more than 700 have been killed seven missions are 
currently in the field 
in a report this week perez de cuellar predicted the world body 
would end next year with a loss of 246 million only 79 of the 159 
members had paid all their dues by nov 30 the report said 
he said friday that the soviet union owed about 100 million but 
he praised the soviets for seting a payment schedule and sticking 
with it

a french cosmonaut and a soviet colleague overcame 
problems outside the orbiting space station mir on friday and 
unfurled a plastic web in a test of space construction techniques 
soviet media reported 
jeanloup chretien of france and soviet cosmonaut alexander 
volkov began their spacewalk at 1257 pm moscow time 4 am edt 
and were scheduled to complete it in four hours 20 minutes the 
tass news agency said but the spacewalk lasted six hours because of 
several problems 
it took longer than expected to lay a cable linking the plastic 
structures platform to the control panel inside mir tass said 
then the structure failed to unfold on the electronic command of 
cosmonaut sergei krikalev who was inside mir 
while scientists at the mission control center in kaliningrad 
near moscow studied the problem the cosmonauts were out of radio 
contact when contact was restored the cosmonauts exclaimed its 
opened soviet television reported the cosmonauts evidently shook 
the structure to open it a tv correspondent said 
if it proves reliable the platform could be used to hold 
antennas and telescope mirrors 
also during the spacewalk chretien and volkov mounted outside 
mir a panel with samples of different materials and coatings 
after six months the panel is to be removed and taken back to 
earth for study of how the materials and coatings withstood sharp 
temperature fluctuations and solar radiation in space tass said 
the soviets have said they intend to build large structures in 
space for research and the techniques and materials the cosmonauts 
tested friday should help plan such projects 
soviet television provided live coverage of parts of the 
spacewalk it showed chretien and volkov in white spacesuits 
floating outside mir and working on the experiments at one point 
they had to stop the work as they passed into a shadow 
along with krikalev the flight engineer remaining inside mir 
during the spacewalk were cosmonauts vladimir titov musa manarov 
and valery polyakov 
chretien will return to earth with titov and manarov who have

they make the descent dec 21 volkov polyakov and krikalev will

the fbi launched a criminal investigation 
friday into the downing of a us locustspraying plane over the 
western sahara in the heart of an area controlled by the marxistled 
polisario independence movement 
meanwhile an official of the us agency for international 
development said his view is that whoever shot the plane down make 
a mistake these were not military planes 
the fbi is looking for possible violations of federal criminal 
laws including one that deals with destruction of us aircraft 
overseas fbi spokesman milt ahlerich said 
in opening the investigation the bureau did not specifically 
invoke a 1986 antiterrorism law which makes it a crime to kill us 
nationals outside the united states 
five americans aboard the dc7 were presumed dead when the craft 
was shot down thursday by a surfacetoair missile 
jay morris deputy administrator of aid told reporters the 
plane and another craft accompanying it were in no sense on a 
mission for the united states 
morris said the planes had been en route from senegal where they 
had finished work for aid to morocco where they were going to 
seek another job spraying locusts for aid 
ahlerich said the downed aircraft had been under contract to aid 
but that the contract expired wednesday negotiations were under way 
to extend the contracts when the aircraft was shot down ahlerich 
added 
asked if the plane crews had been warned of the risk involved in 
flying over the area morris replied i dont think anyone knew 
they were running a risk 
my own view is that who ever did it made a mistake morris 
said these were not military planes 
madjid abdullah the polisarios north american representative 
told the associated press in washington the front will do 
everything possible to shed full light on this tragic and 
unfortunate incident 
both aircraft were owned by tampg aviation of chandler ariz and 
were under contract to aid to spray insects said tampg coowner 
sergio tomassoni who was in the other plane that was hit 
morris said the contracts of the five men presumed dead have been 
extended to spare their families the expense of transporting the 
bodies back to the united states for burial 
we view this as a tragic and deplorable loss of innocent life 
in an effort really to save life morris said 
morris said the men were part of an international effort to stop 
one of the most massive insect infestations in decades a plague 
really of biblical proportions

presidentelect george bushs policy 
toward the soviet union shouldnt be based entirely on the 
pronouncements and personality of mikhail s gorbachev since 
theres no guarantee hell stay in power former secretaries of 
state said friday 
gorbachev acts as he does because he recognizes that the soviet 
economy is a mess and it has to be improved henry kissinger 
secretary of state under former presidents richard nixon and gerald 
ford told a news conference its a big mistake to gear our 
policies totally to one soviet personality 
cyrus vance who directed foreign policy under presidents john f 
kennedy and lyndon johnson said gorbachev faces an uphill battle in 
bringing about his desired domestic reforms and likely will fall 
from power if he fails 
i think he may be gone in a couple of years vance said 
william rogers a secretary of state under nixon said bush 
should continue the policies of the reagan administration i 
think the prospects for peace are very good but we have to remain 
strong militarily 
the former us secretaries of state were here for the sixth 
annual report from the secretaries of state sponsored by the 
atlantabased southern center for international studies and 
nashvilles david lipscomb university 
they spoke with reporters before taping a twohour television 
special to be broadcast by public broadcasting service stations 
early next year 
there was some disagreement with reagan kissinger reacted 
sharply to presidents suggestion thursday that there be talks with 
iran regarding the lebanese hostages 
i am violently opposed to any negotiations about hostages 
ever kissinger said once you begin negotiating on the release 
of hostages you have indicated there is the price and the only 
thing left to negotiate is the price and therefore hostage taking 
has a reward 
i know this sounds cruel i know this is tough on the families 
but i believe that devaluing hostages is the only way you can 
prevent hostages from being taken 
kissinger and edmund muskie secretary of state under former 
president jimmy carter both predicted the hostages in lebanon will 
be released because it will be in irans interest to try to return 
relations with the united states to normal 
vance criticized the reagan administrations refusal to admit 
palestine liberation organization head yassar arafat into the united 
states to address the united nations calling it a serious 
mistake 
it helped those who were opposed to progress in the middle east 
and it disadvantaged those who would like to see us get the peace 
process going ahead vance said i think it makes it more 
difficult for the bush administration to act as an honest broker in 
the middle east 
vance said he that the united states must maintain a strong 
military but said we must remain strong economically as well as 
militarily 
i think one of the things he bush is going to have to deal 
with strongly and effectively is the twin deficits the budget 
deficit and the trade deficit what he does in regard to that 
particular issue is going to have a major effect in the long run 
on our foreign policy 
the forum was held at the invitation of gov ned mcwherter a 
trustee of the nonprofit international studies organization

a wouldbe financial adviser who bilked investors 
out of 15 million to finance a lifestyle of expensive art and 
luxury homes was sentenced friday to eight years in prison by a 
judge who called him amoral not immoral 
david p bloom 24 whose swindle earned him the title wall 
street whiz kid pleaded guilty in march to one count each of mail 
fraud and securities fraud most of the investors he conned were 
friends of his parents prosecutors said 
i have betrayed my own sense of morality and values and 
betrayed the trust and love of numerous people around me bloom 
told the judge 
he conceded he was deserving of punishment but his attorney 
david w oconnor sought leniency saying bloom was a greedy 
young man and a product of our times 
when he grew up greed was on the ascendency oconnor said 
david bloom shouldnt wind up being the scapegoat of the 1980s 
us district judge david n edelstein said he found bloom 
remorseless completely lacking in conscience he was a predator 
completely insensitive 
the judge said he was imposing the stiff sentence because it was 
absolutely essential to send a message to those who act through 
greed and insatiable lust for despoiling innocent people 
the prosecution said bloom used deceit and fraud to parlay a 
college investment club into a multimilliondollar investment 
operation with about 140 clients 
bloom who was not registered as an investment adviser attracted 
investors to his nowdefunct greater sutton investors group inc by 
falsely claiming his clients included the sultan of brunei the 
rockefeller family and entertainer bill cosby 
bloom a 1985 duke university graduate with an art history 
degree told clients he was putting their money into the stock 
market when he actually was using it to pay for his own lavish 
lifestyle 
he had art works worth 55 million an 830000 condominium on 
manhattans upper east side a long island beach house worth 19 
million and two cars an astonmartin convertible and a 
mercedesbenz worth 200000 
bloom sent his investors bogus account statements that claimed to 
show their securities holdings according to the charges he also 
was charged with using new clients funds to pay profits to 
older clients 
edelstein sentenced bloom to four years on each count and 
ordered the terms to run consecutively 
he went on his way without any thought of the pain suffering 
and misery he was inflicting said edelstein he was amoral not 
immoral 
the judge said bloom had cannibalized his family and friends 
he also ordered bloom to make full restitution 
no fine was imposed edelstein could have sentenced bloom to 10 
years in prison and fined him 20 million 
in january the securities and exchange commission brought civil 
charges against bloom who settled by agreeing to turn over his 
assets to a courtappointed receiver and to stay out of the 
securities industry for the rest of his life 
bloom neither admitted nor denied the sec allegations but 
criminal charges were brought in march he waived indictment and 
pleaded guilty march 31 to one count each of mail and securities 
fraud

twothirds of the inmates granted workrelease 
status at the controversial patuxent institution are murderers and 
nearly 60 percent are serving life terms according to prison 
statistics 
the patuxent institution which emphasizes rehabilitation through 
psychotherapy came under criticism last week when convicted rapist 
james m stavarakas fled while on workrelease and allegedly raped a 
woman in hyattsville he was arrested sunday 
earlier it was revealed that triple killer robert daly angell 
was granted several unsupervised furloughs 
citing the criticism and stavarakas escape the patuxent board 
of review voted dec 1 to suspend all furloughs and work release 
programs indefinitely 
lifers turn up more often in patuxents workrelease and leave 
programs than do inmates from the prisons general population 
according to the figures released thursday by the department of 
public safety and correctional services while those serving life 
sentences represent about one in five patuxent inmates they make up 
59 percent of those on workrelease and 28 percent of those on 
leave the figures showed 
the figures also showed that inmates serving life terms at 
patuxent serve only half as much time as do lifers at other maryland 
prisons before they are granted parole 
the 16 patuxent lifers paroled from july 1 1977 to june 30 
1988 served an average of 84 years before release life inmates at 
other maryland prisons are confined 17 years on average before 
parole saiddr norma b gluckstern patuxents director 
patuxent is unusual because of the wide authority given to prison 
officials to grant leaves to inmates although a 1982 law requires 
approval by the governor before an inmate serving for life is 
paroled 
several state lawmakers have suggested that further restrictions 
be placed on the prisons governing board 
inmates are sent to patuxent because correction officials 
consider them more likely to be rehabilitated through its program of 
psychological and psychiatric counseling

officials on friday tried to determine who 
shot down a us locustspraying plane and a us team reported 
trouble in reaching the wreckage in a remote area used by rebels to 
launch attacks 
the investigators told the us embassy in rabat by telephone the 
wreckage of the dc7 lay in the western sahara within a 25milewide 
strip between mauritania and the most forward positions along a 
2000mile defense wall built by morocco 
that confirmed earlier us satellite data placing the site in 
the heart of an area the marxistled polisario independence movement 
in the western sahara uses to group its forces a surfacetoair 
missile downed the plane thursday morning and damaged another plane 
that managed to land safely 
at this point we still dont know who fired the missile 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said friday asked whether 
us officials thought it was a terrorist incident he said well 
we dont know yet a lot depends on something we dont know yet 
which is who did it 
us military experts said the site was a few miles east of 
daddar lahlou a desert outpost halfway between the mauritanian 
border and the defensive wall morocco erected to guard the most 
valuable part of the phosphaterich territory the spot is about 650 
miles south of rabat the capital of this north african country 
the plane was chartered by the us agency for international 
development reports said it exploded at an altitude of about 10000 
feet and that the five occupants all americans were presumed to be 
dead the wreckage was scattered over a wide area 
a second dc7 chartered by aid to help fight the locust plague in 
northern africa also was hit by a missile but limped 250 miles and 
land safely at sidi ifni it sat at the end of the single runway 
friday and the sidi ifni airport was closed 
sergio tommasoni 64 coowner of the chandler ariz aviation 
company that owned both planes was crew chief of the second plane 
he and the other four men aboard were reported safe in agadir 
the american investigators were experiencing unusual 
difficulties in reaching the site us military experts said 
they did not elaborate 
the americans aboard the downed plane were identified as joel 
blackmer 46 and blackmers son frank kennedy 21 both of 
phoenix ben rossini 49 tempe ariz frank hederman 47 cody 
wyo and wes wilson of north platte neb 
in nebraska wilsons widow linda wilson said she talked with 
her husband by telephone on wednesday night and expected him to be 
home by monday 
they knew there were border disputes but they evidently didnt 
think that had anything to do with them she said in an interview 
with kkar radio of omaha 
it was widely assumed though not confirmed officially that both 
missiles were fired by a guerrilla unit 
polisario fighters in the area usually have sovietdesigned sam 
missiles for defense against moroccan aircraft both dc7s were 
flying at 10000 to 11000 feet generally considered too high for 
visual identification 
an american official said privately it was at least possible 
the attackers thought the planes were moroccan 
in washington state department officials said the fbi has been 
brought into the case to investigate who fired the missile at the 
planes and why 
madjid abdullah the polisarios north american representative 
told the associated press in washington the front will do 
everything possible to shed full light on this tragic and 
unfortunate incident 
he said the polisario front has no interest in creating an 
incident with the united states and declared that morocco must 
assume responsibility for sending civilian planes over an area with 
a huge concentration of polisario forces 
the government of king hassan ii of morocco issued a statement 
friday denouncing what it called this act of barbarism it said 
the victims were shot down coldly while they were fulfilling a 
humanitarian duty 
morocco rarely comments on events in the 14yearold war with 
polisario but habitually claims its defensive wall runs flush with 
the mauritanian border 
tommasoni described the twohour trip in the crippled plane to 
sidi ifni as hairy 
we lost altitude we were 25 to 30 feet above the ground most 
of the way he said by telephone from his hotel room in agadir 
we had a load of insecticide aboard and we dumped it and were able 
to gain some altitude 
the planes left dakar capital of senegal early thursday morning 
for agadir to join the battle against locusts 
morocco annexed the former spanish sahara after spain withdrew in 
1975 and moroccan positions were attacked soon afterward by 
polisario guerrillas based in algeria fighting has continued 
despite moroccos construction of the wall 
the united nations plans to organize a referendum among the 
80000 people who lived in the territory under spanish rule and 
their children the two sides have not agreed however on exactly 
who should be allowed to vote or a plan for withdrawing moroccan 
forces

soviet scientists are competing with each other 
to develop a research project for the scientific use of a 
controversial military radar the president of the soviet academy of 
sciences said friday 
guriy marchuk who leads the soviet academy said that at least 
four scientific uses for the large radar station at krasnoyarsk have 
been proposed to the academy but no final decision has been made 
the radar located in a remote sector of central siberia was 
turned over to the soviet academy by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev after the reagan administration claimed that it was a 
violation of the antiballistic missile treaty between the us and 
the soviet union 
the radar is neither on the edge of the soviet union nor is it 
pointed outward as is required by the abm treaty it is believed by 
us experts that the radar was built for the detection and tracking 
of ballistic missiles 
marchuk who lectured friday at the national academy of sciences 
was asked what the soviet academy planned to do with the radar 
we dont know marchuk replied through an interpreter we 
have declared a competition or contest to find the best use for 
the radar station 
we have at least four projects suggesting what we should do 
with it he added he said the proposals include both space and 
atmospheric research 
marchuk speaking to an audience of american researchers said 
that scientists everywhere may participate in the competition 
i invite all of those with ideas to come up with proposals and 
send them to us he said 
in his lecture marchuk said the soviet union now is applying 
democratic principles in selecting the scientific leadership of the 
nation 
he said there are about 520 academic institutions in the ussr and 
that they all recently selected new leaders on a competitive 
basis 
more than half of the academic institutions now are headed by 
young people said marchuk this is possible only in the 
atmosphere of democracy 
the academy president said he regarded this as a good development 
for soviet science because the best ideas come into the minds of 
people under the age of 30 after 30 they just develop their ideas 
marchuk gave the lecture on the opening day of a conference 
marking the 30th year of cooperatation and exchange between the 
national academy of sciences of the united states and the academy 
of sciences of the ussr

the battle across hills overlooking this coastal town 50 miles 
north of the israeli border and nine miles south of beirut lebanese 
police and israeli army spokesmen said 
israel said at least 20 guerrillas were killed and dozens 
wounded lebanese police said at least eight were killed 
the operation ended when four israeli troops who had been 
separated from the main force and surrounded by guerrillas were 
plucked from the ground by two cobra gunships and carried away 
clinging to the struts an israeli officer said a similar rescue in 
1986 saved the life of a downed israeli pilot 
in israel army chief of staff lt gen dan shomron said israel 
launched the raid against the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command a prosyrian group headed by ahmed 
jibril to deter further attacks against israel 
he jibril prepares incidents all the time and we saw a great 
need to attack his camp from where a great many incidents of this 
organization are planned and organized against us shomron told a 
news conference 
israeli officials declined to say how many troops participated in 
the raid which began with a landing on bluffs east of naameh at 
around midnight 
an israeli army spokesman said the troops maneuvered across one 
to two miles of rough terrain on foot to the nearby guerrilla base 
then penetrated it without being detected and fought handtohand 
before withdrawing 
the israeli officer was killed during the assault on the camp 
the spokesman said an army communique identified him as lt col 
amir meital 29 a commander of the elite golani brigade 
in lebanon a police spokesman said the israeli unit was ambushed 
and surrounded shortly after landing he said the israelis responded 
by dispatching commandos by sea and its warplanes mounted 20 
sorties 
the hostilities were over by 1115 am 415 am est shortly 
after two israeli helicopters landed near an abandoned maronite 
monastery and evacuated the besieged troops the spokesman said 
the operation marked israels deepest penetration into lebanon 
since it withdrew from the chouf mountains southeast of beirut in 
september 1983 about a year after invading lebanon in 1982 israel 
withdrew most of its troops from lebanon in 1985 
initial communiques released by jibrils group claimed 18 
israelis were captured but later jibril acknowledged there were no 
captives saying the israeli army has managed even to evacuate 
the body of the killed officer as well as the three wounded 
soldiers 
sitting at an impromptu news conference in a tunnel in the 
stricken area jibril displayed a usmade m16 rifle and 
binoculars he said belonged to the dead israeli officer 
an aide to jibril speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
israelis had released several doberman pinscher dogs fitted with 
teargas containers and explosives 
the dogs were trained to chase our fighters in the tunnels 
when the israelis would release the gas by remote control or 
detonate the explosives to either force our fighters to leave the 
tunnels or kill them he said 
our fighters shot the dogs he said pointing to a dead black 
doberman with explosives and a gas container strapped around his 
belly 
the police spokesman said guerrillas and allied leftist 
militiamen opened fire at the israeli jets and helicopter gunships 
from twinbarrelled antiaircraft guns and launched several 
shoulderfired sam7 missiles no hits were reported he said 
syrian soldiers in trucks and armored personnel carriers were 
seen rolling south on the coastal highway when israeli 
reinforcements stormed ashore at saadiyat two miles south of 
naameh the spokesman said but he said there was no evidence of any 
syrianisraeli combat 
distant thuds of explosions could be heard in beirut as the 
planes thundered through the blue mediterranean sky to stage 
israels 24th air raid on lebanon this year 
at least 119 people were killed and 333 wounded in 23 previous 
israeli air raids on lebanon since jan 3

bluffs as the hostilities raged and panicked residents deserted the 
town for safer areas in beirut and south lebanon 
many cars sped out horns honking from the stricken bluffs to 
the coastal highway

government survived its first national assembly censure vote early 
saturday when communist members refused to back the conservative 
opposition 
only 258 legislators all members of rightist or centerright 
parties voted for the censure motion

votes against six seats are vacant in the 577member chamber of 
deputies the lower house

strikes by public employees including one that has disrupted 
subway bus and suburban train service for the past two weeks but 
he was in no danger of losing the censure vote 
france is at an impasse philippe seguin speaking for the 
conservative rally for the republic party said in the censure 
debate a country needs to be led to know where its going how 
its getting there and why its going there 
rocard told the national assembly it was a motion of spite 
presented because the right was embitterred by its defeat in 
this years presidential and legislative elections 
he called the motion an operation of political diversion with 
its result known in advance and with no effect on the political or 
social climate 
the debate began friday night and lasted past midnight 
the current chamber of deputies is made up of 273 socialists 130 
members of the rally for the republic 89 from the centerright 
union for french democracy 41 in the union of the center 24 
communists and 14 independents 
president francois mitterrand named rocard premier last may after 
winning reelection to a new sevenyear term in junes legislative 
elections the socialists fell short of winning a majority in the 
chamber but did well enough to prevent the right from taking 
control

former philippine president ferdinand marcos was 
hospitalized friday after suffering what apparently was congestive 
heart failure spokesmen said 
marcos 71 was taken by ambulance to st francis hospital he 
was admitted upon the recommendation of his physician calvin wong 
because of the acute onset of congestive heart failure friday 
morning spokesman gemmo trinidad said 
marcos was in guarded condition friday afternoon and was expected 
to be in the hospital for a couple of days said st francis 
hospital spokeswoman norma kop 
preliminary findings indicated marcos had indeed suffered 
congestive heart failure and an arrhythmia or irregularity in the 
heartbeat she said 
asked to comment on allegations that marcos who was deposed as 
philippine president in 1986 and is now under indictment in the 
united states had earlier faked symptoms of illness kop replied 
he had a heart irregularity and that can be pretty serious 
he was resting comfortably with his wife imelda nearby and he 
was able to eat and was in good spirits she said 
marcos was given chest xrays an ekg and diagnostic tests but 
the results would not be available until saturday she said 
wong said marcos did not have a heart attack congestive heart 
failure means the heart is unable to pump the amount of blood 
required by the body 
mrs marcos is very worried trinidad said shes in tears 
shes always in tears 
marcos began having chest pains around 4 am after learning 
that his pregnant daughter imee manotoc who lives in exile in 
morocco was having medical problems and would have to deliver by 
caesarian section trinidad said 
monotoc gave birth but her condition and that of the baby was not 
known trinidad said the president became so worried sick and 
upset that they called the doctor trinidad said 
after marcos was examined by doctors at his makiki heights home 
it was decided he should be hospitalized trinidad said marcos 
arrived at the hospital shortly after noon and was admitted after 
being examined in the hospitals emergency room 
marcos spent several days at the hospital in may after suffering 
chest pains 
marcos has been monitored for three weeks because of an irregular 
heartbeat due to heart disease trinidad said wong ordered complete 
bed rest and marcos will not be permitted to walk around at the 
hospital trinidad said 
a new york cardiologist has told a federal judge in new york that 
although marcos suffers various health problems he is well enough 
to travel to new york for arraignment on racketeering charges the 
arraignment had been postponed after marcos doctors said he was not 
well enough to travel 
marcos faked pain and other ailments during the threehour 
examination according to the report by the cardiologist francis m 
weld 
weld said he wong and other marcos physicians with whom he 
consulted are unable to account for marcos escalating and 
widespread pain syndrome and say that that should not stop him from 
traveling or appearing in court 
marcos has lived in hawaii since he was ousted in february 1986

mikhail gorbachevs visit and a glitzy soviet

soviet businesses abroad already include service stations in 
scandinavia tractor dealerships and fish canneries in the united 
states and canada and currency speculators in london and paris

expert at carleton university in ottawa i dont think the

when a group of ordinary boston merchants who liked 
to sing formed the handel amp haydn society in 1815 beethoven was hot 
and mozart was trendy 
decades passed the amateur chorus grew musically musty but 
since christopher hogwood a worldrenowned british expert in early 
music took over as artistic director in 1986 the countrys oldest 
performing arts group has returned to its avantgarde origins 
he has breathed new life into handels messiah by scraping 
off nearly 200 years of biggerisbetter interpretation using 
period instruments and following the composers instructions 
last year hogwood mixed jazz pianist keith jarrett with mozart 
and prokofiev to demonstrate unexpected connections and he would 
like to collaborate with such unorthodox musicians as the talking 
heads a rock band with an intellectual bent 
im interested in doing some extraordinary combinations the 
sort of program that really makes the audience think he said 
during a recent interview 
hogwood is just as faithful to the societys baroque and 
classical heritage the music that attracted this 47yearold 
scholar harpsichordist author and conductor in the first place 
after all this was the group that performed the us premieres 
of haydns the creation 1817 handels complete messiah 
1818 verdis requiem 1878 and bachs b minor mass 
1887 
those were the hamph heydays some time around the turn of the 
century the handel amp haydn society got stuck in the past thats 
when it stopped sending 600singer choruses to new york city by 
boat its reputation shriveled until it was known as little more 
than a boston chorus that sang messiah at christmas 
this began to change in the late 1960s when conductor thomas dunn 
trimmed from hundreds of amateurs to a few dozen professional 
singers and added a small professional orchestra 
then hogwood arrived 
the cambridge university musicologist harpsichoridist scholar 
author and conductor already was established as the sort of musician 
who would have suited the hamph founders in 1973 for example he 
founded the academy of ancient music the first british orchestra to 
use instruments authentic to the baroque and classical music it 
performed 
hogwood 47 holds to the paradoxical philosophy that what is old 
can be new thats why he favors instruments and arrangements 
authentic to the composer who wrote the work 
as he phrased it should we put the hands back on venus de milo 
my feeling is toward locating what speaks to every man if you 
take on the right instruments that music will speak more natural 
language 
hogwoods deft mix of old and new touches everything this month 
hamph marked the 135th annual boston performance of handels 
messiah but performed for the first time on period instruments 
also during december hamph performs at lincoln center its first 
return to new york since the last century the society is also 
taking messiah to chicagos orchestra hall for a debut 
and the group has its first recording contract 
it is a society so its more than just concerts we talk 
to our audience the hamph demands that we be at the cutting edge 
hogwood said 
thus when the improvisational jarrett performed he played 
mozart who was himself a famed improviser that concert also 
included prokofiev the neoclassical modern russian composer who 
looked to mozart for inspiration the program illustrated the 
musical threads 
the public seems to like this approach too its subscription 
list is multiplying 
it has operated in the black the past four years and the 1989 
budget is 13 million for its september to april season thats 
triple the 1984 budget 
hogwood juggles his time and place between england where he 
makes his home and runs the academy of ancient music minnesota 
where he is director of music for the st paul chamber orchestra 
and sydney where he is artistic adviser to the australian chamber 
orchestra 
since taking over as music director in 1986 he is quickly moving 
hamph out into that world showing it is alive and well and living up 
to the tradition of its founders 
hogwoods goal he said is to get what we are doing more 
defined and get it outside the confines of boston

last summer beverly dangelo was grand marshal 
of the july 4 parade in her native columbus ohio in the new peter 
otoole movie high spirits dangelo doesnt do much cheering 
she plays the unhappy wife of steve guttenberg an american 
tourist who hopes to rejuvenate his marriage by taking a trip to 
ireland they end up at castle plunkett run by peter plunkett 
otoole who attracts customers by advertising that the castle is 
haunted unloved by his coldhearted wife guttenberg ends up 
falling in love with a beautiful ghost daryl hannah 
i decided i was going to be free from what was expected of 
me said dangelo about her new role she has appeared in coal 
miners daughter with sissy spacek and national lampoons 
vacation with chevy chase among many other films 
after the vacation movies there was tremendous popularity 
and success she said i got photographed at a lot of airports 
but if youre really established so firmly in other peoples 
imagination its difficult to get out a certain range 
so the actress jumped at the chance to play a negative character 
in high spirits 
i was totally relieved of having to try to make anyone like me 
i could really explore a territory without worrying about it 
dangelo said 
the actress was born in 1954 and lived in columbus until 
graduating from high school painting was her first love and she 
lived in florence italy where she studied at the american school 
of contemporary arts but her dream of being an artist was 
shortlived and when she returned to the united states dangelo 
whose father was a musician pursued a career as a singer 
i had a musical background and i ended up in toronto doing 
studio vocals i did anything pepsodent commercials i sang in a 
few bands i sang in bowling alleys 
she landed a job as a background singer for the rock artist 
ronnie hawkins but her interests soon shifted to acting and she 
joined a canadianbased repertory company in the mid1970s she 
played ophelia in a musical version of hamlet on canadian 
television and had the same role when it was brought to broadway as 
rockabye hamlet the show flopped 
i strangled myself on stage while smoke bombs and fires went 
off she recalled 
movies however proved more successful for dangelo her debut 
came in 1977 with a bit part in woody allens academy awardwinning 
annie hall she followed that with roles in john schlesingers 
honky tonk freeway and the adaption of the musical hair 
thats when it started to click i had been a painter then i 
wanted to be a singer in hair i realized there was a tremendous 
amount of freedom in playing different characters you could play a 
painter play a singer it suits my temperament 
in 1980 dangelo got to play the late country star patsy cline 
in the highly acclaimed coal miners daughter she has warm 
memories of the film especially of its star sissy spacek 
i always felt that the whole movie was a very wonderful 
experience and it had everything to do with sissy dangelo said 
she did such special work and i really think a lot of the 
atmosphere had to do with that she was such a wonderful person 
dangelo had known director neil jordan mona lisa and 
quickly agreed to be in high spirits the atmosphere on the set 
seemed to live up to the films title 
there are some scenes where youre watching peter otoole 
peter gallagher little john a street theater performer from 
dublin liam neeson and me and steve guttenberg all these people 
came together that was fascinating she said 
everybody did have such different approaches it was a process 
of being quick on your feet all the time 
she especially enjoyed working with otoole 
peter otooles a genius and very charming peters got one of 
the alltime great reputations for having lived a life so it was a 
pleasure to see that hes also the ultimate professional 
high spirits has undergone changes since filming was 
completed the producers found the plot too complicated and ended up 
eliminating material dangelo was unhappy with some of the 
alterations but still defended the movie 
this opened the dublin film festival and i sat with 2000 
people who really really enjoyed it dangelo said 
and she was happy to play the character that got booed 
theres a lot of encouragment to play sympathetic roles but in 
this role instead of going after someones heart youre going 
after somebodys imagination

as a federal grand jury decides whether he 
should be prosecuted a graduate student linked to a virus that 
disrupted computers nationwide last month has been teaching his 
lawyer about the technical subject and turning down offers for his 
life story 
robert morris jr has declined offers from movie producers book 
publishers magazines and television shows said his lawyer thomas 
guidoboni 
robert is not interested he said hes not that kind of 
person hes fairly shy and isnt looking for publicity 
until we get the potential criminal matter resolved 
guidoboni said the 23yearold cornell university graduate student 
will remain silent despite heavy pressure to talk 
its not only the media its computer professionals its the 
government its cornell ive even heard a rumor that congress 
wants to hear from him said guidoboni in an interview from 
washington dc 
no charges have been filed against morris who reportedly told 
friends that he designed the virus that temporarily clogged about 
6000 university and military computers linked to the pentagons 
arpanet network 
a virus is a rogue computer program that can duplicate itself and 
cripple or destroy existing computer systems 
the grand jury investigation is continuing they are looking 
for specific criminal and federal violations that may have been 
committed assistant us attorney andrew baxter said wednesday 
declining to be more specific 
according to search warrants authorities executed at harvard and 
cornell universities in the days following the nov 2 episode fbi 
investigators are reviewing statutes concerning computer fraud wire 
fraud malicious mischief and unlawful access to stored 
communications 
but i cant say the grand jury is looking at the same thing 
said baxter 
recently two harvard university computer experts appeared before 
the grand jury in syracuse they were computer programmer andrew h 
sudduth and graduate student paul graham 
morris attended harvard before beginning a doctoral program in 
computer science at cornell 
the grand jury also has heard from dean krafft a cornell 
computer science research associate and has reviewed morris 
computer accounts from both universities 
the three witnesses have declined to say what questions the grand 
jury had asked or what information they provided the panel 
according to published reports sudduth has said morris called 
him on the night of the outbreak to seek assistance in getting out a 
warning to computer operators linked to the affected system 
morris whose father robert t morris sr is the chief 
scientist at the national computer security center in bethesda md 
reportedly wrote the virus as an intellectual experiment and did not 
intend any harm 
the program apparently was intended to live undetected in the 
arpanet system in which it was first introduced and secretly make 
copies that would move from computer to computer however a design 
error caused it to replicate out of control in computers linked to 
the system 
morris remains secluded at his parents home in arnold md 
where he has been since the outbreak occurred 
according to his lawyer hes trying to keep busy and marking 
his time until this is over 
hes doing volunteer work and spending a lot of time with me 
teaching an ignorant lawyer about a highly technical matter said 
guidoboni

the boy was up to no good and his 
parents knew it 
he was staying out late and skipping school strangers were 
coming up to his bedroom window at 2 am but he swore he wasnt 
dealing drugs the parents needed proof to set him straight and they 
didnt want him to get arrested 
they called in corky an eager yellow labrador with a remarkably 
effective nose 
the dog found a quarterounce of coke in gram bags in a slit 
under his rug said gene panella who trained 2yearold corky to 
locate even minute amounts of marijuana cocaine and heroin at 250 
a sniff 
panella owner of k9 of broward has found a lucrative new angle 
on south floridas everpresent drug trade working for private 
citizens who want their property to be drugfree but has also 
raised the ire of civil libertarians 
in the past four months hes been nearly every other day on a 
search said panella who claims corky has found drugs in 32 of 33 
homes 
families and corporations are mostly interested in getting help 
for people on drugs rather than arresting them all im doing is 
finding the evidence to confront them with 
panella primarily breeds and trains guard dogs but he decided to 
branch out after boat owners began calling him for help from the 
us coast guards zero tolerance policy of confiscating boats 
found with minimal amounts of drugs on board 
one was the owner of the 135foot luxury yacht corky searched in 
fort lauderdale 
when we got to the crews quarters the dog just went bananas 
panella said the owner fired the crew on the spot he just 
dropped them off on the dock 
panella says he warns business executives that one offender can 
leave drug residue all over an office but he doesnt worry that the 
dog might also implicate drugfree employees during his searches 
i just tell them where it is the rest is their problem 
private employees are not constitutionally protected from drug 
searches of their workplaces but the prospect is nevertheless 
disturbing to civil libertarians 
its funny to think of a dog as hightech but its clear 
that this is a very highly invasive type of technology said paul 
joseph vice president of the american civil liberties union in 
florida our society is going to have to decide whether that is 
acceptable 
but jack hook of the us drug enforcement administration office 
in miami says panellas services are sorely needed 
how else can you stop the lawyer who stops by his favorite 
crack house on the way home hook said i think its needed 
because nothing has been done to stop the users 
there are other businesses like panellas around the country but 
there arent very many of them im sure said wayne bohrer 
deputy chief of the deas state and industry section in washington 
panella said he had been contacted by someone in new york who wanted 
to start a drugdog business 
corky is so much in demand now that panella is training a 
4monthold beagle named daffy to handle the overflow 
but dog owners daydreaming of making a fortune off fido should 
know that a good drug dog costs about 6000 to train and not all 
types are suited for the work panella said 
the biggest thing about training a drug dog is starting with 
the right animal you want the obnoxious hyper snotty types he 
said you want them to get keyed up 
panella has a special dispensation from the drug enforcement 
administration to keep the illegal drugs he needs to train his dogs 
but the animals never get to eat the drugs that drive them crazy 
everybody thinks the dogs are all junkies but we never let 
them touch the drugs panella said ive seen dogs get stoned 
out and theyre never the same after that

a holiday dinner as sassy and sumptuous as the 
one miss ruby serves up is a feast indeed 
the table is set tuesday on pbs for miss rubys southern 
holiday dinner and even yankees will feel right at home with new 
york restaurateur ruth adams bronz aka miss ruby and her 
guests humorist roy blount jr entertainer pearl bailey annie 
potts of designing women and food writer craig claiborne 
together they cook eat and talk about some of the hallmarks of a 
southern christmas feast smithfield ham which looks funny 
tastes real good says bronz redeye gravy red snapper stuffed 
with crab turkey and cornbread stuffing scalloped oysters and 
derby pie its a delightful hour for cooks and for eaters 
bronz whose restaurant features a changing menu of regional 
american foods was raised in texas by a louisiana grandmother 
and so qualifies as a southern cook but she acknowledges at the 
start that some will disagree with her version of the dishes 
every southerner believes his south is the only true one 
her guests come from virginia bailey georgia blount 
kentucky potts and mississippi claiborne and have a range of 
experience in the kitchen blount for instance mostly puts things 
in and takes things out of the oven tastes the food and comments 
on it this is the prettiest ham ive seen little children that 
werent as pretty 
over cocktails potts and bronz laugh about fruitcakes and 
yankees and claiborne and blount discuss childhood christmases 
including claibornes memories of breakfasts of quail and ham with 
redeye gravy and grits 
when claiborne makes his cornbread stuffing he notes that its 
not essential to cook these innards until theyre quite 
welldone because theyll cook in the turkey but blount wanders 
into the kitchen takes a handful of stuffing and bites into a raw 
giblet which claiborne calls chicken gizzard sashimi 
at one point bronz coerces blount and potts to pick crab for the 
snapper stuffing as they work on a big pile of blue crabs they 
giggle and reminisce and blount who steals a few bites and gets 
caught with crabmeat on the end of his nose lets on that hes 
borrowed claibornes apron 
when i used to try to cook things people used to say you 
couldnt wear craig claibornes apron but i showed them he 
says 
when bronz was working with producer robert kanter and director 
michael wolkowitz to plan miss rubys southern holiday dinner 
it was decided to try to fit the celebrity guests in with the 
cooking said bronz 
thats authentic bronz said in a telephone interview explaining 
that her grandmothers generation would make long trips across the 
prairie for house parties that would last six weeks over the 
holidays and i think that was in my mind in some way i had a 
real vision of these people being in my kitchen 
the result is comfortable and welcoming what kanter calls a 
comedycookingtalk show 
bronz said she worried a little that the food would be 
overwhelmed by all the commotion but when serious work is under way 
in the kitchen the directions are clear and concise and easy to 
follow viewers also can send for recipes 
i really think good food is riveting i dont think people will 
wander from that bronz said and we really set it up so that 
when we werent making food we were talking about it southerners 
just love to talk about food and if theyre not talking about food 
theyre talking about family and sometimes theyre talking about 
food and family 
there are dishes for cooks of all abilities potts makes her 
derby pie in less than 5 minutes and many people will sympathize

when marlo thomas accompanied her husband 
phil donahue to moscow last year she had more in mind than 
sightseeing in red square 
the trip gave her the idea for what will be the first 
sovietamerican coproduction of an entertainment show her special 
free to be a family airing wednesday on abc 
its an entertainment exchange between kids and superstar 
performers from this country and the soviet union thomas said 
we present our favorite performers and they present theirs its a 
fun show of comedy and song but the show also challenges 
destructive stereotypes about families 
our goal is to show children that every family no matter whos 
in it or where they live is a real family as long as its members 
nurture and love each other 
we also talk about the global family its no longer we and 
they we have to start thinking of us steve martin talks about 
feeding the entire world with one turkey and how big it was would 
have to be carly simon sings the song that became our theme turn 
of the tide it says we are the turn of the tide and we have to 
speak up 
the onehour special is a sequel to free to be you and 
me which won peabody and emmy awards in 1984 
thomas made arrangements for the special while her husband was 
taping a weeks worth of his syndicated talk show donahue in the 
soviet union 
free to be a family was put together later by means of a 
satellite hookup between the hard rock cafe in new york and 
gosteleradio studios in moscow 
thomas is host of the special in new york and tatiana vedeneyeva 
is host in moscow among the american performers are the rock group 
bon jovi actress whoopi goldberg comic magicians penn and teller 
singersongwriter carly simon comedians lily tomlin and robin 
williams and muppets kermit the frog and miss piggy 
we started work on the special last september said thomas 
it was very complicated to put together this is the first jointly 
produced americansoviet entertainment program we have 40 
soviet kids and 40 american kids and we sing over the space 
bridge satellite the kids were selected a year ago and got to know 
each other by exchanging letters and photos 
a free to be a family book was published in 1987 and 
half a million copies have been sold an album featuring many of the 
stars on the special was issued last month 
soviet rock star vladimir prezhnikof is on the show i was 
surprised to learn the russians dance to the same dance steps we do 
and know more about us than we know about them they know all of our 
rock stars and see our movies 
thomas said the first project free to be you and me was 
an attempt to rewrite childrens literature to eliminate sexual and 
ethnic stereotypes 
there were too many stories about prince charming coming along 
and carrying the girl off she said i wanted to liberate the 
definition of boy and girl the way we had liberated the definition 
of men and women the new book liberates the definition of the 
family and expands its meaning 
with the special completed thomas is now on to other things 
shes just completed a comedymystery called in the spirit it 
costars elaine may peter falk and olympia dukakis 
elaine plays a hollywood wife and im a new age health food 
store owner who thinks all the worlds problems would be solved if 
people would just stop eating meat she said were being chased 
by someone who thinks we know about a murder 
next she will star in a feature film for 20th century fox called 
a point of light its a story of a rural family and probably 
will be filmed in vermont 
she will also costar with her father danny thomas in a cbs 
drama called deception she said we play father and 
daughter he said we look alike so what else could we play

the annual crop of holiday greenery is 
sprouting in american homes enjoying those decorations also means 
using some care to avoid fire and keep children from poisoning 
themselves accidentally 
some of the most popular plants used for holiday decorations are 
poisonous according to the national clearinghouse for poison 
control centers 
holly is popular because of its bright green leaves and red 
berries but the berries can be dangerous if eaten 
swallowing the berries can lead to diarrhea vomiting and 
depression of the central nervous system the poison control center 
says 
mistletoe berries are another danger containing chemicals that 
can cause abdominal pain diarrhea vomiting high blood pressure 
and even collapse of the circulatory system medical authorities 
say in addition diarrhea weakness low blood pressure and other 
problems can occur from eating any part of the yew plant 
those lovely red poinsettias can be troublesome too health 
officials say that if any part of the plant is swallowed it can 
cause abdominal discomfort while the milky sap from the leaves can 
cause an irritation or dermatitis in some people 
another decoration danger is fire with christmas trees and other 
greenery a major problem 
try to keep the tree as moist as possible the consumer product 
safety commission urges after bringing it home cut off a few inches 
of the base and place it in water and keep the tree well watered 
when in use 
buyers should avoid dry trees of course a good test is to pull 
on some needles and see if they resist the harder they are to pull 
off the better 
if the cut part of the tree is sticky with resin thats a good 
sign 
try bouncing the tree on the ground a bit a shower of falling 
needles tells you that its too dry 
when going to bed or leaving the house turn off lights on trees 
and other decorations the commission said and never use candles on 
trees or near greens 
check all lights for broken bulbs and frayed wires before 
installing them and discard any damaged strings 
never use lights on a metallic artificial tree a faulty string 
can cause the entire tree to become charged potentially causing an 
electrocution this type of tree can be brightened by a spotlight 
shining on it 
other safety suggestions from the safety commission include 
artificial snow sprays can irritate the lungs if inhaled read 
the directions carefully and follow them 
wear gloves when decorating with spun glass angel hair to 
avoid irritation to eyes and skin 
use plastic tinsel rather than the leaded kinds which could 
be hazardous if ingested 
in homes with children be especially careful of using fragile 
decorations or items with sharp points or which resemble candy or 
food 
before lighting any fire make sure trimmings and wrapping paper 
are clear of the area do not burn wrappings in the fireplace

the grandson of leon trotsky sat in the room 
where one of stalins assassins killed the old revolutionary with an 
ax and pondered how far the new more enlightened kremlin would go 
toward making amends 
if glasnost wants to have authenticity it must recognize 
the proper place of leon trotsky in history esteban volkow 
bronstein said using the word denoting the more open soviet 
policies of mikhail s gorbachev 
the latest sign of change came dec 6 when volkow received 
permission to visit his halfsister alexandra who is dying of 
cancer in moscow he has not been to the soviet union or seen his 
sister in 57 years and learned only last month that she was alive 
its all part of gorbachevs policy volkow said and trotsky 
has been emerging slowly from the dark cave of soviet history 
since glasnost began 
for 50 or 60 years the russian public has been conditioned to 
think of him as almost the devil his grandson said you cant 
change black to white in one day 
leon trotsky born lev davidovich bronstein in 1879 was among 
the most popular leaders of the 1917 bolshevik revolution 
commander of the red army commissar for war and foreign affairs 
the right hand of lenin after losing a power struggle with josef 
stalin he became a nonperson 
stalin exiled him in 1929 and trotskys name was stricken from 
soviet history photographs and film were doctored to erase his 
image real and imagined followers were hunted down and imprisoned 
or killed 
trotskys road ended on a summer afternoon in at his desk in the 
modest house in coyoacan in those days was a quiet village 
coyoacan is enveloped by the smog of mexico city now but in the 
house itself little has change since the assassin entered it aug 
20 1940 with a mountaineers ice ax 
it has no plaques polished display cases or uniformed guards 
but there is a caretaker to greet visitors he answers the bell 
shows them through the rooms and hands them the guest book to sign 
there was a terrible solitude an emptiness here in the 
house volkow said remembering the years after the assassination 
he was born in the soviet union to trotskys daughter zina and now 
is 62 a semiretired chemical engineer 
trotskys house always has attracted a few soviet visitors he 
said but more have come in the past year or so 
they are opening windows in russia volkow said they are 
turning on the light there is a freshness 
glasnost has not altered trotskys official status but his name 
sometimes is mentioned publicly and the soviet supreme court 
rehabilitated a son volkows stepuncle sergei sedov who died in a 
stalin purge 
in september the communist party newspaper pravda called trotsky 
an enemy of stalin rather than an enemy of socialism and the 
revolution 
i believe that his heroic struggle almost alone against one 
of the most terrible the bloodiest tyrannies in history is the 
stage of his life that is going to have the most historical 
importance volkow said 
a quiet river that ran behind trotskys house two generations ago 
has become a stream of vehicles belching fumes on a freeway but in 
the shadowed rooms behind thick walls time seems congealed 
its curious he didnt live here long but he impregnated 
the house with his presence the grandsom said 
beside the reading lamp the dictaphone waits next to books in 
french german russian spanish and english on hitler capitalism 
italian fascism colonialism british trade unionism 
the bloodstains on trotskys chair have faded but bullet holes 
from an earlier assassination attempt still pock the bedroom walls 
he had the windows shuttered with steel and the gateway bricked 
up after the attack may 24 1940 by mexican stalinists with machine 
guns 
three months later a stalinist agent who had insinuated himself 
into the trotsky circle attacked with the ice ax when volkow then 
14 entered the room his grandfather lay on the floor bleeding his 
wife at his side 
the assassin spent 20 years in prison but his identity never was 
confirmed he was thought to be a spaniard ramon del rio mercader 
but also was known as jacques mornard and frank jackson 
volkow said trotsky treated each day after the may attack as a 
bonus every morning after he got up he would say another day of 
life natalia another day of life 
natalia sedov trotskys second wife lived in the house for more 
than 20 years after the assassination she died in paris in 1962 
in the garden a simple gray stone monument carved with a hammer 
and sickle encloses the ashes of trotsky and natalia 
a red flag flutters overhead

italys hottest anchorwoman hikes her skirt on the 
evening news gets sozzled on champagne from male admirers and 
before signing off invites men to call her on a special line 
it happens in a television spoof of television written and 
directed by women but real life is getting closer state television 
has a woman news reader 
when you feel secure you can poke fun at yourself said 
serena dandini one of three authors of the new weekly show tivu 
delle ragazze the girls television 
an increasing number of prime time newscasts feature women and 
italian women are becoming prominent in many other fields once 
closed to them 
women drive romes orangecolored buses in bumpertobumper 
traffic ever more frequently directed by female traffic officers 
policewomen wave automatic rifles out the windows of squad cars 
as they escort ministers and dignitaries until 1981 the national 
police force assigned women only to cases involving prostitution or 
children 
sunday afternoon soccer that ultimate male bastion now has a 
woman as one of the playbyplay radio commentators the games are 
not televised live 
when the first woman justice was named to the supreme court in 
september she was asked what it meant to enter a world previously 
reserved for men 
it signifies that women are present that theyre doing their 
job maria gabriella luccioli said she began her judicial career 
in 1963 when women were permitted to become magistrates 
marisa occhionero a rome university sociologist who has done 
studies for the government on the future of women said the movement 
into top positions is increasing and remains merely a question of 
time 
professors at universities engineers businesswomen 
architects she enumerated theyre not content to stay in civil 
service jobs the woman is changing she has changed its the man 
who hasnt changed 
women in fields ranging from politics to banking echoed her 
comment in interviews they reported tremendous gains at work but 
much less success in persuading men to help mind the house and 
children 
a survey of city families with both spouses working found the men 
put in an average of 35 hours a week at such chores as home repairs 
and cleaning the car while women did 3335 hours of housework 
carole beebe tarantelli an american who serves in the 
parliament said changing sex roles are difficult for an italian man 
whose mother would respond to every whim 
newly married italian men often are dismayed to discover that 
their wives working or not will not iron their underwear like 
their mothers did 
the italian womans struggle is especially hard because of 
the importance placed on the family and the concept of the mother as 
its pillar ms occhionero said 
it often is difficult to run an italian family given the 
structure of italian society especially for working mothers 
mrs tarantelli a mother noted that public schools dont have 
team sports or other extracurricular activities that means 
babysitters for children who finish classes at 1 pm five or six 
hours before parents finish work 
stores close three hours for lunch and only a few stay open past 
8 pm in the tuscan hilltown of arezzo complaints by factory 
workers that the only day care center shut down before the factory 
did prompted the town to open another with more suitable hours 
gioia longo a cultural anthropologist who founded a hotline for 
abused women said a survey she did of 700 teenagers in an adriatic 
resort town indicated girls see no limits on possible achievement 
but boys are confused about their changing roles 
ms occhionero said stereotypical latin males are afraid of 
these women they want to protect them but dont understand to what 
point and they are threatened 
stefania zappanico a journalist in her 20s says many women 
dont help their cause 
italian women are still different from northern european or 
american women said ms zappanico who has spent time in britain 
and the united states theyre not mentally independent even 
women who work think they have to depend on men they dont value 
independence that much in itself 
in a nationwide study of womens lot in the 1870s the first 
years of a unified italy an official in bari said an ass an ox 
a sheep are always worth more than a wife to the peasant and the 
wife obeys her husband like a slave 
a simple rendezvous could get a wife convicted of adultery a 
brief generation ago but a husband could be prosecuted only if he 
brought his lover to live in the house a 1969 supreme court 
decision led to adultery being abolished as a crime for either sex 
birth control pills were legalized in the early 1970s and 
abortion in 1978 
children of an italian man who marries a foreigner always have 
qualified for citizenship automatically but those of a woman in the 
same situation did not qualify until 1984 
dictator benito mussolini thought a womans place was home making 
babies but some historians feel his policy of getting women out of 
the workplace helped them in the long run because many enrolled in 
universities when they could not get jobs 
as more and more italian women enter politics their issues are 
certain to get more attention ms occhionero said women are ever 
more present in the field but still scarce in proportion to 
their effort

the burger king near penn station lets homeless 
customers have it their way up to a point the welcome ends if 
owners think the restaurant is becoming a stopgap shelter for smelly 
transients 
sometimes its difficult to put people out because you know 
they have no place to go said night manager cecil murray but 
you cant have vagrants it scares the normal customers 
some come in for five or 10 minutes just to get warm and wont 
buy anything some end up sitting there with the same thing for an 
hour i ask them to leave i cant have my boss see the whole place 
full of vagrants he said 
a week ago a homeless alcoholic man was dragged from a fast food 
eatery in san francisco and deposited on the sidewalk after passing 
out over his meal he lay there five hours before anyone noticed he 
was dead homeless advocates decried the incident as a toocommon 
example of societys callousness 
the san francisco episode highlights the predicament of fastfood 
restaurants which have become beacons for the homeless they dont 
want to banish people to the streets but neither do they want their 
family atmosphere disrupted by shabby creatures sometimes lugging 
all their worldly possessions in shopping bags and carts 
some places deal with the problem by posting time limits the 
burger king on eighth avenue allows no customer to linger longer 
than 20 minutes 
its fast food we need the seating space said manager mike 
barnes but if someone passed out inside i would call an 
ambulance you just cant carry them out to the street especially 
if they had made a purchase 
other places make casebycase decisions 
if they smell and bother other customers we tell them to 
leave said jose choe who runs a mcdonalds on canal street in 
lower manhattan 
we dont set a limit on how much money or how much time they 
spend as long as nobody is offended said jose martinez manager 
of a mcdonalds near grand central station if someone in a suit 
and tie is being a real pain we would escort them out 
advocates say thousands of homeless seek refuge in subway cars 
train stations bus depots or burger joints 
there are parts of the country ive been in where the local 
dunkin donuts is an emergency shelter by default said robert 
hayes founder of the citys coalition for the homeless 
as night follows day a human being afflicted by a cold wind is 
going to look for refuge hayes said but nobody with a 
reasonable option is going to sleep in a mcdonalds if there were 
reasonable alternatives this problem would disappear 
an estimated 30000 to 45000 people stay in abandoned buildings 
or public places nightly in new york not counting the ones sleeping 
in shelters hayes said an october survey by the transit authority 
found 1404 homeless living in new york subways 
nationwide no accurate census exists but an estimated 3 million 
people are without homes according to the national coalition for 
the homeless based in washington dc it agrees that restaurants 
make lousy sleeping quarters 
these places are not designed to function as housing said 
maria foscarinis spokeswoman for the coalition 
but there is no place else to go

irelands potato farmers who have a most 
colorful past now are fighting for a future harried by falling 
demand and rising imports the spud raisers are modernizing in order 
to compete 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it was a dismal day wet and cold and 
gray the things most hateful about december a few potatoes were 
rotting and their smell was vile but john sheridan didnt seem to 
mind 
tramping across a muckfilled yard in his rubber boots the 
42yearold potato farmer showed a visitor around with typical irish 
generosity of time and spirit 
highlights of the tour of j and c sheridan ltd one of irelands 
biggest potato farms included a new bagging machine and storehouses 
full of those humblest of tubers whose irregular shapes and skins 
of homespun brown inspire instant affection 
we are putting our potatoes in much more attractive 
packaging said sheridan who is spending about 630000 irish 
pounds nearly 1 million to modernize the farm the emphasis all 
the time every single day is better quality i am ensuring that my 
market will be there 
welcome to the brave new world of the irish potato industry 
launching the praties of legend into the 21st century 
irelands potato farmers who have a most colorful past are 
fighting for a future dimmed by imports and a drop in demand 
in the 19th century potatoes were the staple food of ireland and 
blight caused a cruel famine lately the irish have strayed to such 
exotic foods as pasta and farmers are trying to woo them back by 
among other things developing betterlooking potatoes 
what is a goodlooking potato 
whats a goodlooking man responded kevin burke general 
manager of irish potato marketing ltd in dublin about 30 miles 
southeast of wilkinstown very subjective he concluded 
the ideal spud is said to be large wellrounded and shalloweyed 
presentation matters too farmers are packaging their products 
better offering consumers cleaner potatoes in smaller quantities 
and more uniform sizes 
they are investing in better machinery and storage facilities 
breeding higheryield varieties that are more resistant to disease 
and will deliver larger crops per acre they now export to counter 
imports from other common market countries and support development 
of a potato processing industry 
experts say the effort is paying off 
gerry doherty of the governments department of agriculture and 
food said a long decline in output is stabilizing the total was 
400000 tons last year and is expected to be about 370000 for 1988 
he said 
imports are expected to be 30000 tons this year and exports 
13400 a ton of potatoes brings about 90 pounds 140 
id say were more competitive doherty said 
potatoes have been grown in ireland for more than 350 years and 
are woven into its culture and history they have inspired poems and 
songs they conjure many images warm as irish stew or wrenching as 
famine and emigration 
so great has been its influence that the potato and the 
irishman are often considered as somewhat synonymous potato 
expert edward mcgivern wrote 
spaniards brought potatoes to europe from peru in the 16th 
century english explorer sir walter raleigh usually gets the credit 
for introducing them to the emerald isle 
ireland was the first european country to grow potatoes on a 
large scale by the early 1840s they were the main food for 
onethird of its 8 million people 
planting reached a peak of 25 million acres in 1845 but blight 
destroyed the crop and caused the great famine of 18451849 a 
catastrophe that killed an estimated 1 million people and caused 
another million to leave 
emigration continues and the birth rate is declining so 
irelands population now is but 34 million and potato acreage is a 
mere 75000 commercial growers once tens of thousands number only 
6000 
burke the dublin potato dealer said irelands entry into the 
european economic community in 1973 has created competition and a 
lot of people were not ready to cope 
people are now eating things which are considered alien to the 
irish character such as pasta and rice he said 
use of potatoes for industrial alcohol and animal feed has 
declined with more women working and incomes growing fewer 
potatoes are peeled and cooked at home 
per capita consumption fell to 244 pounds in 1984 from 260 pounds 
in 1980 but still is nearly double that of the united states 
sheridan surveyed the farm where he first planted 12 acres of 
potatoes in 1967 and today grows 250 acres of kerrs pink the irish 
favorite 
we are managing to meeting the challenge he said we 
believe well be in business another 20 years

on his suddenly shortened visit soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev achieved every outoftowners dream of making 
it big in the big apple he saw his name in lights on broadway 
as his 45car motorcade moved through times square at the height 
of rush hour one of those huge news headline display signs flashed 
welcome gorbachev 
the chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet got the 
friendly message 
at the corner of 5lst and broadway the tanklike zil limousine 
came to a halt a smiling gorbachev stepped out and began pressing 
the flesh as the crowd chanted gorby gorby 
his startled security detail led by bomb squad vans and a legion 
of motorcycles executed an illegal uturn that further confounded 
crosstown traffic already immobilized by gorbylock 
here are other scenes from a reporters notebook on the brief 
visit of the statesmantourist from moscow 
something like 180000 commuters heeded mayor ed kochs warning 
against coming to town during gorbachevs visit the number of 
vehicles entering manhattan by bridge and tunnel dropped 20 percent 
bringing about a new christmas miracle on 34th street in the 
vicinity of macys department store where a police inspector 
observed that traffic was no more chaotic than normal the 
motorcades l6minute dash from the united nations to south ferry 
was the envy of new york taxi drivers and should qualify as a modern 
record in daylight hours new yorks traffic commissars were 
serious they even posted parking meters with signs in russian 
dont even think of parking 
when the curtains were drawn the squat highly polished 
somewhat antiquated soviet black limousines flown in with gorbachev 
looked as if they had strayed off course from a mafia funeral along 
mulberry street cabbies however had high praise for the russians 
behind the wheel being wheel man in a motorcade is real 
tsuriss said taxi driver moishe abramson of bay ridge brooklyn 
using the yiddish word for tension and trouble gorbys visit 
buried the old joke we had around the un about a russian motorcade 
being a 10car pileup with flags 
on the tonight show johnny carson had a topical gag about 
gorbachevs promised halfmillion cut in soviet troop strength 
soon the russians will be down to just one obsolete tank driven 
by mike dukakis 
coast guard capt michael garwin estimated he had made 6400 
crossings on the fiveminute governors island ferry run before 
being grabbed by news anchors tom brokaw and peter jennings for 
primetime interviews and with gorbachev aboard this was the first 
time police frog men in their wet suits had inspected the hull of 
the ferry t samuel coursen minutes before lines were cast off 
two transit authority cops amused the crowd outside the new 
york stock exchange by harmonizing on shultz and shevardnadze 
to the tune of some enchanted evening while waiting for the 
motorcade to roll by the cathedral of capitalism 
raisa gorbachev the styleconscious soviet first lady who 
calls designer givenchy by his first name of hubert helped bury the 
cartoon caricature of frumpy soviet women in galoshes and babushkas 
in a visit to estee lauders fifth avenue beauty salon she was 
sprayed with a fragrance called white linen by the cosmetic 
queen herself who plans to open a branch soon on moscows gorky 
street raisa also made a brief stop outside bloomigdales the 
upscale market version of moscows gum department store but didnt 
have time to flash her american express card 
according to rumors spread by refuseniks she never leaves her 
dacha without it 
some christmas shoppers like faye bernardi of ozone park ny 
thought they detected the look of longing in her eyes that we 
women get when afflicted with that shopuntilyou drop syndrome 
or maybe it was the look a muscovite gets when peering into the 
windows of a beryozka shop where luxury goods can be bought only 
with foreign currency 
nearly 60 students protesting on behalf of soviet jews were 
arrested on the final night of gorbachevs visit but the number of 
demonstrators fell far below what police had anticipated among a 
variety of ethnic and political dissenters was a small group of 
animals lovers fuming against raisas broadtail persian taupe 
topcoat and russian lynx fur hat with signs proclaiming minx 
stinx 
the visit of course was a media carnival one of the more 
ingenious sideshows featured a canadian actor a gorbachev 
lookalike who conned super capitalist donald trump into a hoax 
interview after the real soviet leader had turned down an invitation 
to visit his 19 million apartment in trump tower 
a yogurt emporium in the alley behind the stock exchange 
dressed up its luncheon menu with a message in the cyrillic 
alphabet translated it read have a nice glasnost 
with mikhail gorbachev ronald reagan and george bush gazing 
meaningfully at the statue of liberty from liberty point governors 
island had its most memorable historical happening since wouter van

mikhail gorbachevs peacemaking new york visit 
and the opening of a glitzy soviet trade show underscored the 
importance the kremlin leader attaches to developing business and 
commercial ties in the west 
but perhaps unknown to many westerners the communist superpower 
has long been dabbling in overseas ventures that range from currency 
speculation in london to fish canning in north america 
while gorbachev may reduce the soviet military as he pledged in 
a speech at the united nations experts on the soviet bloc said they 
believe his broader reforms likely will make the soviets much more 
aggressive in foreign investing exporting and competing for 
customers in an increasingly global economy 
theyre beginning to talk about more direct investment abroad 
focused on firms that might help them market their own products 
said edward hewitt a soviet economics expert at the brookings 
institution a washington research organization i wouldnt be at 
all surprised if they come in and buy out some small european or 
us firms in the next few years 
the soviets have not acquired any significant western companies 
yet but the number of foreign firms owned wholly or partly by the 
soviets has risen sharply from about a dozen in the early 1960s to 
more than 120 now said carl mcmillan a soviet expert at carleton 
university in ottawa 
mcmillan who has compiled a list of soviet blocowned companies 
in the west for the past 10 years said many of these ventures 
reflect a growing sophistication about investing abroad 
there are different ways in which they do it he said they 
have assets portfolios and direct investments theyre in a wide 
range of business areas banks insurance engineering shipping and 
commercial companies 
the soviet investment presence abroad remains minuscule by 
western standards however considering that just one us or 
japanese conglomerate might have 120 foreign subsidiaries still 
the soviets appear to be catching on 
as they participate in the world economy theyve found this is 
the way everybody else plays the game mcmillan said 
in scandinavia for example the soviets have established a chain 
of governmentowned service stations to sell one of their biggest 
exports petroleum 
on this side of the world the soviets have stakes in two north 
american fishing and fishprocessing concerns cansov marine 
products ltd in nova scotia and marine resources co international 
in seattle 
as one of the largest producers of agricultural machinery and 
equipment the soviets have long been in the business of selling 
tractors in 1972 they formed belarus equipment of canada ltd a 
torontobased marketer of soviet farm vehicles a us branch was 
formed five years later with offices in new york and milwaukee 
i would say this sort of trend will continue and under 
gorbachev it will be more dynamic said mcmillan i dont think 
the russians are coming thing really fits theyve been around for 
awhile 
the soviets also are veteran participants in the worlds 
speculative foreignexchange markets trading largely through two 
governmentowned banks moscow norodny in london and the eurobank in 
paris each is believed to have about 5 billion in assets 
because the ruble is not a convertible currency the soviets must 
use western money in order to pay for goods imported from 
noncommunist trading parters as with other currency speculators 
the soviets like to move their holdings into the currency that is 
worth the most at any given time 
they are said to favor the swiss franc although they also have 
deposits and trading accounts denominated in dollars british 
pounds west german marks and japanese yen 
they used to be into wild speculation but theyre more careful 
now said jan vanous a soviet expert at planecon a 
washingtonbased consulting and information concern that studies the 
centrally planned economies of the soviet bloc 
a few years ago for example soviet traders attempted to push 
down the value of the swiss franc by dumping 50 million worth of 
francs in 20 separate orders throughout europe assuming dealers 
would not be able to communicate fast enough about who was selling 
the soviets were wrong losing money and respect 
it really caused a lot of bad blood vanous said you do 
this to someone in the foreignexchange market and the next time 
they deal with you theyre extra careful 
some traders have privately accused the soviets of eavesdropping 
on international telephone lines for advance word on central bank 
coordination and intervention which often moves a currency sharply 
the moscow norodny bank for example is believed to have once 
made huge profits on marks it bought just before the mark soared in 
value after the west german bundesbank made a surprise policy shift 
that change resulted from a telephone conversation hours earlier 
between aides from the bundesbank and the federal reserve in 
washington and according to one widely circulated story the soviets 
learned about it through a wiretap 
on the other hand the soviets can show remarkable naivete about 
economic trends that hurt their currency holdings they were active 
buyers of dollars just before the currency tumbled because of a 
coordination agreement by the leading western democracies and the 
collapse of oil prices a few years ago 
generally they are savvy in the short run but they dont do 
too well in the long run said vanous they are miserable in 
making forecasts they dont have the trained people the 
information and keep making judgments based on their own behavior

business weeks former broadcast editor seymour 
g rudy ruderman has pleaded guilty to mail fraud in an insider 
trading scheme admitting he illegally used advance material from 
the magazine to buy and sell securities 
ruderman admitted on thursday making 15000 between january 1986 
and last july in securities trades using notyetpublished 
information from upcoming issues of the nations biggest business 
weekly 
the 62yearold editor waived indictment and pleaded guilty to 
two counts of mail fraud before us district judge robert ward who 
released him on 100000 bond 
ward scheduled sentencing for march 8 1989 ruderman faces a 
maximum penalty of five years in prison and 250000 in fines on 
each count 
ruderman who had broadcast market and business news for business 
week since 1981 was fired aug 12 for failing to disclose all his 
stock trades and the full extent of his holdings in violation of 
the magazines ethics code 
the first criminal charges were filed in the widening scandal 
last august william dillon a stock broker who had been fired by 
merrill lynch amp co for suspcious trades was charged with mail 
fraud 
seven employees of business weeks printer also lost their jobs 
a result of an inhouse investigation that allegedly found workers 
sold advance copies of business week two brokers at two other 
investment firms also were fired 
ruderman did not report write or edit stories for business week 
but he broadcast a business news report several times a day from the 
magazines office in midtown manhattan to radio stations in new 
york boston philadelphia and fort wayne ind 
according to the charges ruderman used information obtained 
largely from business weeks marketsensitive inside wall street 
column to buy and sell securities on 50 occasions 
a security that received a favorable mention in that column 
generally increased in price in the period immediately following 
public dissemination of business week court papers said 
in entering his plea ruderman said he probably lost more money 
than he made in his securities trading 
according to the charges ruderman regularly received a page 
proof of the inside wall street column on thursdays hours 
before its official release to the public to make sure companies 
mentioned in the column were not referred to in radio broadcasts 
ruderman also was free to use the information in his weekend 
reports which were taped on fridays 
instead ruderman bought shares or options to buy shares and 
caused unidentified other persons to purchase securities in 
companies receiving favorable mention in the upcoming column 
us attorney rudolph giuliani refused to characterize who the 
other persons were but said the investigation was continuing 
he also commended business week and its publisher mcgrawhill 
inc for their cooperation 
ruderman conducted transactions in the securities of such 
companies as champion spark plug chrysler corp mca inc getty 
petroleum and jefferies group inc 
giuliani noted that ruderman was charged with mail fraud for 
victimizing the magazine which is delivered by mail 
ruderman was not charged with securities fraud for insider 
trading the prosecutor said because the us supreme court split 
44 on that issue last year in the case of former wall street 
journal reporter r foster winans 
the supreme court unanimously upheld the mail and wire fraud 
convictions of winans for using advance knowledge of upcoming 
journal columns to make illegal trading profits but the court split 
over a broad interpretation of misappropriation of confidential 
information that would have included revealing yettobe published 
newspaper and magazine stories 
noting that the penalty for mail fraud and securities fraud were 
the same giuliani said from a criminal law point of view this 
is a safer way to achieve the same results

a former president of the new jersey bankers 
association has been accused of leaking highly secret federal 
reserve board interest rate figures to a nowbankrupt brokerage firm 
seeking a jump on the securities market 
an indictment returned here thursday charged robert a rough with 
insider trading while a member of the new york federal reserve bank 
part of the feds regional network from 1982 to 1984 
rough 49 of layton nj received 47000 in interestdeferred 
loans from the nowdefunct bevill bresler amp schulman investment 
firm in exchange for the information the indictment charged 
rough is accused of relaying the data by telephone from his 
executive suite at the national bank of sussex county and once from 
the new york feds boardroom just after a meeting prosecutors told 
a news conference 
bevill bresler made millions of dollars in government securities 
trades based on roughs advance word about decisions made by the 
national federal reserve board on the discount rate and on 
recommendations made by the new york fed about the discount rate 
the indictment said 
changes in the discount rate the interest charged by the fed on 
loans to banks can have a strong impact on financial markets 
roughs attorney michael himmel would not comment in detail but 
said mr rough is going to enter a plea of not guilty and 
vigorously contest the charges 
roughs home telephone number is unlisted and he could not be 
reached for comment he resigned earlier this year as president of 
the national bank of sussex in branchville nj 
the new york fed is one of 12 regional banks in the federal 
reserve system all of which make recommendations every two weeks on 
whether the discount rate should be changed the national federal 
reserve board has the final say in setting the rate 
word that discount rate information was leaked surfaced in april 
1987 during a trial stemming from the collapse of bevill bresler 
prompting the fed to tighten its rules on disclosing the discount 
rate 
the allegations came to light during the trial of gilbert c 
schulman bevill breslers president on charges stemming from the 
144 million collapse of the livingston njbased firm in april 
1985 three other principals who pleaded guilty in the firms 
collapse in exchange for their cooperation testified about roughs 
allegedly passing on the information 
schulman a longtime friend of roughs is serving an 8year 
sentence for securities violations 
schulman testified that rough approached him for the 47000 in 
loans to buy a chunk of stock in the national bank of sussex 
rough faces 29 years in prison if convicted on all counts said 
us attorney samuel a alito jr rough was charged with conspiracy 
to commit wire and securities fraud two counts of bank fraud one 
count each of wire fraud and securities fraud and two counts of 
making false statements to banks 
no arraignment date has been set 
alito said rough violated a position of great power trust and 
responsibility and hoped the case would serve as a warning to 
other wouldbe insidertraders of interest rate data 
he abused that office in a very shocking and outrageous 
manner he said 
fed officials have called the discount rate one of their most 
closely guarded secrets the rate is widely regarded as an indicator 
of the direction in which the fed is seeking to push interest rates 
which affect the prices of bonds 
federal authorities were told by bevill bresler principals of 
the allegations against rough during interviews shortly after the 
firms collapse 
after the fed learned of them it stopped telling regional 
federal reserves of its decision on the discount rate earlier in the 
day than when it was announced publicly said new york fed spokesman 
peter bakstansky 
the indictment took so long because of the complex process of 
examining bevill breslers brokerage operations alito said 
he said the case was the first insidertrading scheme involving 
the discount rate and the first against a sitting member of a 
federal reserve bank 
rough sat on the board as a representative of small banks in the 
regional feds district

the prime time is at hand for a special brand of 
holiday shopping that has become a tradition of sorts on wall street 
stock analysts and traders are busily combing the markets for 
issues trading at or near their lowest levels of the year 
the idea is to buy these stocks while they are artificially 
depressed by yearend sell orders from individual investors looking 
for tax writeoffs and from institutions clearing the losers out of 
their portfolios before they make yearend reports to clients 
once the pressure of this selling is removed with the arrival of 
the new year the reasoning goes these stocks stand a good chance 
of rebounding even if the financial affairs of the companies 
involved dont change much 
in his annual stock traders almanac investment adviser yale 
hirsch describes the list of stocks trading at new 52week lows 
around dec 15 as a menu for the only free lunch on wall street 
for most of the time in the past 15 years according to hirschs 
research the new york stock exchange issues at new lows on dec 15 
outperformed the nyse composite index through the following feb 15 
last winter for example the 23 new lows posted an aggregate 
gain of 132 percent over the twomonth period compared to a 68 
percent rise for the nyse index 
occasionally however the free lunch is more famine than 
feast the four new lows at middecember 1985 which included three 
energyrelated issues suffered an overall loss of 225 percent by 
the next feb 15 as oil prices nosedived 
in addition small investors armed with limited capital face 
problems turning this historical trend into a workable trading 
strategy 
brokerage commissions take their considerable toll and if a 
trader doesnt have enough money to buy a diversified package of the 
stocks at new lows which ones to pick 
the december bargain hunt does dovetail nicely with a phenomenon 
known as the january effect that has been widely analyzed in 
academic studies and at least one book 
this research has documented a tendency for stocks especially 
those of smaller companies to show unusual strength in the first 
few weeks of the year 
the only trouble with the january effect analysts say is the 
very recognition it has received once market patterns become well 
known they often quickly change as traders try to capitalize on 
them 
thus the suspicion among a good many wall streeters that the 
january effect will soon be negated or at least moved into december 
whether or not they prove to be bargains many of the lists 
of depressed stocks being published these days contain a surprising 
number of big names 
for example at oppenheimer amp co analysts norman weinger and 
michael metz ran a computer screen of stocks with market values of 
at least 50 million priced at no more than 10 percent above their 
52week lows and carrying priceearnings multiples of no more than 
10 
the names that turned up included digital equipment xerox texas 
instruments ncr and several technology issues that once ranked as 
leading glamour stocks 
bluechip industrial companies how about dupont goodyear and 
weyerhaueser for starters 
no investment decision is warranted on the basis of these 
figures alone weinger and metz cautioned for a further 
observation they added it is interesting to note how many stocks 
are still down sharply in the aftermath of the october 1987 crash

a drexel burnham lambert inc bond trader has 
agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors probing the wall street 
firm for possible securities fraud the second employee to turn 
states evidence this week 
sources familiar with the drexel case who spoke on condition 
they not be identified confirmed a report friday that terren pizer 
who worked on the bond trading desk at the firms beverly hills 
office agreed late wednesday to provide evidence in exchange for 
immunity from prosecution 
pizer sat near michael milken drexels highyield bond financier 
and a key target of the federal investigation that has lasted more 
than two years an outgrowth of the ivan boesky insider trading 
scandal 
drexel milken and two other employees have been accused by the 
securities and exchange commission of conspiring with boesky to 
commit frauds that range from trading on inside information to stock 
manipulation now imprisoned boesky has been the governments key 
source of evidence in the case 
a manhattan federal grand jury has been investigating the firm on 
similar grounds and has been expected to indict drexel milken and 
the others for months the defendants have maintained their 
innocence although drexel has been negotiating with prosecutors 
about a possible settlement 
the wall street journal reported friday that pizers cooperation 
reflected a tougher negotiating stance by the government and 
intensified pressure on drexel to capitulate in order to avoid a 
possibly devastating indictment that would include charges of 
racketeering which carry enormous fines 
but it was unclear what if any incriminating material pizer 
could provide 
spokesmen for drexel and milken declined to comment on the 
development aides to manhattan us attorney rudolph w giuliani 
also declined to comment in accordance with their policy of silence 
on pending investigations 
pizers agreement came one day after another key figure in the 
investigation milken aide cary maultasch struck a plea bargain 
with prosecutors but the effect of maultaschs cooperation also 
remains unclear

salomon inc said it plans to shift 11 billion 
from a swiss subsidiary to its us operations and take a 150 
million tax charge against fourthquarter earnings 
the announcement thursday marks a major restructuting of 
salomons 36 billion capital and triggered some speculation that 
the investment banking firm may be preparing a stock buyback or 
major acquisition 
robert salomon a managing director said the move would reduce 
the capital of the swiss unit to 600 million from 17 billion he 
said 750 million would be repatriated immediately and 350 million 
at a later date 
the company said it is taking the charge against earnings because 
it had not set aside money to pay taxes on the additional income 
salomon said returning the foreign earnings to the united states 
would give the company greater flexibility 
he said the move also would allow salomon to use certain foreign 
tax credits that expire at years end foreign tax credits typically 
allow firms to repatriate foreign earnings at a lower us tax rate 
salomons zug switzerland unit the commercial financial 
division was established six years ago for tax purposes by philipp 
brothers a commodities firm that merged with salomon

a state appeals court has upheld a lower court 
ruling that blocked warner communications incs proposed 12 
billion acquisition of lorimar telepictures inc 
however warner said it expected to complete the deal next month 
the appellate division of state supreme court on thursday 
affirmed a decision that the merger violated a 1984 agreement 
between warner and its largest stockholder christcraft industries 
inc a broadcasting and manufacturing company 
at issue in the case are lorimars televison stations 
chriscraft claimed in a suit filed in july that because lorimar 
owned six stations the merger violated a 4yearold pact 
prohibiting warner from owning any tv station so long as it owned 25 
percent or more of chriscrafts bhc inc broadcasting subsidiary 
warner acquired a 425 percent stake in bhc in 1984 in exchange 
for chris craft getting 23 percent of warners voting stock 
the appeals court upheld a a ruling that said warner could not 
acquire any lorimar stock until the tv stations were sold or it 
reduced its stake in bhc 
but warner said it was moving ahead despite the setback we 
have been working on alternatives and it is our intent to consummate 
the transaction in january the company said in a statement 
since the chriscraft suit was filed lorimar completed the sale 
of television stations in odessa texas springfield mo and

the eec commission predicted friday that 
crude steel production in the 12nation trade bloc would hold steady 
at about 34 million metric tons in the first quarter of 1989 
the prediction matched production estimates for this years 
fourth quarter and first quarter 
the commission also said total production for 1988 should amount 
to 135 million tons up 8 percent from 1987 
it said demand should remain firm at least through the first 
quarter of 1989 and possibly through the first half despite concern 
over a buildup of stocks in some sectors and diminishing demand 
from french and west german automobile industries 
export and import prices were rising while export demand 
remained high the commission said 
consumption in the european economic community was expected to 
remain roughly steady at 296 million tons in the first quarter of 
1989 that compares with an estimated 298 million tons in the 
fourth quarter of 1988 and 2824 million tons in the first quarter 
of 1988

the european economic community said friday that 
a ban on the imports of hormonetreated meat from the united states 
will go into effect next month 
the ban implementation of which was postponed for one year at 
the request of the united states could provoke a trade war with 
washington 
eec spokesman nicolas wegter also said the 12nation eec only 
would agree to international arbitration of the dispute with the 
united states if consumerrelated arguments as well as scientific 
ones are taken into account 
the ban legislated by the eec which goes into effect jan 1 
would affect 170 million of us meat exports this does not 
include about 72 million of horsemeat which is not treated with 
hormones 
eec and us negotiators were expected to have an opportunity to 
discuss possible solutions to the dispute when they met here this 
week for a ministerial conference of the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade 
but a useec clash over support for farmers prevented the 
discussion from taking place the matter will also not be taken up 
at a bilateral meeting of ministers taking place in brussels friday 
because the us and eec agriculture negotiators had to stay in 
montreal longer than expected and did not get to belgium in time 
we dont care what the americans want for their consumers 
said wegter our legislation goes into effect and we will apply 
it 
a european parliament investigation of reports that european 
farmers violate the legislation and treat their animals with 
hormones will not affect implementation of the ban he said 
the council of the gatt which oversees implementation of the 
1947 treaty regulating world trade is scheduled to meet dec 20 to 
consider a us request for establishing an arbitration pnel 
wegter said the eec would only accept the arbitration panel if it 
doesnt rely just on scientific arguments but also on 
consumerrelated and other arguments he said most eec members 
already had legislated bans on hormonetreated meat and they 
think its good for their consumers 
the united states insists that hormones used on animals do not 
leave residues that are harmful to humans some european scientists 
have concurred while others have argued that the hormones can cause 
cancer 
the united states could retaliate against the meat ban with one 
of its own against european meat exports which consist mostly of 
high quality items like danish ham

us trade representative clayton yeutter 
declared himself satisfied with japans role in internatonal trade 
talks here and said he would reject a petition by american farmers 
to demand access to the japanese rice market 
but a spokesman for the 12nation european economic community 
nicolas wegter said friday that the japanese didnt say one word 
the entire week about agriculture 
yeutter had told reporters that the japanese delegation to the 
ministeral meeting of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
performed superbly they handled themselves skillfully he 
added it was a first class performance 
japan the worlds largest net importer of agricultural products 
sat in on six days of talks between the eec the united states and 
the worlds leading farm exporters 
i didnt hear the translators translate one word from japanese 
into agriculture wegter told reporters 
the divergence of views reflected attempts by the eec and the 
united states to curry japans favor in their battle over 
agricultural subsidies 
yeutter asked whether he would accept a petition by the us 
rice millers association responded i will not 
several weeks ago yeutter rejected a petition by the american 
rice producers group which called on the us government to 
investigate whether japan is employing unfair trade practices in 
refusing to open its rice market to imports 
in turning down the petition yeutter said he hoped the rice 
question would be resolved in montreal and if not the farmers could 
resubmit their appeal 
japans ruling liberal democratic party concerned with the 
veiled threat of us pressure sent a delegation to montreal to 
make sure the foreign ministry negotiators did not cave in to 
demands on the rice issue 
but much to japans relief the subject was virtually not 
mentioned during the six days of talks which were dominated by the 
useec clash on farm supports 
the united states is seeking farm subsidy elimination while the 
eec is only willing to cut down the supports the talks ended in 
stalemate 
japan said it did not take sides in the clash 
our position is that there is no point in making decisions 
until they settle said mutsuyoshi nishimura japans director of 
foreign press relations 
nishimura said that whatever the outcome japans prime concern 
is the protection of its rice market against foreign imports 
the administration appears content to allow the rice issue to 
rest as long as japan leaves it on the table for future negotiations 
japanese rice is about four times more expensive than us rice 
but japan is insistent on complete selfreliance in production of 
the staple crop 
the rice millers were demanding a quota of up to 25 percent of 
the japanese market the first year which would rise to 10 percent 
in the fourth year

two men have been charged with attempted 
extortion in a series of death threat letters sent to prominent 
antelope valley citizens 
although the two unemployed aerospace workers are suspected of 
sending 265 computerprinted threats they were charged with only 10 
specific acts to simplify the case deputy district attorney steve 
cooley said thursday 
many of the letters were identical said cooley but he noted 
that the text of each letter was customized to include personal 
information about the intended victims 
roman stephan makuch 27 and richard mathew faroni 26 were 
arrested in las vegas on thanksgiving day and waived extradition 
letters attached to the complaint began with an obscenity and a 
death threat the writers then demanded specific amounts of cash as 
high as 600000 with instructions for its delivery they also gave 
gruesome details of how victims would be killed and threatened harm 
to children spouses and relatives of the letter recipients cooley 
said 
those targeted by the letter writers he said were all 
substantial people including a former city manager of lancaster 
lawyers bank vice presidents doctors dentists accountants and 
real estate agents 
none of them paid any money he said 
the letters received nov 23 told some recipients to take a 
citizens band radio to las vegas and tune in a specific channel for 
instructions on where to deliver money 
cooley said a search of a las vegas apartment occupied by makuch 
and faroni and a nearby storage facility turned up computer 
printers and computer discs a handgun and several cb radios 
he said acquaintances said about the pair they could be 
characterized as being a couple of oddballs misfits 
cooley added there is some indication there may be other 
people involved 
makuch and faroni were unemployed but had worked previously on 
the assembly line at rockwell internationals palmdale plant on the 
b1b bomber project cooley said 
both were charged with conspiracy to commit extortion attempted 
extortion and sending threatening letters for extortion purposes if 
convicted cooley said they could draw maximum sentences of six 
years in prison

in the next few weeks the media will attempt to 
wrap up the economic year and one of their themes is likely to be 
that 1988 was the year when it didnt happen 
so much didnt happen that was expected to happen a secondary 
shock wave in the stock market and a recession for instance that 
it carries a message for 1989 
that message dont place too much faith in the seers because 
they really dont put all that faith in themselves many of the 
stock market doomsayers for example reversed themselves last 
summer and put their bets on stocks 
another school of economic sages based their forecast of 
recession on the assumption that an expansion that had already gone 
on for five years would have to stop for breath instead the 
expansion merely slowed and inhaled 
now one year later these seers are expressing the identical 
doubts they had in 1987 and for the very same reasons it is a 
nolose situation because a recession that doesnt come can be 
explained away as unexpectedly good news and eventually if not 
now they will be right theyll let you know about it 
interest rates rose but they didnt go through the roof prices 
didnt run away housing didnt collapse cars had a good year the 
jobless rate continued to fall contrary to many forecasts the 
trade and budget deficits narrowed too 
the fact that these dire forecasts didnt materialize doesnt 
mean it was a dull year it wasnt a dull year but the things that 
made it exciting and unusual had very little to do with the 
foresight of the seers 
do you recall any of them telling you that corporate takeovers 
would reach such a frantic pace did anyone even conceive of a 
company the size of rjr nabisco being auctioned off 
it is therefore wise in reviewing the forecasts to remember that 
much of it is a game when you win you get up on the roof and shout 
and demonstrate and when youre wrong you remain in your study and 
guard your quiet dignity 
nothing can stop the forecasts theyll be made if only for 
publicity purposes the future oddly is an attractive place 
largely because it is the great unknown 
though it is a dark mystery the future is where much of the 
investment community seeks to reside you make money by 
anticipating by getting in on things early by beating others by 
buying before the news gets around 
and so there will be forecasts stock market seers make them to 
impress customers scholars sometimes make them because of 
conviction or probably to sell books market letter writers make 
them because forecasts excite interest 
but evidence that very few people really can foresee the future 
at least with any tiny degree of consistency lies in the consensus 
forecast about which you will be reading plenty 
the consensus forecast is the median forecast it is the middle 
range between extremes the consensus is often right on the mark 
correctly estimating such items as inflation interest rates and 
gross national product 
and when the consensus is on the mark it means by definition 
that most of the forecasts it is made of are not on the mark

spain on friday adopted europes standard 
width for railroad tracks a step that will allow trains to roll 
directly into western europe for the first time since track was laid 
133 years ago 
the move clears the way for completion of highspeed train links 
with europe by 1992 when spain hosts the summer olympics and 
celebrates the 500th anniversary of christopher columbus discovery 
of the new world 
the government next week is expected to award a major contract to 
build spains first highspeed train system french west german and 
japanese firms are bidding for the deal 
the first phase of the changeover to the narrower european tracks 
would permit construction of a highspeed line from port bou on 
spains northern border with france to barcelona madrid and seville 
by the turn of the century the 55footwide spanish and 
portuguese tracks would be replaced with 47footwide track used in 
10 other european economic community nations 
transport minister jose barrionuevo said the francetoseville 
line should be ready by the opening of sevilles world expo in 
spring 1992 to commemorate the columbus anniversary and the 1992 
barcelona summer olympics 
the government also ordered the state rail company renfe to 
study replacing the rest of the countrys 7887 miles of rail track 
by 2001 
it is widely believed that spanish railways were given a narrower 
gauge than the rest of europe when first built in 1855 to make a 
military invasion of the iberian peninsula more difficult 
engineers maintained that a wider gauge was necessary to 
accommodate locomotives that carried trains across spains 
mountainous terrain 
now wheels on railway cars from spain and portugal must be 
changed or modified at the spanishfrench border

us secretary of state george p shultz 
said friday that were right in opposing the european economic 
communitys planned ban on hormonetreated meat from the united 
states 
shultz told reporters the meat the united states wants to send to 
european buyers is very acceptable 
there is no health problem involved as we see it he said 
after meeting with officials of the 12nation common market trade 
bloc 
in montreal a spokesman for the european community nico wegter 
said the ban would take effect jan 1 as scheduled 
we dont care what the americans want for their consumers 
wegter said our legislation goes into effect and we will apply 
it 
the eec wants to ban for health reasons all meat from animals 
treated with growth hormones late last year it agreed to delay 
implementation of the prohibition until 1989 
the united states had threatened to take retaliatory action 
against the ban it maintains that the use of hormones to fatten 
animals a common practice among american farmers is not a health 
risk 
an estimated 170 million in us meat exports would be affected 
by the ban 
shultz said the value of meat exports to the eec is small 
compared to this years estimated 166 billion twoway trade between 
the united states and the trading bloc but he said its large 
to the people involved 
he acknowledged a difference of opinion with the community but 
said we think were right 
shultz met with european community president jacques delors and 
other top trade officials 
the talks were held as international trade negotiations in 
montreal were postponed for four months over a stalemate between the 
united states and the common market over phasing out agricultural 
subsidies 
the united states is pressing europe to agree to eliminate 
subsidies it claims distort international trade by supporting 
cutrate exports and restricting imports 
the europeans argue they have taken steps to control farm 
spending and could only agree to reduce the subsidies not scrap 
them altogether 
there is a general recognition that the system of subsidies to 
agriculture has got itself structured wrong and is altogether too 
costly shultz said 
he said the subsidies cost the united states japan and the 
common market an estimated 200 billion a year 
there are big stakes involved economic stakes and political 
stakes and thats the reason why people are so intense about it 
he said 
shultzs discussions concluded a twoday trip to brussels 
primarily for a meeting with other foreign ministers of the 
16nation north atlantic treaty organization

monson trucking a highly profitable family 
business that prides itself on a glistening fleet of modern rigs 
has been crippled by the first drivers strike in its 73year 
history 
the walkout will enter its second week sunday keeping 125 
teamsters in the midwest jobless and neutralizing monsons 24state 
distribution network which revolves around the shipment of 
newsprint from ontario 
both sides say the dispute is fueled by years of bad blood 
between monson and the international brotherhood of teamsters 
they are considered to be one of the most corrupt organizations 
in the united states company president robert monson said of the 
international union why should you want to deal with them 
the teamsters never have been and never will be welcomed 
here he added 
sherman liimatainen secretarytreasurer of teamsters union local 
346 said monson is the most antiunion employer of the 330 
companies he has had to deal with as an officer of local 346 
for a company that displays a whitehorse image out there its 
fair to say that horse has spots on it liimatainen said his 
monsons total approach is you guys are people im going to 
dictate to 
any time anyone asserted their rights in this union they the 
company had a way of intimidating them he said 
despite a threat that they would be permanently replaced if they 
struck by midweek only a handful of drivers had crossed the picket 
line in front of company headquarters along windswept highway 61 on 
lake superiors north shore union officials said 
the company ordered them to return to work last monday 
monson said wednesday the company intends to hire permanent 
replacements until it is back to full strength 
striking driver bill miller a union steward said he knew of 
only four replacement hirings 
monson said monday he was considering options which included 
renewing contract talks with local 346 of duluth and local 160 
which covers employees at monsons red wing terminal on wednesday 
however he said he didnt see any reason to return to the 
bargaining table 
liimatainen said wednesday no new talks were set he said three 
mediated negotiating sessions were held before the companys 
threeyear contract proposal was rejected by 99 percent of voting 
union members the previous twoyear contract expired nov 26 
miller and fellow union steward john deterling said the two sides 
are not far apart on benefits and could possibly work out a deal on 
the chief wage issue mileage pay 
under the expired contract monson truckers were paid 235 cents 
a mile at the average rate of 2500 miles a week drivers made 
about 30500 a year under the old contract with monson paying for 
fuel and maintenance on the trucks 
according to the companys latest offer the mileage rate would 
increase to 25 cents a mile over three years 
miller and deterling said truckers want wages of 26 cents a mile 
the amount they were paid before the industry was deregulated 
monson said he stopped trying to negotiate when he was told there 
would be no contract unless the mileage rate was increased by 3 
cents 
theyre already above industry standards he said of the 
wages 
miller and deterling said their top priority in negotiating a new 
contract is job security not wages 
work rules under the old contract made it too easy for the 
company to discriminate against active union members they said 
they want to alter the companys disciplinary point system under 
which drivers accumulate points for accidents speeding and other 
traffic violations a total of 35 points in a year could lead to a 
drivers dismissal under the expired contract 
deterling 55 said he was fired in 1984 when he was assessed 35 
points for an accident he said the company offered to rehire him 
with no seniority and less vacation pay but he declined with the 
unions help he recovered his job and seniority level 
several employees who were not as active in the union agreed to 
be fired and rehired with a loss of seniority after accumulating 
more than 35 points in a year deterling said

wheat and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower while most corn and oat futures advanced slightly in subdued 
trading friday on the chicago board of trade 
analysts attributed the declines to profittaking and positioning 
ahead of the weekend 
they said wheat also fell on disappointment that the agriculture 
department had rejected chinas bid for 400000 metric tons of us 
wheat at subsidized prices 
soybeans came under additional pressure from mixed forecasts for 
the weekend weather in the south american soybean belt analysts 
said 
two private forecasters were predicting rain and another one 
said it wasnt going to rain so theyve got some confusion going in 
the beans said jerry gidel an analyst with the gh miller 
futures trading division of lit america inc in chicago 
corn futures were buoyed by expectations for increased export 
sales analysts said 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 427 a bushel corn was 2 
cents lower to 2 cents higher with december at 259 oats were 2 
cents to 3 cents higher with december at 205 a bushel soybeans 
were 3 cents lower to 1 cents higher with january at 773 a bushel

in the world of credit short is most 
definitely in fashion these days at least from an investors 
standpoint 
yields on some bills and notes particularly in the treasury 
market have nearly equaled or surpassed those on longer maturing 
bonds more so now than at any other time this year that makes it 
far more sensible to hold onto the shorter securities 
usually its the other way around longterm rates often are 
significantly higher to compensate investors for their increased 
risk 
for instance its more likely that someone will renege on a 
30year debt than on one lasting three months theres also 
increased risk of higher interest rates which depress a bonds 
price and higher inflation which reduce its real value 
but now the socalled yield curve which illustrates the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates appears to 
be changing normally in an upward or j position the curve 
which has been flat for most of the year looks close to inverting 
by midday friday the yield on the treasurys bellwether 30year 
bond stood at 896 percent lower than the yields of all other bonds 
and notes of lesser maturities the 20year bond was yielding 902 
percent the 10year 901 percent the fouryear 900 percent and 
the twoyear 899 percent 
treasury bill yields remained a bit lower however a quick 
measure of the curve is the relationship between the threemonth 
bill and the 30year bond by friday afternoon the long bond was 
079 percentage points higher than the bill the gap though was 
closing in on the oneyear bill which was yielding 890 percent 
when the yield curve is in a positive upward steep the long bond 
is usually between 1 to 2 percentage points higher in yield 
the yield curve theoretically should reflect the expectations of 
borrowers and investors one that ascends steeply indicates that the 
markets expect interest rates and inflation to rise it also 
portrays easy money 
the last time the curve inverted was around 1981 the stock 
market fell into a slump as a result and the nation headed into a 
recession 
market watchers arent sure what the current movement of rates 
means 
jay goldinger a principal at the beverly hills calif 
investment banking firm capital insight inc said he expects the 
yield curve to continue to invert but that the economy shouldnt 
suffer as a result 
what it the inversion really means is inflation expectations 
in this country continue to be reduced as the fed has done a good 
job of tightening credit goldinger said 
this is nothing unusual we have an inverted yield curve in 
england and in australia he explained the central banks of 
this world really pay attention in focusing in on inflation fears 
marshall b front an economist at the chicago investment firm 
stein roe amp farnham predicted that rates might be heading lower 
soon because the economy is showing signs of slowing down 
while shortterm rates certainly are attractive now not just in 
treasuries but in things like certificates of deposits or money 
market accounts front says hes gradually sinking his money into 
longermaturing securities 
our own guess is that were fairly close to a peak in 
shortterm rates we could see a decline in rates before the end of 
the first quarter front said 
if that happens then bond prices will head higher 
we dont think well have a repeat of the last few cycles where 
you had a sharply inverted yield curve front said

as winter settles into the windy city soybean 
traders on the chicago board of trade are looking to the south with 
more than vacations in mind 
its springtime in brazil and argentina respectively the worlds 
secondand fourthlargest soybean producers and a dry spell during 
the south american planting period could prove to be the seedling of 
another drought rally in the soybean market 
its sort of analagous to what happened here in the midwest in 
may or june said james candor senior forecaster with 
accuweather inc a private meteorological information service in 
state college pa 
theres still time for the crop to recover if it turns rainy 
he said but if it stays this dry for the rest of this month into 
early january then problems will really start to mount 
other experts say the south american weather could stay dry into 
late january with no significant damage to the soybean crop and the 
plants wont enter their most critical growth phase until 
midfebruary 
but soybean futures traders are scrambling for every available 
scrap of south american weather information and a recent upswing in 
prices reflects the generally bullish outlook 
soybeans for delivery in march on the chicago board of trade hit 
a recent low of 742 a bushel on nov 18 on friday the contract 
settled at 785 
no one is predicting a return to the highs near 11 a bushel 
reached in july on panic buying linked to the midwestern drought 
but said jerry zusel manager of cbot floor operations for 
balfour maclaine corp if south american production falters 
because of weather and nobody has that answer yet prices could 
go up by 1 to 150 bushel over next several months 
the us soybean market has grown more sensitive to the status of 
the south american crop in the last 10 years as south american 
production has expanded to satisfy the worlds increasing appetite 
for protein 
in 1981 brazil produced about 470 million bushels of soybeans 
and argentina grew about 154 million bushels last month the 
agriculture department estimated brazils soybean output for the 
198889 season at the equivalent of 734 million bushels and 
argentinas at 404 million bushels 
the united states is the worlds largest producer with this 
years output estimated at 151 billion bushels but that figure 
represents a 21 percent decline from the 1987 us harvest and the 
nations surplus stockpile is expected to dwindle by the end of 
august to a scant 125 million bushels as a result 
because of the sharp reduction in us supplies the south 
american weather this year has probably become the most important in 
history as far as soybeans are concerned said charles notis a 
founding partner of freesenotis weather inc in des moines iowa 
soybean traders say the south american weather information 
available from private forecasters varies greatly from one 
meteorological firm to another and seems less reliable than us 
weather data 
the private forecasters say those problems often stem from their 
difficulty in getting data from the weather services run by south 
american governments 
it seems that quite often when it rains down there for some 
reason they dont like to report what happened how much rain 
fell notis said their regular reporting stations sometimes 
dont report 
peter leavitt executive vice president of weather services corp 
in new bedford mass said the information his firm receieves 
through official channels sometimes comes in garbled or just plain 
wrong 
last week campo grande the location of a brazilian reporting 
station transmitted 24hour precipitation of 92 millimeters but it 
actually received only 02 millimeters leavitt said thats the 
difference between 36 or 37 inches and a trace 
so private forecasters rely heavily on data from weather 
satellites and even though satellite accuracy fades the farther you 
get from the equator satellites dont lie notis said 
private forecasters were hesitant to make longrange predictions 
about south americas soybean weather but leavitt cited a cooling 
of ocean surface temperatures which he called the la nina 
effect the inverse of the betterknown el nino 
la nina is typically associated with dryweather years in the 
southern hemisphere he said 
there are very strong la nina signals this year and thats 
more likely to give you a crop problem in south america he said

general electric co plc and siemens ag said friday 
they would delay their 17 billionpound or 31 billion joint bid 
for the british electronics firm plessey co plc pending a high 
court hearing late next week 
plessey on thursday obtained a preliminary injunction from the 
high court blocking the offer before a full court hearing on whether 
the bid infringes on the anticompetition provisions of the treaty 
of rome 
plessey said the injunction was dropped by the court on friday 
after gec and siemens pledged not to pursue their bid before the 
full hearing the matter is now likely to come before the court next 
thursday and friday plessey said 
gec a british company which is not related to the us company 
of the same name said it intends to contest plesseys arguments 
siemens is a west german concern 
plessey argued that the gecsiemens bid is anticompetitive and 
illegal and allegedly contravenes the antitrust provisions of the 
treaty of rome the european communitys founding charter 
the ec commission is also investigating the bid but has not yet

a bipartisan commission appointed to study ways 
to reduce the federal budget deficit friday canceled its next 
meeting after a judge barred the panel from closing the proceedings 
to the public 
the decision by us district judge joyce hens green prompted the 
national economic commission to cancel mondays meeting at which it 
was to review budget options and discuss which economic assumptions 
would be used to make recommendations for deficit reduction 
it is evident in this case that the public has the right to 
know the issues at discussion as they develop at the december 12 
meeting green ruled in granting a temporary restraining order 
barring a closed proceeding 
the meeting is canceled commission spokesman jim hildreth 
said following greens decision we were challenged and we will 
abide by the court where we will go from here we simply dont 
know 
the commission has no other scheduled meetings this month and had 
only discussed tentative dates for discussions in january hildreth 
said 
the judge ruled that news organizations that brought the case 
would likely ultimately be able to prove that closed meetings 
violate the federal advisory commission act and the sunshine act 
the commissions insistence on shielding the debate as to 
budget options from public scrutiny directly contravenes the law 
green wrote in an opinion 
it chops the core of our democratic society open robust 
unvarnished public debate illuminating pressing issues concerns and 
policies that affect the lives of all citizens she said 
the judge rejected the commissions arguments that because the 
panels members were so prestigious their public discussions of 
various economic options could wreak havoc with the financial 
markets 
the expressions to be presented by these officials are no 
different than the plethora of economic assessments and predictions 
some optimistic some grave that inundate the public daily 
green said 
while such discussion may result in speculation on financial 
markets the effect must be balanced against the open society and 
unfettered public debate on important national issues upon which our 
democracy is founded the judge said 
a closed meeting would more likely encourage speculation he 
said adding fear flourishes when the process is shrouded in a 
cloak of secrecy and the swiftest transport to speculation is fear 
the lawsuit challenging the closed meeting was filed by the 
washington post the wall street journal the bureau of national 
affairs which publishes financial newsletters and stephen 
wildstrom an editor for business week 
public citizen a consumer organization founded by ralph nader 
represented the news organizations and also joined in the case 
in a statement public citizens president joan claybrook said 
the idea that the members of this commission are too prestigious 
to air their views in public is outrageous and an affront to our 
open system of government

wall streets latest financial product the 
unbundled stock unit is being touted as a way for topquality 
companies to unlock the hidden values in their shares without having 
to dismantle the company 
but the proposal has also unleashed a torrent of questions from 
investors and money managers trying to figure if there is anything 
in it for them 
shearson lehman hutton inc which developed the proposal 
embraced by four major companies earlier this week has created a 
product that splits a stock into three components a 30year bond 
a preferred stock and a stock appreciation certificate 
american express co sara lee corp dow chemical co and pfizer 
inc have filed documents with the securities and exchange 
commission to offer their shareholders a chance to swap up to 56 
billion in stock for new securities 
while the sec reviews the filings money managers are trying to 
figure how the new securities will work what they will be worth and 
whether there will be be enough of them that there will be a ready 
buyer when a holder wants to sell 
while their inventors say they were not intended as a takeover 
defense some investors say they may have that effect critics say 
the tax savings for issuers inherent in the plans may invite 
congressional scrutiny 
jim rogers a professional investor and professor of finance at 
columbia universitys graduate school of business said the new 
securities are a waste of time i dont see whats in it for 
most people 
the question you have to ask yourself is do we really need 
another piece of paper to maintain our capital system said david 
dreman director of a money management firm that bears his name 
but ron gallatin the shearson executive who oversaw the 
invention of unbundled stock units said they will be useful for 
major companies with credit ratings strong enough to absorb some 
modest increases in debt 
he said they are designed to highlight the three reasons people 
buy stock the chance for a price increase the dividend and the 
possibility that the dividend will be raised 
the 30year bond will pay interest equal to the current annual 
dividend the preferred stock would pay any increase over the next 
30 years in the current level of the dividend the stock 
appreciation certificate would entitle the holder to buy a share of 
the companys stock in 30 years for a preset price expected to be 
slightly higher than the face value of the bond 
investors making the swap would be protected against a dividend 
reduction since the dividend would become a fixed interest payment 
but some investment managers wonder how liquid the market for the 
new securities will be 
youll only be able to determine that when they come out 
said charles minter a partner in the investment advisory firm 
comstock partners 
gallatin conceded that since the exchange of stock for an 
unbundled unit would be taxable the units should appeal mainly to 
taxexempt institutions such as pension funds 
those making the exchange would also give up their voting rights 
a development that some analysts suspect management would like 
if you remove 20 percent of the stock from the market you 
could end up with a higher percentage in friendly hands said 
kenneth heebner a portfolio manager at loomis sayles amp co in 
boston 
from the issuers standpoint the security may be especially 
attractive to companies that feel undervalued have little debt and 
want to avoid the heavy borrowing that would be needed to buy back 
stock for cash 
this is particularly attractive at a time when many american 
managers see other companies succumbing to takeovers at prices far 
in excess of market values the publisher macmillan inc foodmaker 
kraft inc and food and tobacco giant rjr nabisco inc have all 
fallen prey in recent months to takeover offers at a huge premiums 
to their stock prices 
the swaps would have a mixed financial impact on an issuer 
however 
on the one hand the company loses the flexibility of being able 
to reduce its costs in bad times it can always cut a dividend but 
not interest payments but the company would save on taxes since 
interest payments are deductible while dividends are not 
this plays into the hands of those in congress who say debt has 
become a device for avoiding taxes said james ullman trustee of 
batterymarch financial management 
a staffer on the house ways and means committee speaking on 
condition that he not be identified by name said the panel has 
taken no position on whether to investigate the uses of the 
unbundled stock unit and said whether it does so may depend on how 
many companies use it 
the one clear winner in all this investment managers say will 
be the underwriters who get a fee for handling the exchanges and the 
brokers who will get commissions on executing trades involving all 
of the new products 
it is a reflection of the battered shape of wall street said 
batterymarchs ullman

here is a capsule description of an unbundled 
stock unit a new type of security developed by shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
four major companies american express co sara lee corp 
pfizer inc and dow chemical co have announced plans subject to 
federal review to exchange up to 56 billion of their stock for 
unbundled stock units 
the new securities consist of 
a 30year bond that pays interest equal to the current stock 
dividend and carrying a face value payable in 2019 higher than the 
current stock price 
under the preliminary proposal for instance american expresss 
bond would pay 84 cents a year in interest and have a face value of 
75 american express stock was trading at 2687 the last trading 
day before the proposal 
a share of preferred stock that will entitle the holder to any 
dividends declared by the company in excess of the current dividend 
for american express that would be anything above 84 cents a year 
the preferred share could also be redeemed in 2019 for a nominal 
price expected to be 2 
a stock appreciation certificate that will give the holder the 
right to purchase for cash a share of the companys stock in 2019 
for the principal amount of the bond plus the preferred share in 
the american express example that would be 77 
it is expected that subject to appropriate approvals the 
unbundled stock unit each of its parts and a security that combines 
the preferred share and the stock appreciation certificate would be 
traded on the new york stock exchange just as the companys stock

world trade talks ended inconclusively friday 
with tentative gains in many areas but no sign of compromise on the 
critical issue of farm supports 
i suppose we could say its a semisuccess said john 
crosbie minister of international trade for host canada 
trade ministers agreed to postpone final action until the first 
week in april hoping a way will be found in the meantime to break a 
deadlock between the united states and european economic community 
over agriculture 
top officials from 103 nations including 90 trade ministers 
came to montreal to prod along the fouryear uruguay round of 
freetrade talks under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
this is the most ambitious round of freetrade talks since 
formation of the gatt after world war ii and negotiators are 
discovering deep sensitivities over agriculture which had been 
largely exempted from scrutiny until now 
the fourmonth delay in the socalled midterm review of the 
uruguay round meant that progress was frozen in 11 areas of 
tentative agreement including important ones such as freeing trade 
in services and monitoring nations trade policies 
arthur dunkel the director general of the gatt will seek to 
bridge differences over the next four months in the four remaining 
areas agriculture protection of intellectual property textile 
tariffs and quotas and escape clauses from gatt rules 
dunkel expressed optimism that he could persuade the american and 
european negotiators to yield by appealing to their guilty 
consciences over the impasse on agriculture 
when people have bad conscience its a good start to make a 
deal he said in a news conference 
the farm deadlock had threatened to derail the entire 
negotiations because some nations that depend on farm exports had 
warned they would withhold approval of the other agreements unless 
they got some progress on agriculture 
the nations that demanded progress in all areas included 
argentina brazil chile colombia and uruguay hungary and new 
zealand 
the united states demanded a commitment by all nations to the 
eventual elimination of tradedistorting farm subsidies and 
barriers while the eec said it was willing to cut but not eliminate 
such programs 
the united states said it would not discuss shortterm measures 
until it got a commitment on the longterm goal while the eec said 
it would not discuss a longterm goal until shortterm measures had 
been agreed upon 
these were some of the tentative accords reached in montreal 
subject to approval in april 
import tariffs on most goods would be cut by at least the 30 
percent achieved in the last gatt round which ended in 1979 the 
significance of tariff cuts has diminished somewhat along with the 
rise in nontariff barriers 
trade in services would be liberalized although developing 
nations would be allowed to give their service industries some kind 
of extra protection sectors to be covered would be decided by may 
1989 
to speed up settlement of disputes all gatt reports on 
disputes would have to be completed within 15 months unless the 
parties agreed to an extension 
the united states would be permitted to take trade retaliation 
outside the gatt rules even if a gatt proceeding on its complaint 
was under way 
the legality of countries trade policies would be reviewed 
every two years for the united states canada japan and eec 
countries every four years for 16 other countries and as needed 
for all other gatt members 
the gatts director general would be instructed to seek closer 
ties to the world bank and international monetary fund and report 
back by september 1989 
developed countries would lower barriers to imports of tropical 
products such as coffee bananas and rubber from developing nations 
the eec said friday it would go ahead with its concessions on 
tropical products and eliminate tariffs on imports from some of the 
worlds poorest countries without waiting for the april meeting

while mikhail gorbachev soothed world tensions 
with some suave diplomacy in new york americans were taking a 
tougher approach at trade talks in montreal and ruffling feathers 
in fact us negotiators at the freetrade negotiations this 
past week were less yielding than a montreal canadiens goaltender 
demanding a commitment by all nations to total elimination of 
tradedistorting farm subsidies and barriers 
they didnt get what they wanted and by pressing that single 
demand relentlessly they jeopardized progress on other trade issues 
that are dear to americans such as getting developing nations to 
honor us copyrights and patents 
meanwhile gorbachev was winning worldwide applause as a 
peacemaker with his announcement of plans to cut soviet armed forces 
by 500000 worldwide and pull back 10000 tanks from eastern europe 
the irony was that in both cases perception was the biggest 
element of the story 
in the hubbub over gorbachevs initiative it was little noted 
that warsaw pact forces would continue to vastly outnumber nato 
forces in europe or that gorbachevs hand was forced by the crisis 
in his own overstretched economy 
likewise the united states came across as a bad guy in the 
montreal trade talks even though its goal eradicating farm 
subsidies was a popular one 
among other things eliminating the subsidies would save money 
and cut food bills for us and european taxpayers while allowing 
developing nations to generate an extra 26 billion a year in 
agricultural exports 
the ultimate success of the us tactics remains to be seen it 
could yet turn out that an unyielding us stand was exactly what 
was needed to force the europeans into getting serious about cutting 
farm programs 
agriculture is too important to simply nibble at the edges of 
reform clayton yeutter the hardcharging us trade 
representative told delegates from 103 nations in his closing 
statement friday 
but whatever the possible longterm gains the only immediate 
effects of the us unwillingness to discuss shortterm measures 
without agreement on a longterm goal were these 
no agreements were reached on cutting expensive farm programs 
chances increased that the us congress would approve new 
export subsidies in what could become an escalating conflict with 
the europeans 
developing nations were embittered by the stalemate which 
deprived them of gains they had hoped to make in freer farm exports 
in retaliation a bloc of developing nations managed to prevent 
final adoption of agreements in other areas such as freer trade in 
services 
the united states probably could have gotten farther if it had 
been willing to compromise says gerard nierenberg a new yorkbased 
negotiation expert who admits he is no expert on world trade 
theres an old theory that if you make the first concession in 
a negotiation you show your weakness but thats not true said 
nierenberg 
to him exhibit no 1 of the value of unilateral concessions is 
gorbachevs troop reduction announcement at the united nations 
they took what they had to do and made it to their advantage 
what does 95 percent of the world think that gorbachev is a 
peacemaker 
similarly us negotiators could have come across as peacemakers 
on trade if they had announced some cut in farm subsidies and 
invited other countries to follow suit for the good of all 
nierenberg said 
everybody wins in a good negotiation said nierenberg the author 
of 14 books and the president of the negotiation institute 
that view from an admitted novice on farm trade happens to go 
along with pleadings this past week by barber conable head of the 
world bank and michel camdessus head of the international monetary 
fund 
according to a new imf report nations can benefit by cutting 
farm subsidies even if others do not immediately follow suit so it 
makes sense to go first 
the imf report is somewhat politically naive it is hard to 
expect american farmers to relinquish export markets even 
temporarily without a fight 
the united states is tired of making concessions that arent 
matched daniel amstutz the chief us farm negotiator said in a 
news conference 
over 40 years we have learned that the rest of the world has 
not followed suit so no more 
where the americans erred nierenberg believes was in feeling 
that the goal of free farm trade justified the means of stonewalling 
we can have glamorous ends but if we ignore the means to these 
ends were never going to get anything nierenberg said 
hanging tough is not an achievement coming up with creative 
solutions is

eastern airlines on friday denied speculation that a 
move to break up the sales force it shares with continential 
airlines is intended to do anything but sell more tickets 
it has absolutely nothing to do with anything except better 
customer service and selling our core markets to the public said 
cori zywotow eastern manager of corporate communications marketing 
but labor officials said there may be other reasons for the move 
to separate the two carriers sales forces which were combined 
after texas air corp bought both airlines 
it may indicate the company is being readied for sale said 
jb stokes a spokesman for easterns air line pilots association 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo has insisted the moneylosing 
airline is not for sale but speculation increased after real estate 
magnate donald trump negotiated to buy easterns most profitable 
division the northeast shuttle linking washington new york and 
boston for 365 million cash 
eastern lost about 234 million in the first nine months of the 
year and has laid off about 3500 employees in recent months 
other union officials speculated that the sales change may be an 
attempt by texas air to keep miamibased eastern and houstonbased 
continental from being declared one carrier for labor representation 
purposes the national mediation board has been addressing that 
matter in hearings since last summer 
easterncontinental sales was formed when the operations were put 
together to improve efficiency its representatives called on travel 
agents promoting group packages charters and special fares offered 
by the two carriers 
this was one of the things where we had great consternation 
when we did it joseph leonard easterns executive vice president 
and chief operating officer said thursday we have felt and the 
sales people have told us this that its very difficult to sell two 
products 
lorenzo says the carriers are independent and he has no plans to 
merge them he turned the chairmanship of continental over to d 
joseph corr former president of trans world airlines earlier this 
week 
the present sales team will be split in half leonard said each 
will be based at its carriers headquarters 
eastern salespeople will report to stan brown vice president of 
passenger sales brown will report to eastern vice president of 
marketing george brennan 
its really going back and concentrating our energies on 
eastern and emphasizing our sales programs and distinctive 
features zywotow said and were expecting that with a 
dedicated sales force that we can concentrate on our tradtional core 
markets along the east coast latin america and the caribbean

finance minister kiichi miyazawa resigned friday 
the highestranking government official to quit in the aftermath of 
an insider trading scandal while critics intensified demands for a 
fullscale probe of the share purchases by politicians 
miyazawa said he was resigning as finance minister and deputy 
premier to take responsibility for conflicting statements in 
parliament regarding his involvement in questionable purchases of 
stock of the real estate firm recruitcosmos co 
my explanations werent sufficient and i am taking 
responsibility miyazawa told reporters after he informed prime 
minister noboru takeshita he was quitting 
he also said he hoped his resignation would facilitate passage of 
a major tax reform package through the parliament 
accomplishing tax reform is my mission miyazawa said it 
doesnt matter what happens to me 
takeshita who is expected to announce a cabinet shuffle in the 
next few weeks told reporters later that he would assume the 
finance portfolio he refused to comment however on how long he 
would hold that reponsibility 
more than a dozen leading politicians including takeshita and 
former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone have been linked to the 
stock profiteering deal devised by businessman hiromasa ezoe 
founder of the information conglomerate recruit co 
ezoe reportedly offered certain individuals the opportunity to 
purchase bargainpriced shares in recruitcosmos a recruit 
affiliate prior to their overthecounter listing in october 1986 
shortly after the shares were offered for public trading their 
value rose sharply and earned large profits for holders many of 
whom were also provided with interestfree financing to buy the 
shares 
opposition leaders spearheading a probe of the stock deal 
dubbed recruitgate as a parallel to the us watergate scandal 
have charged that politicians were offered the lucrative shares in 
return for political favor 
miyazawa himself came under fire after delivering several 
conflicting reports regarding his former secretarys role in the 
incident 
he initially testified to a parliamentary committee investigating 
the scandal that a third party a friend of his former secretary 
purchased 10000 recruitcosmos shares and only borrowed the name of 
miyazawa 
he later admitted his exsecretary actually paid 30 million yen 
or about 246000 for the shares in september 1986 and sold them 
for 527 million yen or 431000 less than a month later after they 
were listed without the finance ministers knowledge 
miyazawa also insisted the stock purchase was not financed by a 
recruitlinked financial institution but refused to show bank 
documents to back up his argument 
miyazawa is the largest casualty to date in the fivemonthold 
scandal that has shaken public confidence in takeshita government 
public support for takeshitas government dropped to 18 percent 
from 30 percent when he assumed office a year ago according to a 
survey released friday by the masscirculation newspaper mainichi 
shimbun 
the leading opposition japan socialist party and other critics 
said miyazawas resignation was overdue but renewed demands for a 
steppedup investigation of the scandal 
the asahi shimbun a leading liberal daily said it was time for 
takeshita to heed the opinion polls and listen to the voice of the 
people who want the recruit affair cleared up

a us bankruptcy court judge has approved a 
request to forestall action by the commodity futures trading 
commission against two of the hunt brothers of dallas while they 
work out chapter 11 reorganization settlements 
we had an order that enjoined the commodity futures trading 
commission from proceedings until other matters are resolved said 
judge harold abramson of his 36page opinion handed down thursday in 
the cases of william herbert hunt and nelson bunker hunt 
the cftc complaint claims the two dallas businessmen who filed 
for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in september and others 
manipulated the price of silver futures between fall 1979 and march 
1980 
silver prices collapsed to 10 an ounce on march 27 1980 after 
previously hitting a high of 52 an ounce 
tom whitaker vice president of hunt energy and a spokesman for 
the brothers said the hunts are pleased with abramsons decision 
our ongoing intent is still intact that is to get all these 
proceedings into one forum he said 
whitaker estimated it could be 12 to 14 months before the 
bankruptcy court matters are resolved attorneys for the hunts filed 
statements of financial affairs and schedules of assets and 
liabilities in us bankruptcy court last month 
now creditors have until midjanuary to file claims with the 
court whitaker said 
angela g tese a new york bankruptcy attorney whose firm cole amp 
deitz has been observing the hunt case said abramsons decision 
means damages and claims against the brothers take precedence over 
fines and penalties that might be imposed 
the decision of the bankruptcy court judge is not an unusual 
one at all ms tese said its in keeping with the spirit of 
the bankruptcy code 
she said the decision apparently does not mean the cftc will drop 
its civil complaint against the hunts its possible that they 
will proceed at some later date she said 
the cftc general counsel who is handling the case did not 
immediately return telephone calls to the associated press on friday 
in september administrative law judge arthur l shipe ruled that 
the hunts personal bankruptcy court filings did not automatically 
block the governments case against the brothers 
the cftcs complaint is the biggest market manipulation case ever 
filed by the commission if the hunts lose they could face fines of 
100000 for each violation of federal commodity laws and be 
premanently banned from trading in all futures markets 
whitaker also said abramsons ruling also means the cftc cannot 
press its case until appeals are heard involving the hunts lawsuit 
with the peruvian company minpeco 
william herbert hunt nelson bunker hunt and their brother lamar 
hunt and others were ordered by a federal court jury in new york to 
pay minpeco the peruvian governments silver mining company 1346 
million the company had lost millions of dollars in the silver 
price squeeze

the storied yearend rally has arrived on schedule 
for wall street but not quite with its usual measure of 
holidayseason cheer 
even as stock prices were rising in the past week some of the 
largest securities firms were issuing cautious appraisals of the 
investment outlook for 1989 
and what many analysts were calling the gorbachev rally 
showed signs of faltering even before the soviet leaders historic 
us visit was abruptly overshadowed by the disastrous earthquake in 
soviet armenia 
at first it seemed that mikhail gorbachevs pledge to reduce the 
soviet unions military forces and spending had the makings of a 
major stimulus for the american stock and bond markets 
the us in turn could decrease defensive spending relieve 
pressure on an overheated economy and thereby reduce the federal 
budget deficit said edward nicoski an analyst at piper jaffray 
amp hopwood inc in minneapolis 
government bond prices which move in the opposite direction from 
interest rates staged their strongest singleday rally in three 
months 
but the stock market after responding enthusiastically to 
advance reports of the message gorbachev was bringing leveled off 
by the time he actually delivered it 
many market participants quickly shifted their attention back to 
the prospect of further credittightening by the federal reserve to 
keep economic growth restrained 
the caveat as to the sustainability of this rally rests on the 
trend and level of interest rates nicoski observed 
while the gorbachev proposal is a giant step in the right 
direction we question whether the federal reserve or other central 
banks dare relax their monetary reins 
analysts at merrill lynch in issuing their 1989 forecast 
predicted a further rise in interest rates before they turn downward 
next year 
donald straszheim the firms chief economist said he expected 
the yield on longterm treasury bonds recently hovering around 9 
percent to average 93 percent in the first quarter of the new year 
later in 1989 he added a weakening economy and a leveling 
of inflation should cause a substantial decline in rates 
at the close on friday the dow jones average of 30 industrials 
stood at 214349 up 5121 points from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 257 to 15559 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market gained 
129 to 37520 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 234 at 29761 
volume on the big board averaged 14186 million shares a day 
against 13254 million in the previous week 
in their yearend forecasts both merrill lynch and salomon 
brothers inc predicted a trading range stock market in 1989 
similar to the pattern that has prevailed this year 
restructuring activity should extend into 1989 limiting 
downside risk in the market but also continuing to alienate 
traditional investors salomon analysts said 
robert farrell merrill lynchs chief market analyst said stocks 
are likely to remain in transition until the economy weakens 
enough to allow interest rates to fall 
apparent complacency about credit risk reflected in the 
relatively narrow yield spread between treasury bond and junk bond 
yields is not usually characteristic of the beginning of a bull 
market farrell said 
new bull markets usually evolve out of recessions when quality 
spreads are widening sharply and the federal reserve is forced to 
ease

brazil has embraced the use of gasohol an automobile fuel made 
from gasoline and alcohol like no other country a recent opec

trying to win financial backing for its share in the project the 
clean coal program requires local sponsors to put up at least 
half the cost of a project

technical flaws or that the state had been unresponsive just that 
financial support was not available to allow the project to 
proceed in a timely manner

federal funds and the department said it would open negotiations

wynns announcement ended speculation that the new resort on the 
las vegas strip would carry the same name as his hotelcasino in the 
downtowns glitter gulch 
wynn said he and others at the resort knew they had to have a new 
name for the new property or the downtown golden nugget would 
become know as the old one and the strip resort the new one 
it didnt seem fair that this property would be called the old 
one wynn said 
the downtown casino dates to 1946 but renovations a new tower 
and luxury suites have pushed the value to 200 million wynn said

bond prices ended mixed in slow trading friday 
reflecting what creditmarket strategists called uncertainty over 
the direction of interest rates 
the treasurys 30year bond rose about point or 125 per 
1000 in face amount and its yield eased to 895 percent from 896 
percent thursday 
one noteworthy development was a rise in rates on shortterm 
treasury notes to yield more than that of 30year bonds an unusual 
shift that last occurred prior to the 198182 recession but the 
significance of the socalled inverted yield curve remains unclear 
bond strategists said the market was influenced largely by 
confusion over whether or when the federal reserve will move to 
tighten credit conditions in order to preempt inflationary pressure 
and keep the dollar stable 
they said the confusion may be clarified somewhat next wednesday 
when the commerce department is scheduled to release the 
marketsensitive monthly trade deficit figures for october a large 
imbalance could hurt the dollars value and force the fed to raise 
interest rates 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
governments fell point intermediate maturities fell point and 
longterm issues rose point the telerate inc financial 
information service reported 
the movement of a point equals a change of 10 in the price of a 
bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer fell 145 to 113557

buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was up 732 point 
at 90 as of 3 pm est the average yield to maturity was 790

bills rose to 867 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points to 
821 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 892 percent as the 
discount rose 5 basis points to 828 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the

plans by the saudi arabian oil co to buy half 
of texaco incs refining and marketing assets could further erode 
the domestic oil industry and increase reliance on foreign supplies 
rep john bryant said friday in asking the treasury secretary to 
investigate the proposed deal 
the enormity of this acquisition causes us to believe a second 
look should be taken at the matter because of its possible impact 
on the domestic oil and gas industry and on our ability to become 
energy independent bryant said 
bryant a dallas democrat sen howard metzenbaum dohio sen 
jeff bingamon dnm and rep edward markey dmass appealed to 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady to investigate the joint 
venture named star enterprises on national security grounds 
the sauditexaco deal announced nov 10 would include three 
refineries 50 distribution terminals 1400 service stations and 
10000 franchised gasoline stations in 23 eastern and gulf coast 
states 
in their letter the democrats said they believe the acquisition 
falls under the law enabling the government to block mergers 
involving a foreign interests if there is evidence that national 
security is threatened 
the acquisition they wrote could seriously increase us 
dependence on foreign oil threaten the viability of the domestic 
oil industry and jeopardize the wellbeing of american consumers 
the lessons of the 197374 oil embargo and the 197879 shortage 
taught our country all too well the economic and political 
consequences of reliance on vulnerable oil supplies the letter 
said 
what is particulary noteworthy is that 96 percent of the 
capacity of the three refineries will be used in refining saudi 
arabian crude oil bryant said so youve got a circumstance 
that saudi arabia has guaranteed itself an outlet for crude oil into 
the american market giving them the option of lowering crude prices 
while earning increased prices at the gasoline marketing level this 
could amount to an enormous loss to domestic producers and leave us 
even more dependent on foreigh oil 
also he said foreign countries are immune from our antitrust 
laws so its not clear we could enforce antitrust laws against 
this merged entity if needed to do so to protect consumers from 
market manipulation 
he said saudi arabia has announced a concerted effort to expand 
its dominance in us oil markets and that its goal is to become the 
10th largest seller of gasoline in the united states as a first step

larger role in the deal than mai basic which is controlled by new 
york investor bennett s lebow had disclosed in filings with the 
securities and exchange commission

20ashare bid turned it from an investment banker into a bidder 
prime had alleged that drexel controlled the bid through a series of 
investment partnerships that were not disclosed in federal filings 
the judge also said mai basic should have been more forthright 
about past legal problems involving lebow and william weksel who 
together own 43 percent of mais shares and have been named as 
defendants in past shareholder lawsuits 
mai basic a computer company based in tustin calif said in a 
statement while we have not yet seen the written order we do not 
believe that it will in any way impede the consummation of our 
offer

david p bloom the wouldbe financial adviser 
who bilked investors out of 15 million to fund a lavish lifestyle 
of expensive artworks luxury cars and posh homes was sentenced 
friday to eight years in prison by a judge who called him amoral 
not immoral 
asking the judge to give bloom 24 a shorter sentence than the 
threeyear term handed master wall street criminal ivan f boesky 
blooms lawyer described him as a greedy young man and a product 
of our times 
when he grew up greed was on the ascendency said the 
lawyer david w oconnor david bloom shouldnt wind up being the 
scapegoat of the 1980s 
but us district judge david n edelstein said he was imposing 
the stiff sentence because it was absolutely essential to send a 
message to those who act through greed and insatiable lust for 
despoiling innocent people 
the highliving bloom whose massive swindle scheme earned him 
the title wall street whiz kid pleaded guilty last march to one 
count each of mail fraud and securities fraud most of the investors 
he conned were friends of his parents according to prosecutors 
in a 15page sentencing memo to the judge assistant us 
attorney robert l plotz said bloom victimized close friends of 
his parents and betrayed the trust not only of these friends but 
also of his parents 
noting that several of blooms victims had turned over pension 
plans and individual retirement accounts to him the memo said bloom 
took everything he could from people who loved him in so doing 
he exhibited a legal and moral depravity 
i have betrayed my own sense of morality and values and 
betrayed the trust and love of numerous people around me the 
short bespectacled bloom standing with his hands crossed in front 
of him told the judge 
he conceded he was deserving of punishment but oconnor urged 
the judge to show leniency because this is not ivan boesky or 
convicted inside trader dennis levine 
boesky who pleaded guilty to securities law conspiracy and is 
cooperating with investigators was sentenced to three years in 
prison last december levine an investment banker caught in a 
massive insider trading scheme was sentenced to two years in 1986 
oconnor called blooms crime a bizarre aberration and told 
the judge that a stiff sentence was not going to discourage the 
next screwball who comes along 
but edelstein concluded bloom was remorseless completely 
lacking in conscience he was a predator completely insensitive 
edelstein sentenced bloom to four years on each count and in an 
unusual move ordered the prison terms to run consecutively as 
spectators in the crowded courtroom gasped 
he went on his way without any thought of the pain suffering 
and misery he was inflicting said a disgusted edelstein he was 
amoral not immoral 
the judge said bloom had cannibalized his family and friends 
he also ordered bloom to make full restitution 
no fine was imposed 
edelstein could have sentenced bloom to 10 years in prison and 
20 million in fines 
according to prosecutors the boyishlooking bloom used deceit 
and fraud to parlay a college investment club into a 
multimilliondollar investment operation with about 140 clients 
bloom who was not registered as an investment adviser wooed 
investors for his nowdefunct greater sutton investors group inc by 
falsely claiming his clientele included the sultan of brunei the 
rockefeller family and entertainer bill cosby 
a 1985 duke university graduate with an art history degree bloom 
told clients he was putting their money into the stock market when 
he actually was using it to pay for a lavish lifestyle that included 
art works worth 55 million an 830000 condominium on manhattans 
upper east side a long island beach house worth 19 million and 
two cars an astonmartin convertible and a mercedesbenz worth 
200000 
among the paintings bloom purchased with other peoples money 
were works by john sloan thomas hart benton mary cassatt and john 
singer sargent 
bloom began sending his investors bogus account statements that 
claimed to show their securities holdings according to the charges 
bloom also was charged with using new clients funds to pay 
profits to older clients 
last january the securities and exchange commission brought 
civil charges against bloom who settled by agreeing to turn over 
his assets to a courtappointed receiver and to stay out of the 
securities industry for the rest of his life 
under the settlement bloom neither admitted nor denied the sec 
allegations but criminal charges were brought in march bloom waived 
indictment and pleaded guilty march 31 to one count each of mail and 
securities fraud
