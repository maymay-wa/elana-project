rushed out of a grocery store with looted goods 
about 1000 additional border police were deployed in rosario 
argentinas thirdlargest city and the scene of the worst looting 
and clashes the past three days 
the lootings began last week when a supermarket in mendoza the 
countrys fourthbiggest city was firebombed and police in 
cordoba the secondlargest confiscated boxes of molotov cocktails 
months of economic chaos have brought the pay of many 
argentines in terms of equivalent buying power to 25 a month or 
less monthly inflation is estimated at 70 percent for may the 
national currency has been devalued by 90 percent since february

were stolen from a warehouse 
government officials in the biggest provinces scrambled to set 
up free food programs in an effort to forestall violence 
its a first step and we know it will be insufficient

rodriguez said i have two alternatives i can put the little i 
have left in the street and give it away or i can just set fire to 
it all 
national government officials have blamed the looting on leftist 
agitators citing the degree of organization and the theft of 
nonfood items but have not accused specific organizations 
vice president victor martinez blamed groups that do not want 
to see the current government end its term and another 
constitutional government begin 
presidentelect carlos menem is to be installed dec 10 under 
the constitution his refusal last week to assume office early 
contributed to a political paralysis that leaves alfonsins 
government little credibility and gives the governmentelect little 
power 
menem said monday he supported the state of siege as did 
antonio cafiero president of the peronist party and governor of 
buenos aires province 
foreign exchange houses were allowed to open for the first time 
in five business days tuesday and banks resumed operations with

the fbi is conducting a preliminary inquiry 
into allegations of payroll padding on the staff of rep william 
gray a pennsylvania democrat who is seeking a leadership post in 
the house sources said tuesday night 
gray who is seeking the majority whip position in anticipation 
of the expected resignation of house speaker jim wright confirmed 
earlier in the day that he had been approached by two 
philadelphiabased fbi agents on monday 
but gray denounced as an outrageous lie a televised report 
that he was under criminal investigation 
the congressman said that he had been specifically told by the 
agents that he was neither a target nor a subject of a criminal 
investigation 
but government sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed a cbs news report that the fbi was conducting a 
preliminary inquiry into allegations regarding personnel and 
expenditures in the congressmans office 
one source said there were allegations of a noshow employee 
being kept on grays payroll the source stressed however that 
the fbis inquiry was at this point preliminary and agents did not 
know whether it would lead to a fullscale criminal investigation 
though gray denied that he was a target or subject under the 
fbis definition of a preliminary inquiry no one is a subject or 
target of such a probe 
i was told over and over again that i was not under 
investigation gray said in a statement to reporters adding that 
fbi agents told him monday that an employee or employees of his 
office had been under investigation for several months 
we pledged to provide any materials or documents to assist in 
this investigation gray said denying that he was in any way 
uncooperative 
gray is chairman of the house democratic caucus and a candidate 
for the house majority whip post being opened up by the planned 
resignation of rep tony coelho dcalif the report comes as 
democrats await the expected resignation of wright who faces 69 
charges by the house ethics committee 
as i am in the midst of a leadership race in which some have 
said i am the front runner i have to question the sources of these 
leaks and their motives as well as their timing gray said 
cbs said fbi agents visited gray this past weekend seeking his 
cooperation it was not forthcoming cbs said adding that the 
sources said subpoenas likely would be issued within weeks 
gray disputed the cbs account 
on memorial day i was contacted for the first time by two 
agents assigned to the fbis office in philadelphia gray said 
during the conversation with the agents i was told over and over 
again that i was not under investigation nor the target of an 
investigation i was told that the bureau was looking into 
allegations about an employee or employees and that they had been 
looking into these allegations for the past four to five months 
gray the highest ranking black in congress appeared on a cbs 
program sunday and said he was confident the democratic 
congressional leadership recently rocked by ethical problems of 
wright and a questionable financial deal involving coelho was 
headed for better times 
i know that all of us feel very confident gray said i 
know this member feels very confident that there are no problems 
coelho announced on saturday that he will leave the house on 
june 15 and wright is expected to resign possibly as early as 
wednesday

tran phuc sanh spent 14 years saving 
for the day when he could pay a crime syndicate 1000 to spirit 
him away from vietnam 
when it came he climbed aboard a leaky boat bound for the 
philippines surviving on seaweed and urine during an arduous 
journey that ended in april he hopes to go to the united states 
right now i am very happy but i long for the family said 
sanh who made the journey with a daughter but left behind his wife 
and two sons i long my wife and my children i think for sure 
we will be together again 
sanh is part of a new increase in the number of people willing 
to scrape together their lifes savings and risk their lives to 
flee vietnam in shoddy vessels provided by criminals 
according to the united nations nearly 72000 boat people 
were in southeast asian refugee camps at the end of april compared 
with nearly 41000 by the same time last year a nearly 60 percent 
rise 
fourteen years after the vietnam war the threat of pirates 
prisonlike refugee camps and countless days at sea without food 
and water have not discouraged the exodus but the unrelenting flow 
has put new pressure on vietnam to find a solution 
filipino authorities report a 300 percent increase in the number 
of arrivals this year malaysia recorded 11500 arrivals between 
january and may 20 nearly double the same period last year 
another 10012 landed in hong kong during the first five months 
about double the number for the same period in 1988 
since 1975 more than 15 million vietnamese have fled their 
homeland by sea 
the desperation to leave can lead to remarkable feats on 
monday a small wooden boat carrying 107 vietnamese refugees landed 
on an uninhabited island in southwestern japan after a 40day 
voyage officials said 
it was the first time since 1977 that a boat carrying vietnamese 
refugees reached japan directly from vietnam the office of the 
un high commissioner for refugees in japan said 
the vietnamese whose numbers included 14 children told 
investigators they left because of their hard lives and because 
they wanted to live in a peaceful place officials said 
under international pressure vietnam has agreed to attend a 
conference in geneva switzerland on june 13 on ways to curb the 
exodus and arrange for the legal departure of those who want to 
emigrate 
but some officials fear vietnam will use the meeting to pressure 
the united states japan and other developed countries for more 
economic aid 
un and government officials are uncertain what has caused the 
latest increase some suspect vietnamese are rushing to get out 
before the geneva conference fearing it will result in agreement 
to stem the flow 
people are feeling that this is their last chance said a 
western relief agency official based in bangkok 
but filipino officials said most of the refugees arriving here 
had not even heard of the geneva conference most say they left 
because of deteriorating economic conditions and the hope of a 
better life 
faced with a growing influx the sixmember association of 
southeast asian nations agreed in march to screen indochinese 
refugees and send back those who cannot prove political persecution 
but member nations brunei indonesia malaysia thailand 
singapore and the philippines have not uniformly implemented the 
new rule pending the outcome of the geneva conference 
the geneva conference must find a solution said one 
malaysian official the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said malaysia was fed up with the refugee problem 
some relief officials believe the recent increase may force 
malaysia and others to press for the forcible return of boat people 
but in hong kong a british crown colony officials expect to 
spend about 40 million from the local treasury to care for the 
more than 34000 boat people jammed into enclosed camps in the 
already overcrowded territory 
under a tougher policy adopted in june hong kong classifies all 
vietnamese arrivals as illegal immigrants subject to repatriation 
unless they can prove political persecution 
those who are assured of relocation in another country are 
classified as refugees only about 14000 have been designated 
refugees 
last year the un high commissioner for refugees and vietnam 
agreed on a voluntary repatriation program for vietnamese in hong 
kong who have grown tired of waiting for resettlement 
so far this year 143 boat people have returned to vietnam 
another 75 are preparing to return in june officials said 
most of the refugees in southeast asian camps expect to travel 
on to new homes in the united states or western europe few expect 
to settle elsewhere in southeast asia 
but southeast asian countries fear developed nations will cut 
back further on their quotas leaving them with thousands of 
unwanted refugees 
the us quota for vietnamese in 1987 stood at 8500 from the 
orderly departure program under which vietnamese can legally 
emigrate and 32000 boat people washington is considering 
accepting 50000 vietnamese this year 
without improvement in the vietnamese economy some officials 
fear the exodus will continue 
porfirio leyson acting chief of a philippine government transit 
center said 70 percent of the refugees say they fled in search of 
a better economic future 
for them its do or die leyson said

west european leaders gave a quick 
stamp of approval to the plan drawn up by president bush to reduce 
sharply us and soviet troops stationed in europe by 1993 
their formal approval will come today in the communique the nato 
leaders will issue after concluding the twoday 40th anniversary 
summit of the 16nation military alliance 
but the sweeping bush proposal clearly aimed at seizing the 
arms control initiative from soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
was greeted at mondays opening session by unanimous praise 
british prime minister margaret thatcher a staunch us ally 
said the offer had transformed the summit which had been 
overshadowed by a nagging dispute over the future role of 
shortrange nuclear arms in europe 
nato foreign ministers early today arrived at compromise 
language to solve that dispute 
west german chancellor helmut kohl called bushs initiative a 
farsighted step that impressively affirmed the united states 
leadership 
president bush has today paved the way for further success of 
our alliance kohl told his colleagues 
the western leaders have been dogged in recent weeks by a fight 
touched off by a german demand for nato to enter into early talks 
with the sovietled warsaw pact on reducing shortrange nuclear 
arms in europe 
the united states and britain had opposed immediate bargaining 
on those weapons arguing that the alliance should first focus its 
attention on slashing conventional or nonnuclear arms in europe 
the compromise formula worked out by the foreign ministers in a 
postmidnight skull session links the start of shortrange missile 
talks to completion of a conventional arms treaty it also 
stipulates that no nuclear missiles would be pulled out until the 
conventional reductions were completed 
even before the ministers fashioned their negotiating strategy 
european officials said the bush troop initiative had made it 
easier to resolve the missile dispute 
the sting is out of the problem said dutch prime minister 
ruud lubbers it is not of the same urgency any more 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney urged the other allies to 
back the bush proposals and turn them over to nato experts to flesh 
out over the next 60 to 90 days 
the plans would then be put down on the negotiating table at the 
conventional arms talks between nato and the sevennation warsaw 
pact the bargaining which began in early march in vienna covers 
an area spanning the atlantic ocean to the ural mountains in the 
soviet union 
spanish foreign minister franciso fernandez ordonez said bush 
had given a fresh push to those discussions 
this proposal he said would reduce the possibility of a 
surprise attack by the warsaw pact 
a senior administration official briefing reporters under cloak 
of anonymity said the response was even warmer than anything we 
had reason to expect 
in moscow the soviet news agency tass said the american offer 
came from a bush administration under serious criticism from the 
public for the lack of any disarmament initiatives at a time when 
the soviet union has launched a peace offensive 
bush called for washington and moscow to agree to trim their 
troops stationed in europe to 275000 on each side 
this would amount to a 20 percent cut in us combat troops in 
europe reducing overall us troop strength by about 10 percent 
there are about 150000 us combat troops in europe and more than 
150000 support personnel 
the soviets have an estimated 625000 troops in eastern and 
central europe gorbachev has already offered to cut to 350000 and 
proposed equal ceilings of nato and warsaw pact forces of 135 
million 
bush also called on the kremlin to make good on a recent 
gorbachev proposal to set ceilings on conventional arms 20000 
tanks 28000 armored troop carriers and 16500 to 24000 artillery 
pieces the precise number depending on how those weapons are 
defined 
according to nato the west has 16424 main battle tanks and the 
warsaw pact has 51500 heavy tanks with announced cuts to reduce 
that number to 39500 
the president also pressed for reductions in combat airplanes 
and helicopters to levels 15 percent below the current nato levels 
or about 5440 for each side 
all equipment that was pulled back would be destroyed 
the french and the british western europes only nuclear 
powers immediately said they would resist any attempt to include 
their dualcapable aircraft which can fire both conventional and 
nuclear weapons in the bush arms plan

<TEXT>
with one stroke president bush has cut 
through years of handwringing over soviet troop levels 
but problems remain because it is still difficult to determine 
who has how many troops airplanes and artillery and where they all 
are 
even so bush won wide allied endorsement at the nato summit 
meeting here monday for his fourpart conventional arms reduction 
proposal 
i congratulate him on this farsighted step with which he has 
once more impressively affirmed the united states leadership 
said west german chancellor helmut kohl who has clashed bitterly 
with the united states on the issue of nuclear arms 
bush wants the conventional arms talks between nato and the 
warsaw pact in vienna put on the fast track in fact he wants a 
treaty signed in six to 12 months and implemented by 1993 at the 
latest 
that is faster than even some enthusiastic supporters of the 
plan think possible 
former us arms control director ralph earle praised the 
initiative but called bushs timetable overly optimistic 
earle who negotiated the 1979 strategic arms limitation treaty 
with the soviet union predicted the vienna talks would take at 
least two years to reach fruition 
for 15 difficult years east and west debated a cutback in 
central europe they gave up in despair earlier this year 
primarily because of disagreements over how many troops the soviets 
had in the region 
now nato and the warsaw pact are working on a larger canvas 
the vast expanse of europe from the atlantic ocean to the ural 
mountains in the soviet union 
bush proposed ceilings of 275000 troops each for the americans 
and soviets he didnt touch upon the problems of verification 
in another extraordinary turnabout the president also proposed 
reductions in combat aircraft and helicopters which had been 
excluded from the vienna talks at the insistence of some nato 
members 
that raises a mindboggling problem how to tell which planes 
are designed for attack and which are sheerly defensive 
a senior us official asked about the switch said look 
any time you change a position in a negotiation youre going to be 
vulnerable to the accusation that the reasons you had for the 
earlier position are now undercut 
but he said the reason for the initial resistance to cutting 
back on planes and helicopters is that they were designed to 
destroy soviet tanks an area where the soviets had a vast edge 
now with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev agreeing to 
accept equal ceilings of 20000 tanks the planes mission was 
dwindling he said 
we never said never on aircraft the official said we 
said later 
nonetheless britain and france demanded their attack planes be 
excluded from the bush proposal because they are dualcapable 
meaning they can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons 
another headache was posed when gorbachev and then bush threw 
artillery pieces into the mix 
the two sides count differently the soviets tend to include 
smaller artillery pieces than nato does 
arms negotiator earle said he would not be surprised if 
gorbachev tried to include naval forces in the vienna talks too 
because there the western alliance has an edge that he said 
could be an additional problem

despite the weeks of political turmoil in the 
peoples republic of china a band of peace corps volunteers is 
embarking on an intensive training program that will place corps 
workers in a communist nation for the first time 
were proceeding as planned were quite optimistic says 
james c flanigan spokesman for the peace corps the corps is 
celebrating today with an orientalstyle ceremony to mark the 
beginning of the intensive study program on the american university 
campus in washington flanigan said 
guests from the chinese embassy are to attend and the event is 
to be filmed by chinese television flanigan said the ceremony 
marks the end of a more than fouryear effort including sometimes 
intense confidential negotiations to bring the us program to 
china 
our presence is definitely a sign of transition in the 
uschina relationship in the 1970s we were reviled in china as 
an imperialistic agency flanigan said 
as the chinese aspired to impress lesserdeveloped nations 
during those years the american volunteer agency bore the brunt of 
a chinese propaganda attack in an attempt to blunt the us effort 
in asia radio china broadcast attacks against the peace corps 
condemning the workers as agents for the cia 
relations improved after president nixons historic trip to 
beijing in 1972 but it wasnt until election night 1984 that the 
subject of a trial run for the corps was suggested by the chinese 
chinese officials had been invited to watch a broadcast of the 
us election returns at the great wall hotel in beijing a chinese 
official approached an american official saying there was interest 
in the peace corps program 
this is the first such program in a communist country and 
were very hopeful that it will be a relationship that is a 
longterm one flanigan said 
although the chinese initially asked for some 800 volunteers it 
was decided that the emphasis should be on quality program over 
a large number of volunteers flanigan said 
the chinese have requested english teachers for the trial run 
and if both sides find the twoyear program satisfactory other 
types of volunteers in health agriculture or other technical 
fields might be used the spokesman said 
some 23 volunteers have been chosen for the training program 
which includes three months of study in language culture and 
technical arts by midaugust 20 of the trainees will head for the 
heart of the middle kingdom chengdu in sichuan province where 
they will teach english at three colleges and two universities 
flanigan said the group is composed of a variety of americans 
ranging from some chineseamericans to a cuban american and even a 
former college president the spokesman noted that the program set 
up to prepare for the chinese entry was different in that the 
trainees had their tutoring in america 
usually the peace corps trains its volunteers in the host 
country in order to ease their transition and better their language 
skills flanigan noted that despite the demonstrations and 
political uncertainty that has gripped china in recent weeks the 
trainees have several months to prepare and by then things may 
shake down a little 
the chinese are eager to have english teachers in order to help 
push forward with deng xiopings modernization program flanigan 
said the corps has received no indications from china that the 
program would not move forward

the years seem to run together for sara keren 
a vendor who for eight years has made a living snapping pictures of 
tourists who pose on pennsylvania avenue next to a cutout of the 
president 
keren sitting on a chair next to a cardboard of president bush 
said she sells about 10 photos a day a figure that has remained 
constant for years so when told official statistics show tourism 
in the nations capital is sagging she added with a hint of 
surprise i had no idea i really havent noticed any difference 
from last year to this year but i hardly ever do 
figures compiled by the smithsonian institution and the national 
park service indicate that tourism is down in washington during the 
first four months of 1989 compared with that period last year 
officials put the blame on everything from the weather to the rise 
in crime 
tom mack president of tourmobile the company under contract 
with the federal government to conduct tours on the mall and 
arlington national cemetery conceded that the increased homicide 
rate in the district of columbia could be a factor the homicide 
toll stands at a record 189 so far this year compared with 122 at 
this time last year 
id like to think all the rain weve had was the biggest 
reason for the downturn but this is not to say im not concerned 
about the criminal behavior in washington he said but i cant 
see that its any worse than say new york or philadelphia 
the smithsonians most popular museum air and space reported 
400000 fewer tourists from january through april a drop of 15 
percent compared with those months last year in all an estimated 
72 million visitors strolled through smithsonian museums in the 
first four months of 1989 compared with 82 million a year earlier 
but officials at the smithsonian are not panicking the 1989 
figures are higher than those registered in a similar period in 
1984 through 1987 
the dropoff in 1989 could just be part of the normal range 
said smithsonian spokeswoman linda st thomas a million here or 
there is certainly no cause for alarm and compared to 1987 were 
right up there 
smithsonian figures show 79 million visitors flocked to the 
institutions 14 museums in the first four months of 1984 the 
figure dipped to 63 million in 1985 jumped to 68 million the 
following year then crept up to 71 million in 1987 before peaking 
last year 
yes 1988 was a boom year said mack remember last year 
was the hottest warmest and driest year in recent memory 
ms st thomas figures the 1988 totals were helped along by the 
opening of several notable exhibits while this years attendance 
was hampered by the closing of two museums the castle building and 
the freer gallery of art as added evidence to support the idea 
that tourism in the nations capital is alive and well ms st 
thomas said 77 school tours were booked for the air and space 
museum in april of this year compared with 29 last year 
still theres no arguing that the overall numbers are lower 
and not just at smithsonian exhibits the park service said there 
were 59 percent fewer visitors at the lincoln memorial and 
decreases of 13 percent at the vietnam memorial and 39 percent at 
the jefferson memorial this year 
mack said his figures were down 24 percent over the first four 
months of 1989 compared with last year but like ms st thomas 
he was hardly discouraged 
thats well within the acceptable range he said im not 
terribly concerned 
mack cited abominable weather as the chief culprit to the 
downswing 
records at the national weather service showed more than 10 more 
days of rain or snow measuring more than 001 inch this year 
compared with the first four months of 1988

the senate plans to rework a 37 billion 
domestic spending bill this week a politically difficult act that 
would take center stage except for the leadership struggle among 
house democrats 
the spending bill took two months for the house to finish and is 
under a white house veto threat because of its drug spending 
proposals work on the measure is likely to provoke disputes over 
the federal deficit fuel housesenate rivalries and focus 
attention on 1990 politics 
but despite those attentiongrabbing elements most eyes will 
doubtless be riveted instead on the travails of house speaker jim 
wright lawmakers struggling over the bill will find themselves in 
the position of vaudevillians following the animal act 
wright dtexas is expected by many to step down this week his 
35year congressional career sunk by ethics allegations over his 
personal finances jockeying among democrats hoping to move up on 
the partys leadership ladder is already consuming time in the 
house 
the spending is a priority because it contains money for 
programs for the 1989 fiscal year which lasts until sept 30 it 
includes 12 billion for veterans health care benefit increases 
and other department of veterans affairs programs as well as for 
college student loans foster care efforts united nations 
peacekeeping activities refugee assistance and other initiatives 
the measure contains nearly twice as much money as president 
bush sought when he sent a 22 billion version of the bill to 
capitol hill in march bushs advisors say the legislation is too 
costly considering a federal deficit expected to reach about 160 
billion this year 
but most controversial of all is 822 million the house 
shoehorned into the measure for new law enforcement officials 
additional prison cells counseling and other antidrug programs 
house democrats with an eye to surveys showing the public 
thinks illicit drugs are americas worst problem argued that the 
money would finance a war on drugs that bush has merely talked 
about 
republicans said the provision simply threw money at a problem 
that is already adequately financed the republicans complained 
that democrats were merely trying to put them in the embarrassing 
position of voting in opposition to a more muscular federal effort 
against drug dealers 
but according to congressional aides who asked to not be 
identified the senate version of the bill will probably not 
include the drug money lawmakers in that chamber think they have a 
deal with the white house on a bill the president would sign 
lacking the drug funds but containing more money than bush has so 
far supported 
sen dennis deconcini dariz plans an effort to insert some 
antidrug spending anyway his office said friday 
the senate may also try to insert spending priorities of its own 
into the bill senate appropriations committee chairman robert 
byrd dwva may try to find 66 million for a program that 
subsidizes air carriers serving small communities and 75 million 
to replace a giant radio telescope that crumbled last november 
on the other side of the capitol the house may consider 
legislation aimed at putting conditions on a 7 billion deal for 
japan to construct a new generation fighter plane with the help of 
american technology 
the senate approved the deal two weeks ago after voting to limit 
japans ability to bolster its aerospace industry by using the 
advanced us jet engine technology 
last week the house foreign affairs committee voted for

railroads have long been able to set their own 
safety standards and a railroad engineer doesnt even need a 
drivers license but federal authorities are rewriting the rules 
of the rail 
ordered by congress to take several steps to improve rail 
safety the federal railroad administration already has extended 
its authority over individual railroad employees increased fines 
for safety violations required more testing and certification of 
train control equipment mandated automatic train controls on some 
lines and imposed tough punishment for tampering with safety 
devices 
most of the actions arise from the railroad safety improvement 
act of 1988 which was prompted largely by the jan 4 1987 
collision between an amtrak train and three conrail freight 
locomotives at chase md that killed 16 people and hurt 175 
others 
conrail engineer ricky gates who has become a symbol for many 
of the industrys problems is serving a fiveyear prison term for 
manslaughter after admitting he smoked marijuana shortly before the 
crash and violated several safety procedures 
congress is working on mandatory drugtesting bills for railroad 
employees and the supreme court in march upheld postaccident 
testing an administration order requiring random drug testing is 
being challenged in the courts 
still to come from the railroad administration are several other 
rules related to safety the most controversial are a national 
licensing program for engineers and plans to impose federal 
standards for railhighway crossing signals 
federal safety officials reported last week that rail crossing 
fatalities increased 10 percent last year to 689 while other 
highway accidents went up less than 1 percent from 1987 other 
railrelated fatalities decreased from 616 to 564 
the association of american railroads opposes new standards for 
rail crossings saying only one of 2857 crossing accidents last 
year was due to a faulty signal 
licensing required in the 1988 law has caused concern in the 
industry partly because the railroad administration has given no 
hint of what it might include or how it could affect 78000 
engineers and other train crew members on the nations nearly 500 
railroads 
the coast guard licenses ships captains anyone who flies has 
to be certified by the federal aviation administration and 
everyone from a commercial truck driver to a kid with a moped needs 
a state drivers license 
but railroads always have been allowed to set their own 
standards for training and hiring and they like it that way 
were terribly terribly interested and the fra has been 
very very closedmouthed about this issue said jack buckingham 
safety director for the american association of railroads which 
says the nations railroads have adequate standards for engineers 
fra officials said the governments licensing plans will not be 
disclosed until the rule is issued early next month it will not 
become law until after a comment period and public hearing 
the rail safety act requires the agency to set minimum training 
standards and to consider an applicants automobile driving record 
in issuing an engineers license drunken driving convictions 
within the past five years could lead to denial of an engineers 
license unless the applicant had completed a rehabilitation program 
buckingham said railroads follow fairly uniform standards for 
hiring and training engineers and any federal licensing program 
should be based on existing programs run by the largest railroads 
chicago northwestern which has about 950 engineers will start 
to train its 100th class this week said spokesman fred bloedorn 
he said the fiveweek course includes classroom instruction on 
operating rules safety and equipment followed by work in a 
locomotive simulator 
burlington northern has a simulator in chicago that spokesman 
mike wenninger said can make an inexperienced rider sick from the 
motion a trainee can feel the jolt of cars taking up the slack as 
brakes are applied and a movie screen shows actual track the 
railroad uses he said 
conrail with 9000 train and engine employees makes 700000 
spot checks annually to ensure the railroad is run safely and 
requires its employees to take a class on operating procedures and 
pass a written exam each year according to spokesman don 
holloschutz 
tom watts a union pacific vice president said he is concerned 
that the licensing requirements meet the needs of an industry where 
rail conditions vary much of engineers training involves getting 
to know the track they will ride he said 
we dont take a guy off the street and make him a mountain 
engineer watts said

the egg industry is not exactly humpty dumpty 
but it is trying to put itself back together after having a great 
fall the last two years because of rising costs and declining 
consumer demand 
so far in 1989 according to the agriculture department prices 
are up from a year ago and profits are gradually returning to the 
beleaguered egg industry but analysts say the future could be 
shaky 
producers have cut back laying flocks significantly to reduce 
losses and help boost prices and department economists say the 
reductions have had an impact 
in the first quarter of 1989 egg production was down 5 percent 
from a year ago the us laying flock in april was down more than 
3 percent including a 5 percent reduction in the number of hens 
that lay table eggs and a 4 percent increase in the flock that 
produces hatching eggs 
wholesale prices for large eggs averaged 79 cents per dozen in 
the first quarter well above the 55 cents of januarymarch last 
year although prices have dropped since peaking at 99 cents in 
midmarch theyre expected to be relatively strong through the 
remainder of the year 
but a few months of profit dont necessarily put the egg 
industry back on track says economist lee a christensen of the 
departments economic research service one reason is the outlook 
for egg consumption 
per capita egg consumption dropped by about five eggs last year 
and is expected to decline another nine eggs to about 235 in 1989 
christensen writing in a new report said the continuing 
downward trend in egg consumption can be attributed to a number of 
factors including health concerns about cholesterol and negative 
publicity linking eggs with outbreaks of salmonella enteritidis 
a type of food poisoning 
in 1988 total egg production was estimated at 579 billion 
dozen about the same as in 1987 but the value of production 
declined 38 percent to 306 billion from 318 billion the year 
before 
california continued as the leading egg producer with 643 
million dozen valued at 298 million a decline of 26 million dozen 
eggs and almost 10 million in value from 1987 
overall the us egg industrys net returns in 1988 as compiled 
by the usda agency showed the greatest losses since 1975 
christensen reported 
financial losses forced some producers out of the egg 
business he said while net returns are improving in 1989 the 
industry faces continual adjustments associated with declining 
consumer demand some firms will contract in size or quit the 
industry others will expand in anticipation of longrun 
opportunities 
per capita egg consumption has declined steadily since the end 
of world war ii but population growth and the per capita 
consumption of products that contain eggs as ingredients have kept 
the decline from becoming even sharper 
christensen said that the production of table eggs total 
output minus eggs for hatching declined 86 percent to 44 
billion dozen in 1988 from 48 billion dozen in 1960 
during the same period total annual egg consumption declined to 
about 243 eggs per person in 1988 from 320 in 1960 that included 
an increase in the per capita consumption of eggs in the form of 
egg products a rise to 46 eggs in 1988 from 29 in 1960 
egg product consumption changed little during the 1960s and 
climbed only slowly through the 1970s christensen said since 
1980 however it has jumped 33 percent reflecting expansions in 
use in manufacturing a number of food products such as pasta and 
cakes and in hotel restaurant and institutional uses 
christensen examined a number of marketing possibilities that 
egg people may choose to consider 
more attention to all facets of marketing may offer greater 
profit opportunities by transforming eggs as much as possible 
from a commodity product to a branded labeled premium product 
he said industry experiences show that attention to customer 
service market research product development innovation and 
advertising have contributed to successful development and 
marketing efforts by some egg producers 
christensen said a survey has shown egg size is important to 
customers along with a preference for buying eggs by the dozen 
rather than weight while the onedozen carton was identified as 
the most convenient producers who offer split packs a sixegg 
carton and multiple dozen packs have some advantage 
the recognition of demographic trends such as the rise in the 
number of aging americans the increased number of women in the 
work force and the growing importance of ethnic markets are other 
factors to be considered

once again george bush was a campaigner working 
the crowds and no matter that the hands he grasped along the rope 
line werent voters but american priests and nuns at the vatican 
italian townspeople at a playground wall in nettuno 
the habit is unshakeable the technique universal 
god bless america sang about 120 americans studying in rome 
after their audience with the president in a 16th century hall in 
the vatican palace he smilingly checked his watch as their 
applause ran long what a neat welcome thank you bush told 
them 
it was that kind of memorial day weekend for president bush at 
home abroad the heavy duty of his first presidential mission to 
europe was before him in brussels at nato summit talks that wound 
up today bonn and london lie ahead before he flies home on friday 
but first there was time for a hectic roman holiday weekend and 
bush rushed through it smiling waving shaking italian hands 
american hands leavening the formalities and conferences with 
outings he clearly found fun 
he spent an hour on saturday with pope john paul ii they 
exchanged the standard formal statements and the bush white house 
squeezed in more people than there were vatican chairs to make 
certain the devout roman catholics in the presidential entourage 
shared the papal greeting everybody sat as ordained by protocol 
three people to two chairs toward the end of the line 
once in similar audience president reagan had drowsed off 
during a lengthy papal statement perhaps mindful of such risks 
the vatican kept this one brief 
bush presented john paul ii a sterling silver tray engraved with 
the presidents name and office routine nothing to rival 
president lyndon b johnsons present to john pauls predecessor 
a bust of lbj 
the bush gift came from the three trunkloads of presents stowed 
in the white house luggage for ceremonies in four capitals and at 
the nato summit where leaders of 16 atlantic allies conferred 
rome came first since as bush tritely noted all roads lead 
there all roads were traffic jammed while he was in town wheeling 
from meeting to meal to memorial in a motorcade two dozen cars 
long with police helicopters hovering above 
security was tight but not tight enough to keep youthful 
rightists from blocking the motorcade for a few minutes in nettuno 
near the world war ii beachhead of anzio about 20 of them 
pigpiled into the road ahead of the bush caravan on the way to a 
sunday mass at a tiny medieval church a block from the 
mediterranean sea it wasnt much of an episode but the whole 
cavalcade did stall for the better part of five minutes close by 
the ghostbusters pizzeria while italian police cleared the street 
arresting at least four of the demonstrators 
the bushes went on to church to a mass conducted in italian in 
a church that seated fewer than 100 among the fading frescoes when 
the collection basket came around bush had a 20 bill ready a 
translator helped explain the italian litany no translation was 
needed as the parishioners applauded then clapped in rhythmic 
unison as the bushes left through a small door beside the altar 
saturday evening at the vatican bush found himself ahead of 
schedule and decided hes like to make an unannounced visit to an 
italian cafe before the italian state dinner that was not popular 
with security men and it was scrubbed 
but next day bush got his spontaneity system working he 
stopped his motorcade in nettuno and climbed a grassy bank to shake 
hands with 100 or so people at a playground wall it looks like 
hes running for mayor of nettuno said secretary of state james 
a baker iii who can sense such things having managed bushs 
campaigns 
then with 10 minutes notice he took his helicopter out to the 
uss guadalcanal a helicopter carrier anchored 2 miles offshore 
surprise visit captain he said returning a salute from capt 
john mckay of virginia beach va that it was when the president 
and mrs bush went below deck they encountered a sailor who had 
just stepped from the shower and was wearing only a towel 
bush flew on to brussels and the western summit on sunday after 
telling american diplomats in rome that he knows what a headache a 
visiting president can be 
i have been on the receiving end when i served in china 
the receiving end of a visit from a president of the united states 
and i know what its like a pluperfect pain

republicans have a clear lead over the 
democrats so far in the critical contest to recruit strong 
candidates for 1990 senate races 
democrats control the senate with a 5545 majority a narrow 
enough margin to make each contested seat the object of intense 
struggle 
the democrats efforts to widen their majority suffered another 
setback friday when former presidential nominee walter f mondale 
announced he would not challenge gop sen rudy boschwitz 
its a lot easier deciding when to get into politics as 
opposed to when to leave the former vice president told a news 
conference that dashed the hopes of democrats that he would take on 
boschwitz 
i certainly do have a sense of relief said boschwitz who 
has raised more than 1 million for his reelection campaign and 
appears unlikely to face a serious challenge 
a poll taken for mondale had shown him leading boschwitz by 9 
points 
it was the second time in eight days the democrats saw their 
dreams of capturing a gop senate seat slip away 
on may 18 sen nancy kassebaum rkan announced she would 
seek a third term the senator had once said she would retire after 
two terms and her announcement came after prolonged speculation 
that she would stick to that plan kassebaum is regarded as 
unbeatable 
the year started shakily for the republicans when sens gordon 
humphrey of new hampshire and william armstrong of colorado 
announced they wouldnt run for reelection 
even without humphrey on the ballot the democrats are given 
little chance of breaking the republican hold on the voters of new 
hampshire 
rep ben nighthorse campbell looked like the best democratic 
candidate to bid for armstrongs seat but he surprised colorado 
democrats by announcing he would not run 
by contrast with democratic disappointments the republicans 
have rep tom tauke their strongest potential candidate already 
running hard against sen tom harkin of iowa 
in addition rep claudine schneider looks virtually certain to 
challenge democratic sen claiborne pell of rhode island an 
extremely popular liberal republican with a strong environmental 
record schneider passed up a chance to challenge pell in 1984 but 
this time she gives every sign of being ready to take on the 
70yearold chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
win or lose schneider is by far the best candidate the 
republicans could field 
another republican woman who is strongly considering a senate 
race is rep lynn martin of illinois who would challenge 
democratic sen paul simon 
martin recently formed an exploratory committee and republicans 
hope voters became disenchanted with simon after his unsuccessful 
bid for the 1988 democratic presidential nomination 
democrats are still hoping that gov gerald baliles of virginia 
whose term expires this year will decide to challenge gop sen 
john warner 
while the republicans can claim a few more recruitment successes 
than the democrats they appear unlikely to field viable candidates 
against such democrats as sens albert gore jr of tennessee bill 
bradley of new jersey sam nunn of georgia joseph biden of 
delaware and david pryor of arkansas 
on the republican side safe incumbents appear to be thad 
cochran of mississippi william cohen of maine pete domenici of 
new mexico phil gramm of texas james mcclure of idaho and alan 
simpson of wyoming

vice president dan quayle laid a wreath at the 
tomb of the unknowns two soviet veterans paid their respects at 
the vietnam memorial and thousands of people flocked to the capital 
to honor americas war dead 
almost perfect weather with clear blue skies temperatures in 
the 80s and a gentle breeze served as backdrop to the 120th 
memorial day services at arlington national cemetery where 200000 
veterans are buried each tombstone marked by an american flag for 
the holiday 
on a smaller scale eight wreaths at the vietnam memorial 
honored the women who died in that conflict 
in brief somber ceremonies at the tomb of the unknowns quayle 
placed the wreath of flowers before the four graves each 
representing unidentified casualties from world war i world war 
ii the korean war and the vietnam war 
the observance began with a 19gun artillery salute a drummer 
from the us army band sounded four muffled ruffles followed by a 
bugler blowing taps and then 30 seconds of silence 
addressing more than 5000 people many in shorts and tshirts 
quayle called the war dead our nations true heroes the solid 
pillars upon which our freedom rests 
the national cemetery is the resting place for americans for 
whom the words duty honor and country are not just a phrase they 
were a way of life said quayle whose military record became the 
subject of controversy last year because he had avoided serving in 
the vietnam war by joining the indiana national guard in the late 
1960s 
across the potomac river in the shadows of the lincoln memorial 
several thousand vietnam veterans mingled and talked about 
americas most recent war some have made the trip to the vietnam 
veterans memorial each memorial day since the monument a 
chevronshaped wall with the names of 58156 war dead and missing 
in action etched in its black granite was dedicated in 1982 
the monument which has become the most popular in washington 
attracts more than 36 million visitors a year according to the 
national park service 
this memorial day the ceremony was aimed at honoring the women 
who died in vietnam eight wreaths were placed at locations where 
the names of eight women casualties of the war are etched into 
the wall 
veterans who were influential in getting the monument built 
reminded the audience that most vietnam veterans returned from the 
war zone to a country that was at best indifferent and at times 
hostile 
our nation can never again abandon our soldiers declared 
ronald gibbs a member of the vietnam veterans memorial fund board 
of directors if we must send our youth off to battle lets 
stand by them to the end with moral conviction and support 
among the thousands of visitors to the vietnam veterans memorial 
on monday were a soviet general who fought in world war ii and a 
veteran of the soviet fighting in afghanistan 
lt gen vladamir orlov chief of a world war ii veterans group 
in the soviet union and mikhail vishnyakov a veteran of the 
fighting in afghanistan marveled at the impact of the vietnam 
memorial 
the two even traced some of the names according to john 
wheeler a vietnam veteran who helped arrange the visit 
the soviet unions military struggle in afghanistan from which 
the country was forced to withdraw after years of fighting has 
been compared to the us military involvement in vietnam 
the soviet union provided supplies and weapons to the north 
vietnamese and viet cong during the vietnam war

students at community and junior colleges will 
be encouraged to transfer to fouryear institutions under a project 
directed at minority and lowincome students 
the first part of the 12 million 18month project due to 
start in september will pair 25 twoyear institutions with 
fouryear colleges and universities 
the partner schools will collaborate on projects such as 
redesigning courses to make credits transferable developing 
faculty exchange programs and creating pilot programs for twoyear 
students with potential to transfer 
the program was announced monday by its two sponsors the 
american council on education and the ford foundation 
there are about 1250 twoyear community and junior colleges in 
the country many of them serving heavy concentrations of 
minorities and poor students said project director judith eaton 
president of the community college of philadelphia 
she said the transfer rate to fouryear colleges is estimated at 
between 6 percent and 20 percent though some surveys have found 
that 70 percent or more of students at the twoyear institutions 
say when asked that they want to go on to earn a bachelors degree 
often what passes for collaboration is simply a paper 
agreement said alison bernstein of the ford foundation 
students are always in danger of losing time and losing credit 
and taxpayers are in danger of losing money because two and 
fouryear colleges havent come to an agreement 
eaton and bernstein said at a news conference that community 
colleges grew on a wave of interest in career education in the 
1970s when enrollment leveled off in the 1980s they said 
questions arose as to their effectiveness particularly with regard 
to minority and lowincome students 
nearly half the nations 2 million minority college students 
attend twoyear institutions one in six students entering a 
twoyear college in fall 1988 was from a family with earnings under 
15000 compared with one in 10 of the entering freshmen at 
fouryear institutions 
we became so obsessed with access issues that we lost sight of 
retention and graduation issues said robert atwell president of 
the ace an umbrella group for 1700 educational institutions and 
associations the ford foundation is a private philanthropic group 
that sponsors research 
other phases of the aceford project scheduled to follow the 
partnership experiments involve finding ways to encourage 
transfers through federal policy and holding regional meetings to 
discuss how different types of colleges and universities can 
encourage transfers of minority and lowincome students

the bush administration and congress have 
worked out a tentative agreement aimed at continuing us military 
aid to el salvador while taking into account congressional concerns 
about a rightist resurgence in that central american country us 
officials say 
much of the concern stems from a reported increase in human 
rights abuses in el salvador at a time when moderate president jose 
napoleon duarte is preparing to surrender power to the leader of 
the rightist arena party alfredo cristiani 
cristiani was elected in a landslide on march 19 and will be 
sworn in on thursday ending the rule of perhaps the most 
proamerican president in the hemisphere a man who was able to 
coax billions of us aid dollars from congress but was unable to 
achieve peace 
the bush administration fought hard to oppose moves in congress 
for sharp cutbacks in aid to el salvador but democrats were able 
to extract some concessions during lengthy negotiations with state 
department officials according to congressional and administration 
sources 
human rights watch a private monitoring group calls the 
situation in el salvador deeply troubling but the 
administrations case for continued military aid was strengthened 
by what officials regard as indisputable evidence that cuba and 
nicaragua have been increasing arms shipments to leftist guerrillas 
in el salvador 
president bush went public with that allegation earlier this 
month but sandinista officials in nicaragua called his charges 
unfounded and irrational 
in talks with the congress the administration wanted an 
increase to 97 million annually in military aid for the next two 
fiscal years but had to settle for 85 million the same figure as 
this year 
congressional negotiators also wrested from the administration a 
pledge to report at sixmonth intervals on the progress being made 
in el salvador on protection of human rights the prosecution of 
death squad members and a negotiated settlement to the countrys 
nineyear old civil war 
assuming the money is appropriated later this year congress 
could not block military aid funds even if there is no progress on 
any of these objectives 
but if the state department continued sending military aid in 
the face of strong congressional opposition it would put the 
administration in an extremely difficult position said one 
us official asking not to be identified 
in that circumstance the official predicted that congress would 
extract revenge on the administration once the twoyear aid 
cycle is up 
cristiani a useducated businessman has made a highly 
favorable impression on members of congress since his election 
nonetheless there is considerable restiveness among house 
democrats about other influential arena party chieftains who are 
widely reported to have ties with rightist death squads and who 
believe us concerns about human rights are inhibiting the war 
effort against the marxist guerrillas 
to charges that he is a mere front man for party factions 
aligned with death squads cristiani says there should be no 
doubt that it is i who will be running the government 
the congressional unease also stems from what many lawmakers 
regard as the meager returns from more than 35 billion in us 
aid to el salvador since the early 1980s el salvadors civil war 
has claimed more than 70000 lives and there is no end in sight 
el salvador has enjoyed a free ride with the american 
taxpayers footing the bill says sen tom harkin diowa by 
most standards us policy has failed the test 
cristiani has said he will offer the rebels terms for a peace 
settlement but will increase military pressure if they refuse

members of a new independent labor union said 
tuesday that police arrested three of their leaders the latest 
sign the government was getting tough with nonstudent participants 
in the prodemocracy movement 
about 1000 students and workers gathered outside police 
headquarters near tiananmen square to protest the reported 
arrests the public security bureau said it had no knowledge of the 
arrests 
union members carried a banner reading do not secretly arrest 
people let the people know worker representatives who entered 
the building to ask about the three men said police refused to 
acknowledge the arrests 
police also told them the demonstration was illegal and that 
they intended to clear the area police with video cameras filmed 
demonstrators who said they would not leave 
earlier students at the square unveiled a 33foothigh 
goddess of democracy statue inspiring some to pursue their 
sitin while others prepared to leave the square to seek new focus 
for the 6weekold movement 
zhao pinglu head of the beijing independent workers union 
said police monday grabbed one union leader a 27yearold official 
with the national airlines and two others both ministry of 
railways employees disappeared and were assumed to have been 
arrested 
the independent trade union claims 3000 members it was formed 
may 19 in defiance of a government ban on all but the official all 
china federation of trade unions 
party hardliners who have wrested control in a power struggle 
touched off by the student protests have taken the line that the 
students are wellintentioned but that nonstudents who are 
misleading them will be punished 
workers who joined demonstrations or supported the movement are 
being fined or having their pay docked others are being threatened 
with losing their jobs 
hundreds of students from outside beijing said they would return 
home tuesday to spread the word of the students dramatic appeal 
for a freer and more open china 
thousands more pledged to continue their occupation of the 
square begun may 13 until chinas legislature the national 
peoples congress convenes on june 20 about 10000 students now 
are living in a squatters camp on the vast square 
more than 100000 cheering supporters crammed into the central 
square monday night to see the goddess of democracy based on 
the statue of liberty in new york being wheeled in 
students from the central academy of fine arts brought three 
sections of the statue into the square as firecrackers burst 
overhead the statue of a woman in flowing robes holding aloft a 
torch lies on a line between mao tsetungs portrait on the 
entrance to the forbidden city and a monument to revolutionary 
heroes on the square the statue is made of plaster of paris and 
styrofoam 
here is a new symbol for china said a worker at a machine 
tool factory this is even greater than your statue of liberty 
another worker said to an american reporter 
that symbol of unity came as student leaders quarreled over the 
direction of their movement earlier student leaders proposed that 
occupation of the square end tuesday but were overruled by other 
activists including many from outside beijing 
representatives from about 200 schools held a midnight meeting 
monday but failed to iron out differences 
one student leader said they agreed on four demands that the 
may 20 declaration of martial law in beijing be rescinded that all 
troops in the beijing suburbs be removed that there be no 
retribution against students and that the staterun press report 
honestly on their movement 
however some argued these should be conditions for leaving the 
square while others said they should be prerequisites for opening 
talks with the government 
the student leader said most people were against leaving 
tiananmen because at this point no concrete achievement has been 
realized with the government 
the students have been holding regular protests since april 15 
to demand democratic reforms and an end to corruption by officials 
the official peoples daily prominently played a letter from 
seven intellectuals recalling the tragic 196676 cultural 
revolution 
we ask all comrades who in those 10 year of catastrophic 
terror lost loved ones wasted their youth and suffered hardship to 
call on their sense of responsibility to history and society warn 
your sons and loved ones not to allow a repeat of this tragedy of 
history

moderates in the government continued efforts to snuff out the 
democratic movement

government correct mistakes conspirators and bad elements were 
manipulating the students the official xinhua news agency reported

hardline position of senior leader deng xiaoping and premier li 
peng

functionaries are expected to be punished according to chinese

helmets with cartoon stickers or choosing colorful headgear also 
may encourage helmet use it said

with one stroke president bush has cut 
through years of handwringing over soviet troop levels 
but problems remain because it is still difficult to determine 
who has how many troops airplanes and artillery and where they all 
are 
even so bush won wide allied endorsement at the nato summit 
meeting here monday for his fourpart conventional arms reduction 
proposal 
i congratulate him on this farsighted step with which he has 
once more impressively affirmed the united states leadership 
said west german chancellor helmut kohl who has clashed bitterly 
with the united states on the issue of nuclear arms 
bush wants the conventional arms talks between nato and the 
warsaw pact in vienna put on the fast track in fact he wants a 
treaty signed in six to 12 months and implemented by 1993 at the 
latest 
that is faster than even some enthusiastic supporters of the 
plan think possible 
former us arms control director ralph earle praised the 
initiative but called bushs timetable overly optimistic 
earle who negotiated the 1979 strategic arms limitation treaty 
with the soviet union predicted the vienna talks would take at 
least two years to reach fruition 
for 15 difficult years east and west debated a cutback in 
central europe they gave up in despair earlier this year 
primarily because of disagreements over how many troops the soviets 
had in the region 
now nato and the warsaw pact are working on a larger canvas 
the vast expanse of europe from the atlantic ocean to the ural 
mountains in the soviet union 
bush proposed ceilings of 275000 troops each for the americans 
and soviets he didnt touch upon the problems of verification 
in another extraordinary turnabout the president also proposed 
reductions in combat aircraft and helicopters which had been 
excluded from the vienna talks at the insistence of some nato 
members 
that raises a mindboggling problem how to tell which planes 
are designed for attack and which are sheerly defensive 
a senior us official asked about the switch said look 
any time you change a position in a negotiation youre going to be 
vulnerable to the accusation that the reasons you had for the 
earlier position are now undercut 
but he said the reason for the initial resistance to cutting 
back on planes and helicopters is that they were designed to 
destroy soviet tanks an area where the soviets had a vast edge 
now with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev agreeing to 
accept equal ceilings of 20000 tanks the planes mission was 
dwindling he said 
we never said never on aircraft the official said we 
said later 
nonetheless britain and france demanded their attack planes be 
excluded from the bush proposal because they are dualcapable 
meaning they can carry both conventional and nuclear weapons 
another headache was posed when gorbachev and then bush threw 
artillery pieces into the mix 
the two sides count differently the soviets tend to include 
smaller artillery pieces than nato does 
arms negotiator earle said he would not be surprised if 
gorbachev tried to include naval forces in the vienna talks too 
because there the western alliance has an edge that he said 
could be an additional problem

a young man described by neighbors as a 
yale graduate frustrated by unemployment stabbed his mother and 
three other people to death at his home on memorial day 
authorities said 
rolando marcello 23 was arrested by state police after a high 
speed chase that ended when the suspect left his car and jumped off 
a 40foot bridge in an attempt to elude capture said union county 
prosecutor john h stamler 
two of the victims were marcellos mother anita marcello 51 
and his brother raymond 20 stamler said at a news conference late 
monday 
two others nelson paiva 20 a family friend from neighboring 
union and a mark dennis 36 a neighbor who attempted to stop 
paivas slaying were also killed all four died of multiple stab 
wounds 
another neighbor richard hartmann was in guarded condition at 
overlook hospital in summit 
authorities said that neighbors at a holiday barbeque monday 
afternoon saw marcello chasing paiva with a large knife outside his 
white twostory home in this suburban community about 25 miles west 
of new york city 
janice bongiovanni who lives across the street in the neatly 
kept neighborhood said she first thought it was a joke when he saw 
the man who goes by the name of rolly wrestling on the ground 
with other neighborhood men 
they were on the ground i thought they were fooling around 
until i saw a knife in his hand she said it was a 10inch 
knife it was like a dagger 
she said marcello had hartmann on the ground but the latter got 
away the other man apparently dennis did not 
then rolly ran into the house came out again opened the door 
of the car and said what have i done what have i done she 
said 
mrs bongiovanni said he then drove away in his car while 
clutching a brown garbage bag 
marcello apparently tried to ditch the car and steal a pickup 
truck but could not get it started stamler said he then 
succesfully stole a volkswagen and took off heading west on route 
22 
the high speed chase took them 20 miles to neighboring somerset 
county before marcello abandoned his car and jumped off a highway 
bridge over the lanington river state troopers called 
reinforcements and eventually found him exhausted under a stand of 
trees at about 8 pm 
marcello was described as the oldest son of a family of longtime 
springfield residents originally from the philippines 
neighbors said he had been depressed recently because after 
graduating from yale university with a business degree he had been 
able to work only a short time in an internship with chemical bank 
in new york before illness forced him to drop out the nature of 
the illness was not immediately known 
one neighbor steve galluzzo said the whole family was very 
low key and respectful people 
i think he marcello was depressed he said for a while 
he was at top of his class in yale but when he got out into the 
business world i dont know what happened 
prosecutors confirmed that marcello had attended yale and then 
worked for a time as a commercial loan officer for chemical bank 
stamler and other officials could not say if he had been working 
recently 
it appears that he was unhappy but i dont know if it was over 
his employment stamler said 
mrs bongiovanni said his mother lived with her four sons in the 
same house for about 15 years she said the mother was a nurse at 
newark university hospital and that the father died about 10 years 
ago 
marcello was charged with four counts of murder and one count of 
aggravated assault stamler said he was being held in the union 
county jail pending his arraignment

is it london or londres peking or beijing 
un experts have spent 30 years trying to come up with single 
spellings for geographical names worldwide but they say trying to 
make maps match may be a losing effort 
they struggle through 3000 different languages including about 
250 official ones in their search for uniform names says canadian 
henri dorion chairman of the un group of experts on geographical 
names 
the group held its twiceannual meeting in geneva last week 
before an internationally recognized name for a town can be 
adopted a national standard must be agreed upon that poses 
problems for countries like the soviet union which has about 100 
languages dorion explains 
he accepts that the task will occupy his grandchildrens 
generation and doubts complete standardization will ever be 
achieved 
we recognize that for example the french will continue to 
call london londres and we are not trying to change that but we 
would like to limit the number of different transliterations he 
said 
the experts say their littleknown efforts have yielded 
practical benefits especially in improving communications 
bunny lewis a british member of the group cited a recent 
example in sudan 
if you are engaged in famine relief and you have to collect 
the names of the villages to distribute food and those villages are 
randomly spelled what do you do about it 
the answer is that you make new maps and you arrive at a 
standard way of writing all those names of villages lewis told a 
news conference 
the new romanscript transliteration of chinese adopted by the 
united nations in 1977 has been the most successful dorion said 
the chinese system is on the way to being accepted by 
everybody although we still see some variations such as peking 
more and more we are seeing beijing in everyday usage he said

when youre george bush and you find 
yourself back at your 18th century chateau with 90 minutes to spare 
before the next formal event of the 40th anniversary nato summit 
what do you do 
put on a tshirt and shorts and go jogging around the 
stuyvenberg palace what else 
the american president is two weeks shy of his 65th birthday 
but he still likes to get in a relaxing run whenever he can and 
thats what he did after returning late monday afternoon from five 
hours of talks with his counterparts from the 15 other nato nations 
it may have helped him work up an appetite for the evening 
repast that followed at the val duchesse another palatial estate 
where the menu for what was described as a working dinner included 
lobster salad with sauce au corial and caviar pigeon de bresse en 
cocotte with hearts of artichoke and layered pastries with 
strawberries and raspberries 
the presidents presumably fared better on this score than did 
their prime ministers who canceled their own dinner at the val 
duchesse while working into the wee hours to hammer out a 
compromise on nuclear missile negotiating strategy 
a pool of american reporters allowed in to the val duchesse to 
witness the dinner arrivals found itself cooling its heels 
beforehand at nato headquarters while waiting for nato escorts to 
accompany them to the event in the mansion located in a thickly 
wooded park 
the reporters accustomed to being screened and sped on their 
way to president bushs events by secret service agents found that 
wasnt good enough in brussels as one wrote in a pool report it 
was explained nato security would not allow the secret service to 
sweep us nor allow the us press bus to enter the val duchesse 
grounds 
the white house is not running this nato is the advance

the media were not the only ones subject to stringent security 
for the nato summit 
more than 1300 local and state police have been pressed into 
service to maintain security throughout the belgian capital for the 
twoday summit 
as bush and the leaders of the other 15 alliance nations arrived 
at the sprawling nato complex a helicopter hovered overhead and 
sharpshooters stood atop the lowrise pastelyellow building 
for brussels a city of one million that is also home for the 
12nation european economic community its another summit 
another round of pomp and protection that is now almost commonplace 
here 
if it werent for the odd motorcade whizzing by the brussels 
citizenry would not know a summit was under way 
there are no flags in the streets no banners no bunting and 
certainly no crowds 
in fact when bush and the other leaders lunched monday with 
king baudouin only 200 people bothered to stop in the royal park 
to see what all those limousines were doing in front of their 
monarchs downtown palace across the street 
and what was billed as a big antinato demonstration turned into 
only a small scale protest outside the main nato entrance 
punctuated by the sounds of a dozen drumbeating buddhist monks 
across the street 
not a year passes without brussels hosting an eec or nato summit 
on monday a warm and sunny day security was tightest at the 
nato complex as the summit participants arrived in a quick 
succession of limousines accompanied by hundreds of police 
outriders 
in all some 1600 journalists have converged on brussels to 
cover natos 40th anniversary summit that is grappling with the 
issue of the future of nuclear missiles in europe 
and while eastwest issues may be on many front pages not 
everyone knows what nato is all about 
at the downtown hotel where the summits main press center is 
situated an elderly tourist from baltimore md told a us 
embassy official and im so delighted to hear people speak 
american here 
then pointing to the officials nato summit she added 
ive seen that word nato before what does it mean

where else but in southern california would a 
1950sstyle car wash be deemed a cultural landmark 
the car wash plus a gas station and coffee shop are in the way 
of a developers plans to build a minimall in the san fernando 
valley suburb of studio city 
but when neighbors heard of plans to bulldoze the 28yearold 
car wash which is built around three 55foottall steel girders 
arched in the style of an old mcdonalds outlet they fought back 
last week they persuaded the city cultural heritage commission 
to temporarily block the development while the commission weighs 
arguments that the car wash which doesnt even have a name forms 
the gateway to studio city 
we in the valley want to retain some of our culture and 
heritage said jack mcgrath a political consultant who launched 
the campaign to save the car wash 
the arba group of los angeles plans to demolish the car wash to 
make way for a twostory 15 million shopping center company 
officials refused to comment on the protests last week 
about 100 area residents rallied at the gas station sunday to 
protest the planned demolition 
others in the neighborhood arent sure what to make of the fuss 
its not a cultural monument said resident william griffis 
but it certainly is a handy place to get your car washed

making chocolate or tangerineflavored peanut 
pudding was a snap but peanutbased cheese spread was a tougher 
nut to crack 
food scientists at the university of georgia came up with those 
examples of peanut creativity as part of a governmentsupported 
effort to develop lowcost highprotein foods for the third world 
the foods also are low in saturated fat and cholesterol qualities 
that might sell them to us consumers as well 
and the taste is well quite acceptable dr anna av 
resurreccion associate professor of food science said in a recent 
interview she began developing the products three years ago under 
a grant from the us department of agriculture 
for the peanut pudding resurreccion and her colleagues pressed 
peanut kernels to remove some of the oil and ground up the 
remaining material they added hot water and a coagulating agent to 
get a slab of peanut curd about the consistency of tofu finally 
they mixed in sweeteners and flavorings 
the pudding contains 160 calories per serving but it has 50 
percent protein by weight 10 times as much as a serving of 
milkbased chocolate pudding with the same number of calories 
making peanutbased cheese spread was more complicated uncooked 
peanuts were chopped soaked in warm water and dried slowly to keep 
them from developing the usual flavor of roasted nuts then they 
were ground salted and mixed with commercially available cheese 
flavoring 
the spread has a longer shelf life and twice the protein of 
dairybased products

operators of the seabrook nuclear power 
plant warmed the reactor for its first lowpower testing but 
opponents planned to turn up some heat of their own with a new 
round of mass protests 
the confrontation must come now its never been more 
important said paul gunter a founder of the clamshell alliance 
antinuclear group and veteran of its first sitin at seabrook 13 
years ago thirteen years of opposition have made the issues 
crystal clear and now is really a testing time both for the plant 
and the opposition 
operators began heating the reactor saturday in preparation for 
the first atomic chain reaction expected within seven to 10 days 
the test will be the biggest milestone yet for a plant that is a 
decade behind schedule billions of dollars over budget and a focus 
of the nations antinuclear movement 
the nuclear regulatory commission gave seabrook a lowpower 
license friday the day after a federal appeals court refused to 
block the tests 
meanwhile demonstrators have been meeting with local and state 
police to make final plans for a rally saturday and civil 
disobedience sunday some activists plan to try to climb fences 
surrounding the plant 
edward brown president of new hampshire yankee which operates 
the plant said the planned demonstration will not affect the 
testing 
but critics say the protests will be an important indicator of 
the depth and perserverance of public opposition to seabrook as the 
6 billion plant enters the last stretch of its protracted 
licensing struggle 
i think its real important to show the political leadership 
in this state there is real concern about this project and theyre 
ignoring it at their peril and boy are they ignoring it said 
robert backus who has worked as a lawyer for 17 years for groups 
opposing the plant 
originally planned to start producing electricity in 1979 
seabrook overcame construction permit suspensions job actions and 
financial crises to be completed in july 1986 
the project won nrc approval for tests on may 18 but the 
commission granted a oneweek stay of the license pending a federal 
court review 
last thursday the us circuit court of appeals for the 
district of columbia declined requests to delay the tests the 
license allowing seabrook to conduct tests at up to 5 percent of 
full power was issued friday by the nrcs office of nuclear reactor 
regulation 
the plant must win federal approval for evacuation plans for 
nearby communities before it can operate commercially 
seabrooks opponents say the plant represents health and safety 
risks for people living in crowded beaches and coastal communities 
within 10 miles of the plant massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
and other foes have promised to continue their fight even if it 
means going to the us supreme court 
the water in the nuclear reactors cooling system reached 200 
degrees on monday the reactor must reach 557 degrees expected to 
take five days before preparations can begin to start the nuclear 
chain reaction in the 100 tons of uranium fuel 
everythings going smoothly and as planned seabrook 
spokesman ron sher said we want to conduct lowpower tests as 
soon as possible to make sure there are no adjustments we need to 
make to the plant 
i think that most people see that the plant will be licensed 
and i think that most people agree that its in the regions best 
interests said rob williams another spokesman 
but gunter finds hope in the case of the shoreham nuclear power 
plant on new yorks long island nearly four years after shoreham 
started lowpower tests but before it ever operated commercially 
its owner is on the verge of signing a deal with the state to scrap 
the reactor in return for guaranteed rate increases for the next 
decade 
the clamshell alliance an umbrella organization for regional 
antinuclear groups has organized demonstrations against seabrook 
since construction began in 1976 a may 1977 protest culminated in 
1414 arrests and gained national attention for the antinuclear 
movement 
weve faced many disappointments in this struggle and 
lowpower testing may be another disappointment it will be a point 
of no return for the citizenry of new england gunter said

the leader of an international buddhist 
community is in seclusion seeking guidance from the teachings of 
his 2500yearold religion amid reports he has aids and may have 
spread it among his followers 
church leaders refuse to confirm or deny the allegations 
swirling around osel tendzin a man from new jersey who rose to 
become the leader of a buddhist community or reports that he 
refused to step down 
the 45yearold father of four went last fall into religious 
retreat a traditional buddhist practice meditation he said is 
the best medicine 
tendzin has been vague about the allegations but some buddhists 
in the 3500member vajradhatu community have said he admitted in a 
tape played for them that he is suffering from acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
although the faults of myself and others are the cause of this 
apparent confusion this situation has provided a means for 
purifying whatever negative karma has been accumulated he was 
reported as saying in a jan 17 letter to his followers 
church officials say he is expected to remain in retreat in the 
san diego area at least through the end of the summer 
tendzin is unavailable for comment but remains in touch with 
church officials indirectly martin janowitz a member of the 
vajradhatu board of directors in halifax nova scotia said last 
week 
tenzins followers are uncertain what the future holds as weeks 
and months go by without a word 
one of them john mcclellan said the group is split between 
those who believe tendzin acted in a way unfitting for a group 
like ours but nonetheless feel he has just made mistakes and 
those who think he has gone so far beyond any reasonable standard 
of human behavior that they can no longer practice under his 
direction 
born thomas rich tendzin was raised in passaic nj after 
dropping out of fordham university he met vidyadhara the 
venerable chogyam trungpa in 1971 and became the tibetan buddhist 
leaders top student 
trungpa established vajradhatu at boulder in the 1970s and 
founded the naropa institute an accredited liberal arts college 
combining eastern and western studies vajradhatus headquarters 
later were moved to halifax 
trungpa made a great leap from one culture to another said 
rick fields former editor of a buddhist newspaper and author of a 
history of buddhism in america one of the marks of his genius 
was to meet this culture on its own ground 
the vajradhatu has about 3500 members internationally 
including 800 in boulder its a diverse group of mostly nonasians 
who live normal family lives fields said 
trungpa gave rich the buddhist name osel tendzin which 
translates as radiant holder of the teachings janowitz said 
before he died in 1987 trungpa named tendzin his successor 
reports of tendzins illness began surfacing late last year in 
a dec 22 story the daily camera quoted sources in the boulder 
buddhist community who said tendzin admitted in a tape recording 
that he has aids and may have spread the disease the disease is 
most often spread through sexual intercourse or sharing of tainted 
needles by intravenous drug abusers 
in january the daily camera reported that the vajradhatu board 
asked tendzin to give up his duties for a year but tendzin 
refused saying it would vioilate the oath i took with my guru 
he also indicated that meditation during his retreat may improve 
his health 
tendzins wife lila and their four children have stayed at 
their home in halifax 
many church members have said they feel isolated by the lack of 
communication and the refusal of church leaders to deal with the 
issue fields said he resigned as editor of the communitys 
newspaper because church leaders refused to discuss the problems 
buddhism teaches compassion for all sentient human beings 
there is a feeling of wanting to help clarify the situation 
fields said 
but mcclellan said nobody intends to give up on the practice 
a lot of people are beginning to feel that its time to give up on 
vajradhatu

soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs initial pledge for cuts in 
the level of warsaw pact forces 
murayama also hinted at the possibility of a discount rate hike

a key bank of japan committee is expected to meet tuesday local

hit the mornings high of 144 yen mark 
unless the yens movement gets stable stock market cant 
expect large gains he said 
the majority of market players avoided making major moves 
tuesday before a series of releases of us economic indicators

japans central bank today announced it will raise 
its official discount rate by 075 percentage points to 325 
percent reversing the easy money policy it maintained for almost a 
decade 
the decision which clearly shows the central banks intention 
to combat inflation will also lead to rises in interest and

four nuns who locked themselves in 
a monastery infirmary eight months ago to resist liberalizations in 
their austere lifestyle are frustrated at the vaticans inaction in 
resolving the dispute supporters say 
its been a long time too long betty sutton a spokeswoman 
for the nuns said monday its tiring but theyre still hanging 
in there and holding their own theyre not going to give in 
the four nuns and another sister barricaded themselves in the 
infirmary at the most blessed virgin mary of mount carmel on oct 
4 they said they feared eviction because of their protests against 
a loosening of the cloister regime 
sister john of the cross one of the nuns left the infirmary 
earlier this year because of poor health 
the nuns are tired of waiting for the apostolica signatura the 
vaticans highest court to rule on the dispute said mrs sutton 
a private benefactor who has taken up the nuns cause 
theyve kicked this thing around for almost a year now she 
said were going to start making some phone calls and try to 
light a fire under them 
the vatican has declined to comment on the case 
tim manning a spokesman for the paterson diocese where the 
monastery is located said church officials would allow the nuns to 
remain barricaded until they hear from rome he said he was 
surprised at the length of the dispute but added that 
disagreements within the church are studied carefully before any 
resolution is reached 
my understanding is that their operating procedure is very 
deliberate manning said when they have an answer theyll 
send it but they dont issue progress reports 
the nuns are protesting the decison of their prioress mother 
teresa hewitt to introduce candy and television into the monastery 
the former sister john is one of two nuns whose vows have 
expired during the protest she is now known as nicole prescott 
the other nun the former sister bernadette is known as lynn 
williams 
the other nuns are sister philomena sister teresita romano and

the dollar rose in tokyo today despite intervention 
by the central bank and an increase in the banks official discount 
rate while stock prices declined 
the bank of japan announced today that it will raise its 
discount rate by 075 percentage points to 325 percent effective 
wednesday

yen from mondays closing of 14288 yen after opening higher at 
14375 yen the currency fluctuated wildly between 14220 and 
14400 yen 
traders said the bank of japan sold dollars intermittently in an 
attempt to halt the us currencys further rise agaisnt the yen 
the central bank sold a total of about 1 billion during the day 
they said the bank does not normally comment on its market 
interventions 
mitsuhiko kinugasa a trader with daiwa bank in tokyo said 
trading today was very rough with wide fluctuations 
at around noon market players sold the dollar all at once 
after a rumor that the united states might ease its monetary 
policy which participants thought would lower interst rates he 
said citing the days low of 14220 yen 
but he said the market generally continued to favor 
dollarbuying because the wide interest rate gap between the 
united states and japan is still there 
he said the bank of japans decision to raise its official 
discount rate did not affect the market because it had been 
expected for some time 
dollarselling by some participants for profit taking also 
prompted the afternoon losses he said

was unlikely to cut its discount rate to lower the dollar dealers 
said

which lost 3079 points on monday fell another 8394 points or 
025 percent finishing the day at 3407689

weakness against the dollar 
a trader with a major securities firm who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said trading was directionless due to the reluctance of 
participants to make major moves because of uncertainties over the 
foreign exchange market and discount rate hike

ten us air force personnel were hurt 
and 22 military vehicles damaged when villagers armed with clubs 
and rocks attacked a bombing range to demand the facility be 
closed officials said today 
up to 100 villagers stormed the kooni range south of seoul late 
monday to demand an end to aircraft bombing practice at the range 
said sgt will baker an air force spokesman in seoul 
military guards struggled with attackers who scaled fences and 
attacked them with clubs and rocks he said 
the 10 injured air force men were cut or bruised by rocks and 
flying glass and a korean civilian worker was beaten by the 
attackers air force officials said most of the injuries were 
minor and one airman was briefly hospitalized for injuries they 
said 
the air force staff was ordered to retreat to a dormitory after 
one of the attackers pulled a knife baker said the attackers then 
hurled rocks through windows at the air force personnel he said 
villagers say the range plays havoc with their lives preventing 
them from working in fields during bombing practice and they have 
been demanding the facility be closed the villagers have attacked 
the range several times in recent months but mondays incident 
appeared to be the most serious 
they damaged and overturned trucks and other vehicles and 
ransacked and looted buildings in the ranges administration block 
said baker 
a team of 24 us air force security police was airlifted to the 
range by helicopter from osan air force base to protect the range 
personnel officials said but the security police did not clash 
with the villagers they said 
at no time did the security police engage the intruders 
said master sgt daniel smith of the osan base 
south korean riot police reached the range about two hours after 
the attack began and about 450 troopers drove the villagers out 
after about an hour police officials said twenty villagers were 
arrested they said 
south korean press reports estimated the attackers caused about 
250000 in damages air force officials said damage was extensive 
but they had no figures 
the attack came after villagers were stopped for safety reasons 
from working in fields in the outer area of the range during a 
bombing practice monday officials said farmers are allowed to use 
spare government land on the range 
the attack did not appear to be related to calls by some 
antigovernment groups for the expulsion of us forces from south 
korea dissidents have staged a series of protests to denounce the 
united states for supporting the government of president roh 
taewoo 
about 43000 us troops are based in south korea under a mutual 
defense treaty against communist north korea the us 7th air 
force is based at osan

scores of radical students abandoned a 
fiveday hunger strike today because of exhaustion but about 60 
students said they would continue the protest over the mysterious 
death of a student leader 
police said two shipyard workers set themselves on fire in 
ritual suicide bids monday because of a labor dispute they said 
one died and the other was in critical condition 
the two set themselves ablaze at the daewoo co shipyard at koje 
island off the south coast where workers are demanding pay raises 
about 60 students continued to go without food today in the 
compound of seouls roman catholic myongdong cathederal as riot 
police ringed the area but made no move to intervene 
more than 200 other students abandoned the protest or left to 
take weaker protesters home to provincial cities leaders said 
student leaders said they they would not quit the hunger strike 
and that they expected other students to join them five students 
were hospitalized after collapsing during the protest 
a government official who declined to be named said 
authorities did not intend to intervene to stop the hunger strike 
but police might reconsider if any of the hungerstrikers becomes 
seriously ill 
the cathedral headquarters of the catholic church in south 
korea is regarded as a sanctuary it is often used to stage 
antigovernment protests because police will not enter the compound 
for fear of angering the church 
about 300 radicals began a hunger strike at the cathedral late 
thursday to demand the government admit that police killed student 
leader lee cholkyu 
lees body was found earlier this month in a reservoir near the 
southern city of kwangju 
the government released a report today concluding that lee 
slipped and fell into the reservoir after fleeing from a police 
road block the death was accidental and there was no evidence of 
police involvement the report said 
police said lee ran away when stopped at a roadblock outside 
kwangju 
dissident groups claim police tortured and killed lee who had 
served a prison term for antigovernment activities and was wanted 
on charges of writing articles praising communist north korea 
police said today that about 200 people were injured monday 
night in kwangju when riot police broke up a protest march by some 
5000 protesters calling for the fall of the government 
in the labor dispute on koje island officials said lee sangmo 
20 a welder died after setting himself on fire and jumping off a 
40foot building an unidentified worker who set himself on fire a 
few hours earlier was in critical condition 
workers at the financially troubled shipyard are demanding pay 
raises of 50 percent and more daewoo officials say large raises 
are impossible because the yard is losing money due to the poor 
state of the ship industry 
suicide is sometimes used in south korea as a form of protest to 
shame the government or employers and create martyrs

a young yale graduate who authorities 
say killed his mother a brother and two others in a 
machetewielding rampage apparently was depressed over an illness 
that kept him from working neighbors said 
roland marcello 23 was arrested monday evening as he lay 
exhausted on a river bank after a carandfoot chase that took him 
20 miles from the home where his family had lived about 15 years 
only a day earlier marcello had attended his friends first 
wedding anniversary 
there was no motive for what he did said the friend who 
would identify himself only as bill it was obvious that he just 
snapped 
marcello was being held for questioning early today at 
springfield police headquarters and was expected to be arraigned 
this morning police chief william e chisholm said 
he is charged with four counts of murder and one count of 
aggravated assault and could face the death penalty union county 
prosecutor john h stamler said the alleged murder weapon also has 
been recovered he said 
the dead included marcellos mother anita 51 and brother 
raymond 20 nelson paiva 20 a family friend from union and mark 
dennis 36 a neighbor who intervened in the struggle stamler 
said all four died of multiple stab wounds 
richard hartmann another neighbor who intervened was in 
guarded condition in a local hospital 
the killings shattered the calm of this upper middleclass 
community 25 miles southwest of new york city where residents hold 
frequent block parties and help each other in crises and where 
there hadnt been a murder since 1981 
police and neighbors said marcello allegedly killed his mother 
and brother at their twostory home at about 530 pm 
he then got into a dispute with paiva shortly after the family 
friend arrived at the house he chased paiva across the street into 
a yard where neighbors including hartmann were having a picnic 
hartmann went to help paiva who then ran across the yard to 
dennis house dennis came out and the defendant turned his anger 
on mr dennis and stabbed him stamler said 
janice bongiovanni who lives across the street said she first 
thought it was a joke when she saw the suspect known as rolly 
wrestling on the ground with neighbors 
they were on the ground i thought they were fooling around 
until i saw a knife in his hand she said it was a 10inch 
knife it was like a dagger 
i started to walk towards him but when i saw the size of the 
knife he had in his hand i just backed off because i was terrified 
by it said her husband jerry 
mrs bongiovanni said marcello ran back to his house came 
running out with a large brown garbage can and took off in his car 
he said what have i done what have i done she said 
marcello later ditched the car stole another and drove west 
stamler said 
state police saw him speeding and chased him apparently 
believing he might have been involved in an earlier hitandrun 
accident 
marcello ran into a guard rail in neighboring somerset county 
he left the car jumped off a 40foot highway bridge over the 
lanington river and escaped temporarily by running through the 
shallow waters stamler said 
friends said marcello was the oldest son of a family originally 
from the philippines 
he graduated from yale university about two years ago with a 
degree in economics according to neighbors and police he worked 
only a short time in an internship with chemical bank in new york 
before mononucleosis forced him to drop out neighbors said 
the whole family was very low key and respectful people 
said neighbor steve galluzzo 
i think he was depressed he said for a while he was at 
top of his class in yale but when he got out into the business 
world i dont know what happened 
stamler said witnesses reported the family had a discussion 
over marcellos unemployment earlier in the day he declined to 
speculate on a motive but said there was no evidence marcello had 
been using alcohol or drugs 
mrs bongiovanni said anita marcello was a nurse at newark 
university hospital and that the boys father died about 10 years 
ago

following is the text of natos 
comprehensive strategy document relating to modernization of lance 
missiles and shortrange nuclear forces negotiations 
the alliance reaffirms its position that for the forseeable 
future there is no alternative to the alliances strategy for the 
prevention of war which is a strategy of deterrence based upon an 
appropriate mix of adequate and effective nuclear and conventional 
forces which will continue to be kept up to date where necessary 
where nuclear forces are concerned land sea and airbased 
systems including groundbased missiles in the present 
circumstances and as far as can be foreseen will be needed in 
europe 
in view of the huge superiority of the warsaw pact in terms of 
shortrange nuclear missiles the alliance calls upon the soviet 
union to reduce unilaterally its shortrange missile systems to the 
current levels within the integrated military structure 
the alliance reaffirms that at the negotiations on conventional 
stability it pursues the objectives of 
the establishment of a secure and stable balance of 
conventional forces at lower levels 
the elimination of disparities prejudicial to stability and 
security and 
the elimination as a matter of high priority of the capability 
for launching surprise attack and for initiating largescale 
offensive action 
in keeping with its arms control objectives formulated in 
reykjavik in 1987 and reaffirmed in brussels in 1988 the alliance 
states that one of its highest priorities in negotiations with the 
east is reaching an agreement on conventional force reductions 
which would achieve the objectives above 
in this spirit the allies will make every effort as evidenced 
by the outcome of the may 1989 summit to bring negotiations to an 
early and satisfactory conclusion the united states has expressed 
the hope that this could be achieved within six to 12 months once 
implementation of such an agreement is under way the united 
states in consultation with the allies concerned is prepared to 
enter into negotiations to achieve a partial reduction of american 
and soviet landbased nuclear missiles forces of shorter range to 
equal and verifiable levels with special reference to the western 
proposals on cfe tabled in vienna enhanced by the proposals by the 
united sates at the may 1989 summit the allies concerned proceed 
on the understanding that negotiated reductions leading to a level 
below the existing level of their snf missiles will not be carried 
out until the results of these negotiations have been implemented 
reductions of the warsaw pact snf systems should be carried out 
before that date 
as regards the substrategic nuclear forces of the members of 
the integrated military structure their level and characteristics 
must be such that they can perform their deterrent role in a 
credible way across the required spectrum of ranges taking into 
account the threat both conventional and nuclear with which the 
alliance is faced the question of lance will be dealt with in 1992 
in the light of overall security developments while a decision for 
national authorities the allies concerned recognize the value of 
the continued funding by the united states of research and 
development of a followon for the existing shortrange missiles 
in order to preserve their options in this respect

appleton simply cant escape the magic of 
harry houdini and local boosters hope his legacy of daring escapes 
from straitjackets and handcuffs will snare outsiders to his 
hometown 
houdini is our favorite son theres no doubting that said 
businessman tom boldt who is leading the effort to win wider 
recognition for appleton as the magicians hometown 
boosters have named a municipal park an elementary school and a 
cafe after houdini organized an annual halloween seance to attempt 
to contact his spirit and set up walking tours and museum exhibits 
to foster his memory more than 60 years after his death 
we needed something to get people to stop in appleton for a 
while said museum curator christopher miller 
previously the fox river city of 65000 was best known as a 
stopover for tourists headed to lake michigans door peninsula or 
as the hometown of the late sen joseph mccarthy who was censured 
by the senate in the 1950s 
mccarthy is really not a fun topic but houdini is all about 
fun miller said 
the campaign received a boost earlier this year when businessman 
sydney h radner 69 of holyoke mass agreed to lease his 
collection of houdini handcuffs personal letters billboards 
photographs and personal letters to millers outagamie county 
museum 
radner a magic historian and onetime performer collected the 
artifacts from houdinis brother theo hardeen in the 1930s and 
1940s 
miller selected about 10 percent of radners collection for a 
permanent tworoom houdini exhibit on the second floor of the 
museum the exhibit opened april 6 
in a telephone interview from massachusetts radner said houdini 
boostesr have shown the same flare for publicity that the late 
magician had 
its hard to say what hed be doing today if he were still 
alive but you could be darn sure he would in the top of the news 
because thats the type of person he was radner said appleton 
is doing just that putting him in the top of the news again 
houdini whose real name was erich weiss was born april 6 
1874 to cecilia and rabbi mayer samuel weiss his actual 
birthplace has been disputed because an 1880 us census form lists 
it as budapest hungary 
boldt radner and other houdini enthusiasts have found insurance 
policies and a death certificate listing erichs birthplace as 
appleton 
thats not a big thing with me boldt said what is big 
for me is that houdini consistently throughout his career mentioned 
appleton as his hometown 
houdini lived in appleton until he was about 9 
in show business houdini stayed at the top of the vaudeville 
circuit for the entire time which almost spans 30 years miller 
said when he died vaudeville died 
houdini died october 31 1926 in a detroit hospital nine days 
after he was struck in the stomach while performing in montreal 
the society of american magicians which houdini served as 
president the houdini club of wisconsin in milwaukee and the 
houdini hall of fame which opened 18 years ago in niagara falls 
kept interest in the man alive 
boldts family construction company received permission in 1985 
to build a downtown public park and statue houdini plaza centers 
around an abstract sixton statue called metamorphosis 
honoring the magicians escape feats 
the citys efforts gained more attention in 1986 when boldt 
hosted the annual harry houdini halloween seance despite the 
services of a professional psychic and artifacts from radners 
collection no one has heard from houdinis spirit 
but boldt says thats far from a failure houdini had said that 
if he died he wanted relatives and friends to hold a seance each 
oct 31 to prove that no such spiritual contact can be made 
every time they fail it again proves that what houdini was 
doing was correct boldt said

soviet military experts are carefully analyzing 
president bushs proposals for troop cuts in europe a senior 
military spokesman said today after mikhail s gorbachev announced 
plans to cut the defense budget 
lt gen nikolai chervov a member of the soviet general staff 
made the comments to the official news agency tass 
he was quoted as saying that bushs proposals to cut us 
conventional forces in western europe and reach swift eastwest 
agreement on even deeper cuts by 1993 need to be carefully 
analyzed 
we have all long been waiting for the united states to answer 
arms proposals put forward by the soviet union and other socialist 
countries 
certainly the united states could not keep silent 
indefinitely he was quoted as saying washingtons silence was 
beginning to draw criticism in many nato capitals 
he noted that bushs proposals also included combat aircraft and 
helicopter reductions for the first time initially the north 
atlantic treaty organization refused to include those weapons 
categories in its proposals to the vienna talks on reducing 
conventional arms across europe 
gorbachev today made no direct response to bushs proposals in a 
95minute speech to the new congress of peoples deputies 
but he did acknowledge that the soviet union spends 118 billion 
on defense nearly four times what it officially claimed as 
recently as october and pledged spending will be reduced by 153 
billion by the end of 1991 
both superpowers have now proposed specific troop and weapons 
reductions which could set the stage for detailed negotiations at 
the vienna talks rather than continued public diplomacy 
moscow has long concealed its true military expenditures 
complicating eastwest negotiations on mutual arms reductions in 
october the official budget for 1989 allocated 32 billion for the 
military the same figure that had been used the previous year 
gorbachev said military spending had been frozen in 198788 
suggesting that in those years the spending was around the figure 
he disclosed today for current defense expenditures

james richardson dropped to his knees at 
the graves of his seven children made the sign of the cross and 
prayed aloud under an unrelenting afternoon sun 
the memorial day graveside visit was richardsons first since he 
was convicted of killing one of the children nearly 22 years ago 
and his first since a judge ruled he was wrongfully convicted and 
ordered him released from prison just over a month ago all the 
children died after eating a meal laced with pesticide 
oh my little ones are gone i have nothing left now 
except god to keep me going strong richardson said using a 
white hankerchief to wipe the perspiration from his neck and the 
tears from his eyes 
you took something i love i never thought it was going to be 
like this no one seems to understand but you know lord thats 
all right with all the agonies running up and down my spine i 
thank you anyway lord he said as a crowd of about 50 looked on 
moments later saying mondays memorial service at oakridge 
cemetery had cleansed him of the past richardson climbed into 
a limousine and headed back to comedianactivist dick gregorys 
diet and health clinic in fort walton beach 
the 53yearold former farm worker had been serving a life term 
which was commuted from a death sentence 
a judge ordered richardson freed after determining he had been 
wrongfully convicted with what a state investigation found was 
suppressed evidence and perjured testimony 
his homecoming was an emotional one with a rousing service at 
the church that sits near where richardson once lived and where 
his children ate their fatal lunch of rice and beans inside the 
church about 50 neighbors gathered for the afternoon service 
seven wreaths adorned the front of the church six were 
decorated with pink carnations and bows in honor of richardsons 
daughters alice betty susie dorine dianne and venessa the 
last decorated in red was for his son james richardson jr 
as richardson entered the church six girls and one boy sang 
jesus loves me while staring at the man they knew only from 
newspaper and television reports 
its strange to be back here but i know god is able to do 
anything richardson said 
gregory has said he plans to pay richardson 1 million over the 
next 10 years to counsel prisoners and give antidrug talks to 
children richardson said he also intends to become a leader in the 
campaign against the death penalty which he escaped only when the 
us supreme court declared thenexisiting death penalty laws 
unconstitutional in the early 1970s

the sailor linked by reports to the 
investigation of the uss iowa disaster says he wants an apology 
from the navy and a congressman said he plans to inquire how 
kendall l truitt was implicated in the fatal blast 
rep glenn poshard dill said he will grant a request by the 
sailors attorney to investigate the navys handling of its probe 
as it concerns truitt a 21yearold gunners mate 3rd class 
there has been tremendous publicity impugning this young 
man poshard said in a telephone interview somebody had to 
give the news media this information if this boy is not 
guilty how is he ever going to recover from this thing it doesnt 
seem appropriate to try someone before the facts are in or in the 
press 
meanwhile truitt his wife carole and his attorney ellis 
rubin of miami went monday to the norfolk naval base where the 
sailor collected his belongings for a transfer to mayport fla 
id like to see a formal apology from an identified navy 
spokesman truitt told reporters outside the gates to the base 
the iowas homeport im sure this will hurt me in the future and 
certainly now life will never be the same i guess but ill try 
to get it back as close as possible 
accidental causes have not been ruled out in the april 19 
explosion that ripped the ships no 2 gun turret and killed 47 
men but navy investigators have reported finding no evidence of 
mechanical or electrical problems 
in recent weeks news reports based on unnamed sources have said 
investigators were examining the relationship between truitt and 
gunners mate clayton m hartwig 25 who died in the explosion 
neither man has been officially named by the navy as being under 
investigation and truitt has repeatedly denied any involvement 
with the blast 
a report in the new york times monday said investigators now 
feel it is unlikely truitt set off the explosion to kill hartwig 
who had named truitt as beneficiary on a 100000 life insurance 
policy but they say it is possible hartwig may have set off the 
explosion to commit suicide 
capt paul w hanley an atlantic fleet spokesman said reports 
representing the navy as accusing truitt or hartwig are inaccurate 
i emphasize the navy has made no allegation launched no 
charges and done nothing to implicate anyone hanley said 
rubin said he was angered with the navy for hustling his client 
on and off the iowa monday with no opportunity to visit with 
friends or pay respects to fallen comrades 
on this memorial day kendall truitt and his wife carole came 
to pay homage to his shipmates who were lost rubin said he 
was not able to do that

the nations first school for seeing eye 
dogs celebrates its 60th birthday this year with its sights on 
public education and expansion 
back in the 40s and 50s the public probably knew more about 
how guide dogs work than they do now said dennis j murphy 
president of the seeing eye inc it was such a new phenomenon 
that people paid attention to it 
in 60 years little has changed in the way the dogs are trained 
but the nonprofit school has improved its breeding program and 
spent money on research to improve dogs health murphy said 
what has changed is the need to train dogs in a little 
different situations he said the dogs now ride on buses and 
trains 
about 85 percent of the dogs trained by the seeing eye mainly 
german shepherds and labrador retrievers are born at the schools 
breeding station in mendham township said doug roberts director 
of training a few dogs are donated 
over the years breeding has reduced the size of the dogs from 
120 pounds to 70 pounds as apartments and cars have gotten 
smaller murphy said 
shortly after birth the dogs are placed for a year with 275 4h 
families in new jersey eastern pennsylvania and northern delaware 
murphy said the dogs are taught basic obedience given affection 
and put into a variety of situations such as car rides murphy 
said 
the school trains about 320 dogs each year a kennel to be built 
in the next two years will help the program expand to 400 dogs 
murphy said 
after 12 weeks most of the dogs are ready to be placed with a 
blind person roberts said eighteen people from throughout the 
united states and canada are brought to morristown in northern new 
jersey for a month of instruction in dog handling 
there is a six to ninemonth waiting list to get a dog 
recipients usually must be at least 16 years old so they are 
responsible enough to care for the dog murphy said 
the cost for a firsttime dog owner is 150 the same as 60 
years ago roberts said owners looking for a replacement dog pay 
50 
the seeing eye is one of 10 dog training schools in the united 
states says lori scholz the schools spokeswoman 
michele t drolet 35 of morristown coordinates fundraising 
for the seeing eye she is blind and has used guide dogs since 1974 
its a social icebreaker ms drolet says with a cane 
people tend to avoid you they dont know how to talk to you 
with a dog they forget about the master and want to talk 
about the dog

here is a transcript of president 
bushs news conference tuesday at the conclusion of the nato summit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
good afternoon first i want to pay my respects to manfred 
woerner and thank him for the way in which this meeting has been 
conducted for his thorough staff work and for his able leadership 
in the hall 
and i think that the successful results at this summit have 
given us a double hit both conventional forces and shortrange 
nuclear forces and taken in tandem it demonstrates the alliances 
ability to manage change to our advantage to move beyond the era 
of containment 
our overall aim is to overcome the division of europe and to 
forge a unity based on western values the starting point of 
course is to maintain our security while seeking to lessen 
tensions and adapt to changing circumstances 
our conventional parity initiative seeks to capitalize on the 
opportunity we have and to do so without delay we want to finally 
free europe from the constant threat of surprise attack we want to 
free europe from the political shadow of soviet military power and 
we want to free europe to become the center of cooperation not 
confrontation 
we want to open up opportunities for greater useuropean 
cooperation on the other great issues of our day for example on 
environment and regional conflicts a reduced military presence 
when combined with a less threatening soviet presence in europe 
can create a stronger basis for engagement in europe over the long 
haul america is and will remain a european power 
similarly our snf agreement demonstrates our ability to adapt 
to change while remaining true to our core security principles 
weve agreed to future negotiations after the implementation of a 
conventional forces agreement after the implementation of the 
agreement is underway the conventional force agreement any 
negotiated snf reductions will not be carried out until the cfe 
agreement is implemented 
and weve underscored that our objective in negotiations is to 
achieve partial reductions clearly leaving an snf deterrent at 
lower equal and verifiable levels partial means partial 
we also stressed that our strategy of deterrence requires land 
sea and airbased nuclear systems including groundbased 
missiles for as far as we can foresee and while we will not take 
the modernization decision until 1992 the allies recognize the 
value of continued us funding for the research and development of 
the followon to the lance system 
and lastly we are placing great emphasis on a rapid negotiated 
reduction of the conventional asymmetries that threaten europe 
based on results in that area we can negotiate snf reductions as 
well while ensuring the continued presence of the nuclear 
deterrent 
and now i would be glad to take some questions oh excuse me 
weve got to start with our us protocol the overseas those of 
you from the nonus press excuse me if i go first to the up and 
then to the ap helen 
q mr president the communique says that chemical weapons are 
abhorrent and you call for total elimination most people think 
nuclear weapons are totally abhorrent why not totally eliminate 
them as your predecessor had called for

mikhail s gorbachev said today that the kremlin 
spends 118 billion a year for defense nearly four times the 
previous official claim and promised defense cuts would help 
improve peoples lives 
the soviet president disclosed the figure in a speech to the new 
congress in which he also promised and to root out bureaucrats who 
are holding back reforms and pledged an attack on the special 
privileges of soviet officials 
he also said local elections scheduled for the fall would be 
postponed until the spring to give legislators a chance to work out 
changes in election laws and other key legislation 
gorbachev said the savings from a military budget trimmed by 
more than 13 percent would be channeled into raising the standard 
of living of a nation plagued by chronic shortages and shoddy goods 
members of the congress of peoples deputies the first soviet 
legislative body chosen in contested elections in 70 years have 
listed improving the standard of living their most pressing concern 
all of our production capacities must be reoriented to produce 
what the people need gorbachev said in his 95minute address 
he told the congress on the fifth day of its inaugural session 
that military spending would be reduced by 153 billion by the end 
of 1991 prompting delegates to burst into applause 
the speech was greeted coolly by one of the bestknown 
legislators the immensely popular reformer boris n yeltsin 
i was expecting something new something entirely and 
radically new that would take into account the crisis state of 
society and the communist party he told reporters the 
sloganmaking system doesnt work anymore 
gorbachevs speech contained no direct response to president 
bushs announcement monday of substantial cuts in us forces in 
europe and a call for swift eastwest agreement on even deeper 
reductions by 1993 
but both sides have now proposed specific troop and weapons 
reductions which could set the stage for detailed negotiations at 
the vienna talks on reducing conventional arms 
today we can ensure security by political and diplomatic 
means gorbachev said reflecting his policy of new political 
thinking 
this makes it possible to cut down on military expenditures 
without any detriment to the defense capability of our 
country 
the traditionally secretive soviet government has long concealed 
its true military expenditures complicating eastwest arms talks 
as recently as october the official budget for 1989 allocated 32 
billion for the military 
economist leonid abalkin speaking to reporters after 
gorbachevs speech said the figure represents about 9 percent of 
the soviet gross national product the 300 billion pentagon budget 
represents about 6 percent of the us gross national product 
asked why previous defense figures were so much lower abalkin 
said they represented only what we could call the budget of the 
ministry of defense 
this is certainly coming closer to the truth said one 
western diplomat adding that considerable analysis of the figures 
would be required to determine the accuracy of the new total the 
diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity 
gorbachev announced plans to cut defense spending in his address 
to the united nations in december but western leaders had 
continued to question the actual impact of the promised cuts 
noting what they regarded as unrealistic military spending figures 
in his speech gorbachev said many deputies had complained that 
government ministries responsible for consumer goods and 
agriculture were dragging their feet on reforms and he said the 
congress is free to question government officials about their 
actions 
apparently we will have to hear at this conference a response 
from our government gorbachev said in the nationally televised 
report on the state of domestic and foreign affairs 
dressed in a dark suit and red tie the president stood before a 
giant white statue of soviet founder vladimir i lenin facing the 
2250 deputies gathered in the kremlins palace of congress 
deputies say the ministries are restructuring very slowly if 
at all gorbachev said we have to find out what is wrong 
construction and planning ministries have continued to increase 
investments in new equipment and machinery despite his new approach 
demanding that they make better use of what they already have he 
said 
yeltsin signed up to address the congress after gorbachevs 
speech the congress defeated yeltsins bid for a seat in the 
smaller fulltime national legislature or supreme soviet on 
saturday 
but on monday it reversed itself after tens of thousands of 
people took the streets and sent angry telegrams in protest 
yeltsin the 58yearold ousted moscow communist party chief 
won 90 percent of the popular vote in his election to a moscow seat 
this year 
his crusade to end the privileges of the communist ruling elite 
and fill empty store shelves has made him a folk hero 
at a downtown rally after a march from the kremlin with 
supporters yeltsin said his recovery was a victory by the people 
over the secret apparatus 
in a parliamentary maneuver that had gorbachevs blessing a 
siberian deputy the congress chose for the new 542seat supreme 
soviet offered to resign on condition yeltsin be allowed to take 
his place and the congress agreed 
yeltsin also had been passed over for the vice presidency which 
went monday to politburo member anatoly i lukyanov a gorbachev 
confidant

about 1000 students and workers rallied outside 
police headquarters today to protest the reported arrests of 
leaders of a new independent labor union aligned with the student 
prodemocracy movement 
a chinese source said an important communist party central 
committee meeting scheduled this week was postponed because 
conservatives did not have enough backing for their purge of 
moderate leaders 
those believed to be targets of the conservatives include the 
reformminded communist party leader zhao ziyang who reportedly 
was stripped of power last week by premier li peng 
students occupying central tiananmen square continued to snub li 
and his supporters unveiling to the cheers of tens of thousands a 
33foot replica of the statue of liberty 
the goddess of democracy immediately drew an angry response 
from beijing authorities who said the students action was 
illegal they ordered the statue removed immediately 
this is china not the united states the nationwide 
television news quoted one unidentified person as saying even in 
the united states putting up a statue in front of the congress 
building as one pleases is not permitted 
conservatives who adopted a hardline stance toward the 
prodemocracy protests have started arresting nonstudent 
participants 
three union officials and 11 leaders of a motorcycle gang which 
roared through the city in support of the students were reported 
arrested 
zhao pinglu head of the beijing independent workers union 
said one of its leaders shen yinhan a 27yearold official with 
the national airlines was grabbed by police monday in front of the 
beijing hotel 
two other union leaders both employees of the ministry of 
railways also were arrested zhao said 
li zhihuang wife of railway employee qian yiming said her 
husbands work unit claimed he was arrested by police to find out 
about the situation at tiananmen square where students are 
continuing an 18day sitin for a freer society and an end to 
official corruption 
a third man bai dongping 26 was supposed to take his wife to 
the hospital on monday but did not show up said his father bai 
baofa 
he would never just disappear his father said the 
governments actions are vicious 
about 1000 students and workers protested outside police 
headquarters near the square one banner read do not secretly 
arrest people let the people know 
outside police headquarters a man who identified himself as 
chief of beijing public security told a us television crew there 
that no students had been arrested he refused comment on whether 
workers were detained 
the official told the journalists they had violated martial law 
imposed may 20 in a bid to quash the studentled movement he said 
the television crew should not talk with any chinese in the central 
beijing area under the decree which has been widely ignored 
a police broadcast to the crowd said you do not understand 
the real situation beijing is in complete chaos 
when an officer told the crowd to disperse they replied with 
calls of bandit and rascal and how many people have you 
arrested police with two video cameras filmed demonstrators who 
said they would not leave 
the independent trade union which claims 3000 members was 
formed may 19 in defiance of a government ban on all but the 
official trade union federation 
the party hardliners who appear to have won a power struggle 
occasioned by the student protests have taken the line that the 
students are wellintentioned but that nonstudents who are 
misleading them will be punished 
already workers who have joined demonstrations or supported the 
movement are being fined or having their pay docked others are 
being threatened with losing their jobs 
several hundred student protesters from outside beijing said 
they would return home today to spread the movements gospel but 
thousands more said they would stay in the now foulsmelling square 
until the countrys legislature convenes june 20 
about 5000 students are now living in a squatters camp on the 
square chinas symbolic center of power 
student leaders have continued to quarrel over the direction of 
their movement beijing leaders had favored ending the occupation 
today but were overruled by other activists many of them from 
outside the capital and relatively recent arrivals 
representatives from about 200 schools met early today on the 
issue but failed to iron out differences 
chinese and diplomatic sources claim more troops are being moved 
to beijing as part of the behindthescenes power struggle

bush well the communique addresses itself to where nuclear 
forces are concerned blahblah land sea airbased systems 
including groundbased missiles in the present circumstances as 
far as can be foreseen theyll be needed in europe and i would 
just stand by that this is a decision that has been thoroughly 
consulted with the military and thats the way it is 
q mr president your spokesman said today that the formula for 
shortrange negotiations on shortrange nuclear missiles was a 
very strong victory for the united states and the nato alliance 
how can it be a victory for the united states without being a 
defeat for chancellor kohl and mr genscher given that the united 
states and germany were on such opposing sides on this issue 
bush well they strongly supported it its my understanding 
and i dont view it as a victory for the united states i view it 
as a victory for the alliance so they can speak for themselves 
but im very pleased that it worked out and that there was alliance 
harmony on this very important question 
yes 
q did both sides make concessions sir 
bush well i can only speak for the united states and we had 
certain broad parameters that ive addressed part one of them 
and that was this question of partial reduction no third zero 
question the other one was the agreed to begin the negotiations 
on snf following tangible implementation that was one of our 
strong conditions or strong negotiating points if you will and 
then no implementation of agreed reduction on snf forces before 
completion of these reductions so im very happy but i dont i 
want to put it this way were here as part of an alliance and i 
dont think we ought to have winners and losers out of a summit 
that everybody concedes has been very very unified 
and so its an alliance victory or an alliance decision and 
im proud to have had a part in that 
yes 
q mr president all politics may be local but hasnt the 
continued insistence of the germans been damaging to the alliance 
bush talk to the people that have been around here for a long 
time and theyll tell you that theyve never seen more unity and 
more upbeat feeling after a meeting 
q do you think the foreign ministers who missed dinner last 
night would agree with you on that 
bush no they probably would dissent but they went along 
today kept their eyes open in the aisle back here lesley and 
then brit lesley and brit 
q mr president isnt it possible that you could start 
negotiations on snf missiles before the modernization decision has 
been made and do you think thats a good way to go in a 
negotiation without a commitment to upgrade these the soviets 
say okay if you dont have a commitment well get rid of all 
of them and wheres your position 
bush well the modernization decision doesnt need to be taken 
til 92

a yugoslavborn cancer specialist 
convicted of fraud in switzerland promised to fight the charges 
despite being barred from traveling abroad by a us judge 
dr rajko medenica who became a us citizen last year and 
continues his practice from hilton head island said he will fight 
both the geneva conviction and a 1983 yugoslavian conviction on 
similar charges 
im ready to fight if necessary for the next 10 or 15 
years medenica told the associated press in a telephone 
interview from his office on monday 
but i will fight until the end because this problem this 
dispute between yugoslavia and the university hospital in geneva 
concentrates now on me i absolutely was used like a 
scapegoat 
a swiss jury last week found medenica 49 guilty of bilking 
yugoslav social security of some 560000 while leading a clinic at 
a geneva state hospital he was sentenced to four years in prison 
us district judge sol blatt jr revoked medenicas us 
passport before the trial thus prohibiting the doctor from 
attending blatt said he acted after he learned that medenicas 
patients might be in danger without the doctors treatment 
the swiss government alleged medenica was responsible for fake 
billing while treating patients including many yugoslavs at a 
state hospital in geneva and a private clinic from 1973 through 
1981 
in 1983 he was sentenced in absentia in yugoslavia to 20 years 
in prison on related charges 
medenica was released from swiss investigative custody in 1984 
after former south carolina gov john west whose daughter was 
treated for throat cancer by medenica persuaded a judge to grant 
bond west also helped raise much of medenicas 300000 bail 
medenica said monday that while he agreed with the bills 
submitted by the hospital the yugoslav general consul and the 
hospital arranged the billing system 
all records which concern these patients were with the 
yugoslav general consul but when these problems appeared in 
switzerland the general consul of yugoslavia closed his door and 
left for yugoslavia and kept all records with him he said 
the swiss media has been highly critical of medenica a 
frontpage editorial last week in the tribune de geneve accused the 
doctor of amorality and unscrupulousness 
it is catastrophic because they are not corresponding what i 
do for my patients they never mention that the hospital got 37 
million swiss francs because of my treatments he said of the 
media 
those testifying in his behalf in geneva included former world 
heavyweight champion boxer muhammad ali who has been treated by 
medenica and west 
medenica received a permanent license to practice medicine in 
south carolina in 1987 the state medical licensing board was aware 
of the yugoslavian conviction and charges pending in switzerland 
he said

less than a week away from its freest 
elections communist poland is papered with westernstyle campaign 
posters and authorities are accusing the west of trying to 
influence the outcome 
the red logo of the solidarity independent labor movement an 
illegal symbol of defiance a few short months ago is splashed 
across posters on shop windows and telephone poles from the capital 
to the countryside 
communistbacked candidates are putting up their campaign signs 
too 
from the hasty handout in smudgy type to the color poster of a 
smiling candidate and wholesomelooking family the freewheeling 
poster war for sundays vote contrasts sharply with the previously 
tame trickle of strictly controlled information 
jaws dropped in amazement when the first streetcar rolled 
through warsaw bearing a solidarity campaign sign with slick 
graphics 
this is our main chance and we must take advantage of it 
said anna dub who heads solidaritys publicity effort in warsaw 
under a historic agreement reached last month opposition 
candidates have been allowed to run for all seats in a new freely 
elected 100member senate and for 35 percent of the slots in the 
existing sejm or parliament 
however solidarity had just seven weeks from the day the 
government reinstated it after a sevenyear ban to organize its 
campaign select candidates and publicize them 
that campaign has taken a more rancorous tone in its last days 
with the government using the slogan only opposition thats no 
proposition to attack solidarity 
its beginning to get hot right now ms dub said more 
and more attacks in the press more and more posters in the city 
but we havent run out of our possibilities yet and we are 
prepared for the last week 
on monday the government accused the united states and other 
western nations of helping the opposition campaign in a statement 
read on state television it appealed for an immediate halt of 
interfering in the electoral campaign by some western countries 
the polishamerican congress for example says it has raised 
about 200000 nationally to support the solidarity candidates 
solidarity responded today by saying that assistance received 
from abroad was consistent with polish law it accused the 
government of twisting the truth to aid its own candidates 
the authors of the government statement are well aware of 
those facts but its not truth that is the point of the statement 
but antisolidarity propaganda they government want to scare 
those who are undecided the union said in a statement 
the short campaign timetable had been expected to benefit the 
government candidates who had an organization in place support of 
the staterun media and money but solidarity moved quickly 
countless volunteers came forward from squads armed with glue 
and brushes placing solidarity posters even in remote villages to 
passersby who drop off proposed slogans at the warsaw office 
although there is some coverage of solidarity candidates on 
staterun television the unions weekly television show was barred 
may 23 
solidarity says it is relying chiefly on posters and leaflets to 
publicize its candidates 
in the capital it had spent 126000 going into the last week 
of the campaign and planned to finish up by distributing one 
leaflet for every 15 residents ms dub said 
solidarity has shown both determination and wit in championing 
its candidates 
when some solidarity posters were torn down the union responded 
with posters in the same place reading not for tearing down 
in polish that also means it wont wear out 
the government candidates claim they have best chance to put 
reforms in place we have a realistic program and with us it 
is surer read their posters 
however some government candidates have chosen places for their 
banners that are unlikely to inspire confidence such as a warsaw 
renovation project unfinished for nearly a decade 
and while solidarity uses its trademark liberally the communist 
party posters often leave the candidates affiliation hazy 
wojciech szymborski a party worker in charge of the warsaw 
campaign office said the government wants to be more individual 
and democratic 
solidarity has suggested it is trying to confuse voters

helicopter carrying the lebanese christian leader gen michel aoun 
the six were arrested in the south coast tourist resort of 
larnaca on friday and sunday they were ordered held on charges of 
arms possession and conspiracy to commit murder 
the reputed plot was revealed after two cypriot scuba divers on 
sunday came across two sovietmade sa7 missiles and their 
launchers wrapped in watertight packages in shallow water off the 
beach at larnaca 
three of the suspects admitted in voluntary statements that 
with the means at their disposal they planned to assassinate an 
arab personality police investigator nicos kazafaniotis told the 
court 
kazafaniotis did not mention any names but one of the six 
idris jamal jaber turned toward the packed journalists gallery 
and spelled out the name aoun with his lips he did not say it 
aloud 
aoun had been scheduled to pass through larnacas airport last 
week to attend an arab league summit in casablanca morocco where 
arab leaders were discussing lebanons 14year war between 
christians and moslems 
but aoun lebanons army commander and head of a christian 
cabinet vying for power with a moslem cabinet did not attend the 
summit 
aouns mostly christian army units operate a daily helicopter 
shuttle service between larnaca and the christian enclave northeast 
of beirut 
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
other suspects also admitted they intended to shoot down aouns 
helicopter as it was landing 
kazafaniotis said the launchers were found 300 yards from the 
end of the main airport runway 150 yards from the beach the 
lebanese army helicopters land on an apron at the end of the aiport 
runway 
kazafaniotis said police investigating the discovery picked up 
two members of the group in larnaca they arrested the other four 
in another apartment where a cache of arms was stashed 
the police sources said the six men arrested all were moslems 
but that it was not certain their names or travel documents were 
genuine

jailed for 15 years for attempting to blow up the israeli embassy 
in nicosia the cypriot capital

president bush today hailed the 
double hit unity forged on nuclear and conventional arms 
proposals at his first nato summit and asserted he would not 
accept elimination of shortrange nuclear missiles from europe 
there will be no third zero he said in a reference to arms 
control jargon for scrapping the missiles 
partial is partial bush said referring to the language of 
an official nato communique under which the alliance will negotiate 
cuts in shortrange missiles but only after eastwest conventional 
force reductions are underway 
to try to interpret it some other way misses the boat bush 
said in a news conference that ended the twoday nato summit the 
president was departing belgium today for west germany where the 
missile question had been vehemently debated by officials seeking 
immediate negotiations 
in his news conference the president tried to turn the tables 
on soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs publicly appealing arms 
control proposals 
he noted a large warsaw pact advantage in shortrange nuclear 
weapons in europe and said why dont they just unilaterally 
reduce to equal numbers now thered be a challenge 
asked how he was faring in an international public relations war 
with gorbachev bush said ive read who some think was winning 
that was yesterday 
he said hed be willing to meet with gorbachev later this year 
if something constructive could come from such a summit 
bush hailed the results of the nato meetings saying the 
successful results at this summit have given us a double hit 
both conventional forces and short range nuclear forces he said 
that taken in tandem it demonstrates the alliances ability to 
adapt to change 
bush opened the news conference with a statement declaring that 
the alliances overall aim is to overcome the division of europe 
and to forge a unity based on western values he expressed hope 
that his arms proposals which would reduce moscows advantage in 
european military force would finally free europe from the 
constant threat of a surprise attack and the shadow or soviet 
military power 
as for gorbachev who only hours earlier had revealed the 
staggering size of the soviet military budget at 118 billion bush 
said this will help him this should save him a lot of money 
in the long run 
he described the initial soviet reaction to his conventional 
force proposal as positive then turning to aides for guidance 
he added that at least they didnt really slam the door on it 
bush defended the carefully worded nato compromise that calls 
for negotiations to reduce short range nuclear missiles only after 
an eastwest agreement has been reached to reduce conventional 
forces and reductions are actually underway 
the official nato communique represents a careful compromise 
over west germanys initial demand for negotiations soon to reduce 
and perhaps eliminate the shortrange missiles 
there will be no third zero he said emphasizing partial 
is partial 
as for gorbachev bush said he believed the soviet leader 
knows weve been serious in completing a lengthy review of 
policy gorbachev recently proposed a large reduction in 
conventional forces in europe where the soviet unmion and its 
eastern european allies maintain superiority over the west 
the soviet bloc also has a large advantage in shortrange 
nuclear missiles according to us officials roughly 2400 single 
warhead missiles to 700 for the west 
bushs proposal for sharp reductions in conventional forces in 
europe won enthusiastic agreement from the allies bush wants these 
reductions negotiated with moscow before taking up the nuclear 
missile question nato must decide on whether to modernize the 
shortrange nuclear missiles by 1992 
the soviet bloc has far greater numbers of soldiers and 
conventional forces that the united states and nato forces 
grobachev has recently proposed a reduction in his side and bush 
won nato endorsement during the summit for his plan to reduce us 
and soviet forces to equal levels 
bush noted that when he arrived in brussels he was under fire 
for apparently being recalcitrant in response to appealing soviet 
arms proposals but he said he was elected president to do what i 
think was right and added i think weve come up with a good 
proposal here 
bush said the successful results at this summit have given us 
a double hit both conventional forces and short range nuclear 
forces and taken in tandem it demonstrates the alliances 
ability to adapt to change 
the president held out the hope of reduced tensions in which it 
would be possible to move beyond the era of containment our 
overall aim is to overcome the division of europe and to forge a 
unity based on western values 
in particular the president told one questioner he was watching 
events in poland and said if authorities there were prepared to 
embrace western values we will be ready to have much better 
relations 
bush is planning to visit poland later this summer

here are excerpts of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs speech tuesday to the congress of peoples deputies as 
translated by official radio moscow 
the economy 
naturally we cannot expect immediate changes in the sphere of 
life we must concentrate all of our efforts and attention to in a 
very short period of time solve the most vital problems this is 
one of the most crucial problems of the congress and the supreme 
soviet and the new government the basis of perestroika in 
attaining the transformations in the economic and social sphere 
the idea of working in this field is to turn the economy to the 
people to give proper conditions of living and working to the 
people 
what is the matter why dont we feel what we have already done 
what is positive first and foremost because the financial system 
has been sort of disintegrated we have thrown the consumer market 
out of balance creating a shortage of consumer goods 
this panic evokes dissatisfaction among the people and in our 
society 
we are not living by our means our expenditures are higher than 
the national income we have a budget deficit this is economically 
impermissible 
the rapid growth of consumer goods and services must be 
improved we must supply the people with goods commensurate with 
their wages there are other viewpoints some say this problem 
whether we like it or not must be resolved by applying the market 
economy we do not share such an approach because this immediately 
would destroy the entire social system and disrupt the economic 
processes in the country 
we must make full use of all resources not only in the light 
food and agriculture industries but also all sectors of our 
economy including engineering heavy industry and so on defense 
industry 
in other words all of our productive capacity must be 
reoriented to produce what the people need consumer goods 
ecology 
life also requires a solution to ecological problems the 
situation there is very alarming in more than 100 cities of the 
country the harmful material in the air is very dangerous we must 
take care of our water resources the forests 
once more i would like to say that all our plans and drafts must 
be checked for ecological purity also concerning the building of 
canals atomic stations chemical enterprises they must be checked 
for ecological purity 
military and other budget cuts 
we will have to adopt difficult but necesary conditions we have 
to start somewhere and some things we have to turn down we must 
strictly adhere to the rule that the volume of capital investments 
must correspond to the capacities that we have that is the 
material and labor resources only in this way can we put an end to 
the eruption of construction by the different ministries 
another source of resources to improve our social program is to 
cut down our military expenditures to make conversions connected 
to the potential of the defense industries for civic needs for 
people who went through the difficult war defense was of vital 
interest and our soviet army remains important but in the world 
today there is a possibility to ensure security by political and 
diplomatic means this makes is possible to cut down military 
expenditures to have a new quality of armed forces of the 
ussr without any detriment to the defense capacity of our 
country in 1989 military expenditures were 773 billion rubles 
118 billion i am announcing this real figure of military 
expenditures to the congress of peoples deputies 773 billion 
rubles 118 billion for defense there is a proposal made to 
reduce military expenditures already in 19901991 by 10 billion 
rubles 153 billion that is by 14 percent and for the supreme 
soviet to work out further this complex having in mind our domestic 
problems and the tasks of ensuring the defense capacity of our 
country

and we have spelled out the procedures for negotiating on nsf 
snf and that will come after the agreement on the conventional 
forces and that is the important point 
i dont believe the lament i know weve got a lot of experts 
on this side and i dont want to restrict my questions to those of 
us like myself who are not longtime arms control experts but i 
can tell you that most people in our country dont realize the 
imbalance that exists on these conventional forces and it is 
destabilizing 
and the question is snf shortrange nuclear forces where 
theyve got in terms of launchers what 1200 or something of 
that nature to our 88 why dont they just negotiate just 
unilaterally reduce to equal numbers now thered be a good 
challenge so weve got this order set up as to how were going to 
go about it the alliance has taken a firm position and so im not 
going to go into a hypothetical question of that nature 
q on the question of partial the word is underlined for 
emphasis in the document was that done at our behest or mrs 
thatchers behest or whose behest 
bush if we can wake up jim baker youll have to ask him but i 
would simply say there was total agreement on it and it speaks for 
itself partial is partial and to try to interpret it some 
other way misses the boat 
q mr president in light of the fact that you have added 
several new weapons categories to the nato bargaining position 
the conventional arms talks is it realistic to suppose that these 
talks may be carried out successfully in the brief period of time 
that you are now asking 
bush well the timetable yes we can meet that timetable 
weve challenged the soviets to meet us you might say the 
alliance nato is tasked to be back on september 7th with our 
internals to be farther along and so i would certainly say yes 
lets do that we all remember september 7th dont we 
q mr president youve said that the modernization decision 
has been put off until 1992 but you have a commitment to keep the 
weapons systems uptodate when changes can be made 
bush not before 1992 
q mr president youve said that your efforts here are not a 
public relations battle with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev but 
if this were a battle whos winning yourself or mr gorbachev 
bush too hypothetical ellen too hypothetical ive read who 
some think is winning but that was yesterday 
q do you think that the hammering about your alleged lack of 
leadership in the united states should quiet down now as a result 
of your performance here 
bush i havent felt under siege in the united states because 
ive known exactly what we wanted to do and i made statements to 
that effect earlier on that we were going to have a review and 
then have proposals and we did exactly that so i will concede 
ive read such reports but they havent troubled me any

q gorbachev has apparently for the first time revealed 
specific defense budget figures in moscow today he also says he 
proposes to cut defense spending by 14 percent over 199091 thats 
equal to about 173 billion is that a lot is that meaningful 
what do you think about it 
bush well thisll help him this proposal if he hits our bid 
that should save him a lot of money in the long run because he has 
a disproportionate number of conventional forces and therein as 
you know thats where a lot of the expense for defense comes from 
so i dont know but it sounds like a substantial number to me but 
again i hadnt seen that 
i will say this for those who may wonder what the soviet 
reaction has been and its very preliminary but the initial 
contact with our embassy in moscow was i would put fairly 
positive brent is that about right 
brent scowcroft national security adviser cautious 
bush cautious but wearily sic leaning on the side of 
interpreting as saying its positive in other words they didnt 
really slam the door and come in on a negative vein 
q on that point mr president wouldnt it seem that if you 
want to strike this agreement within even as early as six months 
that there would be a summit meeting with mr gorbachev before the 
end of the year 
bush well again ive if there was something constructive to 
come out of such a meeting i would certainly be prepared to meet 
and i believe that secretary baker has conveyed that to minister 
shevardnadze 
q has mr gorbachev responded to your letter of sunday 
bush no sir 
q mr bush you used strong language yesterday about leading 
the alliance and leading the world the free world that wasnt 
your term but did you feel it was important if not for yourself 
then for the alliance for the united states to assert yourself in 
a strong way at this particular summit at this time 
bush yes i think it is highly important that the united states 
to be seen as fully engaged trying to come up with creative 
proposals and fulfilling its historic leadership responsibilities 
i would like to put it in terms of alliance unity though and what 
all these decisions theres plenty of room for credit out there 
and i would insist that its an alliance to the degree we got 
unanimity an alliance victory 
q mr president the stress you put on the speed of 
negotiations six months to a year and a decision can wait till 
92 on modernization are there some progress points if there 
are no negotiations or progress in the negotiations within a year 
do we reexamine the 1992 deadline 
bush i to be honest with you i dont know the answer to that 
question i expect i expect huh 
but my own personal view would be that if it became if 
there were some dramatic change somewhere that changed the thesises 
that underline this agreement that wed want to review things but 
im not predicting that i want to see it go forward 
q following tangible implementation thats being read as 
obviously not complete implementation could you tell us how far 
tangible is 
bush no i cant tell you how far it is but it has to be so 
that you and i would look at it and wed both agree that there had 
been sincere implementation 
q mr president in the comprehensive context you state that 
groundbased missiles will be needed as far as can be foreseen 
now even though the modernization decision has been put off is 
there any alternative to modernizing this missile 
bush is there any alternative to modernizing it we will cross 
that bridge in 1992 
q as you know mr gorbachev is coming to bonn soon and his 
operative style has been to try to up the ante when the us makes 
a proposal on your conventional arms proposal do you think youve 
gone down as far as the west can safely go in reducing conventional 
forces and can you go no further than what you proposed yesterday 
bush i see no reason about talking about further cuts and 
further reductions when we have just tabled a sound proposal that 
addresses ourselves to this enormous imbalance so i just would 
defer on that 
q mr president you were criticized early on for a slow start 
now this proposal is being described as bold you yourself said 
revolutionary i wonder if theres any element of i told you 
so in your attitude now to the reaction to this proposal 
bush not really not really no this is im not going to get 
into that game with congress or anyone else 
q mr president looking ahead what impact do you think your 
proposals will have on ussoviet relations and specifically on 
strategic arms talks 
bush i i hope that they have a that these proposals have an 
ameliorating effect that things will get only better i think its 
a serious proposal i think they see a solid united alliance and 
that is important in this and so i would hope that it would have a 
good effect on whatever follows on in strategic arms reduction 
talks follow on 
i have never doubted ive never questioned whether gorbachev 
knew that we were serious and wanted to move forward with him ive 
read speculation on this but i have reason to believe that he 
knows that we have been serious taking our time to formulate 
proposals i do think that this one will be tangible evidence of 
this 
and so i hope it would lead to if a conventional forces talks 
can be catalytic for strategic talks so be it but i hope that the 
seriousness of all of this and the unity of the alliance will be 
persuasive to him to make him know that we do want to go forward

a few dozen people ended nearly a 
week in exile and returned to a neighborhood devastated by a 
pipeline explosion while the city promised a court battle to shut 
down the line 
about 30 of the approximately 170 families evacuated received 
permission to return home monday police officer john montecino 
said by late monday only 13 of the 30 families returned to the 
area walking past signs that read enter at your own risk city 
of san bernardino 
city attorney james penman said the city would go to san 
bernardino superior court today seeking a temporary restraining 
order to prevent the 14inch line from reopening 
however its unclear whether the court would have jurisdiction 
he said because several federal agencies are responsible for 
monitoring the line 
thursdays explosion killed two people damaged or destroyed 15 
homes and forced 270 people to flee 
the blast came after pipeline owners had declared the line safe 
despite its position directly under the site of a may 12 train 
derailment that killed four and demolished a row of houses 
investigators are focusing on the possibility that the train 
wreck damaged the pressurized line operated by locally based calnev 
pipe line co 
angry city officials have challenged the company hoping to get 
the line routed away from houses 
but over the weekend calnevs parent company announced it will 
rebuild the damaged pipeline in the same location using insulated 
safetyreinforced pipe 
a twohour discussion of the matter was held monday between 
representatives of the parent firm chicagobased gatx terminals 
inc along with southern pacific railroad officials and city 
negotiators penman said more talks were scheduled today he added 
we basically explained that we want the line moved west of the 
railroad tracks and away from the houses that were destroyed or 
endangered penman said 
the pipeline owners have argued the move would keep the pipeline 
shut down for too long 
the pipeline is very critical to the national defense 
system said gatx president robert claypoole noting that the 
line supplies air force bases in california and nevada 
us district judge david williams has signed a temporary 
restraining order barring the city from interfering with repair or 
replacement of the line which moves gasoline diesel and jet fuel 
to southern nevada

iranian rebels in iraq were put on alert 
following reports that ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis health was 
deteriorating rebel leaders said today 
hussein mehdavi a senior official of the mujahedeen khalq or 
peoples holy warriors group told the associated press the 
movements military force the national liberation army of iran 
went on alert sunday 
the nla is in a state of military vigilance and will respond 
to any new situation that arises from khomeinis death he said 
in an interview at the mujahedeens headquarters in the iraqi 
capital 
the rebels claimed monday that khomeini 86 suffered a heart 
attack saturday while recovering from surgery to stop intestinal 
bleeding 
tehran television said monday that irans revolutionary 
patriarch suffered a mild heart complication over the weekend 
but was fine and was recovering well from the surgery he underwent 
may 23 
the television report gave no details of the cardiac problem but 
said the condition had been relieved 
khomeini suffered a heart attack in 1980 and is reported to have 
had another one in 1986 
mehdavi the mujahedeens foreign minister did not say what 
the iranian rebels would do if khomeini died but he said the force 
that fought alongside the iraqis against iran in the latter stages 
of the eightyear iraniraq war had been trained to intervene in 
iran and overthrow the tehran government 
mujahedeen leader massoud rajavi met with his military 
commanders at a base near the iranian border saturday mujahedeen 
sources said they discussed military and political options that 
would be opened by khomeinis death 
the rebels military strength never has been disclosed last 
year it was estimated it had more than 15000 troops along with 
tanks artillery and other heavy weapons 
weeks before the war ceasefire took effect aug 20 the force 
launched its biggest operation into western iran reaching the city 
of bakhtaran 90 miles inside the country before withdrawing 
across the iraqi border 
the mujahedeen claimed the operation was a major victory but 
iran claimed the rebels were driven back with heavy losses 
nonetheless the rebel armys ability to thrust so deep into iran 
alarmed tehran 
the mujahedeen were allied with khomeini during the 1979 
revolution that toppled shah mohammad reza pahlavi but radicals 
turned on the mujahedeen and other leftist and liberal factions in 
198081 killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of people

q mr president as you know the united states has strongly 
opposed and so has nato including aircraft in these negotiations 
up to now could you tell us what your thinking was in deciding to 
reverse that position and to propose the 15 percent cut 
bush trying to correct disparity and it was really that 
simple and i realize there have been some concerns we are very 
understanding of the french reservation in this regard i might 
say very diplomatically and beautifully expressed by president 
mitterrand but it is simply that disparity 
q mr president secretary general woerner spoke of the future 
40 years being as important if not more important than the past 
40 years of the alliance he spoke about natos vision will natos 
vision include an eastwest alliance 
bush i dont see an eastwest alliance but i see a europe much 
more free and one whose innate desire to have more democracy comes 
to the surface but i dont think i dont see it as an east and 
west joining in some alliance formal alliance if that was what 
the question was 
q now the soviet union isnt perceived as a threat anymore 
surely an eastwest alliance would then exist 
bush well ive answered my question on you asked me whether 
i thought there would be some formal alliance between pact 
countries i guess you meant between all the warsaw pact and nato 
and i dont think it would require a formal alliance in order to 
have much much better relationships that include security 
considerations but were a long way from there were just 
beginning to see the differentiation in europe and our whole 
policy for the united states let me set aside nato for a minute 
will be to watch for those changes and try to facilitate them and 
work with those who are willing to move towards freedom and 
democracy 
indeed weve made some proposals on poland i will be going to 
both poland and hungary and i will make clear that if they move 
towards these western values that have served the alliance so well 
for a long time that speaking for the united states we will be 
ready to have much better relations 
q mr president can you say this morning that there will be no 
third zero and if you can say it why cannot the comprehensive 
context 
bush i thought i already did say it there will be no third 
zero there will be no third zero partial means partial 
q mr president vice president quayle in an interview with 
reporters the other day said that if some of these eastern 
european countries moved too far toward western values that the 
soviets might intervene militarily and that we have not planned 
how we might respond to that he said we ought to do that 
do you agree that thats possible he called it a big risk do 
you agree its a big risk and do you think that we ought to be 
deciding what we would do if the soviets intervened 
bush im old enough to remember hungary in 1956 and i would 
want to do nothing in terms of statement or exhortation that would 
encourage a repeat of that and so i would leave it right there 
id like to think that the situation will move in the opposite 
direction but who would have predicted the kind of public up till 
now peaceful demonstration in tiananmen square who would have 
predicted the kind of move inside the soviet union on perestroika 
and indeed glasnost so when youre dealing with things as complex 
as relations between countries i think prudence is the order of 
the day and ive said that all along 
but back to your question i dont i dont think anyone knows 
the answer to that i mean were not certainly predicting that 
q well then do you disagree with the vice president 
bush i dont even know what he said i learned i learned 
long ago not to comment on things that i havent read personally 
when its somebody when were trying to get one member of an 
administration to be juxtaposed against another its bad business 
and im not going to do that but i have great confidence in the 
vice president i might add and i think his pronouncements on 
foreign policy have been very sound 
q mr president notwithstanding the obvious fact that they all 
work for you anyway how much of a problem if any did you have 
getting the pentagon on board on these proposals 
bush the pentagon did what it should have done and they looked 
at various options from the military standpoint and they analyzed 
it and the joint chiefs were fully engaged in the process and my 
contacts were principally but not exclusively with bill crowe 
and i would one of the things i wanted to do in talking to 
our alliance partners was assure them that our military were 
behind it was behind the final proposal indeed i was very 
pleased in talking to general galvin before this proposal was 
tabled to have his assurances that what we have proposed here is 
sound militarily and that made it a much better position to 
present to the alliance

q do you expect any foot dragging or grumbling or maybe even 
a little leaking along the way as you go forward 
bush in our own leakproof bureaucracy no i dont expect that 
and i would discourage it but is it apt to happen i would hope 
not 
q mr president were you at any point unhappy with the pace of 
the projections of that slow and lengthy policy review to the 
extent as you decribed you had a 12day sort of crash course to 
come up with a super proposal could you give us some of your 
personal how you got to this point 
bush well first we undertook these reviews im not sure all 
our everyone here understands that and i said that i needed some 
time when i became president new president january 20th to 
review not only this subject natorelated subjects but a wide 
array of subjects 
were almost through all the reviews and during this time 
i came under some fire for being recalcitrant reluctant to move 
forward indeed when mr gorbachev would make one of his many 
proposals they would be coming to me and saying well dont you 
think you have to do something and i would say no we want to 
take our time and act in a prudent manner 
i had in my mind that what we wanted to do was to be sure that 
the alliance was together on any or would come together on any 
proposal we made to the alliance but i think there was some 
feeling in congress some criticism of my speed or lack of it in 
the united states congress but im so immune to political 
criticism that i just kind of write it off i was elected to do 
what i think is right and i think weve come up with a good 
proposal here 
and i will end this being the last question not with a 
filibuster but simply to say i have been told by others here that 
the alliance really has never had a meeting thats more upbeat and 
where weve taken rather significant steps in unity 
and so whatever the weight whatever the political arrows might 
have been fired my way its all been worth it because i think we 
have something sound and solid to build on now and again i end by 
thanking my colleagues the other heads of government chiefs of 
state that were here for the total cooperation and the spirit in 
which these proposals were received and discussed and the way in 
which nato adopted its final position i think its a good thing 
its good for nato i really happen to believe that its good for 
the entire free world 
thank you all very much

the supreme court today refused to lift the 
strict advertising limits imposed on a texas counseling center that 
authorities called a fake abortion clinic run by antiabortion 
activists 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that ads run by 
the problem pregnancy center in fort worth violated a state law 
banning deceptive trade practices 
the center is run by a charitable corporation mother and unborn 
baby care of north texas inc lawyers for the center had argued 
that the state deceptivepractices law should not apply because the 
center receives no money for services it provides 
state assistant attorney general stephen gardner urged the 
justices to reject what he said was a request for a 
constitutional right to lie to pregnant women to entice them into 
a fake abortion clinic where they are urged to continue their 
pregnancy 
a state court jury ordered the center and its director charles 
j pelletier ii to include prominently in all future ads that the 
center is not an abortion clinic and does not provide abortion 
referrals or medical services 
the jury also imposed 39000 in civil fines and ordered the 
centers corporate operator and pelletier to pay 49025 in 
attorneys fees incurred by the state 
a state appeals court upheld the jury verdict and the texas 
supreme court refused to review the case last nov 16 
pelletier placed ads in the fort worth yellow pages under the 
heading abortion information and services 
during a sevenmonth period in 1986 more than 1000 women went 
to the center most of them then considering an abortion 
according to the state appeals court the women generally were 
given a free pregnancy test while waiting for the results they 
were taken into a room to see slides and a videotape showing 
graphic pictures of abortion procedures 
counselors including pelletier then attempted to persuade the 
women not to abort their pregnancies according to the state court 
state authorities said the record of the jury trial is 
replete with the experiences of pregnant women who were tricked 
into going to pelletiers center by pelletiers deceptive 
representations 
they added pelletier used the tactics of avoidance evasion 
and concealment to draw in as many women considering an abortion as 
possible to force them to hear his message without regard to their 
willingness or need to hear it 
the appeal filed in behalf of the center and pelletier said 
numerous legal actions similar to the texas lawsuit have been 
filed across the country against antiabortion clincs to prevent 
them from being able to communicate information on abortion to 
those pregnant women 
the appeal added in a truly free society speech which is 
nondefamatory nonobscene and does not economically benefit the 
speaker directly or indirectly must remain free of any 
constraints 
the case is mother and unborn bab care of north texas vs texas

the supreme court today refused to block a 
lawsuit by a philadelphia man whose daughter was placed in the 
federal witness protection program without his knowledge 
the court without comment rejected arguments aimed at giving 
federal officials greater protection against being sued 
anthony prisco sued two former attorneys general and another 
federal official in 1985 he said his rights were violated when his 
daughter lauren now 9 was moved to a new home with her mother 
maria and her mothers new husband michael morris 
the priscos were divorced in 1983 after six years of marriage 
priscos exwife remarried and soon after morris was assigned to 
the witness protection program he had cooperated with the fbi in 
an investigation of organized crimes drug trade in the 
philadelphia area 
under the government program such cooperating witnesses and 
their families are given new identities and relocated to protect 
them from retribution 
prisco with the help of a private investigator and a lawyer 
tracked down his daughter he later won shared custody of lauren 
when his exwife died prisco was granted full custody 
prisco sued william french smith who was attorney general when 
lauren was relocated in the witness program and edwin meese iii 
who held the position when the suit was filed 
the witness protection program is run by the us marshals 
service and its director stanley morris also was named as a 
defendant 
the three defendants sought to have the suit thrown out on 
immunity grounds arguing they should be shielded from such claims 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals ruled against them last 
july 
the appeals court said it was premature to consider the appeals 
by morris and meese who was still attorney general last july any 
consideration of whether they enjoy immunity must wait until after 
a trial on the lawsuit the appeals court said 
justice department lawyers in seeking supreme court review 
said barring federal officials from appealing prior to trial will 
chill their freedom to make policy decisions 
the 3rd circuit court acknowledged that the rationale for giving 
such legal immunity is that we do not want officials to make 
discretionary decisions with one wary eye on their pocketbook 
but the appeals court said priscos suit also seeks a court 
order to prevent public officials from violating his rights in the 
future since prisco seeks more than money the case against meese 
and morris must proceed to trial the appeals court said 
it said the suit against smith raises a different issue because 
he had left office before prisco sued and thus no longer was in a 
position to violate priscos right to know the whereabouts of his 
daughter 
but the appeals court rejected smiths arguments that he is 
entitled to legal immunity because at the time lauren was assigned 
to the witness program a fathers constitutional right to be told 
of his daughters relocation had not been established by the courts 
smiths contention that priscos rights to some form of notice 
was not clearly established in 1983 is totally unpersuasive the 
appeals court said 
in the appeal acted on today justice department lawyers also 
argued that smith lacked personal involvement in the prisco case 
and therefore should not have to face a potentially costly judgment 
prisco alleged nothing more than that smith had supervised the 
department of justice during the relevant period the government 
lawyers said 
the case is smith vs prisco 881039

house speaker jim wright indicated today he 
has made a decision about whether to resign in the face of ethics 
charges but refused to say what he intends to do 
wright who is widely expected to announce his resignation on 
wednesday told reporters i think i know what i should do 
i think i know what i believe to be in my best interests and 
the interests of the institution i want to be fair to myself my 
family my reputation and i want to be fair to this institution 
that ive served for 34 years the texas democrat told reporters 
wright said he would have a statement on his plans later this 
week 
sources close to wright have said he is likely to announce a 
decision to resign from his leadership post as early as wednesday 
but they cautioned that wright was torn between such a move and 
fighting the ethics charges to some legal conclusion 
more pressure to resign was applied to wright over the weekend 
when his no 2 lieutenant democratic whip tony coelho of 
california abruptly announced his own plans to resign from the 
house rather than face ethics charges involving a junk bond 
investment he said such a process would hurt the party 
wright alluded to his legal fight and to a motion to dismiss the 
most serious charges against him telling reporters im 
convinced our motions are legally well grounded 
the ethics committee is due to take up the motion to dismiss 
charges at a meeting on thursday and it is seen as likely to 
reject the defense effort 
wright added im convinced i havent violated any rule of the 
house as i understand them and as i think other members do i have 
for 34 years abided by them honored them that is my absolute 
conviction 
wright has been formally charged with 69 instances of violating 
house rules including charges he circumvented limits on outside 
income through bulk sales of a book he wrote and charges he 
improperly accepted 145000 in gifts from a fort worth texas 
businessman with a direct interest in legislation

the supreme court today let stand a decision 
banning organized prayers at the start of high school football 
games 
the court without comment refused to review a ruling in a 
georgia case that such pregame invocations impermissibly promote 
religion 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals by a 21 vote last jan 
3 said prayers carried over the public address system before 
douglas county ga high school home football games had to stop 
in a ruling affecting all public schools in georgia alabama and 
florida the appeals court said the organized prayers violated the 
separation of church and state required by past supreme court 
decisions 
but lawyers for the douglas county school board told the 
justices that pregame prayers have become as much a part of the 
tradition of high school football as the national anthem marching 
bands cheerleaders and baton twirlers 
the school boards lawyers noted that the rev billy graham 
delivered a prayer and benediction at president bushs inauguration 
in january and that each supreme court session begins with an 
invocation for divine assistance god save the united states and 
this honorable court 
the appeal acted on today argued that the douglas county 
football invocations should be reinstated on the same 
traditional grounds used by the justices when in 1983 they 
upheld states practice of opening legislative sessions with 
prayers 
the 11th circuit court rejected that argument noting that 
although state legislatures have conducted prayer sessions for over 
200 years the appeals court said invocations at 
schoolsponsored football games were nonexistent when the 
constitution was adopted 
the appeals court instead relied on the supreme courts 1962 
decision banning organized schoolsponsored prayer sessions and 
its 1963 decision banning daily bible readings 
the appeals court also invoked a 1971 decision in which the 
supreme court created a threepart test to judge the validity of 
laws challenged as violating the constitutional ban on 
establishment of religion 
under that test a law or governmental practice escapes legal 
attacks if it has a secular or nonreligious purpose its primary 
effect neither advances nor inhibits religion and it does not 
unduly entangle government and religion 
the prayers conducted before douglas county high football games 
failed all three parts of the 1971 test the appeals court said 
the pregame prayers were challenged in 1986 by doug jager then 
a douglas county high senior and member of the schools marching 
band and his father william 
doug jager told the associated press that year that his family 
was deluged with threats after his lawsuit 
a couple of callers have threatened to burn down our house 
others have threatened to wrap my saxophone around my head jager 
said in an interview 
jager three years ago described himself as more agnostic than 
anything else his younger brother still attends the high school 
the 11th circuit court said the douglas county high invocations 
at least until 1986 often mentioned jesus christ and that school 
officials refused to substitute the invocations with nonreligious 
inspirational messages 
it is clear the appeals court said that the school 
district was most interested in invocations that publicly 
express support for protestant christianity 
the case is douglas county school district vs jager 881610

the government put 109 vietnamese refugees on a 
remote island without shelter today in an effort to cope with the 
surging numbers of arriving boat people officials said 
we have had over 2300 arrivals over the past three days our 
accomodation resources have simply been overwhelmed said hong 
kong refugee coordinator mike hanson 
officials said 745 boat people arrived today and 109 were towed 
to tai a chau an island 20 miles southwest of hong kong because 
other refugee facilities were filled 
hanson said the boat people would be staying in their boat or on 
the dock at tai a chau there is one school building which some 
people may be able to use but i think most will not be able to 
have covered accomodations he said 
hanson said the boat people would remain on the island until the 
government could find a place to process them 
in june hong kong adopted a screening policy that treats all 
incoming vietnamese boat people as illegal immigrants subject to 
repatriation unless they can prove they fled political persecution

legislators today confirmed veteran 
politician lee huan as taiwans new premier to succeed yu kuohwa 
who had been criticized for his cautious approach to economic and 
political reforms 
lee educated at columbia university in new york and south 
koreas dangkook university is among the most liberal senior 
officials of the governing nationalist party and takes over as 
taiwan is trying to gain international recognition 
younger nationalist legislators considered his predecessor the 
75yearold yu a liability as the party prepared for december 
parliamentary elections yu had governed since 1984 and nominated 
lee to succeed him 
todays vote in parliament where nationalists hold 254 of the 
289 seats was 217 to 24 nine votes were declared invalid and 39 
legislators were absent 
all 12 members of the opposition democratic progressive party 
voted against lees confirmation because they said they first 
wanted him to outline his political plans to parliament 
legislative officials said cabinet appointees seldom address the 
house before being confirmed 
lee 72 was nominated by his party whose parliamentary 
majority ensured his confirmation 
he is expected to announce a 25member cabinet on wednesday amid 
reports he will make only minor changes the new premier who has 
been secretarygeneral of the governing party since 1987 helped 
groom a number of incumbent cabinet ministers he helped chiang 
chingkuo end 38 years of martial law in taiwan two years ago 
newspapers had reported that lee planned to include a member of 
the democratic progressive party in his cabinet but the press said 
today he changed his mind after objections were raised 
the appointment would have been unprecedented the nationalists 
have not included an opponent in a cabinet since they retreated to 
taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war in china since then they 
have dominated the islands politics

a trial over ownership of four sixthcentury 
byzantine mosaics considered to be worth millions of dollars 
begins today in a case that could have serious impact on art work 
considered national treasures 
on one side are lawyers representing the greek orthodox church 
of cyprus and the republic of cyprus and on the other local art 
dealer peg l goldberg 
the mosaics each about two feet square are said to have been 
chiseled from the interior of a small church in northern cyprus 
sometime before 1982 and are considered some of the oldest 
christian antiquities 
experts see the case as a landmark in the growing worldwide 
effort by lessdeveloped nations to reclaim and protect national 
treasures 
the mosaics took a circuitous trail from the mediterranean 
island to indiana attracting an exotic cast of characters 
including reputed international art smugglers and warring greek and 
turkish cypriots 
it was a year ago when goldberg learned of the mosaics tile 
portraits of jesus as a boy an archangel and the apostles matthew 
and james 
goldberg said she fell in love with the mosaics when shown them 
in july 1988 in geneva by a turk who claimed to be the former state 
archaeologist of turkishoccupied cyprus he assured her they had 
been legally exported she said and she paid 12 million for the 
four tiles 
turkish cypriot officials deny his credentials and his claim 
that the artworks were legally exported 
the greek church and the republic of cyprus are suing in us 
district court to get them back the turkish breakaway state on 
cyprus has filed a motion to intervene in the case 
goldbergs lawyer joe c emerson says she acted in good faith 
and even if the mosaics were stolen the sixyear statute of 
limitations in such cases has expired and she is no longer liable 
for prosecution 
he says officials of the church and the republic of cyprus are 
at fault for failing to properly notify the international community 
of the theft 
washington lawyer thomas r kline contends that despite 
goldbergs claim of good faith the merchandise was stolen and 
should be returned to its rightful owners in cyprus 
walter hopps director of the menil collection in houston who 
last year solved a similar problem through a loan agreement with 
cyprus said the lawsuit will become a test case 
he says if the courts uphold goldberg then the possibility 
exists that millions and millions of dollars worth of plundered 
antiquities will pour into the united states it will be a horrible 
precedent

a state death penalty law does not have to 
require juries instead of judges to make the specific findings 
authorizing imposition of capital punishment the supreme court 
ruled today 
by a 72 vote the justices upheld the death sentence of florida 
death row paul hildwin convicted of a 1985 murder 
hildwin had argued that he was denied a fair sentencing trial 
because jurors who recommended the death sentence did not make 
specific findings of any aggravating circumstances 
the sentencing judge however found four such aggravationg 
factors and no mitigating ones in imposing hildwins sentence 
the nations highest court previously upheld floridas 
sentencing system ruling in 1984 that a jury trial is not required 
on the lifeordeath decision 
the sixth amendment guaranteeing fair trials does not 
require that the specific findings authorizing the imposition of 
the sentence of death be made by the jury the court ruled today 
in an unsigned opinion 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall who oppose 
capital punishment under all circumstances dissented 
hildwin was sentenced to death for the sept 9 1985 strangling 
of vronzette cox police said she was raped and killed and her 
body locked inside the trunk of a car left in some hernando county

us agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter warned today against overreacting to southern iowas 
drought but said he understands the longrange problems caused by 
a very strange weather pattern this year 
the national guard has hauled 300000 gallons of drinking water 
to several parched southern iowa towns and we dont see an end to 
it national guard adjutant tommy thompson told yeutter 
in some sections of the state wells must be drilled to 2500 
feet before reaching water said iowa office of disaster services 
director ellen gordon 
yeutter was briefed by state officials and iowas congressional 
delegation during a tour of several southern iowa towns and farms 
state officials told yeutter that while recent rain has 
bolstered topsoil moisture longrange problems remain 
ive been around agriculture long enough to know that you 
cant always tell by whats on top yeutter said 
iowa state university climatologist elwyn taylor said the state 
may be entering a more normal rainfall period but that it begins 
the crop season even drier than last year 
the outlook as we see it right now is for normal weather 
conditions taylor said however he added normal isnt really 
quite good enough 
its a very strange year for that rainfall pattern yeutter 
said without doubt the principal concern is a concern over hay 
supplies 
yeutter said there is still a chance for major crops like corn 
and soybeans and it is too early to talk about potential drought 
damage to those crops 
thats all conjecture at this point he said 
we have to be careful we dont overestimate the problem 
that view was backed up by iowa state university crop specialist 
garren benson who said were off to a decent start for row 
corps its far too early to tell 
june is normally the month when iowa gets its heaviest rainfall 
normal rain over the next few weeks could ease the drought but 
benson warned that a dry june last year spelled death for much of 
the states agricultural production 
this is the month that really killed us last year benson 
said

bulgaria seeking to head off criticism of its 
treatment of its turkish minority took the offensive at an 
international human rights conference today and blamed foreigners 
for the ethnic unrest 
bulgaria is among 35 nations including the united states 
attending the conference on the human dimension in which nations 
will review human rights progress and take to task countries 
accused of abuses 
bulgaria romania czechoslovakia and east germany are expected 
to be singled out during the monthlong conference 
in one of the first speeches bulgarian foreign minister petar 
mladenov went on the offensive accusing foreign circles of 
being behind recent disturbances in his country 
officials in bulgaria say at least three ethnic turks have been 
killed in clashes with bulgarian security forces but turkish 
sources put the number as high as 30 
mladenov did not identify a country or group but the bulgarian 
delegation made available the text of a speech by president todor 
zhivkov saying certain circles in the republic of turkey have 
launched a continuously escalating antibulgarian campaign 
this policy represents a gross interference in the internal 
affairs of a sovereign state zhivkov said 
the bulgarian president whose speech was broadcast monday 
called on turkey to open its borders to all bulgarian moslems 
who want to go there 
the violence stems from ethnic turks opposition to a bulgarian 
assimilation campaign which includes forcing the countrys 900000 
ethnic turks to change their moslem names 
bulgaria has been deporting ethnic turks it considers 
undesirable an estimated 300 have been forced to leave and most 
have been sent to austria and yugoslavia scores have been picked 
up by turkish airliners for resettlement in turkey 
the conference that officially opened today is the first of 
three dealing with human rights and mandated by the vienna review 
meeting of the conference on security and cooperation in europe 
which ended in january 
the conference is made up of all european countries except 
albania and includes the united states and canada all signed the 
1975 helsinki final act 
unlike previous helsinki human rights followup meetings the 
paris conference is to examine how well human rights commitments 
have been implemented 
it will also be a testing ground for a mechanism worked out in 
vienna to call attention to human rights abuses within the 35 
countries 
in this century far more people have been killed by 
violations of human rights than in all the wars of this century 
morris b abram who heads the us delegation said monday 
abram said that romania was in the most flagrant violation of 
any of the states signatory to the promises of helsinki

foreign investors spent 65 billion to acquire 
or establish us businesses last year up sharply from the 403 
billion spent in 1987 the government reported today 
the commerce department attributed the 613 percent increase in 
spending last year over the 1987 level to a surge in large 
transactions with the number of investments worth 1 billion 
doubling from six to 12 in 1988 
those 12 investments accounted for 80 percent of the increase in 
spending last year 
the 65 billion in outlays included 60 billion spent to acquire 
existing us businesses and 5 billion to establish new 
operations some 164 billion of the money was spent by foreign 
direct investors while 486 billion was spent by us affiliates 
of foreign companies 
the department said several factors have made foreign investment 
in the united states attractive in recent years including strong 
us economic growth which made target companies potentially more 
profitable a large consumer market political stability and a 
strong technological base 
in addition the wave of corporate restructuring in the united 
states provided foreigners with investment opportunities and the 
decline of the dollar against foreign currencies probably led some 
firms to shift operations to the united states the department said 
concern about foreign ownership of us assets in the united 
states has prompted moves in congress to require greater disclosure 
about foreign investors and their purchases 
the commerce department said the biggest portion of the outlays 
by foreign investors last year for acquisitions and new businesses 
was the 316 billion spent in manufacturing followed by 8 
billion in retail trade and 58 billion in insurance 
britain was the biggest spender at 215 billion followed by 
japan at 142 billion and canada at 104 billion

mining companies seeking to revive a 5 percent 
cap on the royalties they pay to help finance arizona public 
schools suffered an 80 defeat in the supreme court today 
the justices upheld a ruling by the states highest court that 
the cap established by the state legislature in 1941 violates 
federal law 
todays decision is a victory for the arizona education 
association a teachers union and those taxpayers who challenged 
the cap 
the case now will return to a state trial court which was 
ordered by the state supreme court to determine what further 
relief if any is appropriate 
the dispute has its roots in arizonas drive for statehood the 
1910 law in which congress authorized people in arizona and new 
mexico to form state governments placed strict controls over how 
the new states could use land set aside to help finance public 
schools 
nearly 10 million acres in arizona was covered by the law and 
the state arizona was admitted into the union of states in 1912 
was required to obtain true value in disposing of the land and 
its products 
at issue in the case decided today was whether a 1927 law passed 
by congress loosened those strict controls lawyers for the mining 
companies argued that it had but the high court today disagreed 
the arizona legislature in 1941 permitted the state to lease the 
trust lands for a royalty of 5 percent of the net value of the 
minerals produced from the land 
the lawsuit filed by arizona education association and certain 
taxpayers contended successfully that the 5 percent cap allows a 
giveaway of resources intended to be used for the states schools 
they said royalty rates could be determined by competitive 
bidding administrative rules or casebycase negotiation they 
also urged that royalties be based on gross mineral value to bar 
companies from avoiding having to pay the state anything if costs 
exceed mineral values 
the states royalty payments from the trust lands declined from 
nearly 8 million in 1980 to 13 million in 1986 
mining companies have paid from 6 to 14 percent in royalties on 
land owned by indian tribes in arizona the justices were told 
writing for the court justice anthony m kennedy said the 
sale or lease of mineral lands granted to the state of arizona 
under these federal statutes must substantially conform to the 
mandatory requirements set out in the 1910 law 
he said the arizona supreme court was correct in declaring 
the 5 percent cap invalid as to nonhydrocarbon mineral leases 
kennedys 25page opinion included a 17page discussion on why 
the justices hold the proper authority what lawyers call 
jurisdiction to decide the case 
justices william j brennan byron r white thurgood marshall 
harry a blackmun and john paul stevens joined kennedys opinion on 
the merits of the case 
chief justice william h rehnquist and antonin scalia voted to 
dismiss the case due to a lack of jurisdiction which also would 
have resulted in a loss for the mining companies 
justice sandra day oconnor the courts only native arizonan 
did not participate in the decision

the supreme court today barred the divorced 
spouses of military veterans from sharing in retirement pay the 
veterans have converted into disability benefits 
in a 72 ruling in a california case the justices said a 1982 
federal law does not permit state court divorce decrees to divide 
the disability benefits 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said we 
realize that reading the statute literally may inflict economic 
harm on many former spouses but we decline to misread the statute 
in order to reach a sympathetic result when such a reading requires 
us to do violence to the plain language of the statute and ignore 
much of the legislative history 
justice sandra day oconnor in a dissenting opinion said 
the harsh reality of this holding is that former spouses can 
without their consent be denied a fair share of their exspouses 
military pension simply because he elects to increase his aftertax 
income by converting a portion of that pension into disability 
benefits 
justice harry a blackmun joined oconnor in dissent 
the case stems from the 1979 divorce of gerald and gaye mansell 
after 25 years of a marriage that produced six children 
mansell a retired air force major receives 1200 a month in 
retirement pay and 482 in disability benefits the disability 
benefits were converted from retirement pay by mansell because 
unlike the pension they are exempt from taxes 
the divorce settlement filed in merced county calif awarded 
gaye mansell half the retirement pay in an uncontested split of 
that money and originally half the disability benefits 
but mansell went to court in 1983 to modify the divorce decree 
and exclude the disability pay 
the california courts rejected his request 
california is a community property state meaning property 
acquired during marriage is considered jointly owned 
in other action today the supreme court 
refused to lift strict advertising limits imposed on a texas 
counseling center that authorities called a fake abortion 
clinic run by antiabortion activists the justices without 
comment let stand rulings that ads run by the problem pregnancy 
center in fort worth violated a state law banning deceptive trade 
practices 
state assistant attorney general stephen gardner contended that 
the center was seeking a constitutional right to lie to pregnant 
women to entice them into a fake abortion clinic where they are 
urged to continue their pregnancy 
let stand a decision banning organized prayers at the start of 
high school football games refusing without comment to review a 
ruling in a georgia case that such pregame invocations 
impermissibly promote religion 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals by a 21 vote last jan 
3 said prayers carried over the public address system before 
douglas county ga high school home football games had to stop 
because they violated the separation of church and state required 
by past supreme court rulings the appeals court decision affected 
all public schools in georgia alabama and florida 
refused to reinstate the conviction of a california man 
stephen edward leichty who admitted he tried illegally to ship a 
drug via air freight without comment the court left intact a 
ruling that police unlawfully searched the shipment without a 
courtissued search warrant 
ruled 72 in a florida case that a state death penalty law does 
not have to require juries instead of judges to make the specific 
findings authorizing imposition of capital punishment 
the justices upheld the death sentence of paul hildwin 
convicted of the sept 9 1985 strangling of vronzette cox police 
said she was raped and killed and her body was locked inside the 
trunk of a car left in some woods 
defeated by an 80 decision a bid by mining companies to revive 
a 5 percent cap on the royalties they pay to help finance arizona 
public schools the justices upheld a ruling by the states highest 
court that the cap established by the state legislature in 1941 
violates federal law 
the military benefits and divorce case involved a federal law 
congress passed in 1982 following a supreme court ruling that 
barred state courts from dividing military pay in divorces the 
law called the uniformed services former spouses protection act 
allows retirement pay to be subjected to alimony awards 
the high court said today that the law does not cover military 
pay veterans are allowed to convert to other purposes 
under the acts plain and precise language state courts have 
been granted the authority to treat disposable retired pay as 
community property they have not been granted the authority to 
treat total retired pay as community property said marshall 
the justice department which sided initially with mrs mansell 
changed its mind late last year and concluded that her former 
husbands interpretation of the 1982 law is correct 
the case is mansell vs mansell 87201

federally mandated rules for doling out kidneys 
discriminate against blacks who receive proportionally fewer 
organs than whites even though they are four times as likely to 
suffer kidney failure some experts say 
i dont consider it a national tragedy i consider it 
ignorance as we become more enlightened then we expect the 
system to be more fair said howard universitys dr clive o 
callender one of the nations few black transplant surgeons 
the 1yearold rules adopted by the united network for organ 
sharing which administers the national transplant network 
emphasize tissuematching between kidney donors and recipients 
callender and some others contend the rules put blacks at a 
disadvantage because a fifth of them have tissuematching problems 
that make them wait longer for kidneys most of which are donated 
by whites 
at the time the rules were made that information was not 
perceived as discriminatory callender said but we now know it 
because of studies on the black immune system 
dr william vaughn the networks director of technical 
services acknowledges the rules arent perfect but adds its a 
good system within the confines that we have to work inside of 
you cant put out quotas on organ transplants said dr paul 
eggers chief of the federal health care financing administrations 
program evaluation branch 
transplant specialists have long disputed the importance of 
tissuematching for kidneys and will continue that debate at their 
annual meeting which begins today in chicago 
proponents say the success rate for kidney recipients improves 
considerably when tissue is matched closely but critics contend 
the gains are not great enough to justify letting donated organs 
deteriorate until a close match is found 
even if tissue typing is important should we weaken its 
importance in the interest of getting minorities a better chance to 
get a transplant even if if lowers the success of the operation 
asked arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics 
at the university of minnesota 
the standardized scoring system in effect since oct 1 1987 
also takes into account severity of illness length of time 
waiting proximity to the donor size and blood compatibility 
during 1988 the first full year during which the network 
collected donor and recipient data whites received 71 percent or 
2936 of the kidneys transplanted in the united states blacks 
received 217 percent or 896 of the transplanted kidneys and 
hispanics 74 percent or 304 kidneys 
whites also got 889 percent or 1647 of the hearts 
transplanted last year 859 percent or 997 of livers and 976 
percent or 160 of pancreases according to statistics just 
released by the network 
on the opposite end 832 percent of the 4083 braindead 
victims whose organs were donated in 1988 were white about 86 
percent were black and 59 percent were hispanic well below their 
population share 
sixtytwo percent of the donors were male men also dominated on 
the receiving side getting 792 percent of hearts transplanted 
last year 497 percent of livers 606 percent of kidneys and 564 
percent of pancreases 
the virginiabased network excluded from its calculations 
recipients whose race or sex were not reported 
race has nothing to do with who gets allocated the organ 
neither does sex vaughn said it comes back to whos on the 
list and who has the disease 
blacks have more kidney failure than any other group according 
to callender because of their proclivity toward high blood 
pressure 
onethird of the 107000 americans on dialysis are black and 
onethird of the nearly 15000 people awaiting kidney transplants 
are black according to vaughn 
the gap between black and white kidney recipients could be an 
unconscious bias or a selfselection thing too eggers said 
blacks are reluctant to donate organs for the same reasons they 
are wary of transplantation according to callender those reasons 
include religious beliefs lack of transplant awareness fear of 
premature death and distrust of the whitedominated medical 
community 
we dont really know what patients want said dr philip 
held program director of the renal research program at the urban 
institute in washington 
held recently reported wealthy white men were likelier to get a 
new kidney from 1981 to 1986 than poor white men the same held 
true for black men the higher the income the likelier a 
transplant 
both dialysis and kidney transplantation are covered under the 
federal medicare program regardless of a persons age 
poorer access to health care may limit transplants for many 
women minorities and lowerincome individuals caplan said 
if americans dont all have an equal chance at access to a 
primary care doctor forget about a transplant surgeon he said

the supreme court today refused to reinstate 
the conviction of a california man who admitted he tried illegally 
to ship a drug via air freight 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that police 
unlawfully searched the shipment 
california prosecutors asked the high court to revive stephen 
edward leichtys conviction 
he pleaded no defense to possessing methamphetamine with intent 
to sell the drug and was sentenced to 120 days in jail and three 
years probation methamphetamine is a stimulant that may not be 
sold without a prescription 
a california appeals court threw out leichtys conviction last 
november 
the charges against him stemmed from the suspicions of michael 
brooks supervisor at an air freight facility at ontario airport in 
california 
in september 1986 brooks smelled ether in an empty fivegallon 
plastic container shipped to leichty brooks told leichty that 
shipping ether on an airplane is dangerous and requires special 
precautions 
a few weeks later brooks said leichty came to the terminal with 
a package for shipment the air cargo supervisor said leichty 
seemed to be very nervous and wore dark glasses inside the poorly 
lit terminal 
brooks fearing the package might be dangerous opened it up and 
found two soda bottles filled with a yellow liquid the bottles 
were packed in paper and potato chips possibly to cover up the 
liquids odor handwritten labels on the bottles said they 
contained model airplane oil 
brooks called the police who conducted inconclusive tests of 
the substance at the airport the bottles then were taken to a los 
angeles police laboratory where the substance was identified as 
methamphetamine oil 
the police then obtained a warrant to search the dormitory room 
of leichty a student at harvey mudd college the all 
scienceoriented member of the claremont colleges group in 
claremont calif and found chemical ingredients and apparatus 
used to make methamphetamine 
leichty admitted he was manufacturing the drug 
the state appeals court that overturned leichtys conviction 
ruled that police violated his rights when they tested the liquid 
at the police laboratory without a courtissued search warrant 
the appeals court said the police lab tests were not designed 
strictly to identify only contraband as were the less 
sophisticated tests at the airport the police lab tests could 
have revealed the identity of the contents even if it were a 
substance in which defendant had a legitimate privacy interest 
the appeals court said 
the supreme court in 1984 reinstated cocainepossession 
convictions against a minnesota couple in a similar case the 
convictions stemmed from the suspicions of an air freight worker 
who looked inside a damaged carboard box addressed to the couple 
but the california appeals court said in leichtys case the 
police lab tests were broader than those used to identify cocaine 
in the minnesota case 
there is no evidence that the los angeles police lab tests 
were limited only to those which would reveal the presence of 
contraband drugs the state court said 
the california attorney generals office urged the justices to 
use the case to allow police to search without a warrant whenever a 
package shipped by a private company is obviously contraband 
the case is california vs leichty 881666

the supreme court today set aside a 157500 
award won by the mother of a los angeles county man who committed 
suicide in jail 
the justices by a 72 vote told a federal appeals court to 
restudy its ruling that the inmates rights were violated because 
he was not given adequate psychiatric care 
the justices told the lower court to reconsider its ruling in 
light of their feb 28 decision that local governments may be sued 
successfully for monetary damages when deliberate indifference 
results in inadequately trained employees violating someones 
rights 
justices thurgood marshall and john paul stevens dissented 
voting to leave intact the mothers legal victory 
in the los angeles case sergio alvarez cabrales was jailed on 
oct 27 1983 on a burglary charge 
on dec 16 of that year he attempted to kill himself after he 
was placed in a part of the los angeles county mens central jail 
for the mentallly disturbed he was saved when two guards caught 
him about to leap from the top of the cell bars with blanket strips 
tied around his neck 
a prison psychiatrist said the suicide attempt was a gesture 
intended to convince authorities to put him back with the general 
prison population 
on jan 3 1984 cabrales then in isolation for fighting was 
found dead hanging from a towel rack in his cell with an ace 
bandage around his neck 
his mother josefina cabrales sued in federal court that said 
the county and jail employees demonstrated deliberate 
indifference to her sons medical and psychiatric needs 
a jury in 1987 ruled that the county and ronald black the 
jails director violated cabrales rights the county was ordered 
to pay mrs cabrales 150000 and black was ordered to pay 7500 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals upheld the ruling last 
december 
the appeals court rejected arguments by black and county 
officials that there was no proof they adopted a policy of 
deliberate indifference to cabrales 
this contention misses the point the appeals court said 
adding that there is no need to demonstrate an affirmative act of 
deliberate indifference to prove a violation of an inmates rights 
the very notion of deliberate indifference connotes a regime 
where neglect proves a constitutional violation the appeals 
court said 
it said the jury properly could find cabrales was denied access 
to adequate care noting there was evidence the undermanned 
psychiatric staff spent only minutes per month with disturbed 
inmates 
the case is los angeles county vs cabrales 881581

merchants barricaded their shops 
today and police guarded grocery stores after president raul 
alfonsin declared a state of siege to stop looting by people driven 
to desperation by the economy 
more than 1500 people have been arrested nationwide in five 
days of unrest according to reports from officials in major 
cities many of the looters were women and children caught eating 
in supermarkets and fleeing with food 
at least three people were killed monday during looting and 
riots in the northern city of rosario the nations thirdlargest 
city and scene of the worst violence the government news agency 
telam said 
i had a shotgun and had prepared a system to electrify the 
doors one shopkeeper in rosario pablo davola told the noticias 
argentinas news agency but when looters came in there were many 
people i knew people from the neighborhood he said 
police said about 750 people were arrested and 41 were injured 
in rosario another 500 were arrested in working class suburbs of 
buenos aires 
alfonsin declared a 30day state of siege monday night the 
order suspends civil liberties in an attempt to end unrest by 
people angered by soaring inflation rising unemployment a 
devalued currency and shrunken wages 
the alfonsin government which replaced a military dictatorship 
had no alternative than this measure to preserve order and 
guarantee the property and liberty of citizens said interior 
minister juan carlos pugliese 
most of the capitals businesses were closed today and some 
shopkeepers barricaded their stores schools closed monday 
remained shut and public transportation was scarce 
two bombs exploded in buenos aires early today but there were 
no injuries 
one destroyed the entrance of an office of the radical civic 
union party which was defeated in may 14 elections many have said 
the defeat by the peronists was because of the economic problems 
the other bomb caused some damage outside a communist youth 
federation office 
argentina rich in resources and once one of the worlds 
wealthiest nations has been in steady decline for years many 
trace the crisis back to the policies of former president gen juan 
domingo peron who nationalized industries and expanded social 
programs and public employment allowing government to grow too big 
after he was elected president in 1946 
things took a turn for the worse in february when the central 
bank stopped selling us dollars to prop up the national currency 
the austral since then it has been devalued by 90 percent against 
the dollar 
the country has a 59 billion foreign debt and inflation hit 
nearly 388 percent last year inflation this month may top 70 
percent which amounts to an annual rate of 58162 percent 
government austerity measures have added to the difficulties faced 
by argentinas people 
it was the second uprising of its kind to strike a latin 
american nation in four months in february at least 276 people 
died in venezuela when rioting broke out over a government 
austerity plan aimed at easing payments on the foreign debt 
in the western city of mendoza where a supermarket was 
firebombed friday several others were looted monday in cordoba 
where 200 looters were arrested last week there was a hunger 
march cordoba is argentinas secondlargest city mendoza its 
fourthlargest 
pugliese blamed the unrest on ultraleftists who want to 
cause anarchy he cited the coordination of assaults jamming of 
police radio signals and pamphlets urging alfonsin to resign and 
workers to strike 
leftist leaders denounced the state of siege and blamed the 
disturbances on the failure of alfonsins economic policy 
the way to calm people down is to grant an immediate salary 
hike of 100 percent index wages weekly freeze prices and tell 
businesses and stores on pain of confiscation to deliver 
immediately food and medicine at the frozen prices said deputy 
luis zamora of the movement toward socialism 
the dead in rosario were identified by police as jose la rosa 
47 shot in the neck by people firing from a passing car juana 
amelia mazzi 66 who suffered a heart attack during a melee at a 
supermarket and an unidenfied man shot at another supermarket 
under the state of siege police may conduct raids without 
obtaining warrants and make arrests without specific charges 
presidentelect carlos menem who is due to take office on dec 
10 backed the decree saying this wave of confrontations of 
disturbances of lootings must stop

president mikhail s gorbachev on tuesday outlined 
a system of legislative oversight that would invest the fulltime 
legislature and national parliament with broad powers to change the 
constitution question government officials and review state 
spending 
he also said the new legislature called the supreme soviet 
should create a commission that would act as a constitutional court 
to ensure the transition to a nation ruled by law and respectful of 
individual rights 
the powers of the new parttime parliament the congress of 
peoples deputies and of the supreme soviet appear aimed at 
creating expert policymaking bodies independent of the communist 
party bureaucrats who have run the country for decades and whom 
gorbachev blames for slowing his reforms 
in his speech to the congress gorbachev foresaw the following 
powers for the 542seat supreme soviet 
review of state economic plans and the budget 
review of appointments to key posts and ambassadorships 
calling government ministers to account for mistakes 
ratification of foreign treaties 
review of privileges for the elite 
keeping deputies in the 2250seat congress informed of its 
activities 
making and reviewing laws while passing key legislation to 
the congress or even to the nation for confirmation or rejection by 
referendum 
gorbachev said the aim of his reforms was to create a system 
combining features of the soviets the councils set up after the 
1917 bolshevik revolution with experience culled from western 
parliamentary systems 
for this to work he said deputies must receive the practical 
means to maintain contact with voters 
however he did not specify whether the deputies would be given 
offices and fulltime staff like members of western legislatures 
nor did he say how much public access there would be to committee 
reviews of economic and state policy 
many other details of the reform of the soviet system including 
the makeup of the committee for constitutional compliance or 
constitutional court as well as plans to delegate power to the 
republics and selfgoverning regions were only vaguely outlined by 
gorbachev 
his speech was filled with a sense of caution instilled by 
recognition of mistakes made in the reform effort the work 
involved in drafting or changing at least 50 comprehensive laws 
and the massive economic ethnic and social woes of his country 
reformers such as boris n yeltsin and sociologist tatyana 
zaslavskaya pronounced the speech too cautious saying more radical 
solutions were needed 
but some deputies immediately took up his call to question 
government ministers and senior planners suspected of failing to 
implement his economic reforms to date 
arkady p yanenko head of the engineering institute in the 
siberian city of novosibirsk criticized the performance of the 
soviet government during the debate period that followed 
gorbachevs speech 
maybe there is an increase in supplies in the restaurant for 
the state committee of statistics he quipped but they havent 
got down to us

about 200 americans are quietly talking trade 
with their chinese counterparts this week amid student protesters 
clamoring for democracy and political factions trying to purge 
rivals they blame for the turmoil 
the 2nd uschina joint session on industry trade and economic 
development opened monday with far less fanfare than last year but 
participants said tuesday they were undeterred by the political 
troubles 
there isnt any business uncertainty on the american side 
said william kinch chairman of grace china ltd a subsidiary of 
the new yorkbased accounting firm wr grace the chinese are 
saying this will have no bearing on economic policy in the future 
chinese participants have stressed the point that all sides to 
the internal political debate are keeping the door open to the 
west said washington attorney michael zacharia former assistant 
secretary for export administration in the commerce department 
but the sixweek prodemocracy student movement and the ensuing 
power struggle among the chinese leadership has cast a long shadow 
over the conference 
last year it opened in the great hall of the people chinas 
seat of government with a childrens drum and cymbal corps 
greeting 1000 us businesssmen and premier li peng giving a 
welcoming address 
the great hall was ruled out this year the adjacent tiananmen 
square is occupied by thousands of students many demanding lis 
resignation for imposing martial law on beijing to put down their 
protests 
the american side organized by people to people international 
citizen ambassador program of spokane wash decided to cancel an 
economic summit when it became obvious chinas top leaders had 
other things on their minds 
a chinese trade show had to be called off because exhibitors 
from outside beijing couldnt get their goods to the capital a 
special train arranged to take the americans to other chinese 
cities was canceled although regional visits will go ahead as 
planned 
only about 200 americans mostly from small and mediumsized 
businesses made the trip well below original estimates 
there was a lot of uncertainty among american delegates before 
getting here said people to people chairman norman swanson 
adding he was impressed with the perseverance of those who 
decided to come 
stephen e guisinger a university of texas professor who heads 
the joint center for chinaus management studies quoted one of 
his fellow delegates as saying the political crisis was a stress 
test for the chinese 
its a good opportunity to see how china reacts under 
stress he said 
guisinger also argued it is inevitable that china adopt a more 
open political system as it opens its economy to the outside world 
the current upheaval he said could have positive results 
the americans predicted us investment in china will fall in 
the short run but blamed that more on an economic austerity policy 
in effect since last fall to cool off the overheated economy and 
bring down a 30 percent rate of inflation 
guisinger said americans selling goods china badly needs or 
negotiating longterm business links should have no problems but 
the businessman hoping to sell 100 million in computers in the 
next two years is going to run into difficulties

the effort by prime minister noboru takeshita to 
name a successor ran into trouble tuesday as two former leaders of 
japan refused to support his choice 
in a meeting with takeshita former prime ministers takeo fukuda 
and zenko suzuki suggested the posts of prime minister and 
president of the governing liberal democratic party be held by 
different people a departure from party practice 
there can only be one prime minister but one or several 
others should assume leadership of the party fukuda said after 
the meeting 
he said no single person can reverse the crisis caused by an 
influencepeddling scandal that has forced takeshitas resignation 
fukuda said takeshita who reportedly favors foreign minister 
sousuke uno for both posts promised to consider the proposal 
the liberal democrats who have ruled japan since the party was 
founded 34 years ago have watched the the affair plunge party 
popularity to unprecedented lows and fear sharp losses in summer 
elections for half the upper house of parliament 
takeshita has indicated he hopes to leave office this week 
but unos candidacy was challenged by senior leaders who say he 
may not be able to win back public confidence because of his close 
political ties to former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone under 
whose 198287 tenure the scandal occurred the outcry forced 
nakasone to resign from the party sunday 
the executive council which sets liberal democratic policy 
tuesday ordered measures to salvage the partys damaged image 
it said profits from the scandal should be passed on to japanese 
society in an asyet undefined way and that members linked to the 
affair should be denied government or party posts for an 
unspecified period 
the package left implementation of many reforms to each 
politicians discretion 
this is not going to satisfy the people said governing 
party legislator tsuneo suzuki 
osamu yatabe of the japan socialist party who led the 
parliamentary investigation into the scandal asked who do you 
think will welcome getting the dirty recruit money back the only 
way to take responsibility is for all the politicians linked to the 
scandal to retire from politics entirely 
recruit co an information and publishing conglomerate is 
accused of seeking favors and influence through huge political 
donations and bargainpriced share transactions

bureaucrats have been charged in the case

force bombing range be closed scaled fences and stormed the range 
injuring 10 airmen military officials said tuesday 
about 100 farmers and villagers attacked the kooni range about 
70 miles southwest of seoul on monday night said sgt will baker 
an air force spokesman 
the protesters assaulted military guards with clubs and rocks 
slightly injuring the airmen he said a korean civilian worker 
also was beaten baker said 
he said air force personnel retreated to a dormitory after one 
attacker pulled out a knife the villagers then hurled rocks 
through windows he said

the us air force base in the central city of osan dispatched a 
team of 24 security police to the range by helicopter but there 
were no clashes between the security police and the attackers air 
force officials said

wooden bridges long ago relegated to 
picture postcard status are making a comeback as engineers merge 
todays technologies with the material of yesteryear 
wood is so commonplace says john crist director of the 
us forest service timber bridge program it just hasnt been 
sexy like steel and concrete 
with deteriorating bridges on the increase and state and federal 
highway funds being squeezed timber is getting a new look from 
engineers and government planners who for years have favored 
concrete and steel 
crist and others say new designs for wood allow timber bridges 
to support the same 40ton trucks as concrete and steel they also 
claim wood will last longer and is cheaper to build and maintain 
but those who would make wood the product of choice must 
overcome the fact that it has been dismissed as outdated for so 
long 
thats our toughest nut to crack most of our engineers in 
this country have been trained in steel and concrete crist said 
timber bridges have long been used in the nations most remote 
areas and vermonts covered bridges have been in service for more 
than a century but state and local officials have shied away from 
using timber in federally funded projects because federal standards 
are geared to concrete and steel 
what weve had is a whole lot of cadillacs where chevys and 
fords will do fine simply because thats the way we can get these 
funds said dennis borchardt a resource economist and executive 
director of the george aiken research conservation and development 
area in randolph 
the campaign to bring back timber is being fueled by a 33 
million federal program designed to construct 80 timber bridges in 
30 states by next year 
the goals behind the federal initiative are to expand the market 
for less popular types of wood stimulate the local economy and 
eventually create standard timber bridge designs easy enough for 
local road crews to construct crist said 
to boost wood as the material of choice in vermont a 
demonstration bridge is being built in norwich with completion 
scheduled to coincide with a midjune conference on timber bridges 
also this year the state is sponsoring what officials say is 
the first bridge design competition since 1889 when a jury chose a 
design for the harlem river bridge in new york city now called the 
washington bridge 
the state competition is intended to stimulate design proposals 
with an emphasis on the use of vermont materials for the hundreds 
of town bridges that need to be replaced 
federal experts say as many as half the nations 550000 bridges 
are deficient in some way supporters of timber bridges say most of 
those are short to medium spans many of which would be suited for 
timber 
the bridge in norwich in eastern vermont uses one of the newest 
construction methods known as stressed deck construction which 
was developed in canada when bridges made of wood glued together 
began coming apart 
the construction uses panels of wood with steel rods running 
through them and allows smaller trees to be used in building the 
bridge 
we dont have a lot of very large trees left any more if we 
want to cross a 75foot river we have to find other ways to do 
it said barry dickson a timber bridge engineer 
for some of those involved in the new bridge projects the most 
compelling argument for returning to wood is not its cost or 
availability it is woods beauty 
in the middle of the national forest it would be nice not to 
have steel and concrete said jim moore of new hampshires 
municipal highway division

officials using sonar today detected what 
appear to be two vehicles in a turbulent river where a onelane 
temporary bridge collapsed last week the hamilton county sheriff 
said 
four people are believed missing as a result of the collapse of 
the bridge over the great miami river on friday said sheriff simon 
leis jr 
but leis said the current was still too swift to send in divers 
today they might not be able to enter the river seven miles west 
of cincinnati until thursday he said 
a sheriffs department boat equipped with sonar found what they 
believe are two vehicles near the bridge leis said seven boats 
and a helicopter searched the river 
officials havent been able to determine how many people died in 
the collapse they had thought a car and a van were swept into the 
river but leis said the people in the van have since turned up 
two women from nearby green township riding together in a car 
were still missing today they had not come home since friday 
night said col ramon hoffbauer of the sheriffs department 
in addition leis said two other people also were missing 
the water level has dropped below 12 feet from a high friday 
night of 23 feet seven feet above flood stage 
the temporary bridge located next to a permanent span still 
under construction opened to traffic dec 15 the new bridge is to 
replace a 94yearold structure 
officials said the combination of the rivers current and the 
pounding from waterborne debris probably caused the collapse 
hamilton county engineers said they wont begin their investigation 
until the river falls and the current slows 
the national transportation safety board joined the 
investigation monday spokesman alan pollock said

the supreme court today refused to reinstate 
the murder convictions and life sentence of a south dakota man 
accused of murdering two men in codington county 17 years ago 
the justices without comment let stand a south dakota supreme 
court ruling that steven satters statements to a county sheriff 
were inadmissible because his rights were not read to him prior to 
questioning 
satter was convicted of the aug 20 1972 shooting deaths of 
kent engle and jerry bowling at their trailer home near pelican 
lake at his trial satter contended he had acted in selfdefense 
the two victims bodies were not located until april 2 1973 
after satter then in the codington county jail on burglary 
charges directed sheriff curtis berg to a rockpile along an 
abandoned railroad track south of kranzburg 
at satters trial berg testified that he had received an 
anonymous telephone call the day before his conversation with 
satter the caller identified where the bodies were located and 
indicated that satter might be involved 
after looking for the bodies unsuccessfully berg went back to 
the jail and questioned satter initially about some burglaries in 
the area and then about the missing bodies 
berg testified that he did not tell satter before questioning 
him about his right to remain silent or have a lawyers help nor 
warn him that anything he said could be used against him 
the south dakota supreme court last jan 4 threw out satters 
conviction ruling that his april 2 statement to berg should have 
been excluded from his trial the state court also ordered a 
pretrial hearing to determine whether later statements satter made 
after receiving miranda warnings are admissible a circuit judge 
will rule on whether satter is entitled to a new trial 
the state court also ordered a pretrial hearing to determine 
whether statements satter made to police after his april 2 remarks 
to berg all after receiving socalled miranda warnings are 
admissible as evidence 
in the appeal acted on today state attorney general roger 
tellinghuisen relied heavily on a 1985 decision by the nations 
highest court 
in it the justices said a criminal suspects confession to 
police given after he was advised of his socalled miranda rights 
may be used as trial evidence even though an earlier confession was 
obtained without such warnings 
tellinghuisen told the justices that the statements satter made 
to police after april 2 should are admissible under the 1985 ruling 
the attorney general added that because those statements were 
admissible at satters first trial the use of his unlawfully 
obtained april 2 argument should have been ruled harmless error 
the case is rist vs satter 881661

the people of burma whose own dreams 
of democracy were crushed brutally a year ago are finding new 
inspiration in the student uprising in neighboring china 
the burmese governments response to protest was much harsher 
than chinas has been soldiers opened fire on crowds of peaceful 
demonstrators killing thousands 
in september the military banned all protest 
about a dozen students defied the ban thursday and rallied 
outside the rangoon university campus shouting slogans in support 
of the chinese protest a western diplomat reported from the 
burmese capital 
tin oo chairman of the national league for democracy the main 
burmese opposition party said the next day that police detained 
six activists who stuck posters to trees in solidarity with the 
chinese he said the six had sought legal advice from him 
moe thi zun a 24yearold student leader said at least the 
chinese government has some respect for the students in burma the 
students are just shot down in the streets 
he was among those who fled to the thai border when burmese 
authorities began arresting students who organized demonstrations 
in march and april 1988 
just as in china this spring millions of people followed 
burmese university students into the streets marching and shouting 
for an end to more than a quartercentury of repression they 
forced the resignations of three presidents and ended oneparty 
rule but the army still runs the country 
before leaving burma moe thi zun led the democratic party for a 
new society the main student political party 
at rallies this month aung san suu kyi coleader with tin oo 
of the national league for democracy contrasted the chinese 
attitude with the refusal by burmese authorities to have any 
contact with dissidents she is campaigning for general elections 
the government has promised to hold in may 1990 
tin oo said by telephone from rangoon we started with a 
student movement so everyone has strong feelings for what is 
happening in china his reference was to a tradition of student 
activism that began with the period leading up to independence from 
great britain in 1948 
the official press has printed nothing about developments in 
china and the government has made no comment for information 
burmese listen to the british broadcasting corp and voice of 
america 
events in china have boosted morale among about 3000 students 
who remain in the border area living in harsh jungle conditions 
with ethnic rebels groups who have spent 40 years fighting for 
autonomy 
it makes them realize they are not alone moe thi zun said 
in an interview they can see there are people like them 
struggling for democracy 
he said many burmese students are disturbed by the decline in 
news coverage of their struggle 
it is particularly sad because the students in burma went 
through even greater hardships than those in china he said 
now it is not worthy of page one even though there are many still 
suffering

sales of new homes were up a strong 109 
percent in april the government said tuesday but housing 
economists say the industry will remain on the downside at least 
into summer because of high interest rates 
the increase in sales to 620000 units on a seasonally adjusted 
annual basis was due to an aberration in sales in february and 
march when they dropped 109 percent and 104 percent the 
economists said 
the april increase was the steepest since a 139 percent jump in 
february 1988 
analysts were divided over how soon the housing market would 
pick up 
we view the market tone as generally weakening said david 
seiders chief economist for the national association of home 
builders 
were looking for further weakening in certainly the third 
quarter perhaps the fourth as well he said 
but richard peach deputy chief economist for the mortgage 
bankers association said that while the industry still is in a 
slowing trend the second quarter will be the trough 
as lower intrest rates kick in sales will increase as the 
summer goes on peach said 
fixedrate mortgage interest reached a peak of 1122 percent in 
march and began to drop in april averaging between 1099 percent 
and 1111 percent according to a weekly national survey by the 
federal home loan mortgage corp 
rates had been rising for over a year as the federal reserve 
tightened credit in an attempt to stem inflation 
david w berson chief economist for the federal national 
mortgage association said he too thinks housing activity will 
increase as mortgage rates continue to fall 
we dont expect a tremendous surge in housing activity but we 
do expect it to bounce back a little bit from the levels we saw in 
february and march he said were likely to see new home sales 
between 600000 and 650000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis 
over the next several months 
the april sales level compares with new home purchases totaling 
676000 in 1988 and 671000 in 1987 
john tuccillo chief economist for the national association of 
realtors also sees a slight pickup in sales activity later this 
year 
we anticipate new home sales will pick up slightly during the 
second half of 1989 ending the year with a sales total of about 
640000 he said 
the west paced the april rebound with a 313 percent increase in 
sales to 193000 it was followed by a 212 percent jump to 234000 
units in the south 
sales fell 68 percent to 96000 homes in the midwest and 172 
percent also to 96000 in the northeast 
the falloff in sales in the northeast where housing costs 
generally are highest was the major cause for a 9000 drop in the 
median price of homes to 117000 last month the analysts said 
it was the first medianprice decline since a 2500 decrease 
last november the median price represents the level where half of 
the homes cost more and half less 
the average price which is affected by sales of expensive 
homes totaled 145700 in april down 4800 from the previous 
month

the director of public prosecutions said tuesday 
he has decided against prosecuting subway officials for an 
escalator fire that killed 31 people a ruling deplored by victims 
relatives and a firefighters union 
allan green in charge of prosecutions brought by the police 
said he had insufficient evidence to bring charges of manslaughter 
or endangering life by neglect 
the case has been turned over to the health and safety 
executive a regulatory body for possible legal action green said 
an official report blamed executive complacency and an untrained 
staff response for the nov 18 1987 fire that erupted in busy 
kings cross station during the evening rush hour 
a lighted match falling through a gap in escalator treads 
ignited grease and debris on the escalator tracks and funneled 
flames upward to a ticketing plaza that became an inferno 
i am not surprised by this decision but i am bitterly 
disappointed said the fire brigades unions national officer 
dave matthews 
once again it shows that eminent people in positions of power 
and on good salaries seem on occasions to be beyond the law he 
said how they can come up with such a finding when 31 people 
lost their lives is unacceptable 
sophie tarassenko whose brother ivan was killed said that 
after such a catastrophe of this scale it does seem astonishing 
that corporate responsibility will not be acknowledged through a 
prosecution

president bush and the western allies 
hammered out a lastminute compromise over nuclear missiles today 
and ended unityminded nato summit talks pledging to shape a new 
political order of peace in europe 
bush urged soviet president mikhail s gorbachev to accept his 
challenge to intensify negotiations on reducing conventional nato 
and warsaw pact forces i have reason to believe that he knows 
weve been serious bush said 
the president said he hoped gorbachev will be persuaded by the 
unity of the alliance behind bushs proposals for lowering 
troop levels to 275000 on each side and negotiating new ceilings 
for tanks aircraft and other conventional weapons on the european 
continent 
bush said his goal was to finally free europe from the 
constant threat of a surprise attack and the shadow of soviet 
military power and as an inducement to gorbachev he said his 
arms proposals should save him a lot of money in the long run 
i think its a good thing its good for nato i happen to 
think its good for the entire free world bush told a televised 
postsummit news conference before he flew to bonn for further 
talks with west german chancellor helmut kohl 
during a 30minute session kohl thanked bush for resolving the 
dispute over shortrange weapons that had threatened to disrupt the 
summit and hailed the compromise plan as a move that shows 
inspiration emanating from the leadership of the united states 
mr president it was a wise and right decision at a very 
important point in time kohl said during a brief exchange with 
reporters following the meeting 
the president said the united states is very pleased with the 
reaction to the nato decision taken 
bush said secretary of state james a baker iii had told soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze that the united states was 
interested in a superpower summit before the end of the year 
if there was something constructive to come out of such a 
meeting i would certainly be prepared to meet and i believe that 
secretary baker has conveyed that to minister shevardnadze bush 
said 
baker said in an interview on abctvs good morning america 
show that plans for a bushgorbachev summit will depend on the 
soviet leaderships reaction to the presidents latest proposals 
the 16 summit leaders disposed of a potentially disruptive issue 
by embracing a compromise formula for ussoviet negotiations on 
reducing but not eliminating shortrange nuclear weapons bush 
told reporters he would never accept a nuclearfree europe 
then in a final communique ending their twoday talks the 
allied leaders acknowledged bushs goal of completing eastwest 
negotiations on reducing conventional arms within the next year 
arriving in paris for a human rights conference shevardnadze 
said the bush proposals were attractive and a step in the 
right direction but he said it will take time to examine the 
american proposals in detail and determine the position of the 
ussr 
the summit leaders also welcomed widespread changes under way in 
the soviet union and east europe initiated by gorbachevs reform 
policies 
the possibilities for fruitful dialogue have significantly 
improved in recent years they said the allies are resolved to 
grasp this opportunity 
the allies said attainment of lasting peace will require that 
the unnatural division of europe and particularly of germany be 
overcome 
in a separate declaration the summiteers said we want to 
overcome the painful division of europe which we have never 
accepted we want to move beyond the postwar period they said 
they wanted to shape a new political order of peace in europe 
the missile agreement was endorsed by the united states britain 
and west germany key antagonists in the dispute and nato 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner credited bush for summits happy 
ending his leadership set the tone for the whole meeting 
woerner said 
the agreement drafted after eight hours of intense bargaining 
by nato foreign ministers authorizes the united states to begin 
negotiations with the soviets to achieve a partial reduction of 
shortrange nuclear missiles once implementation of a conventional 
arms agreement begins 
the word partial was underlined presumably at the 
insistence of the british who had vehemently opposed a west german 
preference for negotiations to eliminate all such missiles 
kohl couldnt resist taking a few jabs at british prime minister 
margaret thatcher his chief adversary in the missile dispute 
margaret thatcher stood up for her interests in her 
temperamental way kohl amid laughter from reporters we do 
sometimes have differences of opinion we have different 
temperaments and shes a woman and im not 
praising bushs leadership mrs thatcher said she was very 
very satisfied with the missile agreement as for the west 
germans she said it is all written there very firmly indeed 
and wriggle as they may that is what they have all signed up 
for 
at the final summit session bush declared that a strong 
europe means a strong america and that us troops would remain 
on european soil as long as needed 
the missile issue once threatened to disrupt the summit 
celebration of natos 40th anniversary but harmony was assured 
when west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher gave up 
his fight for negotiating a total missile ban 
its a success genscher said 
under the compromise nato will delay until 1992 a vote on 
whether to modernize lance tactical nuclear weapons in light of 
overall security developments 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush regarded 
the summit as a very decisive and historic turning point for the 
nato alliance 
the postmidnight missile accord was the second major 
achievement of the twoday summit on monday president bush 
proposed and the allies endorsed a plan for cutting american and 
soviet combat troops in europe to 275000 on each side 
bush and kohl had represented opposing camps in the quarrel over 
shortrange nuclear missiles the compromise which the white house 
said was crafted primarily by baker was written to allow each 
leader to claim a partial victory 
were very satisfied kohl told reporters as he entered nato 
headquarters this morning for the final summit session asked how 
the agreement was reached bush replied very carefully 
british sources said mrs thatcher had abandoned her effort to 
have the final agreement include a reservation explicitly 
forbidding a negotiated elimination of all tactical nuclear weapons 
these sources said mrs thatcher was pleased that the agreement 
would allow negotiators to reduce but not eliminate the nato 
and warsaw pact shortrange missiles the compromise reached after 
eight hours of bargaining was a very good outcome said one 
british source our position is now safeguarded 
the cutbacks would be linked to the eastwest talks in vienna to 
reduce troops tanks artillery and other conventional weapons the 
missile negotiations could not begin until an accord was reached to 
reduce those conventional forces and the two alliances had actually 
started to carry out those cutbacks 
and the nuclear cutbacks could not start until the conventional 
cuts were finished said the us official 
for bonn the agreement puts the alliance in favor of eventual 
missile negotiations if certain conditions are met washington and 
london had opposed such talks 
for washington the language ensures that negotiations would not 
start in the near future and would be tied to large soviet cutbacks 
in conventional arms moreover it provides only for partial 
reductions not the total elimination of the weapons 
the draft communique sidesteps another contentious issue by 
calling for keeping the missiles up to date but not specifically 
saying when they should be modernized 
the united states and britain want to more than triple the range 
of 88 usbuilt lance launchers to just under 300 miles while the 
west germans opposed making the weapons more powerful

burmas military government has changed 
the countrys official name to reflect its ethnic diversity a move 
apparently aimed at cooling unrest a diplomatic source said 
a military spokesman announced last week that the official name 
union of burma was being changed to the union of myanma to 
reflect that there are other ethnic groups beside the burmese 
majority a western diplomat in rangoon said 
for four decades a dozen ethnic guerrilla groups controlling 
vast rural areas have been fighting for greater autonomy from the 
government 
last year the government dropped the socialist republic 
from the countrys name to show its willingness to end a quarter 
century of ruinous rigid socialist policies 
the diplomat reached by telephone from bangkok said public 
reaction to the announcement has been apathetic 
the government has made a series of mostly superficial 
tentative changes in the economy and the political system since 
millions of people marched in the streets nationwide last year to 
demand democracy the military ended the marches by shooting dead 
thousands of peaceful demonstrators 
a general election has been promised for may 1990 but 
authorities have constantly harassed the main opposition party the 
national league for democracy 
the national democratic front guerrilla coalition combines 10 
ethnic groups opposed to the government of gen saw maung and 
claims to control half of burma the largest single guerrilla group 
is the karen national union

here are excerpts of the statement 
issued by nato at the conclusion of the twoday summit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the overriding objective of the alliance is to preserve peace in 
freedom to prevent war and to establish a just and lasting 
peaceful order in europe 
the achievements of the lasting peaceful order which the 
allies seek will require that the unnatural division of europe and 
particularly of germany be overcome and that as stated in the 
helsinki final act the sovereignty and territorial integrity of 
all states and the right of peoples to selfdetermination be 
respected and that the rights of all individuals including their 
right to political choice be protected 
the basic goal of the alliances arms control policy is to 
enhance security and stability at the lowest balanced level of 
forces and armaments consistent with the requirements of the 
strategy of deterrence 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
arms control alone cannot resolve longstanding political 
differences between east and west nor guarantee a stable peace 
nonetheless achievement of the alliances goal will require 
substantial advances in arms control as well as more fundamental 
changes in political relations success in arms control in 
addition to enhancing military security can encourage improvements 
in the eastwest political dialogue and thereby contribute to the 
achievement of broader alliance objectives 
in addition to agreements already reached there has been 
substantial progress in the start negotiations which are intended 
to reduce radically strategic nuclear arsenals and eliminate 
destabilizing offensive capabilities 
there has also been substantial progress on other matters 
important to the west soviet troops have left afghanistan there 
has been movement toward the resolution of some although not all 
of the remaining regional conflicts in which the soviet union is 
involved 
prospects are now brighter than ever before for lasting 
qualitative improvements in the eastwest relationship there 
continue to be clear signs of change in the internal and external 
policies of the soviet union and of some of its allies at the 
same time serious concerns remain the ambitious soviet reform 
program which the allies welcome will take many years to 
complete its success cannot be taken for granted given the 
magnitude of the problems it faces and the resistance generated 
the progress recently made in eastwest relations has given new 
impetus to the arms control process and has enhanced the 
possibilities of achieving the alliances arms control objectives 
which complement the other elements of the alliances security 
policy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
alliance security policy aims to preserve peace in freedom by 
both political means and the maintenance of a military capability 
sufficient to prevent war and to provide for effective defense the 
fact that the alliance has for forty years safeguarded peace in 
europe bears witness to the success of this policy 
improved political relations and the progressive development of 
cooperative structures between eastern and western countries are 
important components of alliance policy 
in underlining the importance of these facts for the formulation 
of alliance policy the allies reaffirm that the search for 
constructive dialogue and cooperation with the countries of the 
east including arms control and disarmament is based on political 
solidarity and adequate military strength 
from its inception the alliance of western democracies has been 
defensive in purpose this will remain so none of our weapons will 
ever be used except in selfdefense the alliance does not seek 
military superiority nor will it ever do so 
consistent with the alliances defensive character its strategy 
is one of deterrence for the foreseeable future deterrence 
requires an appropriate mix of adequate and effective nuclear and 
conventional forces which will continue to be kept up to date where 
necessary for it is only by their evident and perceived capability 
for effective use that such forces and weapons deter 
within this overall framework strategic nuclear forces provide 
the ultimate guarantee of deterrence for the allies they must be 
capable of inflicting unacceptable damage on an aggressor state 
even after it has carried out a first strike the strategic 
nuclear forces of the united states provide the cornerstone of 
deterrence for the alliance as a whole 
nuclear forces below the strategic level provide an essential 
political and military linkage between conventional and strategic 
forces and together with the presence of canadian and the united 
states forces in europe between the european and north american 
members of the alliance the allies substrategic nuclear forces 
are not designed to compensate for conventional imbalances 
all member countries of the alliance strongly favor a 
comprehensive effectively verifiable global ban on the 
development production stockpiling and use of chemical weapons 
 
the allies are committed to maintaining only the minimum level 
of forces necessary for their strategy of deterrence taking into 
account the threat there is however a level of forces both 
nuclear and conventional below which the credibility of deterrence 
cannot be maintained in particular the allies have always 
recognized that the removal of all nuclear weapons from europe 
would critically undermine deterrence strategy and impair the 
security of the alliance 
the alliances defense policy and its policy of arms control and 
disarmament are complementary and have the same goal to maintain 
security at the lowest possible level of forces there is no 
contradiction between defense policy and arms control policy 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
our vision for europe is that of an undivided continent where 
military forces only exist to prevent war and to ensure 
selfdefense as has always been the case for the allies not for 
the purpose of initiating aggression or for political or military 
intimidation arms control can contribute to the realization of 
that vision as an integral part of the alliances security policy 
and of our overall approach to eastwest relations 
the allies arms control initiatives seek a balance at a 
lower level of forces and armaments through negotiated agreements 
and as appropriate unilateral actions recognizing that arms 
control agreements are only possible where the negotiating partners 
share an interest in achieving a mutually satisfactory result 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
security arms control should enhance the security of all 
allies both during the implementation period and following 
implementation the allies strategy of deterrence and their 
ability to defend themselves must remain credible and effective 
 
stability arms control measures should yield militarily 
significant results that enhance stability to promote stability 
arms control measures should reduce or eliminate those capabilities 
which are most threatening to the alliance 
verifiability effective and reliable verification is a

the allies fully support the us objectives of achieving 
within the context of the strategic arms reduction talks fifty 
percent reductions in us and soviet strategic nuclear arms 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the allies are committed to maintaining only the minimum number 
of nuclear weapons necessary to support their strategy of 
deterrence in line with this commitment the members of the 
integrated military structure have already made major unilateral 
cuts in their substrategic nuclear armory 
major reductions in warsaw pact systems would be of overall 
value to alliance security one of the ways to achieve this aim 
would be by tangible and verifiable reductions of american and 
soviet landbased nuclear missile systems of shorter range leading 
to equal ceilings at lower levels 
in view of the huge superiority of the warsaw pact in terms of 
shortrange nuclear missiles the alliance calls upon the soviet 
union to reduce unilaterally its shortrange missile systems to the 
current levels within the integrated military structure 
the alliance reaffirms that at the negotiations on conventional 
stability it pursues the objectives of 
the establishment of a secure and stable balance of 
conventional forces at lower levels 
the elimination of disparities prejudicial to stability and 
security and 
the elimination as a matter of high priority of the capability 
for launching surprise attack and for initiating largescale 
offensive action 
the alliance states that one of its highest priorities in 
negotiations with the east is reaching an agreement on conventional 
force reductions which would achieve the objectives above 
the united states has expressed the hope that this could be 
achieved within six to twelve months once implementation of such 
an agreement is under way the united states in consultation with 
the allies concerned is prepared to enter into negotiations to 
achieve a partial reduction of american and soviet landbased 
missile forces of shorter range to equal and verifiable levels 
with special reference to the western proposals on cfe tabled in 
vienna enhanced by the proposals by the united states at the may 
1989 summit the allies concerned proceed on the understanding that 
negotiated reductions leading to a level below the existing level 
of their snf missiles will not be carried out until the results of 
these negotiations have been implemented reductions of warsaw pact 
snf systems should be carried out before that date 
the question concerning the introduction and deployment of a 
followon system for the lance will be dealt with in 1992 in the 
light of overall security developments while a decision for 
national authorities the allies concerned recognize the value of 
the continued funding by the united states of research and 
development of a followon for the existing lance shortrange 
missile in order to preserve their options in this respect

as set out in the march 1988 summit statement and in the 
alliances november 1988 data initiative the soviet unions 
military presence in europe at a level far in excess of its needs 
for selfdefense directly challenges our security as well as our 
aspirations for a peaceful order in europe such excessive force 
levels create the risk of political intimidation or threatened 
aggression as long as they exist they present an obstacle to 
better political relations between all states of europe 
in addressing these concerns the allies primary objectives are 
to establish a secure and stable balance of conventional forces in 
europe at lower levels while at the same time creating greater 
openness about military organization and activities in europe 
the outcome of the cfe negotiations would provide a 
framework for determining the future alliance force structure 
required to perform its fundamental task of preserving peace in 
freedom in addition the allies would be willing to contemplate 
further steps to enhance stability and security if the immediate 
cfe objectives are achieved for example further reductions or 
limitations of conventional armaments and equipment or the 
restructuring of armed forces to enhance defensive capabilities and 
further reduce offensive capabilities 
the allies welcome the declared readiness of the soviet union 
and other wto members to reduce their forces and adjust them toward 
a defense posture and await implementation of these measures 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the soviet unions chemical weapons stockpile poses a massive 
threat the allies are committed to conclude at the earliest date 
a worldwide comprehensive and effectively verifiable ban on all 
chemical weapons 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it is essential that defense and arms control objectives remain 
in harmony in order to ensure their complementary contribution to 
the goal of maintaining security at the lowest balanced level of 
forces consistent with the requirements of the alliance strategy of 
war prevention acknowledging that changes in the threat new 
technologies and new political opportunities affect options in 
both fields 
the current negotiations concerning strategic nuclear systems 
conventional forces and chemical weapons are however independent 
of one another the outcome of any one of these negotiations is not 
contingent on progress in others however they can influence one 
another criteria established and agreements achieved in one area 
of arms control may be relevant in other areas and hence facilitate 
overall progress 
taken as a whole the allies arms control agenda constitutes a 
coherent and comprehensive approach to the enhancement of security 
and stability it is ambitious but we are confident that with a 
constructive response from the wto states it can be fully 
achieved in the coming years in pursuing this goal the alliance 
recognizes that it cannot afford to build its security upon arms 
control results expected in the future the allies will be 
prepared however to draw appropriate consequences for their own 
military posture as they make concrete progress through arms 
control toward a significant reduction in the scale and quality of 
the military threat they face 
the allies vision for europe is that of an undivided continent 
where military forces only exist to prevent war and to ensure 
selfdefense a continent which no longer lives in the shadow of 
overwhelming military forces and from which the threat of war has 
been removed a continent where the sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of all states are respected and the rights of all 
individuals including their right of political choice are 
protected 
this goal can only be reached by stages it will require patient 
and creative endeavor the allies are resolved to continue working 
toward its attainment the achievement of the alliances arms 
control objectives would be a major contribution toward the 
realization of its vision

the former communist party chief and military 
commander of soviet georgia defended themselves tuesday against 
blistering accusations they ordered a fatal military assault on 
demonstrators in tbilisi 
the debate over the april 9 military action against a 
proindependence demonstration in the georgian capital aroused far 
more passion among the 2250 members of the congress of peoples 
deputies than president mikhail s gorbachevs policy speech hours 
earlier 
tamaz gamkrelidze director of georgias institute of eastern 
studies won a round of stormy applause three times longer than 
gorbachev after a speech in which the georgian demanded that col 
gen igor rodionov caucasus military commander be ousted from the 
congress for the assault 
half the congress stood to applaud him 
it is an insult to national feelings the entire population of 
our republic that col gen rodionov still sits in moscow in the 
congress of peoples deputies gamkrelidze said 
he said voters already had decided to recall the officer and 
added col gen rodionov does not have the political or moral 
right to remain a peoples deputy of the soviet union from 
georgia 
a georgian report circulated at the session charged the military 
with a planned mass massacre using clubs shovels and chemical 
substances against independence protesters who filled central 
tbilisi gamkrelidzes text closely followed much of that report 
taking the floor a few moments after gamkrelidze rodionov 
defended himself and his soldiers he said the majority of georgian 
deputies had taken part in a communist party meeting april 8 that 
approved the use of force 
they supported the decision of the party bureau that the 
situation was extraordinarily explosive the outcome could not be 
predicted all measures of action and appeals to common sense had 
been exhausted and there remained only extreme measures to use 
force he said 
but after the violence he said everyone has denied being 
responsible for using force 
he said soldiers were armed with shovels only to protect 
themselves but that they did not expect such brutal and stubborn 
resistance 
at least 19 people died in the clash with soldiers on tbilisis 
rustaveli prospekt and another was shot to death later that night 
sixteen of those who were killed outright were not marked with 
wounds he said not on one of them was there any wound from 
puncture cutting or bashing he said rejecting charges they had 
been beaten with shovels and clubs and suffered chemical poisoning 
rodionov denied using chemicals and said the decision to send 
in soldiers was made by such a small group of people that he 
himself did not know when and how the assault was to take place 
he was heckled but also received long applause when he finished 
after 80 minutes of impassioned debate gorbachev broke the 
tension with humor and a promise that a parliamentary commission 
would find those responsible 
ive know this republic these people for a long time he 
said of georgia they know me i love them and i hope they treat 
me with respect 
answering questions last week before the congress gorbachev 
said he only learned about the assault several hours after it 
happened 
we must get down to the roots whatever this cost us and 
whoever this might concern he added i was interrogated for 
two hours yesterday i am thankful to my comrades this means that 
there is democracy at the congress but this does not mean that 
gorbachev does not see i see everything he said to laughter and 
applause 
dzhumber patiashvili the former georgian communist party chief 
who took responsibility for the assault and resigned charged that 
rodionov and first deputy defense minister konsantin a kochetov 
appeared at a party meeting and said they had been authorized 
from above to end the georgian protests 
he said that when he resigned he did not know that chemicals 
and shovels had been used even two or three days later rodionov 
rejected the fact that shovels and gases had been used 
patiashvili said 
i want to know who authorized the use of gas and shovels who 
ordered this level of cruelty he asked 
after the debate the deputies were invited to closed showings 
of footage shot by georgian activists and from the military about 
events in tbilisi

us sanctions threats against japan are expected 
to overshadow toplevel talks on economic and monetary issues 
starting wednesday at the organization of economic cooperation and 
development participants said 
it is the annual review of the worlds economic health by 
foreign and finance ministers of the 24 highly industrialized 
nations that comprise the organization 
japanese officials angered at the bush administrations decision 
to single out their country as an unfair trading partner likely 
will press their us counterparts about the super 301 
provision of the us trade act it allows the united states to 
target countries officials believe are blocking american exports 
us trade representative carla a hills met tuesday with 
hiroshi mitsutsuka japans minister for international trade and 
industry and told a news conference she wants to ease the friction 
indicating some flexibility in the us position she said 
dicussions with the japanese do not necessarily have to take place 
within the framework of the super 301 provision and that she is 
confident progress can be made 
mrs hills said she did not tell the japanese she specifically 
wants to negotiate under super 301 a condition japanese officials 
have refused 
i do want to talk about bringing down trade barriers and 
streamlining multilateral trade she said i am ready to talk 
she said the only unilateral action the united states has taken 
against japan so far is to name priorities that we will discuss 
the us delegation led by treasury secretary nicholas brady 
is expected to meet with japanese participants wednesday 
foreign minister sosuke uno is leading japanese officials who 
said they are determined to ensure the final communique of the 
twoday meeting contains strong language that while not mentioning 
the united states by name condemns unilateral trade protection 
measures by western industrialized countries the officials spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
both the japanese and the secretariat of the organization of 
economic cooperation and development fear the us decision to 
resort to bilateral negotiations with countries accused of unfair 
trading practices could undermine the multilateral trading system 
that has served the international community well during the 1970s 
and 1980s 
japan is the only member of the organization to be put on notice 
by the united states on may 25 nonmembers warned were brazil and 
india 
the united states said the three nations must lift unfair trade 
barriers against us goods or investments 
super 301 was passed by a congress frustrated with a huge us 
trade deficit totaling nearly 120 billion in 1988 
delegates and officials of the organizations secretariat have 
expressed concern that the trade dispute could push aside other 
agenda items such as agricultural policies the environment 
economic reforms and the debt problem 
participants said they anticipate tough talking about whether or 
not the recent upward trend of inflation is temporary since the 
organization revised its inflation projections for industrialized 
countries up half a point to 45 percent for both 1989 and 1990

the military frequently criticizes the press 
for reporting only bad news stories ignoring all the good 
things that happen inside todays armed forces 
tuesday the air force made a point of offering a good news 
story and it really had to stretch to do so 
recall first that on may 11 the air force conducted the first 
test flight of the new midgetman longrange nuclear missile the 
missile had to be destroyed by a range safety officer when it went 
out of control apparently because of a secondstage rocket nozzle 
malfunction 
tuesday the air force issued a press release that began the 
air force announced today the first flight of the midgetman 
achieved almost 85 percent of its mission objectives instead of 
the previously announced 50 percent 
it seems that staying up in the air is only 15 percent of the 
objective

president bush told us students 
tuesday that western values of democracy and freedom are winning 
the battle around the world as he concluded his nato summit visit 
with a stop at an american school 
as we look at eastern europe and we look at other places 
around the world we see that its the american values that are 
prevailing bush told about 500 high school students at the 
brussels american school 
the president and his wife barbara spent about 20 minutes at 
the school located on the outskirts of the city before leaving 
for west germany the next stop on their european trip 
the flagwaving students greeted the couple with cheers and 
applause 
i love this enthusiasm anything to get out of school 
joked the president after the cheering had died down 
in his remarks bush only mentioned the nato summit briefly 
saying one of the things that has been marvelous about this 
summit is the understanding that our values the alliances values 
are winning the battle around the world 
on a lighter note he read two welcome cards from elementary 
school students 
one began yo president bush i think you are really cool 
looking up from the card to say i want the press to hear 
this bush then continued reading 
you make all the right decisions and i am glad you are coming 
to our school i love your hair

the nato allies argued bitterly 
antagonists yielded ground and when they finally struck a deal on 
shortrange nuclear missiles in europe everyone claimed victory 
but two archrivals in the dispute british prime minister 
margaret thatcher and west german chancellor helmut kohl did not 
forgive and forget 
he called her tempermental she said pointedly that 
wriggle as they may the west germans cannot extricate 
themselves from the accord that dashed their hopes of eliminating 
the weapons on their soil 
president bush sided with mrs thatcher on most of the issues 
but ended up sounding more like a mediator than an antagonist i 
dont think we ought to have winners and losers he said it is 
an alliance victory an alliance decision 
kohl backed by several other leaders and mrs thatcher bushs 
closest ally each focused on the points theyd won and glided over 
their concessions at the end of the twoday summit of the 16nation 
alliance 
mrs thatcher had wanted nato to rule out superpower 
negotiations to reduce the shortrange lance missiles and to pledge 
to replace them in the mid1990s when the weapons will be obsolete 
kohl politically sensitive to widespread opposition in west 
germany to the missiles wanted early and unconditional 
negotiations 
the lastminute agreement calls for the united states to 
negotiate partial reductions but only after conventional 
forces are cut 
partial was underlined for emphasis mrs thatcher said that 
wasnt her idea but she liked it 
i am very very satisfied with the total document it is one 
of the best i have ever seen mrs thatcher said noting that the 
deal specified nato will retain nuclear weapons 
you dont have to ask me or them the west germans just read 
what they have signed up to she told reporters when you sign 
up to something thats that its not a question of what we say it 
means 
kohl meanwhile said the outcome of the summit was 
fantastic it showed a positive recognition of our special 
concerns by he added pointedly most of the allies 
margaret thatcher stood up for her interests in her 
temperamental way kohl said we do sometimes have differences 
of opinion we have different temperaments and shes a woman and 
im not 
at her separate but equally upbeat news conference mrs 
thatcher responded in kind 
asked if shed made up with the west germans she retorted i 
havent started a battle with them i dont have any problems if 
they have let them sort them out 
she added its all written there very firmly indeed and 
wriggle as they may that is what they have all signed up for 
the impetus for the agreement reached after nato foreign 
ministers argued until the early hours tuesday was a bush 
initiative to accelerate conventional arms negotiations for new and 
sweeping cuts in troops armaments and warplanes in europe 
everyone dubbed the bush plan a winner and the us president 
was credited with marking his first nato summit by regaining the 
arms control and public relations initiative from soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
kohls backers such as belgian prime minister wilfried martens 
and others who tried to intercede in the nuclear missile dispute 
all claimed that they too were leaving brussels contented 
the total elimination of nuclear weapons cannot be expected in 
the foreseeable future said italian foreign minister giulio 
andreotti one of the conciliators then he added but no hope is 
excluded

the chief judge of the 7th us circuit court 
of appeals said tuesday he would begin a review of two cases in 
which district judge thomas j curran ruled in favor of the general 
electric co while owning ge stock 
the us code of judicial ethics forbids a judge from presiding 
in a case in which he has a financial holding 
the associated press discovered the incidents by reviewing 
currans financial disclosure statements and crossreferencing his 
stock holdings with his case files 
in a telephone interview from chicago appeals judge william j 
bauer said he had decided to begin a formal review after taking a 
cursory look at the ap finding he said he would probe both 
cases closely and then announce whether any action should be taken 
federal statutes require confidentiality until formal action is 
taken bauer said 
curran was on the bench tuesday and could not be reached for 
comment 
in an interview friday curran said he would notify counsel of 
the existence of the conflicting interest and avoid future 
involvement in cases involving ge 
judge robert w warren chief judge of the eastern wisconsin 
district in milwaukee said currans ruling in ge cases apparently 
slipped through the cracks of a system designed to catch such 
conflicts 
judge curran when he found out about this has filed an order 
recusing himself its not the kind of thing that were happy 
about it will be repaired warren said 
curran reported in all his disclosure statements since 1985 that 
he held between 15000 and 50000 in ge stock he presided over 
unrelated cases involving ge medical systems in 1987 and 1989 and 
said in an interview that he was surprised to learn of the 
conflicts 
i really thought we had a system to prevent that curran 
said he said in accepting the cases he hadnt recognized ge 
medical systems as a subsidiary of ge actually ge medical 
systems is a division of the parent company and in one case 
currans ruling directly cited general electric co as the 
defendant 
i couldnt dispute that said curran 
bauer originally reviewed the aps findings without knowing the 
judges name and said the cases appeared to violate the us code 
bauer is responsible for enforcing the judicial code of ethics on 
all judges in his territory which includes wisconsin 
the code is fairly clear he said if you have a financial 
interest you must disqualify yourself 
university of wisconsin law professor frank tuerkheimer a 
former us attorney said possible action against the judge could 
range from a reprimand to impeachment but the latter was highly 
unlikely he said neither suit was large enough to affect the 
judges investments but the case law is clear that that does not 
matter 
curran 64 is a former mauston wis attorney who was 
appointed to the bench in 1983 by thenpresident reagan his 1988 
disclosure showed net investments between 648030 and 1720000 
generally in bluechip stocks his investments returned between 
37147 and 112116 including between 1001 and 2500 in ge 
dividends 
currans first case involving ge stemmed from a 1983 lawsuit 
filed by a union representing robert holloway the union contended 
holloway was unfairly denied a promotion at the ge medical systems 
plant in west milwaukee there was a oneday trial in 1984 and 
curran dismissed the lawsuit june 5 1987 
his ruling listed general electric co as the defendant 
in the more recent case joseph toth another ge medical systems 
employee sued in 1988 contending he was unfairly fired for missing 
work because of a health problem on april 25 1989 curran denied 
toths request for a trial issuing a summary judgment dismissing 
the lawsuit 
the toth case listed general electric medical systems as the 
defendant 
you try to keep track of these subsidiaries curran said 
apparently in this case we didnt 
he added having been alerted we will notify counsel of the 
existence of the conflicting interest and recuse myself so i would 
not be in a position to pass judgment upon anything further with 
ge 
william e wentzel who represented toth said tuesday im 
certainly going to do something whatever it takes to get the case 
reopened 
wentzel said he and the lawyer representing ge filed a joint 
document in the toth case prior to their first pretrial hearing 
the summary of issues identified ge as the defendent but curran 
never disclosed his holding he said 
matthew r robbins whose firm represented holloway said he 
would contact his client but i would have to suspect that past 
due time would make an appeal unlikely 
robbins said the discovery indicated a problem lawyers are not 
aware of you normally do not know the judges financial 
holdings 
george k whyte jr whose law firm represented ge in the 
holloway matter said he could not recall the case mary pat 
ninneman who represented ge in the toth case did not return 
several phone messages 
title 28 of the us code section 455 requires that a judge 
disqualify himself when he knows that he individually or as a 
fiduciary or his spouse or his minor child residing in his 
household has a financial interest in the subject matter in 
controversy or in a party to the proceeding 
the code defines financial interest as ownership of a legal or 
equitable interest however small 
judge warren said his district court has a certificate of 
interest system designed to identify possible conflicts 
the certificate does not always work because the defendants 
certificate isnt filed until after the case is assigned this 
application just slipped through the cracks 
about all i can say is its unfortunate if it happened but it 
does happen because judges cant keep track of all their holdings 
and their relationships to subsidiaries in this day and age

the state department called tuesday on 
argentinas political and economic leaders to unite in formulating 
a plan to ease the countrys economic crisis 
the statement by deputy spokesman richard boucher appeared to be 
an appeal for government and opposition forces to revive their 
effort to agree on economic measures 
that effort broke down shortly after the peronist candidate for 
president carlos menam defeated the candidate of the ruling 
radical party in national elections two weeks ago 
boucher expressed regret that the economic crisis has led to 
disorder and said the state of siege instituted on monday to halt 
an outbreak of food riots was consistent with democratic procedures 
established by the constitution 
at this critical time we believe it is important for 
argentinas political and economic leaders to work together to 
implement measures to stabilize the economic situation boucher 
said 
he said the administration does not believe that the declaration 
of a state of siege poses any danger to democracy 
despite serious economic problems the people of argentina 
have made their commitment to democracy clear most recently in the 
election for president on may 14 he said

egg industry leaders say its too early to 
tell whether good news on cholesterol from the government and 
american health association will boost americas appetite for eggs 
after decades of decline 
plagued by health worries smaller breakfasts droughts that 
raised feed prices and losses that drove thousands of producers out 
of business egg farmers are faced with a new twist to an old 
question 
instead of trying to figure out which came first the chicken or 
the egg producers are debating which comes first now advertising 
or sales after the best cholesterol reports the industry has 
received in years 
the us department of agriculture said two weeks ago it found 
large eggs have 213 milligrams of dietary cholesterol instead of 
the 274 milligrams listed in government reports dating to 1976 
that led the aha to raise from three to four its recommendation on 
the maximum number of eggs a person should consume per week in a 
lowcholesterol diet 
but rather than kicking off a national campaign to spread the 
word about the new guidelines or other health benefits producers 
either cant afford or are reluctant to spend on advertising in 
some cases they dont even want to talk publicly 
in california which produces more eggs than any other state 
77 billion of the 695 billion eggs produced last year producers 
dont want to talk with reporters after getting a bad rap for a 
long time said robert pierre president of the california egg 
commission 
the egg industry has been in considerable financial difficulty 
for a number of years and is unable to finance advertising at the 
levels we want or need said louis b raffel president of the 
american egg board in park ridge ill and id have to say the 
producers have been a little late in realizing the achievements 
they can get from advertising 
the national advertising budget is only 3 million for an 
industry which last year had 31 billion in sales down from 41 
billion in 1984 
meanwhile the producers biggest competitors cereal makers 
spend hundreds of millions of dollars annually on advertising said 
raffel 
egg producers have a 2cent checkoff for each dozen eggs to 
finance national advertising and are awaiting usda approval for a 
5cent checkoff 
last year was an absolutely terrible year for producers 
said ken klippen vice president of united egg producers in 
atlanta farmers were losing money on every dozen eggs they were 
producing as wholesale prices fluctuated from 50 cents to 75 
cents a dozen 
the drought raised the cost of feed ingredients corn and 
soybean meal while consumption continued downward klippen said 
the industry has lost money five years in this decade including 
280 million in 1988 according to agricultural economist lee 
schrader of purdue university this year schrader forecasts a 
modest profit of 115 million on sales of 4 billion at the 
wholesale level 
the last good year for the industry was 1986 when it made 69 
cents per dozen for a 400 million profit 
the profits this year probably wont come as a result of the 
cholesterol reports klippen said 
its too early to say what effects those reports will have 
he said theyre very positive were trying to change the 
perception of eggs as high in cholesterol but its very 
laborious especially when the consumers are bombarded with 
promotions of products that are low in cholesterol and 
cholesterol free everybody hears this buzzword 
undoubtedly the health issue has been a factor in some of the 
decline in use of eggs but its very difficult to separate that 
out of other factors such as changing lifestyles schrader said 
its not clear what the issue has been changing cholesterol 
levels are bound to have some impact but not a large amount 
the consolidation of the industry nationally there are about 
1600 producers down from 6000 in 1979 may help the national 
advertising effort raffel said 
there are fewer producers to make understand the value of 
advertising he said the larger ones are more sophisticated 
despite consolidation and the decline in annual per capita 
consumption from 278 eggs in 1979 to 242 eggs last year it was 
321 eggs in 1960 when big breakfasts were still fashionable and 
cholesterol wasnt a major concern the number of egglaying hens 
has remained fairly constant in recent years at about 235 million

kicked in to buy 90 1 tickets for saturdays drawing the other 12 
employees are kicking themselves said chief robert lamb who is 
one of the winners 
its been like pandemonium lamb said from lottery 
headquarters where the departments winning lotto ticket was 
verified the adrenaline is flowing 
the winners share is 83 million paid out in 20 annual 
installments after the first 416811 check they will split 
414000 a year said lottery spokeswoman carrie worley

little more comfortable for all of us 
in addition to lamb the winners include cmdr ed fair three 
sergeants two dispatchers a mintenance worker and eight 
patrolmen officials said

pope john paul ii met tuesday with cardinal john 
oconnor for a briefing on the new york prelates visit to lebanon 
where he tried unsuccessfully to visit americans held hostage 
for the holy father to schedule an hourandahalf meeting on 
the eve of his trip to scandinavia he must have been very 
interested in hearing the cardinals impressions said monsignor 
james mccarthy the cardinals secretary 
oconnor traveled to lebanon on saturday in his capacity as head 
of the catholic near east welfare mission and visited hospitals and 
orphanages 
he appealed during his threeday trip to see the nine american 
hostages held by proiranian extremists but received no response 
from the captors 
in all 18 foreigners are held hostage in lebanon the longest 
held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
oconnor arrived in beirut a day after an arab league summit 
renewed its call for christian troops fighting syrian and druse 
forces to honor a ceasefire 
the latest round of fighting in the 14yearold civil war began 
11 weeks ago and has overshadowed the hostage issue 
oconnor planned to visit moslem west beirut but called off the 
trip on sunday because he was told there was a fighting along the 
citys dividing green line 
he said later the information was inaccurate but declined to 
say where it came from 
it was the cardinals decision not to go based on a number of 
different reports influences people and the predominant physical 
danger of his going at that time said mccarthy who accompanied 
oconnor to lebanon he would not elaborate 
the decision offended some moslem leaders including acting 
prime minister salim hoss the cardinal later spoke with hoss by 
telephone to try to patch things up 
he also met with a representative of shiite moslem parliament 
speaker hussein husseini mccarthy said 
oconnor flew to rome on tuesday from larnaca cyprus after 
staying in lebanons christian enclave at bkirki monastery as the 
guest of maronite catholic patriarch nasrallah sfeir 
security at larnaca airport was tight after police on monday 
found a cache of weapons near the beachside runway they included 
sovietmade sa7 shoulderfired missiles police said 
cypriot police arrested six arabs suspected of planning to shoot 
down lebanese army helicopters that make daily flights from cyprus 
to the christian enclave under siege by shelling by syrian forces 
government officials said the target was an arab 
personality not oconnor they did not elaborate

the 33foottall goddess of democracy 
unveiled tuesday is the latest in a long line of blasphemous 
additions to tiananmen square by students demonstrating for 
democracy 
first the students made fun of soldiers messing up their timed 
march by yelling numbers out of sequence then they hung flags for 
freedom from the roof of the museum of revolutionary history 
next came balloons floating atop the monument for revolutionary 
martyrs a massive obelisk in the middle of the square meet our 
demands they read as they bobbed in the wind 
with the visit of soviet president mikhail s gorbachev the 
students had their own welcoming ceremony 100000strong 
forcing the government to switch its ceremony to the airport 
last week three people threw paint at the portrait of chinese 
leader mao tsetung covering it with blue red and black dots and 
forcing authorities to replace the portrait of the great helmsman 
on tuesday they put the goddess a statue of liberty 
lookalike in the middle of the vast expanse the symbolic 
political center of china 
fashioned from white styrofoaom and plaster of paris by students 
from eight art schools around beijing the statue depicts a large 
lady hair blowing in the wind holding a torch 
whereas the lady in new york harbor holds a torch and a tablet 
chinas version holds only a torch in both hands like a baseball 
bat 
located smack on the celestial axis a line which runs from the 
throne in the forbidden city to the temple of heaven the statue 
is a challenge and some might say an insult to chinas imperial 
and communist tradition 
the nightly tv news took a hard line on the statue 
the people of the whole nation will resolutely oppose it 
the news quoted a group called the beijing tiananmen square 
administration as saying the erection of a socalled goddess 
statue here is an insult to the national image and dignity 
a letter from an unidentified intellectual also was read 
this is china not america he reminded the audience but 
even if it was america you wouldnt be able to build a socalled 
statue in front of the congress building 
he called the act illegal and asked the government to get 
rid of the statue by thursday otherwise there will be serious 
unhealthy effects he warned 
for a government used to a monopoly on political symbols the 
statues meanings must irk the leadership in several ways 
the unwillingness of the builders to listen to the governments 
warnings about the statue and the relish with which beijings 
citizens treated its appearance must chafe 
indeed although a hardline faction appears to be winning the 
power struggle inside the halls of power the statue proved that 
for the time being the streets still belong to the people 
on tuesday tens of thousands of people swarmed around the 
statue posing for pictures with the goddess as a backdrop 
this is not fine art said a woman as she looked up at the 
goddess face but it is a symbol it proves people want 
freedom

soviet officials tuesday welcomed a nato proposal 
to negotiate reductions in shortrange nuclear missiles but said 
linking the issue to talks on conventional arms could cause an 
unneeded delay 
a soviet tv commentator said the nato agreement had only papered 
over differences between president bush and a majority of the us 
allies in the north atlantic treaty alliance 
the proposal announced by bush on monday at the nato conference 
in brussels authorizes the united states to negotiate with the 
soviets to achieve a partial reduction of shortrange nuclear 
missiles 
however any missile reductions would be linked to eastwest 
talks in vienna on reducing troops tanks and artillery the 
missile negotiations could not begin until an accord was reached to 
reduce those conventional forces and nato and the warsaw pact had 
actually started to carry out those reductions 
president mikhail s gorbachev did not comment on the proposal 
in a major policy address tuesday in which he disclosed that the 
kremlin spends about 118 billion a year for defense nearly four 
times the previous official claim 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said upon arriving in 
paris for a human rights conference that the proposal was 
attractive and a step in the right direction 
but he said it will take time to examine the american 
proposals in detail and determine the position of the ussr 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said in moscow that 
soviet officials had not yet seen the proposals but welcomed the 
opportunity to negotiate a reduction in battlefield nuclear 
missiles 
generally speaking we are for such negotiations and against 
linkage of such negotiations with other talks and negotiations 
gerasimov said 
if the united states is going to postpone the negotiations on 
tactical nuclear missiles until we have agreement on conventional 
weapons and start reductions then we think that it is a 
protraction a protraction that we dont need he said 
gerasimov said negotiations should be able to move ahead in 
several areas simultaneously 
now we have an improved political climate in europe to state 
in this situation that we should have some kind of linkage these 
statements become less and less convincing he said 
maj gen vladimir kuklev said an official position had not been 
formulated to bushs proposal to cut conventional forces by about 
10 percent but that in his opinion it was a major step 
forward 
gerasimov interrupted to say official opinion coincides with 
your opinion 
in a report from the nato conference soviet tv commentator 
valetin zorin said on the news program vremya that soviet 
proposals at last made washington move off dead center where it 
was for the past several months 
the deep contradictions between the nato members are not 
solved but pressed deep inside he said not by chance 
president bush in his speech yesterday avoided a sensitive question 
that divided him from the majority of his european allies the 
issue is tactical nuclear weapons and the compromise decision on 
this problem was made at the very last moment

black kidney recipients fare as well as whites 
transplant doctors said tuesday contradicting other studies that 
have found blacks tend to do much worse after such surgery 
even in our program back in 1982 1983 1984 they blacks 
did a little worse lately they dont and overall they do as well 
as whites said dr ingemar dawidson associate professor of 
surgery at the university of texas southwestern medical center at 
dallas 
its hard to tell why but i think the message is that we 
can transplant blacks as well as whites he said 
dr clive o callender head of the howard university hospital 
transplant center said studies encompassing larger pools of 
patients show kidney transplants are 10 percent to 20 percent less 
successful in blacks than whites 
i guess you believe what you want to said callender one of 
the nations few black transplant surgeons 
a 15 percent difference for instance was found in a study of 
more than 2000 patients who received kidneys from 1968 to 1988 at 
the university of alabama at birmingham that difference was noted 
after the advent of the potent antirejection drug cyclosporine 
said dr arnold diethelm chairman of surgery there 
the drug which suppresses the bodys natural immune system was 
approved for general use by the us food and drug administration 
in 1983 
we havent seen the advantages of cyclosporine in the black 
race diethelm said one explanation he said could be the high 
incidence of high blood pressure among blacks and other genetic 
factors 
dawidson however found blacks and whites did equally well with 
cyclosporine he said poorer success was noted among blacks when 
earlier less sophisticated antirejection medication was used 
the biggest problem is we are ignorant of the immunogenic 
system of black patients callender said until we know that 
well be stabbing in the dark 
dawidson reported at the annual meeting of the american society 
of transplant physicians that 70 percent of the centers 130 black 
patients since 1982 had functioning kidneys one year after 
transplantation that compared to a oneyear success rate of 66 
percent among 213 whites 
the success rate two years after surgery was 68 percent for 
blacks and 71 percent for whites dawidson said 
during the past two years the oneyear success rate for both 
groups has climbed to 85 percent to 90 percent according to 
dawidson ninetythree percent of the black patients were alive a 
year after surgery compared to 90 percent of the whites dawidson 
said there also was no statistical difference five years later 
about a fourth of both groups needed at least one dialysis 
treatment following the transplant operation because of delayed 
graft function dawidson said 
dr paul peters chairman of the university of texas urology 
division said careful matching of the tissue type between donor 
and recipient likely contributed to the improved success rate among 
blacks he also cited the centers experience in dealing with black 
patients 
blacks comprise nearly a third of all patients at parkland 
memorial hospital where the kidney transplants were performed 
i dont think we can take praise for better surgical 
techniques because there are plenty of places that can do it just 
as well peters said but we are familiar with the problems of 
black patients 
its difficult to know if race plays a role in the outcome of 
heart transplantation since the procedure is so rarely performed on 
blacks callender said but doctors at the university of pittsburgh 
are finding similar survival rates among whites blacks and other 
minorities 
the texas doctors have not yet studied the longterm results of 
black kidney patients the feeling elsewhere however is that 
blacks lag far behind whites over the long haul according to 
dr philip held program director of the renal research program at 
the urban institute in washington 
but what does that mean it doesnt mean transplantation is a 
bad idea for blacks held said for a black patient the option 
is not to become white his option is transplantation or dialysis

despite weeks of political turmoil that has 
gripped china a band of peace corps volunteers plans to travel 
there in midaugust to begin a twoyear experiment as english 
teachers 
the twodozen volunteers were hailed tuesday as the hand 
clasp between china and the united states as they embarked on a 
training course for the corps firstever project in a communist 
country 
at a ceremony marked by inspirational speeches cups of tea and 
goodwill wishes the group celebrated its historic venture with 
peace corps officials and representatives from the chinese embassy 
in a way this is a symbolic gesture part of chinas opening 
up and choosing closer relations to the united states said paul 
englesberg the groups team leader 
peace corps director paul coverdell told the group they were 
embarking on a special mission and taking a special piece of our 
country with you 
you are the hand clasp between us you are the symbol of 
relations between two nations and their commitment to peace 
coverdell said 
xiao houde the counsellor of the chinese embassy told the 
group the program is very important because it reflects the 
friendship between our two peoples 
you have a special responsibility you will set an example for 
your followers xiao said 
lisa smoker 24 of lancaster pa and janelle cavanagh 22 of 
san francisco calif said the political tumult doesnt bother 
them 
im not worried ms smoker said the demonstrations dont 
seem to be directed against americans 
ms cavanagh said her parents were excited for her since they 
both had expressed an interest in joining the peace corps when they 
were young but had not been able to fulfill their dreams 
i guess im the one to get the chance ms cavanagh said 
peace corps spokesman james c flanigan said that despite the 
prodemocracy demonstrations and political uncertainty that have 
gripped china the trainees have several months to prepare and 
by then things may shake down a little 
the chinese are eager to have english teachers in order to help 
push forward with deng xiopings modernization program and 
flanigan said the corps has received no indication from china that 
the program will not move forward 
the group will be the first in the peace corps 28year history 
to serve in a communist nation currently there are 6000 american 
volunteers and trainees working in 65 nations under the program 
established to help people in the developing world 
after an intensive threemonth course in chinese language 
culture and technical arts 20 of the volunteers will be chosen to 
teach english in various locations in chinas western province of 
sichuan 
tuesdays ceremony marked the end of a nearly fiveyear effort 
to bring the us program to china 
our presence is definitely a sign of transition in the 
uschina relationship flanigan said in the 1970s we were 
reviled in china as an imperialistic agency 
as the chinese aspired to impress lesserdeveloped nations 
during those years the american volunteer agency bore the brunt of 
a chinese propaganda attack radio china broadcast attacks against 
the peace corps condemning the workers as agents for the cia 
relations improved after president nixons historic trip to 
beijing in 1972 but it wasnt until election night 1984 that the 
subject of a trial run for the corps was suggested by the chinese 
chinese officials had been invited to watch a broadcast of the 
us election returns at the great wall hotel in beijing a chinese 
official approached an american official saying there was interest 
in the program 
although the chinese initially asked for some 800 volunteers it 
was decided that the emphasis should be on quality program over 
a large number of volunteers flanigan said 
the chinese have requested english teachers for the trial run 
and if both sides find the twoyear program satisfactory other 
types of volunteers in health agriculture or other technical 
fields might be used 
the volunteers have come from all around the country and only a 
handful have any skills in the chinese language but they all have 
a zest for adventure and interest in helping their fellow man

the national abortion rights action league 
launched a newspaper ad campaign tuesday designed to let voters 
back home read the outrageous comments their elected officials 
are making about women and abortion 
many of the constituents in districts around the country do 
not know what their congresspeople say and do regarding a womans 
right to choose said naral executive director kate michelman 
we believe that it will make a difference when they do know 
the leagues first target was freshman rep craig james a 
florida republican whose district covers an area from jacksonville 
south to cape canaveral james last year narrowly wrested the seat 
from veteran rep bill chappell a democrat whose name had come up 
in connection with the pentagon procurement scandal 
the ad in the daytona beach newsjournal paraphrased comments 
that james made during a may 10 hearing of the house judiciary 
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights according to the 
abortion rights league 
among the statements the group attributed to james were that 
pregnant women are too confused to make a rational decision about 
whether or not to have an abortion safe and legal abortions 
promote promiscuity and increase the spread of aids and if 
abortion becomes illegal women who seek abortions and all those 
who help them would be criminals and should be punished 
the supreme court is now reconsidering who will have the right 
to decide if a woman can have an abortion politicians like craig 
james or you the ad says ultimately you will with your 
vote 
michelman said the ad is the first of its kind for the league 
but we will see more of this she said her group has gathered a 
store of tremendously outrageous statements about reproductive 
rights and women in general from other legislators and is 
developing a list of targets of which james is the first 
were going to educate the public and organize them into a 
voting block michelman said we intend to make this a decisive 
issue for the publics voting decisions in 1989 and 1990 this is 
not just about congressmen and senators its governors and state 
legislators and county commissioners and the whole range of 
political public office 
james press secretary brian flood called the ad a 
fundraising ploy and said the congressmans position on abortion 
has always been clear he is opposed to it except where a womans 
life is endangered or in cases of rape or incest 
it is extremely improper and way out of line to interpret 
anything said at this hearing as antiwoman flood said this 
is a despicable political effort to undermine his continued service 
in congress 
flood called the naral ad the beginning of what will be a 
nasty effort to unseat james by trying to find little bits of 
information and take them out of context and present them in a very 
radical way like this in an attempt to damage his credibility and 
reputation i dont think its going to work 
michelman said the timing of the ad so far in advance of the 
1990 election is meant to coincide with increased public interest 
in the abortion rights issue while the supreme court weighs a 
missouri case that could have profound consequences for womens 
access to abortion 
as for whether james constituents will remember the ad come 
november 1990 she said they wont forget because we wont let 
them forget

the leftist west berlin mayor who 
governs with the help of an antinato party was noticeably absent 
from the guest list at tuesdays state dinner for president bush 
while mayor walter momper has said bush would be welcome to 
visit his city some of mompers partners in his coalition 
government dont feel the same and they said so in a statement 
less than two months ago 
while momper was being snubbed at tuesday nights feast the 
citys former conservative mayor eberhard diepgen was prominent 
on the guest list he joined 150 business political and cultural 
leaders for a gourmet meal of turbot and creamed asparagus at an 
elegant 18thcentury villa in bonn 
momper spent the night in communist east berlin attending a 
concert by the famed berlin philharmonic under the direction of 
metropolitan opera conductor james levine 
west berlin legally remains under the control of world war ii 
allies france britain and the united states although daytoday 
administration is left to the germans 
the three allies maintain military forces in the city located 
deep inside communist east german territory us officials 
routinely stress their commitment to guaranteeing west berlins 
security and its links to the west 
west berlin officials said they were stunned that momper was not 
invited and charged that the government had snubbed the entire city 
by inviting diepgen instead 
diepgen is a member of chancellor helmut kohls christian 
democratic party but he lost power after the berlin elections in 
january 
momper a social democrat heads a coalition government that 
includes the farleft environmentalist alternative list party the 
alternative list in april said it would oppose a bush visit to west 
berlin during his current european swing although momper asserted 
the president would be welcome 
hansjochen vogel who heads the leftist social democratic 
party said he was amazed that diepgen was invited and not 
momper 
momper told reporters in west berlin that the decision was 
alienating and incredibly impolite 
vogel who was invited to the dinner said he planned to deliver 
heartfelt greetings from momper to bush and suggest to the 
president that he meet another time with momper 
west german television showed bush greeting diepgen with a broad 
smile and a handshake at a reception before the dinner 
bush told reporters after arriving in bonn that he would address 
the status of berlin during a speech in the city of mainz on 
wednesday 
thenpresident ronald reagan during a visit to berlin in 1987 
proposed a wideranging plan to ease tensions in the divided city 
and revitalize it into an international magnet for trade and 
sporting events 
government spokesman ulrich strempel said momper was not invited 
to the banquet because of limited seating arrangements at the 
banquet hall 
strempel said many politicians were not invited to make room for 
representatives from politics industry and the arts

president bush exulted tuesday in the 
success of a nato summit that produced a united western front on 
both conventional and nuclear weapons and smoothed over a dispute 
with west germany in the process 
bush flew to bonn from brussels where the 16nation north 
atlantic treaty organization had just forged a compromise on 
shortrange nuclear missiles the deal will keep some of the nato 
weapons deployed indefinitely while providing a framework for 
eventual negotiations with the soviets to reduce the stockpiles 
once conventional weapons in europe are cut 
bush met oneonone in bonn with west german chancellor helmut 
kohl who called the president a friend among friends bush 
said he was very pleased with the reaction to the nato decision 
in a triumphant mood bush said the alliance had scored a 
double hit with its decision on the nuclear issue and its 
endorsement of his proposal for widespread reductions in troops and 
conventional weapons based in europe 
the communique winding up the 40th anniversary summit meeting 
specified that only a partial reduction in battlefield nuclear 
weapons would be pursued 
bush said most people do not realize the soviets have a 
numerical advantage in such weapons and he challenged soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to order a unilateral cutback 
the call for only a partial reduction was a setback for 
kohl who had sought swift ussoviet negotiations with the 
possible aim of eliminating the missiles both in nato and the 
warsaw pact 
there will be no third zero bush said partial means 
partial 
the two other zeroes were in the 1987 ussoviet treaty 
banning two categories of intermediaterange missiles 
despite the tilt toward the us position kohl did not leave 
the summit emptyhanded on a related issue bush and british prime 
minister margaret thatcher agreed to postpone modernization of the 
usbuilt lance launchers that are deployed mostly in west germany 
bush discussing the compromise at a news conference said i 
dont view it as a victory for the united states i view it as a 
victory for the alliance 
bush and thatcher had wanted to more than triple the range of 
the lances but at west germanys urging the allies decided to 
postpone any modernization until 1992 at that point the 
communique said the introduction and deployment of a followon 
system for the lance will be dealt with in 1992 in the light of 
overall security developments 
the timetable postpones superpower negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear weapons until the two alliances conclude an accord in 
vienna to reduce their conventional forces 
the nato leaders also gave a green light to congress to finance 
the development of a more powerful shortrange missile in the 
meantime 
at a news conference later tuesday secretary of state james a 
baker iii cautioned the soviet union that the nato proposals are a 
package deal 
this is not something we have put on the table the idea that 
the east can come in and pick what they like and leave what they 
dont like he said 
kohl under intense disarmament pressure at home praised the 
united states for breaking the impasse over when and whether to 
negotiate cuts in the shortrange nuclear weapons 
but in the city of mainz where bush is scheduled to speak on 
wednesday about 1000 protesters marched through the street 
distributing leaflets saying bush is not welcome here 
police have announced measures to virtually seal off the city 
from any possible influx of violenceprone demonstrators during 
bushs appearance 
kohl used remarks at a state dinner tuesday evening to reassure 
the west that his country is not romantically and dreamily 
looking toward the east affirming west germanys solid support 
for nato kohl said we are not wanderers between two worlds 
bush in turn said that in 1989 we are nearer our goals of 
peace and european reconciliation than at any time since the 
founding of nato in 1949 
bush also announced that west germans no longer will be required 
to have visas to visit the united states under a pilot program 
offering easier access to residents of selected countries the 
announcement duplicated a gesture bush made earlier this week to 
the italians 
bush reported a cautious but positive soviet response to the 
proposal he outlined monday for reducing us and soviet troops in 
europe to 275000 each and limiting tanks artillery and combat 
aircraft as well 
they really didnt slam the door and come on a negative 
view bush said 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in paris for a 
human rights conference said the bush proposals were a step in 
the right direction but he said it will take time to examine 
the american proposals in detail and determine the position of the 
ussr 
in moscow lt gen nikolai chervov a member of the soviet 
general staff said we have all long been waiting for the united 
states to answer arms proposals put forward by the soviet union and 
other socialist countries certainly the united states could not 
keep silent indefinitely 
but bush said he had not felt under siege because ive known 
exactly what i want to do 
his performance at the summit was hailed by nato general 
secretary manfred woerner who said bushs leadership set the 
tone for the whole meeting

rep claude pepper who crusaded for franklin 
roosevelts new deal in the 1930s and was still championing the 
rights of the elderly a halfcentury later died tuesday at 88 
he was the oldest member of congress 
pepper had been hospitalized since april 6 suffering from an 
undisclosed stomach ailment he died at walter reed army hospital 
where he returned a month ago after an interim stay at johns 
hopkins hospital in baltimore 
rochelle jones peppers press secretary said the congressman 
died at midafternoon 
the florida democrat was elected to the senate in 1936 and 
promptly made his mark as an architect of some of the nations most 
enduring safety net programs including social security the 
minimum wage and medical assistance to the elderly and handicapped 
children 
he remained in the senate for 14 years and after an interlude 
practicing law and teaching began a house career that would 
include 14 terms 
he was still barnstorming last year in an effort to fend off 
reagan budget cuts and to promote fellow liberal michael dukakis in 
the presidential race 
pepper was born on sept 8 1900 on a farm near dudleyville 
ala and grew up poor he put himself through the university of 
alabama and harvard law school toting cafeteria trays and emptying 
coal ashes in a power plant 
elected to the florida house of representatives in 1929 pepper 
moved onto the us senate seven years later though he had been in 
the house for nearly four decades he was still called senator 
by colleagues in congress 
a bitter democratic primary in 1950 ended his senate career 
including the label of red pepper playing on claims during the 
communist scare of the era that he was soft on the soviet union a 
fellow democrat george smathers took his place 
pepper returned to his law practice but then was elected to the 
us house from the miami district in 1962 he was never defeated 
again largely because of his dogged attention to retirees in a 
city heavily populated by them 
although he was a millionaire from investments and property 
holdings pepper always scoffed at the thought of fading away to 
retirement and a rocking chair 
his florid fingerwagging lectures at committee hearings 
reflected the politics of the old rural south where he had his 
roots often he faced news cameras like a tv star as he raked a 
recalcitrant witness over the coals

syrian army gunners shelled lebanons 
christian enclave with howitzers mortars and tank cannons tuesday 
despite renewed calls to honor a ceasefire declared by arab 
leaders 
police said one civilian was killed in the barrage by syrians 
deployed in moslem west beirut and the capitals southern slums 
that raised the overall toll to 360 killed and 1396 wounded 
since the latest round of lebanons 14yearold civil war broke out 
march 8 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified in line with 
standing rules said army commander gen michel aouns 20000 
mostly christian troops did not fire back 
us ambassador john mccarthy said the bush administration was 
discouraged by syrias failure to enter into a dialogue with 
aoun who heads the christian cabinet in lebanons dual government 
weve been urging syria privately and publicly that 
given its description of its own role here as a peacekeeper that 
its action should be more in line with those of a peacekeeper he 
said that what is necessary in lebanon is a political dialogue 
to get under way not have a lot of shelling 
the syrians and certainly the lebanese moslems should be 
dialoguing with aoun rather than criticizing him i find the 
syrian position to date on that specific point has been unwise 
it was the strongest public criticism of syria by a us 
official during the present confrontation between aoun and an 
alliance of the syrian army and druse leader walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party 
mccarthy spoke after meeting with foreign ministry 
undersecretary farouk abillama in christian east beirut as syrians 
sporadically shelled the sector 
dozens of howitzer shells crashed onto the christian coastline 
north of beirut hitting the ports of jounieh and byblos the 
police spokesman said 
shelling of the coast is intended to prevent the christians from 
receiving war material and other supplies 
syrian gunners also opened up at the christian suburbs of 
hadath kfarsheema and baabda southeast of beirut he added 
baabda houses the presidential palace aoun has been staying in 
its bunker throughout the 11 weeks of shelling duels 
the spokesman said the palace ravaged by previous shelling was 
not targeted tuesday 
shelling has increased despite a call by arab heads of state for 
a complete ceasefire as they ended a summit on friday in 
casablanca morocco the arab league declared a ceasefire on may 
11 
the leaders formed a committee made up of the heads of state of 
morocco saudi arabia and algeria to try to resolve the lebanon 
crisis within six months 
the committee was given a mandate to arrange for the lebanese 
parliament to convene to draw up political reforms and elect a new 
president who would form a government of national reconciliation 
the summit pledged to support the new government in 
reestablishing state authority with its own forces on lebanons 
entire territory an indirect assertion that the syrians should 
withdraw 
mccarthy called the arab moves were encouraging developments 
syria maintains 40000 troops in lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league aoun says the syrians 
lost their credibility as peacekeepers when they sided with the 
moslems in the civil war 
aoun 54 a maronite complained in a weekend memorandum to the 
arab league that syrian gunners were not respecting the truce 
called by arab leaders his command said 
king hassan ii of morocco who heads the committee on lebanon 
told a news conference in rabat the arabs would make every effort 
to solve the problem but that the solution would have to come from 
the lebanese themselves

a dozen investments of more than 1 billion 
apiece helped increase foreign direct investments in the united 
states to 65 billion last year a 613 percent rise over 1987s 
403 billion the commerce department reported tuesday 
britain and japan led the world in buying or establishing 
business enterprises in the united states and each had four of the 
dozen 1 billionplus investors the department said two canadian 
investments also also topped the 1 billion mark 
the department said the 12 investments represented 80 percent of 
the 1988 increase there were only six investments totaling more 
than 1 billion in 1987 
the report covered only foreign direct investment in the united 
states such as buying control of a company it did not include 
passive investment by foreigners such as purchasing stocks or 
bonds which they are not in a position to manage 
analyst james annable of first national bank of chicago said the 
sharp increase in foreign direct investment was almost as much of 
a given as death and taxes given the nations high budget and 
trade deficits 
were going to see this number grow like clockwork every 
year annable said 
the department said factors encouraging foreign investment 
include the profitability of us companies a large consumer 
market an advanced technological base and a cheaper dollar 
compared with foreign currency 
because of growing foreign investment legislation has been 
introduced in congress to require greater disclosure about foreign 
investors and their purchases 
last years foreign investments were widespread the department 
said in its report 
substantial increases occurred in all major industry groups 
except services real estate and financing except banking the 
report said 
the total british direct investment was 215 billion followed 
by japans 142 billion canada was third with 104 billion 
investments in the manufacturing sector totaled 316 billion 
retail trade 8 billion and insurance 58 billion

the government intensified its charges 
tuesday that the united states is improperly helping solidaritys 
election campaign a claim solidarity and us diplomats denied 
a state department spokesman said congress has authorized 1 
million annually for solidarity trade union for at least two years 
but us spokesman richard boucher added were not interfering 
with the election campaign 
zbyslaw rykowski the deputy government spokesman in warsaw 
said an official statement monday accusing western diplomats of 
helping the opposition before sundays elections referred to 
representatives of the embassy of the united states 
but he added he hoped the matter would have no influence on 
president bushs planned midjuly visit to poland 
the way of behaving of those diplomats unambiguously showed 
that they were taking part in the electoral campaign in favor of 
the opposition rykowski said 
he told a news conference he had a dossier on alleged incidents 
but its in no ones interest to say anything more 
in warsaw a us embassy spokesman read a response saying 
embassy personnel in keeping with standard diplomatic practice 
are responsible for keeping abreast of important developments in 
poland including the elections 
however the embassy emphatically denies that any of its 
personnel have engaged in improper activities or that they have 
actively supported one group or one candidate over any others 
the accusation came in the final days of the campaign for 
polands first democratic elections since world war ii 
poles vote sunday for 100 members of a new senate that will be 
the east blocs first fully democratically elected legislative body 
they also choose 460 members for the existing parliament where 
the opposition may compete for 161 seats the rest are reserved for 
the communist party and its allies 
solidarity has endorsed candidates for all contestable seats 
answering statements about solidarity claims the opposition is 
ahead in the campaign rykowski predicted the communist party 
coalition would do well 
he said the partys campaign has not had to be as visible as 
solidaritys because one knows what one can expect from us 
the prognoses for our side are good he said all the data 
presented by our opponents are only the result of their wishful 
thinking 
he said the party and its allies were the guarantors of 
certainty and stability of this country we dont have to use 
election techniques taken from an american movie 
government polls show about 85 percent of the countrys 
approximately 26 million voters will participate he said in 
polands last elections for local offices in june 1988 the 
official turnout was put at 56 percent but the opposition said it 
was much lower 
mondays government statement alleged an unprecedented 
violation of polands sovereignty 
it mentioned diplomats appearing at opposition election rallies 
financial donations flowing to solidaritys campaign from the west 
and usfinanced radio free europe which broadcasts without 
interference to poland in polish 
solidarity said help received from abroad was consistent with 
polish law and accused the government of trying to frighten voters 
they want to scare those who are undecided the statement 
said scaring citizens does not serve it well nor does abuse of 
patriotic feelings or manipulation of facts 
solidarity has not given details of money it has received but 
says most contributions are from poles abroad who are entitled to 
vote 
city officials meanwhile announced the creation of a 
freespeech corner from thursday in the citys agrykola park 
similar to londons speakers corner it will be open to orators 
on any theme so long as they abide by the generally adopted moral 
norms and good manners and international conventions signed by 
poland the warsaw daily zycie warszawy reported 
prosolidarity university students announced they would suspend 
strikes they have staged for the past week because of the 
approaching elections and the possibility of using the wave of 
student strikes as propaganda against opposition candidates 
the strikes began may 23 after a warsaw court denied an 
application to charter the independent students association 
closely linked to the solidarity union movement 
in denying the application the court said the association 
illegally claimed it has the right to organize strikes 
association leaders said tuesday they would appeal the court 
decision and resume strikes in the autumn if authorities still 
refuse to register the organization they said students at 43 
institutions of higher learning had participated in the strikes but 
gave no further details

dr ernst a h friedheim who developed a drug 
to treat african sleeping sickness that probably has saved 2 
million lives has died of kidney cancer at the age of 89 
friedheim who died at home saturday devised melarsoprol in the 
1930s and 40s to treat trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness the 
disease spread by the tsetse fly remains a serious problem in 
africa and friedheims drug is still used to treat some more 
advanced cases 
he also developed drugs to treat many other parasitic tropical 
diseases and later in his career devised remedies for lead and 
mercury poisoning when he died he also was working on drugs to 
treat cancer 
he continued to work virtually until his death said thomas 
donnelly a veterinarian who worked with friedheim when he was 
in the hospital he kept asking me about the results of our 
experiments he said i have to know he knew he was running out 
of time 
born in switzerland friedheim earned a medical degree as well 
as a doctorate in chemistry this training allowed him relative 
independence in a field dominated by research teams 
rockefeller university where friedheim had been a professor 
since 1978 issued a statement saying he singlehandedly 
performed chemical synthesis laboratory evaluation and clinical 
testing in the field the latter took him to africa asia south 
america and pacific islands 
it was unusual the way he was able to take the development 
of a drug from the laboratory to its application in the field 
said dr william trager a leading malaria researcher he had a 
lot of drive he went out to africa in the old days when it was 
really africa 
a month ago friedheim was honored at the 26th meeting of the 
international council for trypanosomiasis research in kenya peter 
deraadt of the world health organizations parasitic diseases unit 
credited friedheims development of melarsoprol with saving the 
lives of 2 million africans 
donnelly said that judging from estimates in various medical 
texts friedheims other drugs probably have saved an additional 1 
million lives around the world 
he is survived by his wife suzanne hagerstromfriedheim

bulgaria took the offensive tuesday at the opening 
session of an international human rights conference by blaming 
turkey for recent violence involving bulgarias ethnic turks 
the monthlong conference is to review human rights progress 
among the 35 nations that are signatories of the 1975 helsinki 
final act 
it also is expected to single out nations accused of specific 
abuses and romania and bulgaria are expected to take the brunt of 
criticism 
about 20 foreign ministers attended the opening of the monthlong 
conference the first of three mandated by the vienna review 
committee of the conference on security and cooperation in europe 
which ended in january 
in one of the first speeches foreign minister petar mladenov of 
bulgaria accused foreign circles of being behind recent 
disturbances in his country in which ethnic turks reportedly have 
been killed 
the bulgarian delegation made available the text of a speech by 
president todor zhivkov that said certain circles in the republic 
of turkey have launched a continuously escalating 
antibulgarian campaign 
this policy represents a gross interference in the internal 
affairs of a sovereign state the statement said 
the bulgarian president whose speech was broadcast on monday 
urged turkey to open its border to all bulgarian moslems who 
want to go there 
bulgaria has been deporting ethnic turks it considers 
undesirable an estimated 300 have been forced to leave most to 
austria and yugoslavia many also have been picked up by turkish 
airliners for resettlement in turkey 
according to an official report three people died in recent 
ethnic unrest deportees have put the figure at up to 30 the 
reports could not be confirmed independently 
mladenov said bulgaria wanted to discuss the problems with 
realism and good will 
the second human rights conference is to be held in copenhagen 
in 1990 and a third in moscow in 1991

with his arms control challenge to 
moscow president bush also sent a message home an almost 
taunting toldyouso to the political critics who said he was 
lagging instead of leading 
it is of course in loftier more diplomatic language and when 
he was asked whether hed intended that message he said not and 
laughed 
im not going to get into that game with the congress he 
said during a news conference at nato on tuesday or anyone 
else 
but there was no masking the presidents satisfaction in telling 
detractors and everyone else that hed known what he was doing 
during the long diplomatic dry spell 
he said hed been studying planning and preparing what the 
white house called the most farreaching western proposal for 
conventional arms control since world war ii 
bush noted that his administration took a bit of a hammering in 
congress and elsewhere for its goslow silent treatment of mikhail 
s gorbachevs soviet peace offensive 
but he said it hadnt bothered him i havent felt under seige 
in the united states because i knew exactly what we wanted to do 
the president said 
after presenting his arms control proposal to the atlantic 
allies on monday bush said this is the way we plan to lead 
lead the alliance and lead the free world 
it was a measure of his mood hed been accused of a failure to 
lead 
bush said at a news conference the criticism hadnt bothered 
him that hes weathered enough political criticism to become 
immune i just kind of write it off i was elected to do what i 
think is right 
bush emerged from the 40th anniversary nato summit in brussels 
with a strengthened hand both internationally and domestically his 
call for swift eastwest troop tank and aircraft cuts was a 
dramatic summit debut for the new leader at the nato table bush 
said he meant to transform the military map of europe and 
whether or not his proposal achieves that aim he is on the 
initiative now he relished the role 
here we go now on the offense with a proposal that is bold 
and tests whether the soviet union will move he said monday 
that was parlayed with a deal fashioned by nato foreign 
ministers early tuesday after a long night of negotiations to 
settle an intramural dispute about negotiations on shortrange 
nuclear missiles 
it was a compromise on bush terms overriding earlier west 
german demands for immediate talks with the soviet union on 
shortrange missile reductions the nato settlement calls for those 
talks to await an eastwest agreement to reduce troops and 
conventional weapons and the shortrange missiles will stay put 
until there have been actual cuts in conventional forces 
the successful results of this summit have given us a double 
hit bush rejoiced 
but he crowed with care so as not to rub it in for the west 
germans his next hosts his spokesman marlin fitzwater had 
called the missile deal a victory for the united states and for 
nato bush amended that i dont view it as a victory for the 
united states i view it as a victory for the alliance he said 
the president also said the west germans had strongly supported 
the missile settlement 
the nato deal said to have been designed largely by secretary 
of state james a baker iii cleared the table of an issue that had 
threatened to sow discord at the summit 
with that deal in hand bush and west german chancellor helmut 
kohl took separate commuterlength flights to bonn for their 
oneonone meetings after the first one they joined in praise of 
the nato agreements 
kohl has been under political pressure to get negotiations going 
immediately on the shortrange missiles almost all of them based 
in west germany but he told bush you are a friend among 
friends 
neither admitted to any german misgivings about the shortrange 
missile compromise i think we were all just winners in 
brussels said kohl 
he also said bushs visit would be helpful politically to him in 
the west german elections that are due next year 
bush goes from west germany to london and returns to the united 
states on friday strengthened politically as he confronts the 
domestic agenda he is likely to challenge the democratic congress 
with his first veto even before he gets back to washington to 
block a minimum wage increase he says is excessive and therefore 
likely to cost jobs 
hell head home satisfied and perhaps a bit feisty whatever 
political arrows might have been fired my way its all been worth 
it bush said

the looting and fighting in the 
streets that have shaken more than a dozen argentine cities and 
towns stem from an economic crisis of the first magnitude one 
that has been simmering for months 
the central bank which had been selling us dollars to prop up 
the austral and fend off inflation stopped the practice in 
february argentinas national currency has plunged in value by 
more than 90 percent since then 
inflation rocketed from 96 percent in february to 17 percent in 
march 334 percent in april and possibly 70 percent this month 
private economists say it may top 100 percent in june 
wages failed to keep pace suddenly food medicine and other 
basics were beyond the reach of hundreds of thousands of argentines 
doubling the national minimum wage on tuesday to 8700 australs 
a month about 50 is not likely to help much 
what people are earning doesnt enable them to put even one 
meal a day on the table thats a basic fact that society has to 
deal with said beverly keene of the human rights group peace and 
justice service 
inflation is but one facet of the crisis 
the national budget is in deficit the government of president 
raul alfonsin is hardpressed either to lay off employees or 
further increase charges for telephones electricity and other 
public services which were raised 40 percent only two weeks ago 
the foreign debt has climbed to 59 billion annual interest 
payments of 6 billion amount to about twice the annual trade 
surplus removing that as a source of investment interest has not 
been paid since last year 
economic deterioration is compounded by political paralysis the 
governing radical civic union lost national elections on may 14 
but presidentelect carlos menem of the peronist party is not due 
to take office until dec 10 
alfonsin has the authority to rule but menem has the crucial 
public support 
origins of the economic crisis date to the 1950s argentines 
since that decade have lived with a statemanaged economy powerful 
labor unions and political polarization between the two main 
parties and the military inflation has been tripledigit since the 
1970s 
alfonsin 62 has tried since his inauguration 5 years ago to 
reduce the role of the state diminish the power of organized 
labor curtail the militarys political ambitions and spark an 
economy that has stagnated for a decade 
in almost every area he failed

the government controlled by gen 
manuel antonio noriega is holding at least 89 political prisoners 
including opposition party officials two opposition leaders said 
tuesday 
the prisoners are nothing more than hostages opposition 
presidential candidate guillermo endara said in an interview with 
the associated press 
they the panamanian defense forces commanded by noriega take 
people prisoner for a while and then if things are quiet they just 
let them go he said they take people off the street people 
who were just watching a parade 
first vice presidential candidate ricardo arias calderon said 
six people arrested may 24 while marching with the opposition 
candidates to a meeting with a delegation from the organization of 
american states have not even been allowed to see their 
families 
for most of the 89 there has been no reply to habeas corpus 
or other judicial petitions showing how deeply the judiciary is 
subordinated to the interests of the military dictatorship arias 
calderon told a news conference 
international observers at the may 7 election said the 
opposition led by endara won the elections by about a 31 margin 
but the official returns were seized by troops and on may 10 the 
vote was nullified by the governments electoral tribunal 
the oas at a meeting in washington crticitized noriega the 
nullification and the beating of opposition candidates it urged a 
quick transfer of power and sent a delegation to panama 
arias calderon distributed a list of 89 people he said were 
political prisoners and it included opposition spokesman luis 
martins legislative candidate felipe escobar antonio galvez one 
of arias calderons bodyguards and jose guillermo lutrel a 
panamanian human rights committee election observer 
he said the total held was more than 100 but some had not been 
identified 
many of the prisoners were accused of threatening the security 
of the state and were summarily sentenced to a year in jail by a 
judge on the night of their arrest according to arias calderon 
he said such sentences often can be converted into fines payable 
at the rate of a dollar a day but relatives of the prisoners had 
been told nobody is available to collect the fines 
messages left for a defense forces spokesman for comment on 
arias calderons charges were not returned the defense forces have 
not commented on the issue despite previous requests 
endara said about half of the 170 to 200 people arrested during 
and after the election have been released and it appears others are 
being freed onebyone and often without paying a fine 
they havent released anybody who is wellknown however 
said endara 
arias calderon noted the oas delegation is to file a report on 
june 5 and the oas council of ministers will meet the following day 
he said again the opposition wants the oas to recognize its 
victory and impose a diplomatic and political quarantine on panama 
if noriega and his handpicked government refuse to surrender power 
arias calderon said the opposition would continue to insist that 
noriega and the panamanian defense forces be included in political 
negotiations saying they hold the real power 
noriega has said the political parties should settle the 
dispute and arias calderon said noriega is trying to hide behind 
a smokescreen

commercial banks expect to hear at a meeting 
in madrid spain on june 7 what help they can expect from 
governments in reducing third world debt an international banking 
official told congress tuesday 
horst schulmann a west german heads the institute of 
international finance a washingtonbased organization that 
represents 182 big banks in the united states and 38 other 
countries 
he was testifying at a hearing on progress under treasury 
secretary nicholas f bradys march proposal for debt reduction 
debt forgiveness is equivalent to foreign aid but banks are 
not in the foreign aid business schulmann said 
if banks are coerced into taking large losses under the brady 
initiative they will be unwilling to provide addditional 
financing 
third world countries owe about half their 12 trillion debt to 
commercial banks according to rep sam gejdenson dcomn he 
chaired the hearing as head of the subcommittee on international 
economic policy of the house foreign affairs committee 
members of congress and treasury undersecretary david mulford 
have warned banks that unless they cooperate with brady there 
could be action against them from the us government 
schulmann said the madrid meeting will include michel camdessus 
of france who heads the international monetary fund the fund 
owned by 151 govwernments has promised to aside a part of its 
future loans for debt reduction directors of its sister 
organization the world bank met on tuesday to decide what role it 
will take barber conable the banks us president will also go 
to madrid 
we are not planning to do anything for the commercial banks 
said frank vogl chief spokesman for conable but there are many 
things we want to do for our member countries 
also expected at the madrid meeting is e gerald corrigan 
president of the federal reserve bank of new york the federal 
reserve would have an important role in making the changes in 
official regulations that us banks would like to see as part of a 
debtforgiveness package 
another witness eugene h rotberg executive vice president of 
merrill lynch amp co inc and former vice president of the world 
bank said debt reduction will not reduce the amount of interest 
countries would pay from their own resources unless the reduction 
is greater than new loans the banks will be asked to make 
the fact is in recent years many debtors have met only about 
half of their debt service obligations the balance comes from the 
banks themselves as new loans rotberg added 
last year debtor countries paid out 26 billion as interest 
gejdenson said adding that the united states and other major 
governments had helped by underwriting the world bank and 
international monetary fund

a group of 29 scientists and arms control 
experts called on congress tuesday to reconsider plans to build a 
plant in idaho to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons 
in a letter to the chairmen of the house and senate armed 
services committees and other key legislators the experts said the 
plant is not needed for national security and would undermine us 
efforts to limit the spread of nuclear arms 
the bush administration is seeking authorization to begin 
building a special isotope separation plant at the idaho national 
engineering laboratory near idaho falls the plant would use a new 
laser technology to convert fuelgrade plutonium from energy 
department stockpiles to weapongrade plutonium 
the letter dated may 26 was signed by paul leventhal 
president of the nuclear control institute a private group 
concerned with nuclear proliferation problems 
among other signers were retired adm thomas davies a former 
assistant director of the us arms control and disarmament agency 
peter bradford a former member of the nuclear regulatory 
commission and peter clausen research director for the union of 
concerned scientists and a former cia and energy department analyst 
the group said it was concerned that the technology could spread 
to other nations that could convert fuelgrade plutonium from 
civilian plants to develop a nuclear arsenal it also expressed 
concern that the us plant eventually could be used to purify 
plutonium from us commercial nuclear reactors even though this 
is specifically outlawed by the 1982 atomic energy act 
for both these reasons going forward with the sis plant could 
severely compromise us nonproliferation objectives the letter 
said 
in view of the acknowledged surplus of plutonium in the us 
nuclear arsenal there are no clear national security benefits that 
offset the obvious nuclear proliferation and terrorism risks 
posed by use of the plant they added 
the isotope separation technology is still under development at 
an energy department laboratory in california although the 
administration wants to break ground on the idaho plant this year

ahmed jibril leader of a palestinian 
group us officials suspect was behind the bombing of a pan am 
jet met irans foreign minister ali akbar velayati in syria this 
month diplomatic sources said 
the may 22 meeting came as jibrils radical group the popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command renewed 
denials it was involved in the pan am bombing dec 21 that killed 
270 people 
us and other western intelligence officials believe the 
popular front carried out the bombing at irans request in 
retaliation for the us navys downing of an iran air jetliner 
last july in the persian gulf all 290 people aboard died 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said velayati 
and jibril discussed irans support for the palestinian struggle 
against israel 
they said jibril asserted that armed struggle was the only way 
the palestinians will regain their homeland 
like jibril and other syrianbacked palestinian leaders iran 
has denounced plo chairman yasser arafats peace initiative 
renunciation of terrorism and recognition of israel 
the sources said velayati was in damascus the syrian capital 
for consultations with president hafez assad before last weeks 
arab summit conference which endorsed arafats initiative and 
sought ways to end the lebanese civil war 
jibril denies involvement in the pan am bombing but he has said 
his group makes bombs similar to the one investigators believed 
exploded in the plane over lockerbie scotland on a flight from 
frankfurt via london to new york 
iran also denies involvement 
popular front spokesman fahd shrourou said on may 21 in damascus 
in decrying us allegations were not agents for iran or anyone 
else they didnt ask us theyre not allowed to ask us for such 
things 
he said that american insistence on blaming us is because 
theyve failed to get any evidence firmly linking his group with 
the pan am bombing 
diplomats and counterterrorism specialists believe jibril and 
palestinian terrorist mastermind abu nidal forged new links over 
the last year with iranian radicals and their shiite moslem allies 
in lebanon 
the radical resurgence in tehran the confrontation with the 
west over british author salman rushdies novel the satanic 
verses which many moslem say blasphemes islam and opposition by 
hardline palestinian factions to arafats initiative by the 
palestine liberation organization would provide fertile ground for 
such an alliance 
iranian parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani asked palestinians 
this month to kill five westerners for every palestinian slain by 
israelis in the uprising in the occupied territories and to attack 
western targets 
he later claimed he was misinterpreted but his remarks were 
seen as reflecting the militancy of radicals now ascendant in 
tehran 
the diplomatic sources said evidence against the the popular 
front for the liberation of palestinegeneral command in the pan am 
sabotage is circumstantial but its there 
they cited the arrest of 14 popular front activists in west 
germany last october including a top jibril lieutenant kassem 
dalkamoni 
the men had czechoslovakmade semtex explosives hidden in a 
candy wrapper and a bomb hidden in a japanesemade cassette radio 
linked to a barometric device 
investigators have concluded the pan am bomb contained semtex 
was hidden in a cassette radio packed in a suitcase and was 
triggered by a barometric sensor 
popular front officials said the men arrested in west germany 
were heading for the middle east to attack israeli targets 
shrourou said we dont carry out attacks in europe because 
that would have a negative effect on the support of the eec 
european economic community nations for the palestinian 
struggle 
however western european governments have generally supported 
arafats efforts to negotiate a settlement with israel a move 
jibril and his fellow radicals consider a betrayal of the 
palestinian cause 
diplomats and counterterrorism specialists doubt the popular 
fronts claim it would not hit targets in europe 
police in sweden last week arraigned three men they said were 
linked to the popular front for the liberation of palestinegeneral 
command for suspected complicity in the 1985 bombing of a danish 
synagogue and similar attacks on us and israeli airline offices 
in denmark sweden and the netherlands

potential candidates began lining up quickly during the memorial 
day holiday weekend to vie for the chance to succeed rep tony 
coelho the house majority whip from california who announced he is 
resigning 
but while house speaker jim wright is thought to be planning to 
resign in the face of an ethics investigation the gop chairman in 
wrights home county in texas says that if the democrat decided to 
stay in office its unlikely anyone could oust him from the seat 
he has held 34 years 
a special election will be required to fill the san joaquin 
valley congressional seat coelho a democrat is vacating 
democratic assemblymen gary condit of ceres jim costa of fresno 
and rusty areias of los banos havent said either yes or no yet 
but condit and costa at least are expected to run 
on the republican side modesto mayor carol whiteside is firmly 
in the race and assemblyman bill jones and fresno county district 
attorney ed hunt are considering running for the office 
california gov george deukmejian will schedule a special 
election in the 5th congressional district probably in late august 
or early september with a runoff if needed during the november 
general election 
in wrights case the texas democrat probably has a safe seat in 
congress as long as he wants it despite the ethics investigation 
that some say could force him to resign says steve hollern 
chairman of the tarrant county gop 
the republican party made its last concerted effort to oust 
wright in 1980 winning just 39 percent of the vote and wright had 
no opposition when he sought reelection last year months after 
the ethics probe was launched 
i think if jim wright decides not to stay in congress the 
whole ball game changes hollern said tuesday if he stays 
there i dont think we can beat him 
wright has been charged with 69 violations of house rules he 
said tuesday he will announce this week whether he will resign 
in congress rep thomas s foley dwash currently the

several were injured tuesday during a confrontation with police in 
kosovo province where more than two dozen people have died in 
ethnic violence this year 
a delegation from the european parliament visited the southern 
province to assess human rights abuses there 
tanjug the official news agency said the delegation would meet 
with officials of the predominantly ethnic albanian province about 
human rights violations under a state of emergency imposed after 
riots by ethnic albanians in february and march

podujevo 20 miles north of pristina the provincial capital 
about 50 ethnic albanians were involved in the protest tanjug 
said but sources in the area said there were 80 people some 
carrying banners or albanian flags 
the tanjug report did not give the number of people injured or 
say whether the person killed was shot to death it said protesters 
hurled stones at police 
because of the aggressive behavior of the demonstrators the 
policemen were forced to intervene tanjug said witnesses said 
both sides used firearms 
a source said privately it was believed to be the largest 
albanian protest in two months emergency measures imposed after 
the februarymarch riots forbid public gatherings of more than 
three people 
tanjug said earlier the fivemember european parliament 
delegation led by julian grimaldos of spain met on sunday in 
belgrade with senior officials of the serbian republic kosovo is 
an automous province within serbia yugoslavias largest republic 
ethnic albanians about 85 percent of kosovos 18 million

ethnic albanians

hundreds wounded in the riots earlier this year about 800 ethnic 
albanians were arrested

the district of columbia council on tuesday 
passed emergency legislation designed to prevent the extradition of 
a teenager facing a possible death sentence in alabama 
supporters of the measure which will remain in effect for 90 
days said it was needed because of uncertainty over whether the 
districts ban on capital punishment could be used to block 
extradition of juvenile suspects facing a possible death sentence 
that question is now before a district court 
the 17yearold teenager identified only by the initials om 
could face murder and arson charges in connection with an april 
1988 firebombing of a gadsen ala apartment that took the life of 
a 14monthold boy the teenager is being held here pending a 
decision on alabamas extradition request 
during more than three hours of debate tuesday supporters of 
the measure said a jurisdiction that bans capital punishment should 
not subject a suspect in its custody to the death penalty 
elsewhere others also raised questions about whether the youth 
who is black would receive a fair trial 
it is reprehensible that a jurisdiction would even consider 
applying a death penalty to a juvenile said william lightfoot a 
council member that is not civilized conduct 
another member nadine winter said that by refusing to 
extradite the youth the district could gain a reputation as a 
haven for juveniles accused of serious crimes 
at a recent court hearing relatives of the teenager recounted 
alleged racial abuse by gadsen officials also reviewed at the 
hearing were comments recently made to the washington post by the 
countys only juvenile judge robert e lewis in which lewis 
suggested he thought the teenager likely was involved in the 
firebombing 
the emergency legislation which would apply only to om was 
sought after a recent court hearing left in doubt whether the 
districts existing laws were sufficient to block the extradition 
the teenagers attorney gerald fisher argued the districts 
death penalty ban must be applied by district courts when 
considering interstate juvenile extraditions

rep claude denson pepper whose political 
odyssey took him from the senate to the house spanned 53 years and 
10 presidents and made him the unrivaled champion of americas 
senior citizens died tuesday he was 88 and the oldest member of 
congress 
pepper had been hospitalized since april 6 suffering from an 
undisclosed stomach ailment which a spokesman in his office said 
tuesday was cancer he died at walter reed army hospital where he 
returned a month ago after an interim stay at johns hopkins 
hospital in baltimore 
tributes poured in 
president bush on his european trip said in a statement in 
bonn west germany claude pepper gave definition and meaning to 
the concept of public service he fought for the poor and the 
elderly in his own determined way claude pepper was a 
gentleman a noble human being 
he will be greatly missed said rep charles wilson 
dtexas but we should have the kind of life he had 
there has never been a greater friend and advocate for older 
americans said rep richard gephardt dmo claude pepper was 
and will always remain one of our national treasures 
just last thursday bush went to the hospital to present the 
presidential medal of freedom to pepper who was only the fourth 
member of congress to receive the award 
rep david bonior dmich said pepper obviously was wracked 
with pain but was able to bring himself together and speak for 10 
minutes obviously there wasnt a dry eye in the place including 
those of the president 
congress on wednesday is to act on a resolution so that pepper 
could lie in state in the capitol rotunda on thursday 
the florida democrat was elected to the senate in 1936 as a 
liberal crusader for franklin roosevelts new deal he promptly 
made his mark as an architect of some of the nations most enduring 
safety net programs including social security the minimum 
wage and medical assistance for the elderly and for handicapped 
children 
he remained in the senate for 14 years then after an 
interlude practicing law and teaching following a bitter 
reelection defeat began a house career that would include 14 
terms 
he was still going strong when he barnstormed the nation last 
year in an effort to fend off reagan budget cuts and elect to the 
white house a fellow liberal michael dukakis who was all of 3 
years old when pepper first came to congress he had supported 
gephardt until the missouri congressman dropped out 
pepper didnt have to campaign to win his most recent term in 
the house no one ran against him after he won with 74 percent of 
the vote in 1986 
born poor in 1900 in rural alabama pepper was the preeminent 
eyewitness to americas turbulent journey through the 20th century 
he was 5 years old in 1905 when he first saw an automobile he 
witnessed the passing of halleys comet in 1910 and again in 1986 
he met orville wright and greeted the apollo 11 crew on their 
return to earth 
he stared adolf hitler down in a nuremberg beer hall sized up 
joseph stalin at the kremlin and earned winston churchills 
undying affection for casting the only vote in the senate for the 
lendlease act the first time around 
among several leadership posts over the years he was most 
recently chairman of the rules committee a position he took 
because of its influence in deciding what bills would go to the 
floor affecting the elderly and poor 
pepper also gained prominence as chairman of the house select 
committee on aging an advisory forum that he unabashedly used to 
draw public attention to the problems of old people he was 
instrumental in the passage of the medicare catastrophic coverage 
act of 1988 
one of peppers proudest accomplishments was a law that bars 
forced retirement he was the principal author and driving force 
behind the law passed in 1986 which makes it illegal for 
employers of more than 20 workers to require retirement at any age 
and orders continued health coverage for older workers 
his own advice to the older set was to keep on doing what 
youre doing but maybe at a slower pace 
i was playing golf one day he said a few years back when 
i noticed my partners clubs were lighter than mine i found i 
could handle them easier so i changed to less weighty clubs 
so thats what you do in life he said when you come to a 
time when theres a need for any sort of change simply lighten 
your clubs and go right ahead 
in recent years pepper pushed hard for legislation to provide 
federal money for longterm home health care but colleagues 
defeated the pepper bill last june finding a procedural way to 
do it so as to spare his feelings as much as possible 
in his final years he dug in his heels against cutting social 
security benefits to elderly retired workers half a century after 
campaigning for establishment of the retirement program 
his senate career ended in 1950 after a campaign which saw him 
branded as red pepper playing on claims during the communist 
scare of the era that he was soft on the soviet union a fellow 
democrat george smathers took his place 
pepper was elected to the house from the miami district in 1962 
he was never defeated again largely because of his dogged 
attention to retirees in a city heavily populated by them 
his florid fingerwagging lectures at committee hearings 
reflected the politics of the old rural south where he had his 
roots often he faced news cameras like a tv star as he raked a 
recalcitrant witness over the coals 
he wore thick hornrimmed trifocal glasses and was all but deaf 
without his hearing aids one for each ear he underwent heart 
surgery in 1976 for a valve replacement and again in 1982 to have 
a pacemaker implanted 
pepper who stood 5foot7 and weighed 180 pounds had strands 
of thin white hair for a while he wore a toupee but quit in 1980 
after it blew off during an appearance with thenpresident carter 
early in his political career pepper cosponsored repeal of 
poll taxes often used to bar poor blacks from voting even 
though florida at the time was hostile to racial change 
in the late 1930s he attended a nuremberg conference and 
returned to the united states convinced that hitler had to be 
stopped he pushed for the draft and massive military assistance 
to great britain while isolationist fever still gripped the nation 
he was hanged in effigy on the capitol lawn by irate mothers who 
called him a warmonger after the war conservatives accused him of 
not being hawkish enough against the soviet union 
he was the first national legislator to push publicly for 
federal funding for the war against cancer a disease that took his 
wife mildred in 1979 some 43 years after they were married they 
had no children

us agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
touring droughtstricken southern iowa on tuesday said conditions 
were better than he expected but that didnt mean folks are out 
of the woods 
yeutter said pastures he saw were not as good as normal but 
added that dry weather has hit other areas harder 
the drought situation in the other states is more severe than 
it is in iowa yeutter said in a relative sense the pasture 
conditions out west are much more troubling than they are here 
yeutter visited the area after being briefed by a special 
drought task force he also watched the iowa national guard hauling 
water 
the cabinet officials tour came as heavy thunderstorms rumbled 
across other sections of iowa following holiday weekend rains 
throughout the state 
in terms of crop conditions and pasture conditions i would 
say overall they do look better that i expected yeutter said 
that doesnt mean folks are out of the woods its dramatically 
improved from what it was a couple of weeks ago 
yeutter said a decision on opening fragile setaside acres for 
grazing would come very soon 
today isnt the time to do that he said the time to do 
that is after weve had some time to assess the rainfall in recent 
days this has been a strange weather year all over the united 
states 
for conservation purposes the government pays farmers not to 
farm setaside land during last summers drought some setaside 
land was opened up for grazing or hay harvesting 
state officials said tuesday that subsoil moisture and 
groundwater supplies are dangerously low but said its too early 
to determine if corn and soybeans will be damaged 
yeutter said kansas winter wheat crop has been devastated by 
dry weather 
he offered little hope of a big drought aid package this year 
we have to be careful we dont overestimate the problem he 
said 
yeutter trudged across farms near afton about 75 miles 
southwest of des moines touring cattle farms officials said 
cattle farmers face the most immediate danger because ponds are 
drying up and hay has been scorched in the fields 
state officials had a trench dug to illustrate their point that 
soil moisture levels are low 
i think he understands said gov terry branstad hes a 
farmer from nebraska and he understands that just because we got a 
little rain in the last couple of weeks it doesnt mean the 
droughts over 
branstad asked yeutter to open acres for grazing and give more 
money for rural water systems 
yeutter held out little hope of quick federal assistance noting 
that water projects are expensive two projects that state 
officials pushed him to approve cost 11 million and his total 
budget for such efforts is 4 million yeutter said

from around the country saluted rep claude d pepper on tuesday as 
a tireless and tenacious advocate for the poor and elderly during a 
more than halfcentury career in public service

giant a heart that felt the pain of a world where children go to 
sleep hungry and where the old die alone rep joe moakley

will be deeply missed 
house speaker jim wright said he expected the house and senate 
to adopt a resolution on wednesday clearing the way for pepper to 
lie in state in the capitol rotunda on thursday 
for longer than the rest of us he was a moving force in 
american life wright said he was always a voice for the 
voiceless and a helping hand for the helpless he said 
such sentiments were echoed by officials from peppers home 
state of florida and by his friends and colleagues in congress 
where at 88 he was the oldest member all spoke of his commitment 
and inspiration to the elderly others spoke of his tireless 
advocacy of other causes as well some commented on the mark he 
left on them 
like all floridians i am deeply saddened by the death of 
claude pepper florida gov bob martinez said the sense of 
loss we all feel is softened by the warm memory of a lifetime full 
of achievements on behalf of all people through his words and 
through his actions claude pepper proved that older americans need

improving their lives and those of others he was a rare human 
being and we are all richer for his presence among us

claude pepper was one of americas political giants of this

career pepper was a champion for justice for civil rights for a 
prepared america to defeat nazi tyranny and for dignity for older

memory by renewing our dedication to his ideals of justice and 
human dignity 
republican sen connie mack of florida said congressman 
pepper will be missed not only by those of us who served with him 
but by americans everywhere whose lives are now better because of 
his dedication and leadership to say that congressman pepper was 
an institution is an understatement of the commitment and 
contribution he made to improving the lives of individual 
americans 
horace b deets executive director of the american association 
of retired persons said of pepper more than anyone in our 
lifetime he helped us as a nation realize the contributions that 
older americans can make to our nation if given a chance 
moakley was visiting pepper last week when bush presented pepper

because it was part of his view of our nation that the care of 
those who built it should remain a concern of those who inherit

mikhail s gorbachev uncovered one of the 
kremlins bestkept secrets tuesday by disclosing that the soviet 
union will spend about 118 billion on defense this year about 
four times what it previously acknowledged 
i am announcing this real figure of military expenditures to 
the congress of peoples deputies 773 billion rubles the 
soviet president told the 2250member national parliament to gasps 
of astonishment 
gorbachev pledged defense spending would be cut by 10 billion 
rubles 153 billion by the end of 1991 as the soviet union 
redirects its resources to revive the soviet economy and ease world 
tensions by reducing arms 
today we can ensure security by political and diplomatic 
means gorbachev declared during an address on foreign and 
domestic policy this makes it possible to cut down on military 
expenditures without any detriment to the defense capability of 
our country 
the central intelligence agency estimates annual soviet defense 
spending at 115 billion to 125 billion rubles roughly equivalent 
to pentagon expenditures of 300 billion richard kaufman an 
expert with the joint economic committee of congress said in 
washington 
in gorbachevs 95minute address to the congress on the state of 
the countrys foreign and domestic policy he also 
proposed creation of a special legislative commission to 
review the decadesold system of privileges for the elite 
acknowledged complaints that government ministries are 
restructuring very slowly if at all and urged deputies to 
question government ministers on why they are dragging their feet 
on reforms 
announced local elections will be postponed from fall to the 
spring of 1990 to give lawmakers a chance to correct problems in 
the electoral system that arose during the spring campaign 
pledged that the ruling communist party he heads is open to 
talks with any social group or organization backing reform 
he also outlined a system of legislative oversight that would 
invest the fulltime legislature or the supreme soviet and 
national parliament with broad powers to change the constitution 
question government officials and review state spending 
gorbachev said the supreme soviet should create a commission 
that would act as a constitutional court to ensure the transition 
to a nation ruled by law and respectful of individual rights 
his moves seemed aimed at creating expert policymaking bodies 
independent of the communist party bureaucrats who have run the 
country for decades and whom gorbachev blames for slowing his 
reforms 
leonid i abalkin director of the official economics institute 
said gorbachevs surprise disclosure on soviet defense spending was 
aimed at ending distrust in eastwest arms reductions talks caused 
by decades of kremlin secrecy 
as recently as october allocations for the soviet military in 
the official 1989 government budget were listed to be the same as 
in 1988 202 billion rubles 32 billion 
gorbachev did not say what his real figure embraced but 
maj gen vladimir kuklev deputy chairman of the general staff 
told a news briefing the sum includes expenses for purchasing 
weapons as well as research and development 
abalkin indicated some government operations with military 
applications such as space programs still were not included in 
the new figure 
gorbachevs announcement is unlikely to settle the question of 
how much money the soviets spend on defense many questions remain 
about how the price of soviet weapons are set and the official 
exchange rate for the ruble which makes the 773billionruble 
defense budget equal to 118 billion artificially inflates the 
value of the ruble 
abalkin said soviet defense spending was about 9 percent of the 
countrys gross national product the sum of all goods and services 
produced asked why previous official figures were much lower he 
said they represented only what we could call the budget of the 
ministry of defense and not appropriations for ministries in 
charge of producing weaponry 
the washington think tank planecon has figured soviet defense 
spending at 122 billion rubles or 13 percent of gnp the us 
defense budget by comparison is 300 billion or 6 percent of its 
much larger gnp 
gorbachev announced in a dec 7 1988 address to the united 
nations that the soviet armed forces would be unilaterally reduced 
by a halfmillion men to 37 million he later said there would be 
a 12 percent reduction in military manpower a 142 percent cut in 
the defense budget and a 195 percent cut in weapons production 
but western leaders continued to question the impact of the 
promised cuts pointing to what they regarded as unrealistic soviet 
defense spending figures gorbachevs speech was coolly received by 
communist party maverick boris n yeltsin 
i was expecting something new something entirely and 
radically new that would take into account the crisis state of 
society and the party the former moscow party leader said in an 
interview 
more than 400 congress deputies including yeltsin and human 
rights activist andrei d sakharov asked for an opportunity to 
reply to gorbachevs speech and deputies trooped to the 
microphones tuesday mostly to offer their own points of view on 
issues of concern to their constituents rather than to respond 
directly to the presidents remarks 
the debate later tuesday over the april 9 military action 
against a proindependence demonstration in the georgian capital of 
tbilisi aroused far more passion than gorbachevs speech 
tamaz gamkrelidze director of georgias institute of eastern 
studies won stormy applause after demanding that col gen igor 
rodionov caucasus military commander be ousted from the congress 
for the assault 
at least 19 people died in the clash with soldiers and another 
was shot to death that night

the mayor of the jewish settlement of ariel in 
the occupied west bank said tuesday palestinians working in the 
town will be required to wear alien worker tags 
some members of parliament condemned the plan comparing it to 
the yellow stars of david that jews were forced to wear in nazi 
germany 
plans to control arabs also were reported or underway in two 
jewish suburbs of tel aviv 
in petah tikva construction began on an encampment for arab 
workers outside the town municial officials in ramat gan were 
considering an ordinance to ban all arab workers 
ariel mayor ron nachman said in an interview the tag system was 
adopted for security reasons 
he said palestinians working in ariel would undergo daily 
security checks and then would be issued tags identifying them as 
alien workers 
we dont have any control over the hundreds of arabs who come 
every day he said we want to be sure that no terrorists enter 
ariel getting a job is a privilege not a right 
nachman said about 400 palestinians work in construction and 
municipal services in ariel which has a population of 8000 those 
workers are threatened by other arabs who want to stop them from 
assisting the jewish settlers and they deserve protection he 
added 
the plan was denounced in parliament during a debate on the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
those who give tags to the arabs walk around freely said 
yossi sarid of the citizens rights movement i just hope these 
tags arent yellow 
they are yellow said shulamit aloni of sarids party 
speaking on israel television im amazed they just propose a 
tag why shouldnt we tattoo their skin 
about 6 million jews perished in the nazi holocaust and many of 
the victims and survivors had concentration camp numbers tattooed 
on their arms 
twentyfive legislators from seven parties signed a petition 
demanding that the government denounce nachmans step 
among the signers were members of the rightwing likud bloc of 
prime minister yitzhak shamir lawmakers from the leftist labor 
party and even members of the nationalist tsomet party israel 
radio reported 
there have been various efforts to control the movement of about 
110000 arabs working in israel since the uprising began in 
december 1988 
after stonethrowing battles in the southern israeli towns of 
ashkelon and ashdod the army on may 15 ordered all 50000 gazans 
who were employed in israel to return to the gaza strip 
shmuel goren israels coordinator for the occupied lands said 
gazans would be given a special permit for work in israel and the 
system probably would be expanded to cover the estimated 60000 
west bank arabs who work in israel 
petah tikva mayor giora lev said construction is to be completed 
by the end of the week for the encampment for arab workers being 
built in the sgula industrial zone at the entrance to the tel aviv 
suburb 
he said the camp will be equipped with running water and toilet 
facilities 
palestinians will be banned from petah tikva unless they are 
brought in from the encampment ty jewish employers 
i think its for the benefit of the public lev said 
everybody says its about time we impose some order the 
residents dont want to see them arabs in their courtyards 
inside their houses and we had four bombs in the last three 
months

by a 72 vote in a california case the court said a 1982 
federal law exempts from alimony any military retirement pay that a 
veteran converts into disability benefits 
the court also said the law requires that the alimony a military 
veteran is ordered to provide must be calculated on aftertaxes 
income not gross pay 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said congress 
is free to change the law 
but until that happens a lawyer in the case said that more than 
a million divorce settlements could be reopened 
in other action the court 
refused to lift strict advertising limits imposed on a texas 
counseling center that authorities called a fake abortion 
clinic run by antiabortion activists the center was found to 
have enticed women there with misleading ads so counselors could 
urge them to continue their pregnancy 
let stand a ruling that bans organized prayers at the start of 
high school football games in georgia alabama and florida a lower 
court ruled that such pregame invocations impermissibly promote 
religion 
agreed to consider reviving a federal lawsuit stemming from the 
collapse of the old court savings amp loan association in maryland 
ruled 72 that floridas death penalty law does not have to 
require juries instead of judges to make the specific findings 
authorizing imposition of capital punishment 
ruled 80 against mining companies seeking to revive a 5 
percent cap on the royalties they pay to help finance arizona 
public schools 
in the divorce case organizations representing more than 12 
million military personnel had urged the justices to shield the 
disability pay from divorce decrees 
the court said tuesdays ruling may inflict economic harm on 
many former spouses but marshall said we decline to misread 
the statute to reach a sympathetic result when such a reading 
requires us to do violence to the plain language and ignore 
much of the legislative history 
he added that the 1982 law is aimed at dividing only a veterans 
disposable retirement pay the net amount of money received 
each month 
excluded from that figure marshall said is money the veteran 
chooses to convert into taxexempt disability benefits as well as 
any taxes paid on the military pension 
justice sandra day oconnor in a dissenting opinion said 
the harsh reality of this holding is that former spouses can 
without their consent be denied a fair share of their exspouses 
military pension simply because he elects to convert a portion of 
that pension into disability benefits 
justice harry a blackmun joined oconnor in dissent 
the case stems from the 1979 divorce of gerald and gaye mansell 
after 25 years of marriage 
mansell a retired air force major receives 1200 a month in 
retirement pay and 482 in disability benefits 
the amount of disability pay veterans may receive is based on 
the seriousness of the disability and the resulting impairment on 
their ability to work veterans commonly choose to convert part of 
their pensions into disability pay because the latter is taxexempt 
the mansells divorce settlement filed in merced county 
calif awarded mrs mansell half the retirement pay in an 
uncontested split of that money the decree also gave her half the 
disability benefits 
but mansell went to court in 1983 to modify the divorce decree 
and exclude the disability pay the california courts rejected his 
request 
california is a community property state meaning property 
acquired during marriage is considered jointly owned 
tuesdays ruling also applies to states that split up property 
for divorced couples based on a theory of equitable 
distribution 
the decision focused on the law congress passed to reverse a 
1981 supreme court decision that barred state courts from dividing 
military pensions in divorces 
the 1982 law called the uniformed services former spouses 
protection act allows retirement pay to be subjected to alimony 
awards 
the justice department which sided initially with mrs mansell 
changed its mind late last year and concluded that her former 
husbands interpretation of the 1982 law was correct 
dennis cornell mrs mansells lawyer said the decision could 
allow more than a million exmembers of the armed services to 
reopen their divorce cases and try to reduce the alimony they pay 
he said many divorce settlements have been based on a veterans 
gross retirement pay 
im hopeful congress will act to undo the decision cornell 
said 
the national organization for women legal defense and education 
fund called the ruling a cruel blow for those who seek alimony 
payments from military retirees who seek to avoid obligations to 
their former families

its center is miamis heavily cuban eighth street or calle ocho

a special election will be held to fill peppers seat but it 
could not be held for at least 40 days because of the minimum 
intervals for filing and two primary elections that would have to 
be held 
tributes came from all over florida which pepper watched grow 
from mostly rural land into the nations fourth mostpopulous state 
and which became home to many of the senior citizens whose cause he 
championed 
he always said it was the senior citizens who made this 
country great said leila johnson a resident of mildred and 
claude pepper towers a federally subsidized seniorcitizen 
apartment complex named for pepper and his late wife 
mrs johnson said she never really understood how she could be 
important until she heard pepper outline his belief that after

her are still contributing to society

contribution said mrs johnson 74 he really made me feel 
important

israeli soldiers and allied militiamen killed a 
guerrilla tuesday who apparently was trying to cross the border 
into israel the army reported 
israel radio said police were questioning 20 students at a 
hebrew study center in nablus about an attack by jewish settlers on 
a west bank village monday in which a 13yearold girl was shot to 
death 
leaders of the ariel settlement founded in the occupied west 
bank in 1977 said palestinians who work there will have to wear 
tags identifying them as alien workers 
soldiers wounded at least 15 palestinians in the occupied 
territories nine in the gaza strip and six in the west bank 
according to arab hospital officials 
arab reports said 8monthold mohammed hamdan was hit in the 
head by a plastic bullet when israeli soldiers dispersed a march by 
about 350 west bank palestinians in tulkarem refugee camp he was 
reported in critical condition at muqassed hospital in east 
jerusalem 
in south lebanon a guerrilla wearing military camouflage was 
spotted by israeli soldiers and allied south lebanon army 
militiamen east of marjayoun an army statement said 
he was wounded in an exchange of gunfire then was pursued and 
killed by the militia it said one militiaman was slightly wounded 
army sources said he was a palestinian trying to infiltrate 
israel middle east television run by the usbased christian 
broadcasting network said the guerrilla was a survivor of a squad 
intercepted sunday in the security zone israel maintains just 
north of its border 
two guerrillas were killed sunday and two were wounded and 
captured after katyusha rockets were fired into the israeli border 
town of matulla slightly wounding an infant 
israel radio said 20 young settlers from the study center in 
nablus were being questioned about the attack on nearby kifil 
harith in which ibtisam bozieh became the 500th palestinian killed 
in the uprising against israeli rule that began dec 8 1987 
twentytwo israelis also have been slain 
members of the student group said they were hiking to a 
religious shrine in kifil harith when palestinians began throwing 
stones police reports said the students set fires in grain fields 
outside the village and appeared to start shooting as soon as they 
entered the village 
the rampage in kifil harith was the latest retaliatory action by 
settlers against palestinian stonings or firebombings 
defense minister yitzhak rabin told a parliament committee it 
was the job of the police and army to enforce the law 
he noted that many of the 70000 jewish settlers have been given 
weapons for protection but added they are forbidden to take 
the laws into their own hands and carry out punishment raids 
daniella weiss a leader of the settlers gush emunim movement 
told israel radio the jews were being provoked to take action 
if people react to attacks by arabs they should be praised 
for it and no one should speak against it she said 
the us government condemned vigilante attacks by jewish 
settlers 
we note the israeli governments views that there could be no 
justification for people taking the law into their own hands we 
certainly agree with that state department spokesman richard 
boucher said in washington 
in ariel near kifil harith mayor ron nachmann said in a 
telephone interview that the palestinian workers would undergo a 
daily security check before being issued tags identifying them as 
alien workers 
we want to be sure that no terrorists enter ariel nachmann 
said 
about 400 palestinians work in ariel a settlement of more than 
8000 israelis the palestinians are mainly residents of the west 
bank which was captured by israel from jordan in the 1967 middle 
east war 
the tag policy was announced on tuesday and is believed to be 
the first of its kind in israel 
in the tel aviv suburb of petahtikva officials have begun 
building an encampment for arab workers they are supposed to 
be taken to and from work by employers without being allowed to 
walk the streets freely

state television aired a solidarity 
election program tuesday featuring a former us presidential 
adviser and a comedian instructing voters how to choose candidates 
in the june 4 election 
it was followed immediately by an official commentator who 
indirectly criticized zbigniew brzezinski an adviser to former 
president jimmy carter 
the start of the solidarity broadcast was delayed for 18 minutes 
by the coverage of an election rally for prime minister mieczyslaw 
f rakowski 
brzezinski seated in front of a solidarity banner said a truly 
democratic poland could benefit from ties with other democracies in 
europe 
at the end of the solidarity program an unidentified commentator 
said you just watched an interview with zbigniew brzezinski 
we believe people who think in a proper way will assess 
properly this interference in the polish election campaign 
polands communist authorities accuse the united states of 
improperly helping solidarity 
the solidarity show included tapes of french singer yves montand 
and american singer stevie wonder both of whom visited poland in 
the past week 
a major segment was a sketch by polish comedian jacek fedorowicz 
on how to choose solidarity candidates in the complicated voting 
procedure for the sejm or parliament and new senate 
fedorowicz is shown at a polling station equipped with glasses 
to read the ballot and pens to show viewers how to mark it for 
solidarity candidates 
candidates will not be identified by party affiliation on the 
ballot and the voter must remember the name of the person he wants 
to support 
to vote for a candidate the voter must cross out the names of 
the other candidates 
the commentator accused fedorowicz of advising voters to cross 
out candidates on the 34member national list on which top 
communist party and government officials are running unopposed 
fedorowiczs call to cross out all candidates from the 
national list is a gesture against the agreement the commenator 
said it rejects people who created and signed the agreement and 
it breaks the rules so it is better not to mix up a cabaret with 
political instructions 
an april 5 agreement between solidarity and the government 
established procedures for polands first democratic elections 
since world war ii and allowed solidarity access to state 
television and radio 
tuesdays broadcast was the third solidarityproduced show 
authorities blocked an election show dealing with human rights that 
was to have been shown may 23 they said it violated the april 
agreement

willie b the atlanta zoos 30yearold 
silverback lowland gorilla went on his first date tuesday and got 
slapped for his trouble 
the male gorilla who has been isolated from his own kind for 28 
years was introduced to a pair of female gorillas tuesday morning 
in a room specially designed for the assignation 
neither willie b nor the two females 6yearold kinyani and 
26yearold katoomba showed any shyness said zoo atlanta 
director terry maple both females are from emory universitys 
yerkes regional primate research center 
it couldnt be going any better maple said so far 
willie has proved to be very normal in the behaviors he has shown 
during the socialization process 
the idea behind the meeting wasnt to get the gorillas to mate 
its much too early for that 
we wouldnt have expected that said zoo spokeswoman erika 
archibald he has no experience in that 
this is just a period of socialization for willie b she 
said we hope that mating might happen eventually 
a 37by20foot room was prepared for the female gorillas it 
was filled with straw bamboo and other items such as a large rope 
and a tire 
kinyani and katoomba were allowed to decide whether to join 
willie b in the room by using an overhead door large enough for 
them but too small for him they waltzed right in maple said 
there are two other doors just big enough for kinyani and 
katoomba to escape if need be and maple said both used the doors 
several times but always returned to the room 
then came a magic moment willie b made contact with a female 
gorilla 
actually katoomba gave willie b a little slap and acted a bit 
aggressively said kenneth gould chief of reproductive biology at 
yerkes 
this may be her social experience showing through gould 
said shes been through introductions before and has a history 
of being able to look after herself

domestic partnership law they also urged the mayor to consider 
extending health benefits to the partners of city employees 
a few other cities have adopted policies extending health 
benefits to livein lovers of municipal employees but san

premier turgut ozal said tuesday he would 
be willing to negotiate an immigration agreement with bulgaria to 
allow the repatriation of ethnic turks according to the anatolia 
news agency 
our borders are always open ozal said responding to a call 
monday from bulgarian president todor zhivkov for turkey to open 
its borders to all bulgarian moslems 
zhivkov was reacting to growing unrest among ethnic turks who 
have violently resisted an assimilation campaign in bulgaria since 
the campaign began in 1984 100 ethnic turks have died in clashes 
with bulgarian security forces and thousands have been imprisoned 
ozal said bulgaria had rejected previous suggestions that the 
countries negotiate an immigration agreement most recently in 
1988 he said he believed the announcement from sophia might be 
timed to influence discussion of the issue at a 35nation helsinki 
human rights conference that opened tuesday in paris 
if they have now changed their minds i propose we immediately 
sit at a table and work out an immigration agreement of extensive 
scope said ozal 
but he said any agreement must protect the rights of ethnic 
turks 
they are sending our ethnic brothers out with only one 
suitcase what happened to their lands their other goods ozal 
said 
although turkish officials have said they are ready to accept 
the entire minority population in bulgaria if necessary privately 
they are worried about the influx of such a large group without any 
possessions funds or jobs 
bulgaria took the offensive at the paris conference by blaming 
turkey for recent violence involving bulgarias ethnic turks 
the conference is to review human rights progress among 
signatories of the 1975 helsinki final act 
it also is expected to single out nations accused of specific 
abuses and romania and bulgaria are expected to take the brunt of 
criticism 
in an early speech foreign minister petar mladenov of bulgaria 
accused foreign circles of being behind recent disturbances in 
his country in which ethnic turks reportedly have been killed 
the ethnic turkish minority in bulgaria is estimated at 900000 
but ozal said he believes the figure is as high as 25 million 
unrest among ethnic turks has grown recently last week the 
bulgarian news agency said security forces killed three ethnic 
turks protesting the assimilation campaign but deported ethnic 
turks said upon arriving in ankara the death toll was at least 30 
in the clash 
the bulgarian government has resorted to mass deportations of 
the minority group to quell mounting resistence to the assimilation 
campaign which changes the moslem names of ethnic turks to slavic 
ones forbids use of the turkish language and prohibits islamic 
worship 
an estimated 380000 turks have been repatriated to turkey since 
1925 through defection or programs to reunite split families

a police chief said tuesday he ordered 
a stadium gate to be opened to prevent soccer fans outside from 
being crushed but minutes later in the surge of the crowd 95 
people were killed 
superintendent roger marshall told an investigating panel he was 
told by a senior officer that lives were in danger because of the 
mass of people pressing against a gate at the hillsborough stadium 
before a cup game between liverpool and nottingham forest on april 
15 
there was no real alternative because there was nowhere for 
these people to go marshall said there was no escape route in 
any way shape or form other than into the stadium 
as the fans rushed through the open gate they piled into the 
crowds in the standing areas in the early minutes of the game 
antiriot fences barred the victims of the crush from escaping 
onto the field of the stadium in sheffield 150 miles north of 
london 
marshall said when he heard of the casualties i felt this 
entire tragedy was my responsibility 
half an hour before the 3 pm kickoff there was a carnival 
atmosphere outside the stadium but then as the crowd grew and 
became impatient the situation deteriorated by the minute in a 
big way and the turnstiles had to be closed he said 
marshall said that 15 minues later when he asked the police 
control unit for permission to open the gate the situation in 
front of the turnstiles was becoming completely and utterly 
untenable 
people were crying out and fighting each other mounted 
officers were working valiantly but to no avail they were totally 
surrounded by people 
i have never come across anything like it in my life and as 
time went on we lost our ability to manage that situation he 
added the late arrival of fans laced by drink and individuals 
who had not got tickets and had an absolute determination to get 
into that football soccer ground come what may were present that 
afternoon 
he said that in opening the gate i have to say it never 
crossed my mind what the consequences would be

chinas leaders intensified efforts to intimidate 
the student movement wednesday but delayed a meeting to purge 
government moderates because top officials are locked in a power 
struggle sparked by the protests sources said 
a military source said the 200000 troops surrounding beijing 
have been told to prepare for winter meaning hardliners are 
anticipating a long battle with moderates more sympathetic to the 
demonstrations for reform 
more than a dozen military motorcyles with sidecars and followed 
by jeeps raced down the main streets of beijing on wednesday the 
latest warning that government tolerance for the protests was 
nearing an end 
staterun radio beijing on wednesday played up divisions in the 
student movement it interviewed li lu a beijing student leader 
who accused nonbeijing students of powergrabbing li said 
beijing students began the protests and students from the provinces 
should play a secondary role 
on tuesday workers and students chanted down with police 
thuggery outside police headquarters to protest the arrest of 
labor leaders sympathetic to their movement for greater freedom and 
an end to official corruption 
the beijing daily said that 11 members of motorcycle clubs that 
participated in the demonstrations also were jailed 
students continued their occupation of tiananmen square 
triumphantly unveiling a 33foothigh sculpture inspired by the 
statue of liberty in the center of the vast plaza 
thousands cheered as the goddess of democracy a woman 
holding a torch high above her head was christened the statue 
faced the portrait of communist chinas founder mao tsetung 
a core of about 10000 students have maintained a 
roundtheclock protest in the square but the numbers swelled into 
the tens of thousands for the statues unveiling 
the official xinhua news agency called the statue an insult to 
the national dignity and image and said it should be taken down 
by thursday 
indications appeared that the power struggle between hardliners 
who oppose political reform and moderates who back some democratic 
change had reached an impasse 
diplomatic and chinese sources said a meeting of the central 
committee of the ruling communist party scheduled to begin in 
about 10 days has been postponed because the leadership is too 
divided 
the meeting was called to ratify a purge of communist party 
chief zhao ziyang who last week reportedly was stripped of power 
the central committee must approve leadership changes 
they said the conservative faction represented by conservative 
premier li peng had yet to gain the necessary support in the 
central committee to oust zhao and others sympathetic to the 
students 
sources said they believed that opposition to the purge was 
temporary and that senior leader deng xiaoping who is 
masterminding the struggle would make zhao step down 
in another indication zhao is in danger the nightly news did 
not include his name when mentioning a series of important speeches 
being studied by highranking party members 
the other five politburo members named were mentioned except 
for hu qili a zhao ally and who also is reported under house 
arrest 
the hardline faction gained another supporter when the communist 
party committee of the national peoples congress chinas 
legislature issued a statement backing martial law in beijing 
li declared martial law may 20 but troops have been unable 
unwilling or ordered not to move against the protesters who on 
occasion have numbered 1 million 
at the beijing police headquarters about 1000 students and 
workers staged a sixhour sitin demanding information about the 
three union leaders who disappeared monday 
the beijing independent workers union was formed may 19 in 
defiance of a government ban on all but the official all china 
federation of trade unions the union with a claimed membership of 
about 3000 has been active in getting beijing citizens to 
participate in the movement 
union head zhao pinglu said one of its leaders shen yinhan a 
27yearold official with the national airlines was grabbed by 
police monday in front of the beijing hotel 
two other union leaders both employees of the ministry of 
railways also were arrested he said 
li zhihuang wife of railway employee qian yiming said her 
husbands work unit claimed he was arrested by police to find out 
about the situation at tiananmen square 
a third man bai dongping 26 was supposed to take his wife to 
the hospital on monday but didnt show up said his father bai 
baofa the governments actions are vicious he said 
the official media continued its shrill campaign against the 
students participating in the 18day occupation of the square 
the peoples daily published a letter from seven intellectuals 
recalling the tragic leftist purges of the 196676 cultural 
revolution warn your sons and loved ones not to allow a repeat 
of this tragedy of history it said 
military sources said all military personnel have been 
threatened with court martial if they joined or expressed sympathy 
with the movement

central american countries need at least 
350 million to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in the 
wartattered region according to a threeyear plan released 
tuesday at an international conference 
delegates from 56 nations and 36 representatives of 
international organizations are attending the unsponsored 
conference on central american refugees that opened monday and ends 
wednesday 
mexico belize el salvador guatemala honduras nicaragua and 
costa rica submitted the threeyear plan to be considered details 
were not released 
hundreds of thousands of refugees and displaced people most of 
them women and children have been innocent victims of conflicts 
the roots of which lie in the unjust socioeconomic structures in 
the region said un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
in opening the conference 
guatemala president vinicio cerezo told a news conference his 
government has been able to help guatemalan refugees who return 
voluntarily in small numbers but is not prepared for a repatriation 
of thousands 
he said at least 43000 guatemalan refugees are living in mexico 
while some 200000 refugees most of them from nicaragua and el 
salvador are living in guatemala 
their massive return could be grave because we do not have the 
physical and economic capacity to solve their problems he said 
of the guatemalan refugees 
cerezo said democray in guatemala would be complete when the 
guatemalan refugees have been able to return and live in their 
nation enjoying liberty 
guatemala returned to elected civilian rule three years ago 
after years of military control cerezos government has survived 
two coup attempts 
according to the united nations 146000 registered refugees are 
in central america and mexico and 893000 central americans are 
living illegally throughout the region about 872000 people have 
been displaced inside their countries the un figures show 61500 
refugees have been repatriated 
representatives of several groups helping refugees held their 
news conference tuesday and complained that their groups had not 
been invited to the conference 
rolalinda tuyc president of the commission of those displaced 
by violence said her organization had asked guatemala to allow it 
to participate but was told the united nations had made up the 
guest list 
oswaldo enriquez a member of the guatemalan human rights 
commission in mexico said we reject the manipulation by the 
government over the problem of refugees and people displaced by 
violence 
he said the guatemalan government has not improved conditions 
sufficiently to encourage the guatemalan refugees living in mexican 
camps to return home 
a delegation of miskito indians from nicaragua made public a 
letter they said had been sent to the un office of high 
commissioner for refugees asking that the indians be reclassified 
as refugees 
it said that during the past few years the un agency had 
helped nicaraguan indians classified as refugees return to their 
homeland from camps in honduras 
the letter said there persists a climate of repression against 
us in nicarauga and this and other circumstances motivated the 
return to honduras of the great majority of those who had been 
repatriated

federally mandated rules for doling out kidneys 
discriminate against blacks who receive proportionally fewer 
organs than whites even though they are four times as likely to 
suffer kidney failure some experts say 
i dont consider it a national tragedy i consider it 
ignorance as we become more enlightened then we expect the 
system to be more fair said howard universitys dr clive o 
callender one of the nations few black transplant surgeons 
the 1yearold rules adopted by the united network for organ 
sharing which administers the national transplant network 
emphasize tissuematching between kidney donors and recipients 
callender and some others contend the rules put blacks at a 
disadvantage because a fifth of them have tissuematching problems 
that make them wait longer for kidneys most of which are donated

newspaper advertisements and computers 
are replacing traditional matchmakers among the literate classes in 
india where brides and grooms rarely choose their own spouses 
every sunday the newspapers are filled with classified ads 
inviting inquiries about smart welleducated professional 
boys and really beautiful homely university graduate girls 
homely in indian matrimonial ad english means someone who 
would make a good wife mother and housekeeper 
it did not seem odd to saswati a 28yearold executive in a 
multinational firm that her parents inserted a classified ad to 
find her a husband 
they asked if i had someone in mind i wanted to marry 
saswati said insisting that her last name not be used when i 
said no they proposed an advertisement in the newspaper frankly 
i had no objections it gave me a wider choice 
there was a special caste of matchmakers in earlier times 
called ghataks said arati srimal a social scientist they 
were welcomed respected and given pride of place wherever they 
visited because every household had someone eligible for 
matrimony 
annu kurien a sociologist who found her husband through the 
matrimonial columns said the image of the matchmaker is so 
deeply ingrained in the minds of even modern urban indian youth 
that when newspapers replaced the ghatak as matchmaker they 
assumed a popularity the ghatak could not aspire for 
the phenomenon is not confined to indians in the country 
sanjit a 34yearold engineer who recently visited new delhi 
has lived in the united states since he was 12 
his family received 103 responses when they inserted this ad in 
the times of india alliance invited for smart bengali hindu 
engineer 34 185 cms 6 feet settled in the united states music 
addict no encumbrances 
sanjits family narrowed the list to seven and started 
negotiations writing or calling families of the women 
sanjit who also didnt want his last name used said he hopes 
his family will find the right woman so he can get married when he 
returns to india in six months 
parents of indians abroad seek indian spouses for their 
children in a bid to retain traditional values and roots said 
op sharma chief of advertisements at the hindustan times a 
conservative englishlanguage newspaper famed for carrying the most 
matrimonial columns 
the hindustan times was the first newspaper in north india to 
begin carrying matrimonials in the early 1970s sharma said we 
now run over 4500 such advertisements a month and the number is 
increasing very few advertisements are repeated an indication 
that the success rate is high 
the hindustan times charges six rupees 37 cents a word for 
matrimonials and gets 48 percent of its classified advertising 
revenue from them sharma said 
monthly this means an income of approximately 12 million 
rupees 80000 sharma said 
the hindustan times also runs a computerized matchmaking service 
called life partners which is offered free to advertisers 
names rarely appear in the ads and most advertisers receive 
their answers in special mail boxes at the newspapers 
an advertising executive at the times of india which runs about 
2000 matrimonials a month said the number of responses varies 
from one to hundreds 
nonresident indians and green card us work permit holders 
attract a greater number of people said narayani mantoo 
the phenomenon of matrimonial advertisements is predominantly 
urban she added more than 95 percent of our clients come from 
cities 
cities have the highest concentrations of newspaper readers in a 
country where about 43 percent of the 880 million people are 
literate most of the ads are placed by hindus who account for 80 
percent of the population but sikhs christians and moslems use 
them as well 
a social scientist interpreted the phenomenon of matrimonial 
advertisements as a sign that urban indian society was in 
transition but unable to cast off deeply ingrained cultural customs 
the disintegration in the traditional joint family framework 
brought around perforce a more impersonal unitary concept of 
family said manisha bahl at the center for womens development 
studies 
personal contacts have been replaced by the impersonal 
advertisement in a newspaper or agency to bring about the desired 
union she said

organized labor is finding itself in a 
struggle because of policies laid out by president carlos salinas 
de gortari to reverse mexicos 7yearold economic crisis 
since taking office dec 1 salinas has insisted on economic 
austerity and uprooted veteran union bosses synonymous with 
corruption 
with the measures that have been taken the leaders are 
cautious said francisco zapata a labor specialist at the 
colegio de mexico a graduate school 
the same thing can happen to them that happened to the oil 
workers 
he was referring to salinas going after oil workers union leader 
joaquin hernandez galicia in january hernandez galicia along with 
45 of his associates and union officials wound up in jail on 
weapons and other charges 
more leaders have toppled in salinas campaign against the 
corruption that impedes economic modernization the most recent was 
carlos jonguitud who had run the national education workers union 
for 17 years but who unlike hernandez galicia had not opposed 
salinas 
jonguituds ouster met only one of the demands of thousands of 
striking teachers nearly a month into the strike which virtually 
shut down the nations public school system the government 
grudgingly offered a 25 percent wage and benefits hike 
the teachers victory seemed to indicate that mexicos workers 
whose paychecks are worth half what they were at the start of the 
economic crisis were starting to awaken and learn to fight for 
themselves 
but when mexico city bus workers tried the same tactic and 
struck for a 50 percent wage increase the government swiftly fired 
all 23000 of them and canceled their union contract salinas made 
it clear he wouldnt permit union pay demands to interfere with his 
plans to check inflation and streamline the economy those plans 
include revamping the moneylosing city bus system 
but salinas faces a delicate situation in trying to retain the 
governments longtime control over labor while modernizing the 
economy 
the symbiotic relationship between union leaders and the 
government monopolized by the institutional revolutionary party 
or pri has buttressed mexicos political system and kept the party 
in power since 1929 
partyaligned union leaders churn out the vote for pri 
candidates and keep workers in line with timely raises and generous 
fringe benefits that include housing recreational facilities and 
discount stores the benefits place priaffiliated unionists a cut 
above independent workers 
that system functioned over more than four decades of steady 
economic growth but as mexicos debt crisis continues and the 
economy remains stagnant salinas has been forced to keep raises to 
a minimum to control inflation 
federal funds for such benefits as health and other government 
services have dried up while public investment in a job market 
that must accept 1 million new workers each year has virtually 
disappeared 
the pri suffered the consequences during the presidential 
elections last july workers didnt turn out the vote in the 
traditional massive numbers and salinas won with just over 50 
percent the lowest ever for a pri presidential candidate numerous 
priaffiliated union candidates lost congressional and other races 
the teachers strike possibly the most serious conflict salinas 
has faced since he took office forced the government to break its 
austerity restraints and increase its wage and benefit offer from 
10 percent to 25 percent 
the government also strongarmed the union hierarchy into 
firstever negotiations with dissidents over control of union 
locals where dissidents are a majority or are strong 
the government sought to justify its higher wage offer by saying 
that teachers salaries had fallen behind inflation but it said 
similar raises would not be extended to other unions 
the onetime concession may work to salinas advantage by 
showing flexibility he provided a means of bringing the estimated 
500000 dissident teachers back into the pri fold 
the mexico city bus workers union which is independent 
managed to obtain a court order permitting fired workers to keep 
their jobs at least temporarily and got the bus system running 
again 
but the government intends to pursue its plan to split up the 
public bus company into cooperatives with workers participating if 
they want to

a multimillion dollar plan to sell souvenir 
parcels of land near the chateau where the marquis de lafayette was 
born and left behind to fight in the american revolution has 
infuriated a group seeking to preserve his name 
its nothing short of a land scam destined to fool people 
into thinking theyre buying a piece of history and they are 
not said christian malagies secretary of the memorial 
lafayette the foundation that owns lafayettes birthplace and 
operates as a nonprofit organization promoting frenchamerican 
friendship 
the venture was launched earlier this year by a private company 
with a name similar to the foundations limmemorial lafayette 
one of thousands of commercial operations here capitalizing on the 
200th anniversary of the french revolution it is one of the most 
controversial 
the name itself could mislead potential customers who might 
think they were contributing to the foundation malagies said in 
a telephone interview 
limmemorial lafayatte is the brainchild of caroline 
damphernet a 29yearold marketing consultant who decided to turn 
a 20yearold dinner party conversation into a moneymaking concern 
the idea comes from a wellknown anecdote about cutting up te 
marquis de lafayettes embroidered handkerchief and selling the 
pieces the story circulated in paris for years ms damphernet 
said in a telephone interview after doing a market study in the 
united states on lafayette we decided to do something about it 
she said the survey indicated that one in 10 americans knew who 
lafayette was the general and statesman who fought alongside 
american revolutionary forces against the british 
about 50 percent of the people polled had heard of him but 
many thought he was a notorious pirate she said 
marquis gilbert du mortier de lafayette 17571834 was born in 
chateau chavaniac lafayette and spent his youth there he left for 
the united states at 20 served with american forces at brandywine 
and yorktown and became a close friend of george washingtons 
in january the company bought up 25 acres of untilled farmland 
near the chateau ms damphernet said she told the farmers why she 
wanted the land and why she was ready to pay 900 an acre more 
than three times its normal price 
since then other farmers have expressed interest in selling 
additional land in the village she said 
there is certainly no way we can prove that the land once 
belonged to lafayette since the regional archives were burned in 
1860 ms damphernet said but the history books all agree 
that the entire village of chavaniac lafayette was part of the 
domaine that had belonged to the lafayette family since medieval 
times 
limmemorial lafayette plans to divide up the land into pieces 
roughly a foot square each piece will sell for 100 for a total 
of 167 million 
malagies calls the venture too juicy to be honest 
the whole operation is completely immoral malagies said 
first there is no evidence to support their claim that the land 
belonged to lafayette the land is not contiguous to the chateau 
but is farther away in the village itself 
secondly its using the bicentennial of the french revolution 
to take advantage of people who are gullible because theyre far 
away and have never laid eyes on chateau chavaniac lafayette 
ms damphernet said she has already sold a few pieces in france 
but expects to sell the majority to americans and japanese she 
plans to contact american cities named for lafayette along with 
historical societies connected to both the american and french 
revolutions 
each purchase will be accompanied by a handpainted deed a 
oneofakind diplomasized certificate edged in blue white and 
red decorated with a seal in the form of lafayettes profile and 
bearing the number of the lot and the owners name 
itll will be decorative the ultimate bicentennial souvenir 
for history buffs and francophiles ms damphernet said

john sayles the staunchly independent 
filmmaker would not seem the most likely guy to jump into the 
network series grind 
its part of my program he said ive told myself id do 
anything once 
shannons deal isnt on nbcs fall schedule but the 
twohour pilot airs sunday besides sayles it boasts such 
behindthecamera talent as jewel of the nile director lewis 
teague who also directed sayles early feature effort 
alligator a cultfavorite horror film fame producer stan 
rogow and composer wynton marsalis who wrote the score 
sayles who has avoided big movie studious throughout a film 
career that includes the return of the secaucus seven 
brother from another planet and most recently eight men 
out got involved with the nbc project after rogow asked if hed 
be interested in writing a tv movie that could become a series 
i said i would if it was something i would be interested in 
and maybe write one or two episodes and tell whoever was taking it 
over so long kind of establish the character and see if they 
could run with it sayles said as the sound of a jet airplane 
almost drowned him out he talked from a pay phone at jfk 
international airport just before boarding a flight to italy where 
he was to appear in a friends first feature film 
sayles was no stranger to television having written the tv 
movies perfect match and unnatural causes i actually had 
a pretty good experience on both of them he said 
he came up with several series premises and nbc entertainment 
president brandon tartikoff picked shannons deal it is from 
nbcs own production company so i felt like it wouldnt die of 
neglect because its one of his babies sayles said and it 
was a nice experience everybody seemed to be talking about the 
same thing 
indeed in an apparent effort to keep talent like sayles coming 
back even if he doesnt get on the schedule nbc is giving the 
pilot redcarpet sunday movie treatment 
in shannons deal set in philadelphia jamey sheridan plays 
jack shannon a former corporate lawyer whose gambling addiction 
cost him his family and career as the movie opens hes trying to 
start over as a generalpractice anythingthatcomesinthedoor 
attorney 
the first case in the door is lucy acosta elizabeth pena who 
says her boyfriend was framed and she needs a lawyer the place 
is lousy with lawyers they ought to spray more often says 
shannon whos sitting on a crate playing poker with himself 
shannon agrees to represent lucys boyfriend if shell work as his 
secretary 
shannons second case another young woman looking to spring 
her boyfriend from jail lands him in the middle of a

by martin ferrero who was informant izzy moreno on miami vice 
gondolph says he knows where shannon is coming from the urge to 
hang out your own shingle be a lone wolf in the treacherous forest 
of jurisprudence i understand completely life is not printed on 
dollar bills we are the backbone of the profession i salute you 
counselor 
sayles said he was interested in the guys who do the nuts and 
bolts of law the guys who cut backroom deals rather than 
grandstand in a courtroom i would be happy if they make it into 
a series if he never went to court 
sayles made shannon a former poker sharp so he could use the 
skills of bluffing and holding in his dealings with prosecutors 
other attorneys and witnesses he also liked the idea of having him 
confronted daily with the life he gave up 
i was interested in the idea of somebody who is kind of 
discovering his value halfway through his life a guy in his 40s 
whos done the gonnamakealottamoney thing and its failed for 
him on a lot of levels hes starting from scratch economically 
and emotionally 
ive met people who are recovering alcoholics drug addicts or 
gambleholics they have this vulnerable feeling but at the same 
time they can be incredibly tough

in the decades that israelis were kept busy 
building and defending their nation they had little time for the 
environment the result is the holy land today is not blessed with 
clean air and water 
the jordan river where jesus was baptized today is a muddy 
stream devoid of natural life and sewage is seeping into the 
biblical sea of galilee 
in this modern port city residents are sometimes trapped 
indoors by foulsmelling clouds of sulfur dioxide spewed from 
refineries and other industrial plants 
though some types of pollution are near catastrophic 
proportions most israelis remain apathetic reports of mass fish 
poisonings meet with indifference and israelis litter their 
streets and beaches with soda cans empty cigarette packs and 
plastic bags 
the attitude of most people is that the main purpose is to 
build the country and defend it said uri merinov head of the 
environmental protection service 
the environment is not a political issue in israel there is 
no real public movement that demands environmental protection like 
in the united states or europe 
israel does not have such severe problems as acid rain and ocean 
dumping that have awakened environmental consciousness elsewhere in 
the world 
it was not until this past december that the government formed 
an environment ministry to gather under one roof enforcement powers 
that had been scattered in 10 different ministries 
environment minister roni milo is still fighting with the 
agriculture and health ministers over their refusals to surrender 
authority 
in the meantime polluters continue to dump toxic wastes and 
send dangerous fumes into the air 
one of the worst hit areas is haifa bay site of more than 2000 
industrial plants including a power plant and oil refineries that 
spew sulfur dioxide a colorless gas blamed for a host of health 
problems including respiratory troubles 
our old people are suffering from headaches and 
breathlessness said erika frasch head nurse at the iben ezer 
nursing home which has 30 patients and is about two miles from 
haifas industrial area myself i feel like im poisoned 
theres smoke all over the city 
on april 30 the sulfur dioxide content in air increased after a 
refinery filter broke down with a dirty gray cloud hovering over 
the city the elderly and those suffering from respiratory or heart 
problems were told to stay indoors schools canceled outdoor gym 
classes 
the accident dramatized haifas air problems caused by spotty 
compliance with already lax emission standards 
in april we measured violations on 10 days said zvi fuhrer 
of the haifa town association for environmental protection 
he noted that the heavy fuel used in israels power plants and 
refineries contains 32 percent sulfur in contrast to a maximum of 
05 percent permitted in los angeles and 03 percent in new york 
the environment ministry wants tougher standards but the energy 
ministry which runs the power plant and the refineries argues 
that using lowsulfur oil and installing scrubbers would make the 
plants unprofitable 
while air pollution is a problem mainly in the industrialized 
coastal strip deteriorating water quality affects nearly all 42 
million israelis 
water pollution has been causing dysentery outbreaks in haifa 
and the western galilee since 1985 in hot weather health 
authorities frequently urge israelis to boil drinking water 
in the sea of galilee which provides about 40 percent of 
israels drinking water there has been a gradual but continuous 
deterioration in the quality of the water state comptroller 
miriam ben porat wrote in her 1989 report 
she noted that in israel water is not filtered and carries 
sediments that are a fertile breeding ground for germs 
a major pollutant is sewage that overflows or is pumped backed 
into the water system before it has been treated sufficiently said 
avner adin head of the department of environmental sciences at the 
hebrew university of jerusalem 
there are no specific regulations on what sewage quality 
should be before it goes into a stream or river he said 
one of the rivers affected is the jordan 
adin describing its condition as not good said both israel 
and jordan have diverted water for irrigation lowering the rivers 
level and raising the salt concentration sewage and other 
contaminants also seep into the river in the north he said 
merinov blamed israels environmental problems mainly on 
unchecked industrial development 
but he said public indifference left over from the ghettos of 
europe and north africa where people had no control over the 
environment outside their own homes was responsible too 
one of our major efforts is to change this attitude but its 
going to be quite difficult merinov said

for more than 20 years detroit real estate broker raymond 
jenkins has been telling anyone who would listen that the united 
states government owes black americans a debt for centuries of 
forced labor by their ancestors 
for most of that time jenkins says nobody took him very 
seriously they thought it was a joke they said the government 
will not give the black people of this country anything 
but ever since congress approved 12 billion in reparations to 
japaneseamericans for their treatment during world war ii people 
have been listening to jenkins more and laughing at him less 
its too early to call it a movement but the notion of making 
reparations to the descendants of slaves is beginning to catch on 
among some prominent black americans 
in april delegates to the africanamerican summit in new 
orleans included a call for reparations in their preliminary agenda 
of africanamerican priorities 
earlier this year the detroit city council passed a resolution 
calling on congress to set aside 40 billion in reparations to 
create an educational fund in massachusetts a state senator 
introduced a bill to create a state commission to study the idea 
and sometime in midjune us rep john conyers dmich plans 
to introduce a bill in congress that would call for the creation of 
a federal commission similar to the one proposed in massachusetts 
this question is beginning to come up again and again said 
james williams a spokesman for the national association for the 
advancement of colored people which hasnt taken a position on 
reparations 
the idea probably goes back to the time of emancipation 
margaret washington creed a history professor at cornell 
university said union gen william tecumseh sherman allowed freed 
slaves to buy 40acre plots of land that were abandoned by southern 
planters during his devastating march through georgia in most 
cases whites eventually reclaimed the land 
shermans plan led to proposals to give all freed slaves the 
opportunity to buy 40 acres of land and a mule ms creed said the 
proposals were never enacted but 40 acres and a mule became a 
rallying cry for freed slaves and their descendants 
it is almost folklore in black communities across the 
country said state sen william owens the author of the 
reparations bill in massachusetts owens said he recalls hearing 
the phrase constantly as a child in alabama 
the nation of islam also known as the black muslims began 
calling on the us government in the 1930s to set aside land for 
black americans and the notion of land or money for the 
descendants of slaves was heard again during the black power 
movement in the 1960s 
however according to ms creed no proposal for black 
reparations has ever advanced to the floor of congress 
the latest demands were prompted by last years passage of the 
japaneseamerican reparations act which allotted 20000 each to 
japaneseamericans who were sent to internment camps during world 
war ii 
thats when within the minority community people started 
saying hey what about us and slavery said john matlock 
conyers district staff director 
ed matovcik a spokesman for rep robert matsui dcalif 
cautioned that the japaneseamerican case is unique because it is 
directly paying those who were wronged 
thats where this is a different issue he said youre 
getting into a whole new ballgame when you start talking about 
descendants 
proponents of black reparations respond that the damage done by 
slavery is felt by black americans to this day and that many 
blacks who are alive today were subjected to legally sanctioned 
discrimination 
however advocates of reparations also acknowledge that it would 
be virtually impossible to distribute payments to every descendant 
of a slave in the united states there are approximately 30 million 
black americans most of whom are descendants of slaves 
because youre dealing with something that occurred over 100 
years ago you run into problems in determining whos eligible and 
whos not matlock said 
consequently the favored alternative would be to establish 
funds to pay for education housing or medical care 
my idea of reparations said william strickland an 
instructor of political science in the afroamerican studies 
program at the university of massachusetts is that americas 
resources need to be put into our cities not as any racial 
favor but as part of a fundamental strategy to save this country 
how much money would be involved jenkins has called for 40 
billion as a start although he insisted that its far from 
adequate compensation for 246 years of unpaid labor by millions of 
people 
if conyers bill is introduced and passed by congress that 
would be one of the questions left to the federal commission that 
the measure would establish according to matlock 
its not hard to find people who are skeptical about the 
prospects for black reparations derrick bell a professor at 
harvard law school said such payments would be just as valid as 
the japaneseamerican reparations but probably could never be 
approved 
still just the growing talk about reparations has been 
satisfying for raymond jenkins who believes more than ever that 
his goal is possible 
its catching on its been kind of a lonely fight and i 
sometimes wondered why i put all my time into it but now i 
seem to be getting a little results from it 
jenkins who puts his age at over 60 said his grandfather 
will mobley was born into slavery 
i cant understand since our foreparents were in slavery from 
1619 to 1865 why they didnt even get an apology from our 
government he said i just think we havent been compensated 
i dont think its another handout i think the government owes 
us a debt

editors note with americas streets growing meaner all the 
time more and more women are taking up arms buying handguns and 
learning to use them gun manufacturers noting the trend have 
come out with special weapons for women and even a little pistol 
for joggers that fires right through its walletholster 
</TEXT>

terry weber a softspoken sharpshooter in 
this midwestern city sometimes answers the door with a gun on her 
hip on the firing range she practices her marksmanship against 
reallife assailants with wax bullets 
in new york city where a woman jogger was attacked and raped by 
a roving gang in central park thalia adams 32 practices 
regularly at a pistol range she has twice been the victim of armed 
robbery since she moved to manhattan from palo alto calif 
marie mann an insurance executive in cincinnati has a 
380caliber bersea she practices with it in her back yard but 
would she use it to shoot an intruder or an attacker shes not 
sure 
but when a woman takes to shooting its usually for reasons of 
selfdefense not sport 
no one knows how many women carry handguns on the streets in the 
united states by some estimates however as many as 12 million 
one out of eight have handguns in their homes 
there are no reliable statistics neither the justice department 
nor the treasurys department for alcohol and firearms keeps 
records of women who are licensed to carry or own firearms or who 
run afoul of the law by their use 
but firing ranges around the country report a significant 
increase in the number of female members in the past four years 
for instance lt john benner who started the tactical training 
center in cincinnati says women once comprised only about 15 
percent to 20 percent of his beginning classes now they amount to 
about 50 percent 
sharon sullivan a cincinnati attorney can knock a clay pigeon 
out of the sky on the skeet range at the moonlight gun and hunt 
club but she doesnt carry her handgun on the street and wonders 
about the wisdom of using it in selfdefense nevertheless shes 
convinced police are no longer sufficient protection 
indeed police all over the country have told citizens that they 
have an obligation to maintain order and enforce the laws but they 
cannot defend every citizens life or safety every minute of every 
day citizens must take some responsibility and indeed the courts 
have upheld them 
some women have taken the warning seriously they are out there 
hefting their 44caliber magnums from the west side rifle and 
pistol range in new york city to the beverly hills gun club in 
california some even graduate for sport to ak47s and other 
automatic weapons 
noting the trend smith and wesson has brought out the lady 
smith a version of its popular 38caliber scaled down to fit a 
womans hand another firm charter arms is offering a hisandher 
pair of 38s called the bonnie parker and the clyde barrow the 
bonnie being scaled down in grip and trigger action 
there are all kinds of new products for the wouldbe guntoter 
including a a little gun for joggers it fires right through its 
walletholster 
polls by womens magazines have shown that women are often the 
secret victims of crime and have bought guns for security a 
ladies home journal poll in 1987 found that 40 percent of 104000 
women queried kept guns at home strictly for protection and 42 
percent said they had been victims of crime 
paxton quigley in her new book armed amp female a 
comprehensive look at women and guns the law and selfdefense 
says chances of being raped at any age in new york are one in 
eight los angeles one in seven atlanta one in five detroit 
one in four 
across our nation one out of every four families will be 
victims of serious crimes like burglary rape robbery or murder 
says quigley who estimates that 12 million women have guns in 
their homes a gallup poll finds that six out of 10 women in this 
country are afraid to walk in their own neighborhoods at night 
quigley a native of california was once an antigun activist 
then she says two things happened in a weeks time that changed 
my mind about 2 years ago a girlfriend of mine heard someone come 
in her bathroom window about 1 oclock in the morning she called 
911 and waited she didnt know what to do it happened very 
quickly and the damage was done the police came 10 minutes later 
the same week she read a story about a woman who thwarted an 
intruder with her own 38caliber special and held the cringing 
wouldbe attacker at gunpoint until the police arrived 
but shed stopped a crime from happening while my girlfriend 
was raped now 2 years later shes still not well so i decided it 
was time for me to get a gun 
other women coming to the same conclusion have another critical 
decision to make should they leave the gun at home or defy the 
law by carrying it 
gun activists are careful not to encourage women to carry guns 
if a woman or a man kills someone who is clearly menacing 
her life chances are they will get off by pleading selfdefense a 
woman especially because of the disparity of force between her 
and her attacker 
but no one can avoid the charge of illegal possession of a 
handgun and in most places could face a year in prison bernard 
goetz new yorks subway shooter is a case in point he was 
acquitted of shooting his young attackers but jailed for 
possession of the instrument of force

sullivan who practices law in cincinnati says heres the 
problem once youre close enough to use selfdefense youre 
better off submitting in a threatening situation with a gun 
what happens the attacker gets the gun first or you never get a 
good drop on him because there are so many variables its 
incredible or if it is a perfect deal and everything works right 
you dont have the justification to use the gun 
the only way i would go jogging in burnett park here would be 
with a gun and if i carried it in a holster the police would stop 
me or some guy will knock me in the head to get the gun 
terry weber who trains people in the use of handguns agrees 
its a catch22 do i do my time in prison or take a chance with 
my life 
sullivan appealed a case of a young man who was attacked on his 
way home through the park early one morning after his wife had 
given birth he killed his assailant and spent a year in prison for 
illegal possession of a handgun 
linda farmer who with her husband jd operates the hard times 
armory in atlanta ga says if women are going to be equal to 
men in this world then we are going to have to take on the 
responsibility for our own selfdefense whether we like it or not 
whether its something thats feminine or unfeminine whether you 
decide to carry a gun or not 
janet davis of kennesaw ga carries a gun in a special pocket 
in her purse there are a number of reasons her sister was raped 
she had a job in which she carried a lot of money the community in 
which she lives encouraged every citizen to own a gun in fact 
passed an ordinance requiring it the local police gave the 
national rifle associations fourhour course in the use of guns to 
anyone who asked 
janet a selfdescribed very religious woman went through 
all of the arguments for and against the use of lethal force her 
decision to carry a gun but to exercise caution in its use if 
you take it out youd better use it and if you use it youd 
better empty it 
originally from nebraska she and her husband live in the 
atlanta suburb that passed its gun ordinance in reaction to oak 
grove ill which passed an ordinance prohibiting the ownership of 
any guns she admits her relatives in nebraska might not understand 
her fondness for guns but they still live in nebraska and they 
dont need to like them 
chief dwain l wilson of the kennesaw police department says his 
officers trained about 500 women in the use of guns and the 
communitys small crime rate fell after the ordinance and has 
remained at a low level despite the rapid growth of the town 
but even women who have taken up shooting concede many women are 
against it they hate any kind of aggression or any kind of 
control or power says sharon sullivan they sort of turn up 
their little noses 
terry weber and paxton quigley think the training has to go 
beyond target practice terry takes courses at the tactical 
training center which she and her husband joe now own with lt 
benner of the fairfax ohio police department 
they are reallife situations with wax bullets 
people pop out at you and the student has to make in a split 
second shoot or dontshoot decisions 
they used me in a hostage situation somebody had me around 
the neck with a gun to my head what are you going to do joe came 
on the scene 
what did he do 
he shot both of us you cant believe the ability you lose 
when all these things start happening to you you can be a 
tremendous shot on paper but when those hands start shaking and 
the knees start knocking and the adrenalin starts pumping ive had 
people standing as close as 3 feet and miss me 
benner trains women to open their eyes to what is going on 
around them in a series of concentric circles 15feet 30feet 
and farther away 
both wilson and benner say women make better students than men 
so does longtime gun advocate and shooter linda farmer 
the woman has been taught that firing a gun is going to hurt 
she fears the recoil but what she is really afraid of is the 
noise farmer says 
so give her a pair of earmuffs she says shes a better 
shot than the man from the beginning they dont have this macho 
thing men have they can ask questions and nobody faults them for 
it 
the women who like guns for sport recognize the difficulty of 
carrying that over to selfdefense says sullivan 
my perception is that women are not very practical when it 
comes to their own safety theyll have a fetish about locking the 
doors but then theyll do all kinds of stupid things like going 
out in the middle of the night to get a pack of gum 
i think women will often say they are fearful for their lives 
but they are also fearful of guns and many will not overcome that 
fear to better protect themselves first of all the gun is 
mechanical and its black and dirty its not something that is 
appealing to the feminine personality i think if they had more 
pink guns 
terry weber says thats why women want a smallercaliber gun 
they only want to shoot him a little bit so they want a little gun 
thats pretty and that will only hurt a little it doesnt have 
stopping power yet thats what defensive shooting is all about 
suddenly her voice gets hard and she says stopping that 
person psychologically you have to prepare yourself to hurt 
somebody

editors note its as endemic to new orleans as the mardi gras 
bacchanal and the strip joints on bourbon street while the 
dixieland jazz funeral fell out of favor for a while the old 
funeral bands are now back on the march strutting their stuff with 
a syncopated sendoff for the departed 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the jazz funeral is making a comeback for 
1200 more or less the olympia brass band will wail you out to 
the graveyard slow and sad then cut you loose in ragtime and let 
the saints go marching in 
the more or less depends on the location of the cemetery 
in new orleans the overground vaults are just about full so 
we got to go by van to cemeteries out in the suburbs says harold 
dejan who for 30 years has mournfully swayed and strutted with the 
word leader stamped in gold on his black funeral cap but 
well go anywhere we just played a funeral in hattiesburg miss 
young girl called me and said her daddy so wanted to go that way a 
farmer up in minnesota has got us written into his will lots of 
folks have 
just turned 80 dejan is delighted at an upsurge in burial 
business from a younger generation that once scorned dixieland as 
uncle toms tomtom 
everything is lovely he drawls frequently funerals are 
picking up again sometimes we do two three a week black white 
pink purple it makes no difference we play for anyone who asks 
years ago i did three funerals in a day the lodges and 
benevolent societies all had burial policies some folks joined 
just sos theyd have a band at their funeral it came with a 50 
policy 
wed march out to the graveyard then parade the organization 
back for 150 or 2 the leader got an extra dollar now with the 
union id have to pay my men 40 or 50 for that same funeral and 
the leader gets double 
live business is even better besides playing weddings 
baptisms french quarter nightclubs steamboat cruises mardi gras 
parades and balls the old funeral bands are hard pressed to keep 
in step with the conventions coming to new orleans and the fad for 
jazz breakfasts and luncheons at hotels and restaurants 
the growth of the hospitality industry makes it tough to get a 
band together around here says talent agent harry mayronne who 
helps the olympia with outoftown bookings 
the band has made 28 european trips played for several heads of 
state and every president since lyndon johnson it has appeared in 
movies like the james bond film live and let die and donned 
white caps and gloves to welcome pope john paul ii at the new 
orleans airport 
jazz jazz the musicloving pontiff exclaimed as dejans 
alto sax wailed the counterpoint on lord lord you sure been 
good to me his theme song also he avows the story of my 
life 
dejans father the biggest drayman in new orleans gave 
him a clarinet for his 8th birthday but his love of music came 
from his mother who had heard jenny lind and adelina patti at the 
french opera house 
when his brother leo got a gold trumpet the doctor 
recommended it after taking out his tonsils dejan wanted a gold 
saxophone but daddy said that would cost twice as much so i 
started work at the japanese gardens out in milenberg the next week 
and paid for that sax in three months 
in his living room cluttered with trophies old band hats and 
faded snapshots memories of those dance pavilions and speakeasies 
out on lake pontchartrain glitter like the diamond in jelly roll 
mortons front tooth 
milneberg joys from a barrelhouse piano kid ory pumping up 
a trombone storm over those bootlegger boats bobbing at anchor big 
foot philips on drums papa celestins horn airborne on south 
rampart street parade 
dejan was 12 years old when he worked at the japanese gardens 
hey son buy you a drink 
whiskey id order and the boss would pour me some cola in a 
japanese teacup and put 50 cents aside only made 2 a night but 
the tips were great they hired me because most of them cats 
couldnt read music 
dejan was still in short pants and hid a tuxedo under the porch 
to sneak off after dark to the college inn in storyville those 
fabled 38 blocks set aside by alderman sidney story for sin and 
syncopation 
buy you a drink baby gals say sure then dump it into a tin 
can under the table at mahogany hall you took off your shoes 
didnt dare scratch up that beautiful floor 
dejans gaze rested on a yellowing photograph of trumpeter 
milton batiste his assistant leader with louis armstrong and king 
oliver i call them the three kings i remember the night louis 
left tom andersons annex on the corner to go with oliver in 
chicago 
later sidney bechet went off to join josephine bakers revue 
negre and became the toast of paris the sweet silver of his 
soprano sax echoed in classical fugues by jazz buff igor 
stravinsky bechets brother leonard a good dentist and fine 
trombonist stayed behind and rendered jazz a singular service 
dejan told how trumpet great bunk johnson lost his lip and was 
reduced to chopping sugar cane until leonard rejuvenated him 
with a new set of choppers 
dixieland evolved from two cultural strains in old new orleans 
first came gens de couleur free people of color who were the 
artisans and shopkeepers in the days of french and spanish rule 
military bands were the vogue and the aristocracy kept creole 
mistresses in maisonettes in the vieux carre the old quarter 
and showed them off at elegant quadroon balls

discography celestin bechet batiste dejan alphonse picou 
lorenzo tio manuel perez to this day mayronne points out 
almost all the old black musicians in the quarter are catholics 
this may explain why the jazz funeral dramatically accelerating 
from somber sadness to triumphant gladness resembles in its rich 
rituals the old latin requiem mass 
on the way to the undertakers you pick up the organization 
and play some beautiful gospel songs dejan explains bye and 
bye until that moment comes over in the gloryland any of 
those lovely old dirges dejan like most jazzmen pronounces it 
dodges 
when the body comes out the band marches ahead of the hearse 
and plays nice and soft to the church just a closer walk with 
thee meet me savior sometimes you wait two hours in the heat 
or the cold for the preacher to get finished 
the beat picks up a bit to move the procession toward the 
cemetery im on my way what a friend we have in jesus 
swing low sweet chariot 
we never play the same dodge twice unless the widow requests 
it says dejan the echoing brass and pounding bass drum draw a 
second line of impromptu mourners out of the side streets off 
the stoops from the bars and cafes kids rush from doorways 
clutching a bugle or a battered trumpet 
at the graveside the tempo is real sorrowful like keeners 
at an irish wake or jewish elders come to sit shivah the band is 
there to weep 
amazing grace tremulous stark a clarinet cry for pity 
piercing the heavens saxophone sighing tuba and trombone 
throbbing sobbing in counterpoint long doomsday drumrolls 
between wailing solo improvisations the melody keeps reappearing 
like sunlight through the trees its as if each bandsman saw his 
own name on the coffin plate 
as sidney bechet put it in his autobiography the remembering 
and the waiting and the suffering and looking at that sky 
watching the dark come down thats all inside the music 
while the gravediggers shovel dirt over the casket only the 
muffled beat of the snare drum leads the mourners out the cemetery 
gates 
then a block or so away dejan continues you cut that 
body loose and jazz it up oh didnt he ramble the saints go 
marching in like i say everybodys happy coming back from a 
funeral especially the widow shes got the policy 
the second line begins to prance and dance through the band 
winging it wild with their own instruments grand marshal anderson 
minor stomps and struts and sways waving an enormous silk parasol 
disrespectful not at all says mayronne its sound 
theology the deceased has gone to glory weep no more life goes 
on 
even the grand marshal he explains is not a fun figure he 
functions as a blocking back cutting a path through the jostling 
crowd so the trombonist or trumpeter doesnt get a busted lip 
not too long ago militant blacks complained sometimes 
threateningly that conventioneers were making a carnival out of 
jazz funerals dejan disagrees 
the tourists make everything lovely sometimes french and 
english cats maybe a swede ask if they can join in i say come 
on man now theyre playing in the clubs around here some even 
bought buildings and those kids you see hustling a horn around the 
quarter well their daddies were in my band a new generation is 
coming off the streets out of that second line 
dejan played his most memorable funeral gigs for free 
theres no charge when a musician dies he says biggest 
i ever saw was for alphonse picou kid howard got a fine sendoff 
papa celestin died in december some years ago lord it was cold 
cold when we cut him loose on louisiana avenue 
two years ago new orleans held one of its largest and certainly 
most unusual jazz funerals for allan jaffe the young genius behind 
preservation hall who often sat in with his tuba among those 
perishing old men who make dixieland a living legend 
no man did more for musicians in this town dejan says 
cant count the times he went with me to the pawnshop to get 
somebodys horn out of hock 
after a rabbi read the jewish service at a funeral home on north 
rampart the olympia band and four others led a lamenting line of 
thousands down the quarters streets when trumpeter milton batiste 
patted the hearse fondly and cut him loose with shake it and 
break it the second line writhed and jived danced and frolicked 
and rollicked far into the night 
everything was lovely dejan summed up the soulful road to a 
journeys end

harold dejans dream of playing all those good old gospel songs 
like roll jordan on location in the holy land almost turned 
into a nightmare 
the olympia brass band was detained at customs upon arrival from 
new orleans at israels tel aviv airport in september 1986 they 
were suspected of being black hebrews members of a chicago sect 
claiming descent from a biblical tribe but deemed ineligible for 
citizenship by the israeli government and subject to immediate 
deportation 
airport security confiscated milton batistes trumpet case and 
had it tested by the bomb squad but missed the only real 
contraband the band was carrying 
wherever they go they carry along louisiana pork sausages 
said booking agent harry mayronne 
during the five hours it took to verify the bands credentials 
leader dejan handed out some purple and gold mardi gras 
doubloons inscribed with his picture like the souvenir coins 
thrown from the floats in the mardi gras parade 
then everything was lovely dejan recalls while we waited 
to get our passports back the immigration people let me walk 
outside by the fence and pick up some holy rocks from the holy 
land

editors note two engineers convinced that a connecticut 
inventor beat the wright brothers into the air by more than two 
years have drawn up blueprints for an engine they believe is 
almost identical to the ones that powered that first flight the 
next step they hope is to build working replicas of the engines 
in an attempt to prove that gustave whitehead may have been cheated 
out of his proper place in history 
</TEXT>

speaking with the passion of a television 
preacher wes gordeuk got down on his knees and carefully unrolled 
a sheaf of documents containing the longlost secrets of an early 
american inventor 
when he had finished gordeuk leaned back and smiled 
spread across the carpet on his living room floor were the 
blueprints for an engine that gordeuk believes was used to power 
the first airplane flight in the united states 
theres a hell of a lot of detail here he says 
gordeuk an engineer and jet engine instructor at pratt amp 
whitney and don richardson a former electrical engineering 
professor from stratford spent more than two years investigating 
the engine and drafting the blueprint they are now putting the 
finishing touches on the blueprint and some day hope to build 
engines based on the plans 
the two are part of a team attempting to prove that gustave 
whitehead made the first powered airplane flight in history on aug 
14 1901 more than two years before the wright brothers flew in 
north carolina whitehead allegedly soared 50 feet above the ground 
for a distance of about a halfmile at bridgeport 
whitehead apparently did nothing to record his flight for future 
historians there was mention of the flight in a local bridgeport 
newspaper a few days after it reportedly occurred and the flight 
also was mentioned in scientific american magazine but there were 
no photographs workbooks or other ironclad documentation 
even the airplane and engines allegedly used didnt survive 
whitehead enthusiasts say that is because as a tinkerer whitehead 
constantly disassembled his inventions and reused parts for other 
work 
the state of connecticut in 1964 recognized whitehead as the 
father of connecticut aviation but claims that whitehead was 
the first in the nation to fly have been rejected by many 
including experts at the smithsonian institution 
the connecticut legislature adopted a bill in 1986 asking the 
smithsonian to review the matter but to no avail 
undaunted by the skeptics the whitehead research society has 
been working to quiet the opposition it is building a flying 
replica of the plane whitehead is believed to have flown 88 years 
ago the plane is known as no 21 an oddlooking singlewing 
machine modeled after a flying fish 
three years ago the group unveiled a fullscale model of no 21 
that was made of the same materials used by whitehead silk 
bamboo and pine the replica underwent successful tow tests and 
tethered lift tests 
gordeuk prepared for the tedious work of reconstructing 
blueprints for the engines by making two propellers the 
64yearold cromwell resident followed whiteheads notes and 
studied photographs of no 21 then spent 13 months carving the two 
6foot spruce propellers that were finished in 1985 
to draft the engine blueprints gordeuk and robinson studied 
photographs of the engines and reviewed descriptions by whiteheads 
former coworkers in addition they studied engineering handbooks 
and hardware catalogs from the turn of the century to help with 
their detective work 
knowing engines you dont even have to see the whole picture 
because even just a part of a picture to an engineer will give the 
whole thing away he says 
we found that the hardware available and used by gustave 
whitehead in 1901 was exactly the same as it is today the 
standards have not changed 
gordeuk had to go to such extremes because whitehead left behind 
no notes on his work some believe that his family discarded the 
material many years ago the scant documentation is one reason 
whiteheads accomplishments have been ignored by history 
weve duplicated we think within 99 percent of the actual 
engines gordeuk says by no means was it easy 
the two engineers discovered that whitehead built an external 
combustion engine that was modeled after a steam engine it was 
fueled by acetylene gas which at the turn of the century was 
readily available and was considered as the fuel of the future 
gasoline at that time was considered too dangerous a fuel to be 
used in engines gordeuk says 
using acetylene mixed with air whitehead developed a unique 
lightweight engine with tremendous power gordeuk says the 
doubleacting fourcylinder engines could produce about 10 
horsepower a cylinder whitehead used one engine per propeller 
giving him more horsepower than the wrights had on their first 
airplane gordeuk says 
he was able to take off after a run of 20 to 25 yards 
gordeuk says why was he able to do this simply because he had a 
third engine driving the front wheels of the airplane 
the first airplane built that could fly and did fly was able 
to take off in any wind conditions or still air in the shortest run 
that hasnt been duplicated until recent years whitehead was a 
genius he was not a liar 
having developed blueprints for the engines the whitehead group 
has now reached its next obstacle gordeuk said the group is in 
need of a machine shop to manufacture the engine parts so that 
replica engines can be built the group has not yet found a machine 
shop to help 
we are at somewhat of a dead end now gordeuk says 
but he is far from disheartened and he is certain that his 
engine and no21 will fly some day 
were good engineers he says we know its going to fly 
the smithsonian ignored the connecticut legislatures request 
and has no plans to conduct hearings into the matter says peter 
jakab the museums curator of early aviation 
the governor signed a piece of legislation asking us to 
convene a public hearing he says its just not appropriate 
for us to participate in that way were not an arbitrative body 
the curator says the wrights fully documented their flight and 
research while the case for whitehead is based on speculation as 
a result the development of the blueprints for the engines is 
interesting but not historically significant he said 
while they claim to have developed the engines he says 
its impossible to tell

editors note with the kremlin relaxing stalinera bans on the 
practice of religion dozens of new islamic mosques are opening 
across soviet central asia a land awakening from decades of 
complacent cronyism but no one is sure where more religious 
freedom and other reforms will lead in this volatile region 
separating the heartland of the ussr from iran and afghanistan

soviet central asia an arid land 
historically at the crossroads of caravans and conquerors is being 
buffeted by resurgent islam from the middle east and political 
reforms from moscow 
with new freedoms under president mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms residents of the broad band separating the soviet unions 
slavic heartland from iran and afghanistan are expressing their 
religious ethnic and political concerns 
that represents further progress for gorbachev whose program 
already has stirred other areas of the soviet union but it also 
sets the stage for a possible race between secular communist reform 
and revitalized islam for the future of a land awakening from 
decades of complacent cronyism 
much depends on the abilities of new civil and religious leaders 
to persuade people that more freedom can help solve their problems 
and not just offer a vent for their frustration such frustration 
has sparked bloodshed in other southern soviet republics armenia 
azerbaijan and georgia 
success is vital to the kremlin faced across its southern 
frontier with irans islamic fundamentalism and afghan rebels who 
fought the soviet army to a standstill both inspire some radicals 
in an interview after being chosen the new spiritual leader of 
central asias moslems recently 36yearold mohammadsadyk 
mamayusupov indicated he would follow previous religious leaders in 
cooperating with the government but use the reforms broadly to 
improve religious life 
we intend to use this moment very judiciously for the 
development of our religion and the renewal of its spiritual 
life he says 
mamayusupov has moved quickly where he can between feb 6 and 
midmarch authorities gave permission for the opening of about 35 
new mosques and he pledged that we will continue to open mosques 
until all the requests of our moslems are satisfied 
only about 200 mosques are sprinkled across the five central 
asian republics kazakhstan uzbekistan kirghizia turkmenia and 
tadzhikistan which occupy an area half the size of the continental 
united states 
the number of students in islamic academies is being doubled and 
the number of korans and other religious books being published will 
be greatly increased the kremlin is removing a stalinera ban on 
group religious education and plans to allow believers to organize 
charities 
but radicals predict the increased attention to religious needs 
will lead more people to embrace islamic fundamentalism 
we need to raise the people up said one moslem radical who 
favors establishment of an iranianstyle islamic republic it 
wont be in two three or four years it has to be done very 
quietly he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the stakes are considerable the population of the five central 
asian republics is booming from 1970 to 1987 it increased 26 
percent to 475 million and now makes up about 18 percent of the 
soviet population 
at the center of much of the regions activity is uzbekistan and 
its capital tashkent the historic cities of bukhara and samarkand 
along the silk route are centers of religious culture 
what is now soviet central asia accepted islam in the first 
century after mohammed and was a crossroads for mongols turks 
persians and slavs until it was absorbed in czarist russias drive 
south in the 19th century 
although officially atheist the soviet union nevertheless has 
maintained relations with iran and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze held a rare meeting with ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
last winter 
the soviet union has supported arab causes in the middle east 
diplomatically and militarily for more than two decades but now is 
trying to improve relations with israel in order to play a bigger 
role in any middle east peace settlement 
mamayusupov rector of the higher islamic institute in tashkent 
owes his selection in part to the resurgence of religious feelings 
in early february mufti shamsuddinkhan babakhan was ousted by a 
series of protests in which radicals accused him of corruption and 
lacking sufficient religious knowledge a council of religious 
leaders elected mamayusupov to replace him

six weeks after ousting babakhan believers were demonstrating 
again but this time they were praising god for the return of a 
7thcentury koran a gift from the uzbekistan government 
the new openness also has sparked protests of a more political 
or ethnic character 
on april 9 tashkent sources said several thousand people 
rallied to support belik an informal political group seeking to 
establish uzbek as the republics official language and calling for 
drastic measures to improve the environment belik means unity 
in the uzbek language 
in central asia as in the baltic republics and armenia the 
deteriorating environment has become a rallying point that has 
opened up broader issues such as economic reform and demands for 
more local control 
gafkha namatova a belik spokeswoman said the group claims 
100000 members it supports gorbachevs reforms she said but 
we see a lot that we like in the programs of the peoples front 
grassroots organizations that have sprung up in the baltics and 
elsewhere 
national policies demanding cotton production in central asia 
have led to food shortages she said abuse of farm chemicals on 
those same cotton fields has increased infant mortality she 
charged 
in an interview with the soviet government newspaper izvestia in 
march the republics new president mirzaolim izragimov said 
cottongrowing must be deemphasized 
the policy of pushing marginal land into production ruined 173 
million acres of pasture he said 
drainage of rivers that flow into the aral sea on the border of 
uzbekistan and kazakhstan has lowered the level of the sea and 
made it one of the soviet unions top environmental concerns 
many of the policies and practices now being repudiated in 
central asia are associated with former president leonid i 
brezhnev and his supporters 
but experience has shown the danger of replacing local 
officials ignoring ethnic feelings 
in 1986 riots broke out in alma ata the capital of kazakhstan 
following the replacement of the republics party leader 
dinmukhamed kunaev by gennady kolbin kunaev an ethnic kazakh was 
a politburo member and a close associate of brezhnev kolbin is a 
russian 
brezhnevs soninlaw yuri churbanov was sentenced to 12 years 
in a labor camp last december after being convicted of accepting 
more than 145000 from uzbekistan officials 
mamayusupov pledged religious leaders would become more socially 
active fighting bribery alcoholism and prostitution 
attacks on those social ills are not likely to bring him into 
conflict with the kremlin but moslem leaders could run into 
difficulty with local authorities if they launch a serious 
anticorruption campaign 
moslems intend to struggle very actively in the social 
sphere he said adding that ecology is the first target 
while some civil discontent is organized openly through belik 
and similar organizations the religious discontent remains largely 
hidden 
an underground group calling itself islam and democracy claimed 
credit for the protests that ousted babakhan but it since has 
splintered 
almaz yestekov the 33yearold chairman preaches the need for 
a strengthening of islam as well as establishment of westernstyle 
civil liberties 
but he said islam and democracy ultimately cannot cooperate with 
belik because of the latters secular views 
the influence of khomeinis iran may be limited the vast 
majority of soviet moslems are sunnis while shiites are dominant 
in iran the two sects have deep historic differences 
mamayusupov said the traditions of soviet moslems are strong 
enough that they will not be carried away by attempts to export a 
radical islamic movement from iran or afghanistan 
we have our own view and our own foundation he says we 
can influence others but others cannot influence us

editors note on an island on lake huron where once the most 
strenuous activity was going fishing and the only industry was a 
gravel pit prosperity has arrived and an agesold 
confrontation has been renewed some islanders it seems would 
prefer their former peace to prosperity and are in a neckwringing 
mood 
</TEXT>

the way things have been going 
since the arrival of tom monaghan it was no surprise what happened 
to his turkeys 
when monaghan set up his spread two years ago in a decaying 
retreat on this bluecollar fishing island on lake huron he let 
the tame farm birds run loose 
it was just going to be a vacation home monaghan said but in 
two years he apparently changed his mind and what he has done to 
the island instead has so angered many of the islanders that one 
night somebody wrung those turkeys necks 
monaghan king of dominos pizza inc and entrepreneur 
extraordinaire has converted his dominos lodge into a corporate 
retreat built frank lloyd wright copy homes for himself and his 
top executives cleared the woods to make room for an 18hole golf 
course added a pond and a sewer plant and started building cabins 
he and his associated landholding companies have bought more 
than 1700 acres of drummond island excluding two auxiliary 
islands and other parcels snapped up around the island by land 
speculators doing business with monaghan 
monaghan talked of plans for more condominiums marinas 
lodges banks and golf courses while he pledged his support for 
conservation by stopping his bulldozers from knocking down a tree 
with nesting woodpeckers his workers filled in wetlands 
island tempers boiled over the neckwringing was one more 
unpleasant reminder that some drummond islanders would just as soon 
see tom monaghan pack up his worldclass resort plans and take his 
jobs elsewhere 
that doesnt faze monaghan an orphan from northern michigan who 
built a pizza empire on a 30minute delivery guarantee and also 
owns the detroit tigers baseball team 
the harbor dredging is on hold and dominos island bank has been 
canned but monaghan has kept right on building and buying tame 
rabbits now wander among the shady cedar groves at dominos lodge 
unannounced monaghan popped in on the backtoback drummond 
island township board and chamber of commerce meeting this spring 
and told islanders whats what 
for good or bad things cant go back the way they were 
monaghan said even if we tore dominos lodge to the ground and 
left drummond island would never be the sameit will prosper 
with or without us 
monaghan went on 
island residents can jump on board the boom and build their own 
motels and restaurants and lodges or they can sit by and watch 
outsiders do the same he said 
its up to the little business to think a little bigger not 
just sit back and complain about everybody else monaghan said 
he is right drummond island never will be the same said 
township supervisor tax assessor and schoolteacher frank sasso 
the change is a shock for the modest island folk who measure 
their day around the mainland ferry schedule and whose idea of 
progress was marked recently with the erection of drummond islands 
first fourway stop sign 
tom doesnt mean harm sasso said he just sees potential 
and we see a place to live 
before tom monaghan drummond island was known mostly as a place 
for perch bear and bobcat the state owns 52 percent of the 
9milelong island its winter population hovers around 700 many 
of them summer vacationers who stayed on in retirement 
island economy was built on the back of a limestone gravel pit 
but its owners laid off and sold out today drummond lives mostly 
off the spending of the sport fishing trade cabin rentals are the 
going thing 
sasso said he expects the island to be invaded by a new class of 
people the walkandshop tourist 
for islanders its not what they came here to live for a lot 
of people here work for a lot less money than they can get 
elsewhere just so they can live here said sasso stabbing the 
table with his finger 
nobody on drummond island is sure how far monaghan wants to 
build or how much more land he wants to acquire the pizza king 
talks loosely of plans to expand the lodge to 40 rooms build 
another lodge and add 40 units around the golf course

in other talks he also has mentioned a commercial motel 
recreation center miniature golf course condominiums and another 
marina a minicar museum a mailorder trading post and a chapel 
retreat with 160 bedrooms 
a filing by dominos lodge inc with the chippewa county 
register of deeds details a 36condominium project with the 
potential for 236 units the site plan includes such features as 
pepperoni pond and anchovy alley 
dominos community relations director dick brunvand said he 
doesnt know monaghans concrete intentions 
i dont think there are specific plans he said a lot of 
the talk is speculative 
dominos continuing quest for island land is an attempt to 
preserve a woodland buffer around monaghans property brunvand 
said 
monaghan was rebuked once by michigans department of natural 
resources when he tried to trade nonisland land for 1440 acres of 
state forest next to his golf course 
dominos lodge staff and dnr field agents said they expect 
monaghan to try again this time offering island land 
the dnrs interest in protecting the maxton plains a rare 
bedrocklevel plant community on drummond is common knowledge 
said dnr agent pat hallfrisch in newberry 
ive heard mr monaghan was purchasing up there hallfrisch 
said my assumption is that when hes got enough hell be ready 
to trade again 
its possible said joe viilo an islander who works for 
monaghan as head of operations at dominos lodge 
no longer a personal retreat dominos lodge is a fullscale 
business venture that not even dominos can afford to keep empty 
brunvand said 
dominos now is trying to market the island getaway to other 
corporations he said 
were losing money at a rapid pace brunvand said you 
have to understand the dominos organizationthe point is we 
will not continue to lose money here 
chamber of commerce president charles krahnke protests the 
notion that monaghan has changed drummond island to dominos 
island other than the construction activity and an increase in 
airplane traffic at the township airport little has changed he 
wrote in an open letter to the media 
krahnkes life has changed however he owns a small fishing 
resort across the bay from dominos lodge in august krahnke sold 
the neighboring james island to one of dominos landholding 
companies 
shoreline property prices are up sharply and land sales are hot 
island real estate broker theila gagliardi said last year i had 
the best year of my business in 14 years on the island she said 
bob conard came to drummond island to escape a onetime college 
activist and current caretaker and oddjobs man he and his wife 
live in a house without electricity on the opposite side of the 
island from dominos they watch bluebirds nesting in the field 
nearby 
when he heard monaghan wanted to dredge the islands main 
fishing harbor potagannissing bay so a schooner called the domino 
effect could park there an angry conard began the drummond beacon 
journal on his dining room table 
the birth of that island newspaper spawned another publication 
the drummond island digest edited by brunvand from dominos 
corporate headquarters in ann arbor and printed on parchment stock 
readers are treated to a polarity of opinion 
regardless of where they came from the people who settled 
this fair island came here to assert their independence harvest 
the bounty of the woods and waters enjoy the fresh air peace and 
quiet of gods country and work together to build a better 
future for themselves and their children brunvand wrote in a 
recent editorial thats why tom monaghan and the dominos family 
are here to share this heritage and preserve it 
in a letter to the beacon journal summer visitor joan meyer of 
grand rapids expressed different sentiment 
i shall miss my drummond island she said it will never 
be the same

editors note america stills lags behind many other 
industrialized nations in the amount of trash it recycles about 10 
percent but that is changing as the nations garbage dumps fill 
up indeed some entrepreneurs are cashing in on a recycling boom 
applying modern business methods and computer technology to the old 
scrap business 
</TEXT>

paul meyer an 81yearold former corrections 
office and bank guard who drives a dented pickup truck collects 
hundreds of pounds of newspapers a day for recycling he gives the 
proceeds to charity 
like a growing number of others meyer has found theres money 
to be made in trash he figures hes given more than 60000 to 
various masons organizations since 1977 in particular the 
scottish rite foundation for aphasic children which he helped 
establish 
meyer takes his newspapers to trir systems a recycling company 
in northeast denver which like many other companies is cashing in 
on the recycling boom 
meyers stack of newspapers is immediately added to the 
inventory by laptop computer 
weve essentially applied fastfood techniques to the old 
scrap business says trir president david powelson 
the scrap and recycling industry is approaching the 14 billion 
mark in annual sales powelson says he said trir had 15 million 
in sales in 1983 and 53 million in sales last year 
founded in 1977 it now accepts 35 kinds of recyclable 
materials from paper to plastic and brass to glass at operations 
in three states 
the growth of recycling has changed the economies of scale 
in the scrap industry attracting entrepreneurs versed in 
businessschool economics and computer technology powelson says 
bob rubin agrees hes director of recycle now a nonprofit 
group funded largely by the beverage and container industries to 
encourage the growth of recycling in colorado 
theres a definite trend toward multimaterial recycling 
facilities with an emphasis on being as convenient as possible 
he says recycling works best when its most convenient 
although america still has one of the lowest recycling rates of 
industrialized nations about 10 percent that rate has begun to 
climb in the last few years and is expected to accelerate in the 
next decade 
the nations garbage dumps are filling up rapidly and public 
awareness of the problem has grown to what powelson calls 
staggering proportions 
studies say as much as 86 percent of household trash could be 
recycled and the environmental protection agency has set a goal of 
recycling 25 percent within four years 
smaller scrap and recycling companies also are benefiting from 
the industry boom 
leonard benson of benson and benson iron and metal co says 
his company is expanding moving from its scrap yard in denver to a 
customerservice center in suburban westminster equipped with 
canbuying machines and attendants to help customers unload their 
recyclables 
benson whose father was in the scrap business says he didnt 
decide to enter the business until five years ago 
recycling has put a lot of people into business he says 
adding that scrap dealers are getting away from the old scrap 
salvage yard 
were now dealing with residential businesses and people in 
the community providing a community service by making recycling 
efficient to more customers 
for manufacturers using recyclables can be cheaper than finding 
and processing raw materials using recycled paper products instead 
of virgin products for example can cut the energy used in 
production by as much as 74 percent according to the washington 
dcbased worldwatch institute it also cuts water usage by more 
than half and air and water pollution significantly 
trir has more than 1000 commercial accounts to which it sends 
trucks to pick up recyclables it also collects recyclables from 
people who come to its several distribution centers in colorado 
wyoming and arizona or to the dozen or so money mobile 
trucktrailers that the company franchises out and parks on busy 
streets in residential neighborhoods 
trir turns around and sells the recyclables to companies like 
container corporation of america weyerhaeuser reynolds aluminum 
and others including brokers who sell the recyclables to mills in 
several asian countries 
old computer paper that trir picks up at a corporate customers 
offices for instance is put on conveyor belts in trirs 
warehouse and run through a shredder and baler 
the shredded spread sheets are bought by tissuepaper 
manufacturers powelson says 
the companys main warehouse in denver processes 4 million to 5 
million pounds of recyclable materials daily most of which is sold 
the very same day to keep inventory low 
computerization of the inventory means trir also can adjust the 
prices it pays for materials to fit the latest market conditions 
powelson says 
powelson says the recyclers real competition is the trash can 
and he is hopeful the worlds no 1 throwaway society will 
keep changing its ways 
standing amid mountains of baled paper and cans in trirs 
warehouse he winces at the words trash or garbage 
i just look at them and see money he says 
so does meyer one load of newspapers in his truck weighs from 
2200 to 2800 pounds for which he is paid 1 cents a pound 
when asked how much he makes in this business meyer consults a 
battered notebook he keeps in his shirt pocket in the last 2 
months he brought in about 40 tons of paper for 175075

cindy williams and bill hudson stars of the 
disney channels just like family are indeed just like family 
not only are the two married in real life and the parents of 
two children but one daughter has made an appearance on the new 
comedy series 
williams and hudson play a childless couple that hires two 
children to pose as their offspring thats to satisfy the whims of 
hudsons new boss who runs a childrens clothing company and drops 
hints about hudson being a family man 
the weekly halfhour comedy series taped before an audience 
made its debut in midmay 
one of the children in just like family is named emily 
after their 6yearold daughter 
the real emily was in a birthday party scene recently says 
williams who is best known for her role as shirley feeney on the 
hit comedy series laverne and shirley she was a tad confused 
when we called the actress emily 
shed told us one day why cant i be on the show hudson 
says the next week was the birthday party and we talked to the 
producers she was an extra with no lines afterward when we took 
her home she said next time i want lines 
both parents say they like the family feeling of working at the 
disney studio 
its like being in high school says hudson who began his 
career as a member of the musical group the hudson brothers the 
studios like a campus its a real family atmosphere 
williams quit laverne and shirley in 1982 when she became 
pregnant the series which also starred penny marshall as laverne 
de fazio lasted for another season the show a spinoff of happy 
days made its debut in january 1976 in first place in the 
ratings it finished the season in third place and the next season 
it was second to happy days it was first for two seasons 
197778 and 197879 
since then williams has been looking for another series and 
working mostly at disney 
williams had starred in save the dog for the disney channel 
and did two disney sunday movies the leftovers with john 
denver and help wanted kids with hudson the latter inspired 
the current series 
they didnt have any actors for the movie on a friday and it 
was due to start filming on monday she says jeffrey 
katzenberg president of walt disney studios called and asked if 
bill and i would do it the movie did very well in the ratings 
williams turned down initial overtures from the studio to make 
it into a series 
i didnt want to do a show about parents and kids she says 
i felt the market was saturated i wanted to do an ensemble show 
that didnt happen so i said lets do this one 
in the series they play a young couple that moves from new york 
to nevada when the husband hudson as tom burke accepts a new job 
with a childrens clothing company williams is lisa burke a 
bigcity newspaper woman who finds her only outlet is a small 
weekly newspaper gabriel damon 13 and grace johnston 8 also 
star as their rented children 
pat mccormick appears as the head of giddyup clothes and dan 
hedaya is the seedy uncle lucky 
the way we explore the rented aspect is that both the adults 
and the children need something from each other hudson says 
we need them for the job and they need us because theyre little 
scam artists they live with uncle lucky whos always got some 
scheme going 
the important thing is that a bond grows between the couple 
and the children especially with cindy whose maternal instincts 
come out 
but williams adds basically its a comedy 
cindys theory is that we have 22 minutes so make them 
laugh hudson says i go for the subtext the underlying meaning 
cindy goes for the laughs 
prior to the movie and series williams and hudson had only 
appeared together in the play see how they run at the burt 
reynolds theater in jupiter fla

ira levin a novelist and playwright whose 
thrillers and mysteries have spiced the stage and bookstores for 
years notes wistfully that comedy comes easiest 
but book editors ask for thrillers not comedies levin says 
i always have to watch myself he says very often when im 
writing scary stuff i find i cant resist a little joke i 
eventually edit it out sometimes ill write a good one down and 
hope a place will show up for it it rarely does a joke usually 
springs out of the situation and characters 
his current offbroadway offering is cantorial in which the 
audience never sees the cantor they only hear him singing a 
singing ghost 
not a new twist for levin who has written about the 
supernatural before but unlike his bestknown novel rosemarys 
baby this plays ghost is benign all he does is sing but his 
songs are directed to a young couple that has taken up residence in 
a former manhattan synagogue the ghostly voice wants their 
furniture out of the living room he wants it to be a synagogue 
again 
levins other novels include a kiss before dying the 
stepford wives and the boys from brazil his plays range from 
the comedy no time for sergeants in 1955 to deathtrap in 
1978 broadways longestrunning thriller 
for a while i would go back and forth between a play and a 
book levin says at this point id like to do more books 
its hard to get a play on it takes so long it was easier in the 
old days 
cantorial was presented three years ago in stamford conn 
there were problems with it levin says i put it on the 
shelf then i did a complete rewrite i felt i had found the 
problems with it so it was kind of exciting to get it right 
he doesnt mind that its being presented offbroadway instead 
of on and is pleased at its success there were hoping its 
going to have a good long healthy run so far it is doing very 
nicely the audience seems to be building from wordofmouth 
levin doesnt want potential playgoers to think cantorial 
with the young man in it adopted and thinking he may be jewish is 
only for jews i think nonjewish people seem to respond to it 
if anything more warmly than jewish audience members partly i 
think theyre relieved theyve enjoyed it 
i always intended it for a mainstream audience we all are 
looking for roots and family warmth even those of us whove had 
it its nice to have that sense of recapturing it 
levin plunged into writing full time after new york university 
where he majored in english a tv script he wrote for a competition 
was bought by nbc 
that was enough to encourage my parents to let me stay home 
and write he says i wrote a few more tv plays that sold i 
wrote a few that didnt i wrote my first book a kiss before 
dying then i went out looking for work before i could find a job 
the book had been accepted by simon and schuster so i officially 
became a writer ive never held an honest job 
thats unless you count two years in the army even there i 
managed to write training films 
levin who is divorced and has three grown sons lives in a 
manhattan apartment with a grand piano and a big black coffee 
table with a big black box in the center its a tv projector for a 
10foot screen which pulls down from the ceiling consequently he 
doesnt read much anymore 
the architect who did the apartment talked me into it ive 
got my own movie theater which i always wanted as a child ive 
really gotten hooked on tv it has even made a baseball fan of me 
which i never was the study where he writes is partitioned from 
the living room by a wall of glass bricks 
i tend to be a workaholic he says when i really get into 
something i wake up earlier and earlier and work later and later 
after a few days i cant tell the fictional world from the real 
world 
years ago levin made a list of interesting settings for novels 
or plays a haunted synagogue was on the list 
one day it dawned on me it should be haunted by a cantor not 
somebody banging around in chains he says i thought cantorial 
singing would be interesting its unusual to hear in a theater 
thats how i got started then the synagogue became a former 
synagogue the singing obviously made it a play instead of a 
novel 
the boys from brazil was always a novel idea because these 
boys would have to be cropping up in different countries 
levin never has written a screenplay any idea i got could be 
a play or a novel first he says i might as well do it that 
way and please myself rather than write a screenplay that has to 
please 100 people on the coast 
i was going to do deathtrap then the thought of writing the 
whole thing over again got to be a chore i was sorry afterward i 
wasnt that happy with the screenplay that was done 
but he liked rosemarys baby 
its probably the most faithful movie adaptation that has ever 
been made he says roman polanski directed it and wrote the 
screenplay it was the first movie hed made that wasnt based on 
his own original material i dont think he knew he had a right to 
change things

as south america sinks lower into economic 
morass its young people see their futures sinking with it many 
are not staying around leaving the continent with the prospect of 
a serious loss of brain power in the years ahead this is one of a 
series of periodic reports by the associated press on the economic 
social and political turbulence that has turned south america into 
a continent in crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
south americas young are losing 
faith in their debtridden continents future they are emigrating 
in evergrowing numbers to escape deepening economic and social 
crises in their homelands 
angry with widespread nepotism patronage and corruption in 
their governments and frustrated by shrinking job markets more and 
more youngsters are lining up outside emigration offices for visas 
hoping to pursue careers in the united states or europe 
in rio de janeiro alone on every business day visa lines of 
about 200 people form outside the us consulate most in the lines 
are young 
similar lines are seen in such capitals as buenos aires in 
argentina and montevideo in uruguay 
young people youth leaders and professional counselors 
contacted by the associated press in eight south american nations 
said 16 to 21yearolds doubt a ready solution exists to the 
continents inflation joblessness indebtedness and economic 
stagnation 
its like inheriting a nightmare said luciana jorge da 
silva 16 a high school sophomore and a youth leader in santos 
brazil you dont know exactly when it began or how to end it 
widespread anxiety has replaced a mood of optimism born 10 years 
ago when a number of south american countries began a passage from 
dictatorship to civilian rule 
since then the regions youth have seen civilian authority 
erode from within by corruption inefficiency and government 
indecision and challenged from without by disgruntled military 
officers drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas 
newly restored press freedoms have exposed violence 
environmental abuse and social injustice often hidden during 
military rule forcing the young to view their countries in a new 
painfully realistic manner 
we are victims of a lost decade said marcelo rodrigues de 
carvalho 21 a university biology student in rio de janeiro our 
economies are in ruins we are financially exploited by the us 
and europe and we have lost our cultural identity 
runaway inflation shrinking buying power and spiraling 
unemployment add to the gloom 
university students often abandon school to become maids street 
peddlers movie ushers or black marketeers 
raul 18 is one of some 3000 money changers on the streets of 
lima the capital of peru 
i change dollars now because its the only way for me to make 
decent money he said besides im not strong enough to carry 
heavy loads and id rather do this than steal 
in venezuela or chile two of south americas more economically 
stable nations there is a vague awareness among young people that 
things are getting worse 
finding a job will be more difficult than graduating said 
carlos garofalo 18 a college freshman in caracas venezuela 
studying electrical engineering 
in some countries desperation turns to violence 
in colombia and peru where leftist insurgenices have grown the 
nations young play a key role in armed struggle against government 
forces in peru the average age of a guerrilla fighter in the 
marxist shining path group is 16 to 20 
unemployment and deficient educational systems have likewise 
triggered a steep rise in drug and alcohol abuse among youth across 
the continent especially in slums around large metropolitan 
centers 
a recent survey of high school students in montevideo uruguays 
capital found that 11 percent of 13to17yearolds were drug or 
alcohol addicts in 1987 more than 44 percent of peruvians 19 to 
24 consumed cocaine paste according to police figures 
in rio de janeiro slum dwellers are often organized and ruled 
by young narcotics kings who train children as young as 12 to use 
guns and run cocaine to customers in wealthy suburbs 
in santiago chile where various social research organizations 
estimate that more than 500000 young people in the metropolitan 
area of 4 million are underemployed or unemployed drug abuse is 
rampant there too 
juan reyes 19 who works as a doorman at the garage of a major 
santiago bank said in the ghetto where i live there were two 
kids who used drugs a few years ago now there are dozens who do 
it and many others drink its because they have nothing to do but 
hang around 
the economic squeeze has made a college education impossible for 
all but the elite in chile where the minimum legal salary of 
about 38 percent of the population is the equivalent of 72 a 
month stateowned universities charge 120 a month tuition 
in brazil where only 35 percent make more than the minimum wage 
of 85 monthly an average college tuition upwards of 130 a month 
is far out of reach 
allessandra de oliveira nobre 17 dropped out of a rio 
institute that trained flight stewardesses to take a job in a 
mcdonalds for 20 a month 
my life seems like its over and i havent even had a chance 
at a career she said 
still most student and vocational couselors regard a college 
diploma as little more than a piece of paper 
young people go to college knowing theyll get a degree but 
not a job said sen enrique bernales of peru 
what does education in argentina do for young people said 
roman ojeda 20 a prelaw student at the university of buenos 
aires it gives them the opportunity to leave argentina 
indeed escape seems the only way out 
in buenos aires long lines snake around blocks outside the 
italian and spanish embassies where work papers can be obtained 
easily for children and grandchildren of italians and spaniards 
in montevideo one survey indicated that a third of people 15 to 
29 years old hope to leave uruguay to find a better job in spain 
argentina or the united states 
at the us consulate in rio de janeiro the young apply for 
student visas or work permits 
yet while history shows that south american teenagers often 
look to the armed forces to provide leadership in times of crisis 
this is not happening today at least in part because of growing 
awareness that the continents social crisis and foreign debt were 
left behind by preceding miltiary regimes 
as a result most guidance counselors and vocational experts 
say the brain drain will deprive south america of talent needed 
for economic development 
young people though aware of economic strains imposed by south 
americas 2774 billion foreign debt overwhelmingly blame corrupt 
government officials for their nations problems 
everybody knows theyre all thieves said maye villarroel 
15 a high school student in caracas reflecting what seems to be a 
general sentiment among youths 
more alarming to some such as brazilian career counselor paulo 
quintanilha nobre de mello the continents economic decay seems 
directly and indirectly linked to a savage individualism and 
moral decadence 
everybody is responsible for the current situation says 
daniel lin 17 a high school student in buenos aires but 
absolutely nobody takes responsibility

as the us supreme court considers a new ruling on 
legal abortion the issue is flaring in western europe with 
churchbacked groups fighting to limit laws that have made the 
practice widely available 
the issue has touched off street demonstrations in italy 
threatened the stability of belgiums government and prompted a 
debate in west germany where authorities have cracked down on 
violators of the abortion law 
but in many other parts of the world it is barely an issue at 
all either because of a consensus it is wrong or a broad 
acceptance of abortion as a form of birth control 
in the soviet bloc and china for example abortion has reached 
very high levels one for every two live births in china but it 
is widely accepted as a means to prevent unwanted babies even in 
overwhelmingly roman catholic poland the practice is widespread 
the catholic church has been the principal force behind 
worldwide campaigning against abortion 
the protection and defense of the human person every person 
and the whole person especially those who are vulnerable and most 
helpless this is a task which the catholic church in the name of 
christ cannot and will not forsake pope john paul ii said may 
23 reaffirming the churchs total ban on abortion 
in the united states churchbacked groups have played a key 
role in a vocal campaign against the 1973 roe vs wade decision 
that made abortion a constitutional right the supreme court in 
wasshington is reconsidering that decision and is expected to rule 
by late june 
abortion became legal in many western european countries in the 
1970s and early 1980s but as in the united states legalization 
has not tempered the debate 
in italy hundreds of thousands of protesters thronged the 
streets of rome this spring in the biggest demonstrations for and 
against abortion since 1981 when italians voted in a referendum to 
uphold the practice on demand in the first three months of 
pregnancy 
health minister carlo donat cattin a member of the christian 
democrat party has joined religious groups and conservatives in 
calling for limits on the 1978 law proabortion demonstrators have 
countered protesting loopholes in the law they blame for a 
growing number of back alley abortions 
in belgium a 16year battle to legalize abortion realized its 
first victory in may when two senate committees voted to allow 
abortion in cases of psychological or economic distress 
but the measure is fiercely opposed by belgiums dominant 
christian democrats a catholicinspired party the issue could 
bring down the coalition government 
in western europe as in the united states restrictions on 
abortion have not prevented women from getting them elsewhere 
for example many belgians go next door to the netherlands 
where abortion laws are more liberal dutch hospitals performed 
36455 abortions in 1986 21655 of them for foreigners 
and in britain doctors performed 3673 abortions in 1987 for 
women from ireland where the operation is illegal 
the abortion issue returned to the front pages in west germany 
in may when a bavarian court convicted dr horst theissen of 
performing abortions without proof that the women had been 
counseled by at least two doctors as required by law 
bavaria state which is 70 percent catholic also indicted 156 
of theissens patients on charges of getting abortions without the 
required counseling most were fined the cases prompted rallies by 
proabortion groups and criticism from the countrys main 
opposition party the social democrats 
abortion is a common means of birth control in the soviet bloc 
even in poland where more than 90 percent of the population 
consider themselves catholic an estimated one in two pregnancies 
is terminated by abortion one of the highest rates in the world 
a severe housing shortage and erratic supplies of contraceptives 
contribute to the rate 
polands parliament is considering legislation backed by the 
catholic church to make abortion a crime both proand 
antiabortion groups have held demonstrations 
in the soviet union women average six to nine abortions each 
during their childbearing years according to western estimates 
the countrys topranking woman candidate politburo member 
alexandra biryukova has complained about the number and blamed a 
shortage of contraceptives 
abortion was legalized in many east bloc countries in the 1950s 
while contraceptives were not generally available until the 1970s 
said jeremy hamand publications director of the londonbased 
international planned parenthood federation 
when they did come in there was a whole generation of women 
who had controlled their fertility by abortion he said 
several asian countries outlaw abortion but it is widely 
practiced in japan and china 
it was like making an appointment at the dentist said one 
college student who recently had an abortion in tokyo 
japan bans the birth control pill because of possible side 
effects the countrys main religions buddhism and shintoism do 
not condemn abortion and it carries no social stigma 
the health ministry in tokyo says japan had 178 registered 
abortions for every 1000 women aged 15 to 49 in 1985 however 
many go unreported doctors say and japans abortion rate might 
exceed that of the united states which had 24 terminated 
pregnancies for every 1000 females of childbearing age that year 
abortion is a main form of population control in china where 
more than 10 million abortions are performed each year about one 
for every two live births while there is some individual 
resistance to government pressures to abort unplanned babies there 
are no antiabortion groups and the main criticism has come from 
the united states 
in predominantly catholic latin america abortion is widely 
illegal except in cases where the womans life is in danger or she 
is a victim of rape there has been little or no movement to expand 
those conditions 
however there are many illegal abortions 
theyre extremely common and maternal mortality is extremely 
high as a result said hamand 
in brazil for example about 300000 to 500000 abortions are 
performed a year according to the health ministry 
in an exception to the regional practice cuba instituted legal 
abortion in 1959 soon after fidel castro took power to cope with 
a population boom it is routinely performed in government 
hospitals and free contraceptives are provided

for 60 of his 89 years the rev 
arthur le blanc made his missionary rounds in an ox cart then in 
april his bishop ordered him to stop and assigned him a car 
the bishop was just 3 years old when le blanc came here from the 
united states and even had served as his altar boy 
i was ordained the year charles lindbergh flew across the 
atlantic le blanc said then the next year he himself crossed 
the atlantic on a threemonth journey that brought him to this 
island off southeast africa on july 10 1928 
he has since endured countless privations a climate doctors in 
1932 said would kill him and only limited success in converting 
the islanders to roman catholicism other christian missionaries 
havent had much success either since the vast majority of people 
here still cling to traditional ways and to animism a belief that 
inanimate objects have consciousness and personalities 
le blanc devoted his life to trying to sow roman catholism among 
them nevertheless and if he wasnt a big success at that he 
achieved other things that would please a religious man 
six years ago he almost lost his sight a surgical implant has 
helped save it earlier he nearly died from blackwater fever 
but he kept going 
his persistance is incredible in the early 1970s american 
was a dirty word here but he was so accepted that the difficulties 
didnt affect him said the rev joseph shea director of 
personnel for la sallete order to which le blanc belongs 
priests in the united states dont see the results of their 
work le blanc told a reporter here we do 
sipping on a small glass of rum during one of his rare visits to 
the capital le blanc recalled that books magazines electricity 
even vegetables and fruit were luxuries most of the time and he 
spent many years as the only priest in one of several towns on the 
west coast 
two letters would arrive at the same time one asking why the 
other one hadnt been answered he said 
when you get interested in your work you can do without things 
you thought were necessary in the past you like the people your 
companion priests thats the main thing 
im staying until the end 
he doesnt plan to use a us vacation due him this year his 
three brothers and two sisters have died 
le blanc talked of his arrival in madagarscar 
we had no church or even a house so we rented a villagers 
house it was our dormitory our dining room was in another house 
a mile away 
two other priests joined him after he opened the first mission 
in morondova 240 miles by air and until recently a twoday and 
sometimes dangerous drive from antananarivo 
we built a wooden cathedral in morondova sixty men went into 
the forest and cut wood for it it is still in use because the new 
concrete one isnt finished 
his first task was to teach himself the malagasy language and 
local children helped services were conducted in latin but the 
priests read their sermons in malagasy 
wed make all kinds of mistakes but the people were used to 
that and they were so happy we tried 
newly arrived priests now get a sevenmonth course in the 
language 
his initial forays into the scorching heat of the baobab and 
tamarind country around morondava were taken in a palaquin a 
covered litter carried by four men who handed him to a second team 
in shifts without dropping him 
after the government banned this practice he began using an ox 
cart extremely expensive on the small stipends priests earn but 
the only reliable form of transport 
i packed my baggage cooking gear and mass materials into the 
cart along with coffee and sugar i carried no food people gave 
me rice and chicken he said 
most trips were two months or longer dodging ant hills and 
seeking shelter from the maddening ranovory downpours that 
occasionally burst from the usually deep blue skies there were few 
villages or other rest points en route 
you wanted to stop but where 
le blanc reckons he has gone through four or five ox carts and 
an untold number of oxen at one point the us catholic 
missionary vehicle association gave him 1500 for a new cart 
he recalled visiting one village to see a woman who had given up 
the faith to return to her former traditional beliefs 
i tried without success to convince her to return and then 
left her village to resume my trip 
but my ox died and i had to go back to her village to find 
another one the woman said my return was a sign from heaven and 
she confessed he said 
it was thrilling to find one person who seemed to be 
interested who asked a lot of questions 
le blanc has baptized thousands over the years but sometimes he 
would return from a long trip with no new converts or only a 
handful news that wasnt well received at church headquarters 
the people are ferociously individualist and cling to their 
traditional way said shea of the la sallete order 
it is estimated that perhaps only 8 percent of the people in the 
morondava area are christians most of the rest are animists 
ancestor worship is widely practiced in madagascar an island 
whose people have oceanic origins 
in the morondava area several cemetaries display explicit erotic 
funeral art and funerals somtimes include orgies 
visitors to the cemetaries are expected to make a donation to 
the dead usually a sprinkling of rum before entering the spirit 
domain

suppose you were seeing a space movie you knew nothing about 
the crew of the space ship includes a black a japanese a russian 
a scot as well as a halfhuman halfspaceling a regular united 
nations 
the action is wildly improbable when the heroes find themselves 
in inescapable peril they simply request a fat guy to remove them 
to a safer place as for special effects theyre on a par with 
saturday morning tv shows and the dialogue features such cliches 
as you look as if youd seen a ghost i think i have 
captain i think i have 
now suppose you learn the movie is star trek v the final 
frontier that changes things right 
star trek has become such a modern mythology that it defies 
criticism even when the movies descend into selfparody maybe 
its better simply to report the plot and let the ticket buyer 
beware 
members of the starship enterprise crew are vacationing in 
yosemite still pristine in the 23rd century captain kirk is 
climbing the face of el capitan he slips and plunges downward 
then zip spock in his jet boots manages to rescue him preventing 
a short movie 
the crew is summoned back to the enterprise its a new model 
and chief engineer scott is still trying to get the bugs out no 
time the enterprise is ordered on a troubleshooting mission some 
religious zealots have conquered nimbus iii the planet of 
galactic peace and have taken hostages 
the ramshackle enterprise takes off and it is tracked by kirks 
archenemies the strangetalking klingons kirk escapes and he 
attacks the nimbus iii rebels kirk and party are captured and they 
encounter the leader of the rebellion a christlike vulcan named 
sybok he turns out to be spocks halfbrother 
sybok commandeers the enterprise for a flight past the unknown 
and into a strange land where he believes god lives he is sadly 
disappointed 
action is scarce while the characters engage in metaphysical 
political and personal matters william shatner takes his turn at 
directing leonard nimoy directed no iv and he performs well 
within script limitations all of the crew members satisfactorily 
do their shtick lawrence luckinbill is impressive as the 
wrongheaded sybok 
the paramount pictures release was produced by harve bennett 
with a script by david loughery from a story by loughery shatner 
and bennett the rating is pg perhaps for excitement

in a sentimental mood warner bros dr john 
 
those who remember dr john as the night tripper who brought 
a touch of bayou mysticism to the era of psychedelic rock will find 
it curious to think of him as a sentimental kind of guy nor would 
his usual concoctions of delta blues rock and honkytonk lead one 
to associate him with such tin pan alley standards as more than 
you know or accentuate the positive 
even more unexpected are the lush string and horn arrangements 
heard in the background of some of the nine tracks on this album of 
classic old songs 
but as an accomplished session player dr john aka mac 
rebennack is nothing if not versatile so when he turns his 
keyboard talent and his distinctive gravelly voice to sentimental 
ballads such as candy and my buddy he knows how to create 
the right mood 
yet its clear this is not the doctors specialty an inner 
sleeve note credits ray charles for inspiration the fact is ray 
does it better 
dr johns seenitallandthensome vocal style works much 
better on the bluesy black night and on makin whoopee the 
sassy duet with rickie lee jones that leads off the album teaming 
those two vocal stylists was the best idea behind this record and 
it would be great to hear more from them 
the other highlights are the instrumental title cut a duke 
ellington number and a rollicking rendition of cole porters 
love for sale both featuring dr johns piano playing his 
true forte

kings of boogie gnp crescendo savoy brown 
 
in an age of classic soft drinks and candy bars perhaps 
savoy brown after 22 albums can be excused for taking on the title 
kings of boogie but as a souvenir of the coronation this 
effort is pretty stale 
theres plenty of boogie music here but youve heard it all 
before on any given night there probably are hundreds of bands in 
bars across the country playing this type of music with more 
inventiveness and freshness than what is displayed on kings of 
boogie 
as always bandleader kim simmons is impeccable on guitar the 
rhythm section is solid and vocalist dave walker can growl with the 
best of them the trouble is the material its tired cliched and 
forgettable 
oh yeah the albums liner notes gushing about the bands 
integrity seem a little silly next to the thank you note to a 
certain athletic shoe maker and the insert hawking official savoy 
brown merchandise

a night to remember epic cyndi lauper 
 
that is cyndi laupers name on the new album a night to 
remember and yes it sure sounds like her but for all we know 
it could be paula abdul or jody watley or debbie gibson fill in 
your own choice 
once delightfully distinctive laupers taken a distressing step 
backward into the sea of wannabes with this record the need 
for hits has made her music generic 
the cyndi on the shes so unusual album was a joy to know 
she was a tough independent woman with a marvelous set of pipes 
not afraid as the song says to have fun not many artists have 
the guts to defend masturbation on their first album 
where did that cyndi go on the first three songs of this new 
record lauper defines herself through men theres the man she 
craves so much shell drive all night to sleep with him the man 
she craves so much she feels primitive urges the man she 
craves so much she cant bear to spend that first night without him 
the narrator could be anybody although lauper shares 
songwriting credit on seven of this records tunes all are written 
at least in part by professional song doctors people such as 
billy steinberg and tom kelly who are brought in for artists 
desperate for hits 
some of the songs are good these people didnt get their track 
record by chance i drove all night in particular builds 
nicely with fine singing by the deeper voiced lauper a night to 
remember is another catchy tune however both are weighted down 
by overly loud drumming and busy arrangements 
some songs are too gimmicky insecurious and like a cat 
are ideas that probably sounded more clever on paper 
none of the tunes though really sound like laupers 
remember this is an artist whose last single stiffed and her 
first starring role in a movie vibes was a disaster this 
record has the uncomfortable feel of an artist whos lost her 
confidence being directed by a record company concerned about a big 
investment

john clark gable son of the star 
hollywood called king has decided to follow in the profession of a 
father he never knew 
the 28yearold gable is costarring with james brolin and 
richard roundtree in the western bad jim produced by menahem 
golans new 21st century film corp 
the movie has been shooting in the desert plains and arroyos 
northwest of phoenix and so far young gable has drawn high marks 
from his costars and director clyde ware 
i think hes got a lot of his father in him ware said 
hes never really acted before hes never wanted to act before 
hes a race driver imagine carrying the load of being the kings 
son i think he carries it very well 
the resemblance is hard to fathom john clarks face is long and 
thin compared to his fathers squarejawed look and his hair is 
light brown while gables was dark their height is the same but 
the son is slender and wiry the greatest similarity is in the 
voices both crackle with nononsense authority 
one recent afternoon before shooting began gable sat down 
before a frontier saloon amid a clutter of ramshackle movie sets 
called cow town and submitted to a rare interview 
submitted is an apt word since gable does not easily reveal 
himself that is natural after a childhood in which his mother kay 
spreckels gable strove mightily to keep him out of public view 
i am a private person he admitted crediting a little 
help from my wife she is tracy yarro and they have a daughter 
kayley 3 and a son clark james 7 months but how is he going to 
cope with the publicity spotlight thats generated as a movie actor 
real simple he said just as if im a rolling billboard 
out there in the desert ill play it the same way its the same 
as in racing its all advertising and product he is sponsored 
by bf goodrich and american racing wheels in his racing career 
does he enjoy interviews 
a rare grin please dont put me on a spot like that yes and 
no it depends 
john clark gable was born in 1960 three months after his father 
died of a heart attack at the conclusion of the misfits the 
boy spent his first 13 years on the 22acre gable ranch in the 
middle of encino the property has since been subdivided into 
luxury estates and the gable house is now occupied by indicted 
junkbond king michael milken 
i went back there once and it made me sick he said i 
drove up the driveway to my old house and was so appalled at what 
had been done to it that i turned around and drove away 
kay gable protected her son from the press and other intruders 
sending him to private schools buckley in west los angeles and 
brooks prep in andover mass 
she didnt like the way people handled interviews and she 
wanted to protect me gable recalled she was afraid of 
possible kidnapping she always told me that my father told her 
one actor in the family is enough 
gable spent a year at aiglon college in villars switzerland 
then graduated from santa monica city college in 1983 his fields 
of study included art ceramics a lot of science art history 
nothing related to the entertainment business 
during his college years gable became engrossed in motor cross 
racing much to his mothers distress she died in 1983 he has 
jolted through the grueling baja california race for almost 24 
hours straight twice he has had serious accidents in races one 
required seven hours of surgery after four years of motor cross he 
switched to classa trucks 
whats so great about racing 
i just love it the excitement of it he said theres 
nothing like racing across the desert they used to cross the 
desert in covered wagons back in the 1800s were just modernday 
cowboys in fullsized pickups now its pretty much the same thing 
we just go a little faster and a little harder 
fear i have no fear i have more fear when i get on a horse 
two years ago friends saw him in television interviews about his 
racing and suggested john clark could make it as an actor he 
studied for two years in acting school a lot of improvisation 
a lot of classroom work a lot of work on my feet with other 
actors or solo pieces the basic things you learn in acting 
school 
ware submitted a script that gable didnt like then he was sold 
on bad jim now john clark would like to do more acting 
especially action and adventure films im not very much into 
romance or any of that 
john clark first became aware of his famed father at a home 
screening of gone with the wind 
i was 2 years old and i couldnt sit through the whole movie 
at that point in my life he recalled i was kind of 
rambunctious at that age 
on another occasion he threw a glass of punch at the screen when 
he saw his father kissing another woman 
i really didnt know my father he remarked i used to 
love to hear my mother tell stories about him i was very lucky 
that i was able to see my father on film what he looked like 
acting talking moving i didnt really know much about my dad 
except the stories ive heard 
gable hasnt seen his fathers 66 films but he hopes to see 
them all some day his favorites are the misfits san 
francisco test pilot his very favorite mogambo 
gone with the wind of course mutiny on the bounty 
and soldier of fortune 
he was asked for a capsule portrait of the man who was called 
king his reply 
he was a very rugged outgoing man he was very social and 
generous to people but he also had a very private life he loved 
hunting he loved fishing he loved fast cars he loved motorcycles 
and horses 
that might also sound like a picture of john clark gable 
uhhuh he admitted it might run in the blood

stage doors sometimes stick and smoke effects 
have gone up in flames costumes are homemade or handmedowns and 
actors race out the theaters back door through a parking lot and 
past derelicts on the street to make front stage entrances 
its all part of high opera in a distinctly lowbrow area called 
the bowery one of new york citys dingier spots 
with a 24hour car park on one side a transient hotel and 
punkrock club on the other the narrow fourstory amato opera 
theatre fills the bowery with strains of mozart and puccini 
this everymans opera company is the creation of tony amato who 
fell in love with opera as a youngster shortly after emigrating 
with his family from minori italy to the united states 
but the amato theaters unprepossessing style is no cover for 
amateurish ways since amato launched his opera theater 41 years 
ago 65 alumni have graduated to the metropolitan opera new york 
city opera and other companies in the united states 
he was a beacon for me there was a place i could go at a very 
young age and learn said neil shicoff a lead tenor at the met 
he went to amato when he was 19 after being rejected by the 
juilliard school after three years with the amato juilliard 
accepted him 
the learning techniques of how to act were really from tony 
the 39yearold shicoff recalled in a recent interview how to 
stand how to really look at another singer and how to not lose the 
audience when you do that or how not to sing directly to the side 
into the wings 
it was only when i sang on an international level that i 
realized how good tony was he really could take somebody from 
scratch and teach you stuff which a lot of directors cant do 
attracted by that reputation amatos amateur casts of hundreds 
trek over after office hours from throughout the city for a chance 
to learn operas heroic and obscure roles staging and later to 
perform fulllength operas before tiny audiences the converted 
storehouse seats about 100 folding chairs are set up for sellouts 
at the amato only the scenic designer and musicians are paid 
the amatos receive rent for the building an annual grant from the 
new york state council of the arts for 4000 ticket sales at 12 
each a handful of contract performances and contributions keep the 
shows running last years annual budget was the highest ever 
100000 the season usually includes five productions of about 10 
performances each 
people dont really do it for money said 24yearold mark 
freiman who made his debut in march as the lead in the marriage 
of figaro 
amato a short whirlwind of energy controls almost every aspect 
of his company he chooses the operas stages the productions 
directs the actors changes the scenery conducts the orchestra 
hes the master of ceremonies announcing winners of raffles for 
amato tshirts and videotaped operas during a performance of 
faust several years ago amato even put down the baton to 
extinguish a fire when a smoke effect went awry 
my theory is that to have good theater one man has to be in 
charge when you have a stage director a music director a scenic 
director and a costume director too much friction too much time 
wasted i experienced it many many years ago thats why i decided 
to do everything myself 
i used to be a singer i still sing once in a while in an 
emergency said the 68yearold amato who toured the united 
states with regional opera companies as a tenor 
opera in those days was very bad badly put together and i 
always realized the lack of good theater in it so when i had a 
chance to i started teaching to earn some extra income i realized 
how much i could give to it 
dubbed the twopenny opera in one newspaper account of the 
theaters history the amato seems to pride itself on making the 
most of less his wife sally helps wherever needed from sewing 
costumes to singing lastminute roles props are inventive dry 
oatmeal was used once for snow but discontinued when hordes of 
mice invaded sets are reused carefully patched up so age doesnt 
show 
the orchestra pit is literally that a cramped cellarlike area 
mostly under the stage with barely enough space for one upright 
piano and the usual accompaniment of 10 musicians the concession 
stand is a small table in the back of the room where amatos 
sisterinlaw sells coffee and homemade rum balls and cookies 
when scenes call for front stage entrances actors must race out 
the theaters back door through the parking lot past a varying 
assortment of vagrants alcoholics and drug addicts and in through 
the theaters front door 
amato moved his theater to the bowery 29 years ago instead of 
having dope addicts we had wine addicts amato said 
but theres been no trouble and sometimes he invites his 
neighbors of the street in for a show 
i say if you dress clean ill let you come in and they do 
youd be surprised the knowledge of opera some of them have its 
incredible he said 
the contrast between the art form and the neighborhood is often 
startling 
were always running around with our costumes on the bums 
they stare at you and sometimes they think they have had too much 
to drink freiman said usually when you wear your costume no 
one says anything because its new york 
but during one opera which required tie and tails several men 
asked freiman for money because they thought he was rich 
it was weird shicoff recalled i would sing a performance 
down there and i would feel on top of the world and you would walk 
outside and somebodys laying in the gutter its a very strange 
dichotomy of emotions 
despite its humble stature the amato sometimes attracts opera 
critics from such publications as the new york times and the new 
yorker especially when it puts on operas not often performed 
elsewhere the generally favorable reviews are plastered throughout 
the theater 
unlike some large opera companies which dazzle the spectator 
initially but then sputter the amato operas production pulls the 
listener in very gradually gaining momentum as it progresses 
wrote the times tim page in a review of offenbachs tales of 
hoffman in 1986 
amato used to have more grandiose aspirations than his spot on 
the bowery 
years ago i believe i had an ambition to get to the 
metropolitan he said but not for the past 20 years because i 
know i could do more here to help the young artists get ahead and 
learn the trade

reggae has had its ups and downs over the past 
decade but frederick toots hibbert just keeps playing 
hibbert who has been making music since the early 1960s before 
the word reggae ever hit american music stores is back with his 
first lp since 1981 toots in memphis a collection of soul 
standards 
his raspy voice capable of sweetness and toughness has been 
likened to the late otis redding one of souls greatest singers 
the reggae star covers a pair of obscure redding songs ive got 
dreams to remember and hard to handle he also sings the 
rhythm n blues hit knock on wood and al greens love and 
happiness 
i always listened to al green otis and michael jackson 
stevie wonder hibbert said we are related somewhat 
reggaes most famous rhythm section sly dunbar and robbie 
shakespeare plays on the record also featured are guitarist 
teenie hodges who helped write love and happiness and andrew 
love of the memphis horns 
many of souls greatest artists including redding wilson 
pickett and aretha franklin recorded in memphis the idea for 
making an album there often had been suggested to hibbert and the 
singer finally contacted island records president chris blackwell 
to express his interest 
im not just a reggae singer hibbert explained i can 
sing anything any song rewrite the song and make it into my 
style 
thanks to young artists such as ziggy marley and maxi priest 
reggae has enjoyed a resurgence over the past year inspiring those 
who long for a return to the musics heyday of the early 1970s 
few of the stars who first made reggae internationally popular 
are still around bob marley the musics most celebrated artist 
died of cancer in 1980 peter tosh marleys onetime bandmate and a 
major performer in his own right was murdered in 1987 jimmy 
cliff whose talents were featured in the popular reggae film 
the harder they come is no longer a commercial success 
in the early 60s hibbert formed a ska trio the vikings 
with raleigh gordon and jerry mathias they quickly became one of 
jamaicas most popular acts with prince buster producing and 
hibbert leading the way on a series of local hits pain in my 
belly little flea and dog war 
the group renamed itself the maytals in 1966 and won that years 
jamaican festival song competition with bam bam hibbert 
formed a permanent niche in reggae history by giving the music its 
name in a 1968 song do the reggay 
we were just playing around hibbert recalled we used to 
have slogans jokes sometimes wed say of a girl thats not 
looking so great shes like a streggae that word was there and 
one morning i said lets do the reggae i didnt think that the 
name would last 
under the production of leslie kong the maytals entered their 
peak of popularity with a string of songs that became reggae 
standards funky kingston 5446 thats my number and 
pressure drop a featured number in the harder they come 
but hibbert was anxious to experiment with other forms of music 
covering the rock n roll oldie louie louie and a 
surprisingly danceable version of john denvers take me home 
country roads hibbert was surprised himself when he learned who 
performed the original song 
when i listened to it first i thought it was ray charles and i 
always liked ray charles sound he said i have a 
countryandwestern voice very high pitched i can find that voice 
anytime 
many reggae stars have been outspoken politically bob marleys 
active support for jamaican prime minister michael manley led to an 
assasination attempt in 1976 
priest and burning spear have each recorded tributes to the 
late black nationalist leader marcus garvey ziggy marleys latest 
album has several political songs 
but hibbert who broke up with the maytals in the early 80s 
prefers to concentrate on personal matters i dont write about 
politics the singer noted i write about naturality about 
real things that happen to real people 
one of hibberts most popular songs is love is gonna to let me 
down a heartfelt ballad 
its about a girl and im giving encouragement he said 
it can mean anybody male or female everytime i see your face 
something moves in my heart i believe in love so even if love 
lets you down love also never dies 
he also differs from other reggae musicians by not being a 
member of the rastafarian religious sect reggae got soul is a 
better way of expressing hibberts philosophy 
i know its got soul and if you got talent and soul you can 
sing it he said everybodys got soul reggae music is the 
music that carries love and good principles with it

with 80 pages of his first novel completed 
alexander stuart received some tragic news his 3yearold son 
joe was dying of cancer 
feeling a huge rage at the injustice of it stuart divided 
time between the hospital and the typewriter throwing himself into 
his work 
the book he had started was hardly a sentimental love story 
stuart wanted to write about the troubles of a seemingly normal 
middleclass english family and decided to use the teenage sons 
discovery of an affair between his father and sister as the central 
plot 
stuart had originally conceived a lowkey approach but changed 
his mind after learning of his sons illness joe stuart died in 
january at age 5 
it actually proved to be the perfect vehicle in a way to 
release my feelings because it pushed me closer to the edge 
explained stuart whose book is called the war zone 1695 
doubleday 
i wanted to write a book which would explore incest without 
being too disturbing the more i researched the more i realized 
its a very destructive process i dont think anybody could come 
out of it without being damaged 
my sons illness allowed me do it head on to try and take it 
all the way i hope its dangerous but in a responsible way i hope 
it challenges what you think and feel but at the same time feels 
true 
stuarts wife was pregnant when the writer developed the idea 
for the war zone with stuart about to become a father he 
became curious about the relationships between parents and children 
i was very fascinated by friends and their fathers and 
friends and their daughters and what seemed to be an electric 
spark i would watch the daughters with their fathers flirting 
with them and their friends i wondered what it would be like to 
have a teenage daughter 
the books narrator tom is an alienated teenager enraged with 
his father and sister and cynical about the world in general the 
34yearold stuart drew on his own disenchantment 
i think it definitely comes out of something i felt at his age 
and now he certainly does experience disillusionment hes 
horrified by what his father is doing what interested me in toms 
character was that whole area of exclusion all of us feel excluded 
at some time 
stuart born in 1955 grew up in the english town of bexley 
kent his childhood had little of the trauma suffered by tom but 
stuart learned that several people from his supposedly quiet 
hometown eventually committed suicide 
i do feel disillusioned in a sense its very hard to maintain 
in life the excitement you had at 12 13 or 14 why cant it be as 
wonderful as it seems to promise at that age i suppose thats 
partly what the books about 
he did have a sister and remembered the shifting alliances when 
confronting their parents 
we used to side against them at times at other times you sort 
of chop each other to get out of something certainly as a kid all 
of us have played our father against our mother the author said 
it seems to me the passions within the family are 
extraordinary to start with the family is the environment in which 
you tend to develop your relationship skills if you like the book 
takes it one step further 
he insisted however that the family portrayed in the war 
zone was purely fictional 
both my parents read the book and are somewhat stunned by it 
but at least they dont recognize themselves in it obviously one 
is influenced by ones childhood but i did work hard in recreating 
something fictional from my own experiences and friends i had 
spoken to 
film not writing was stuarts first love the author wrote the 
screenplays for ordeal by innocence and nicholas roegs 
insignificance and sees similarities between the written word 
and moving pictures 
i was fascinated by visual language he said i dont see 
it as a division to me its all about using the language thats 
available the camera can be used emotionally like martin 
scorceses mean streets 
when i write i think in terms of the emotion id want if it 
were in a film and than translate and get it onto the page 
he was struggling financially while writing the war zone 
but was too distressed about his son to notice 
i had a huge overdraft a huge mortgage and was really kind of 
feeling worried financially stuart said but once he was ill 
the financial problems didnt matter they became completely 
irrelevant it doesnt mean anything like seeing your son dying 
from cancer

tammy wynettes life has had as many turmoils as 
a country music song lyric 
shes had five marriages her daughter tina had meningitis as 
an infant shes had medical and painkillerdependency problems 
her house burned 256 hours of tapes for her autobiography burned 
in another fire and she filed for bankruptcy last fall 
a settlement was made in march the bankruptcy is withdrawn and 
shes able now to explain about protecting herself with chapter 11 
but wynette isnt trying to change her image as the country 
queen of hurt and lonely its often said i spoke for the wronged 
woman she says 
her current single thank the cowboy for the ride is 
cheerful she is healthy and has been happily married since 1978 
to george richey who manages her career they met 22 years ago 
when he was writing songs for her with record producer billy 
sherrill who gave her the stage name tammy to go with her middle 
name wynette she was born virginia wynette pugh 
i think thats one reason our marriage has been good and 
lasted wynette says we were buddies first we worked well 
together we could talk 
when richey and i got married billy sherrill said there 
will be no more sad songs written he was right 
but she can still sing sad songs i remember how i felt when i 
wrote the song or what was happening in my life when i first heard 
it and recorded it i couldnt get the feeling across to them the 
audience if i didnt go back and put myself in that position 
she and richey wrote only one song on her new album when a 
girl becomes a wife for her youngest daughter georgette who 
was married in march in red bay ala her older daughters are gwen 
jackie and tina who was married last year 
wynettes new album next to you her 51st for cbs does 
contain some heartbroken and wrongedwoman songs such as you 
left memories layin all over the place and liars roses 
a sad song makes you reflect back on something in your life 
that has happened you can feel part of that song she said 
she was interviewed while in new york for her first appearance 
at the bottom line wynette is on a national tour these days she 
tours 11 months a year in the united states and europe and takes 
off three weeks in december ive got a beautiful house in 
nashville and i live on a bus 
the blond singer seems to glow with health it feels good to 
feel good she said i havent had any problems since surgery 
2 years ago i had one operation and formed adhesions which 
caused the rest of the operations im one of those people who form 
scar tissue 
about filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection against 
creditors wynette said she and her husband had money in the 
development of two florida shopping centers the first sold and all 
went well when the second sold she said the money was dispersed 
to the other partners and her bank credit wasnt paid off 
they sent a federal marshal to our house they were going to 
take everything we had and we didnt owe the money she said 
i think they thought we wouldnt want my name dragged through 
fighting that whether they dragged my name through mud or not we 
had to do it they wanted 12 million if you dont owe it why 
pay it wed worked too hard to have what we had to let somebody 
take it we made a settlement of 450000 in november and didnt 
get the paperwork done until march 9 we paid them and theyre out 
of our life now 
richey said three bankers were indicted in the case 
we couldnt explain this while we were in litigation 
wynette said i had to just say yes id filed for bankruptcy 
it was horrible to have to go through it you dont think people 
will do that to you its over with thats all that matters now 
paul richey her husbands brother and ed bruce who wrote 
mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys wrote the 
current single thank the cowboy for the ride 
its a cute little song wynette said it starts he was 
pushing 7 and i was barely 5 when he rode up on his broomstick 
horse and said you want a ride it goes on hes almost 67 i 
admit to 39 when ive done it on stage old and young people love 
it 
her favorite song written with her husband is till i can make 
it on my own 
george jones and i had just divorced the song said exactly 
what i was living she and jones worked together after the 
divorce but stopped that several years ago 
hes happy im happy our daughter is happy we had magic 
years ago to try and go back and recapture that would probably be 
a mistake its probably best we leave it like it is

memories of me cbsfox video vhsbeta 8998 rated pg13 
 
memories of me is almost a completely forgettable movie 
until its final third when theres finally some action to the 
drama about a father and son trying to reconcile their years of 
estrangement 
memories is henry winklers first outting as a director and 
it shows in the movies pacing much of the beginning is plodding 
and selfconsciously slow poignant moments when young dr abbie 
polin billy crystal reflects on his callous father hang 
relentlessly on dead air 
crystal cowrote the film and added a girlfriend jobeth 
williams for himself whose role in the melodramacomedy is vague 
at times her only purpose seems to be to admire crystals 
posterior or his sexual prowess 
the plot finally gets going when abbie after suffering a mild 
heart attack treks from new york to los angeles to resolve the 
decades of paternal indifference once there he learns that his 
father abe the king of hollywood extras alan king is terminally 
ill 
they try to win a speaking part in a movie for abe and validate 
his oftrepeated claim i am an actor in the process abbie 
comes to love his curmudgeonly dad who returns the favor by 
softening enough to tell abbie he loves him too and that in his 
role as father he was simply miscast 
it gets a bit cornball after this but the ending is far more 
compelling than the beginning and worth slogging through the slow 
start

childs play mgmua home video vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
meet chucky he makes jason look like a wimp and he could take 
on freddy in any nightmare no problem 
andy barclay is a lonely lad until chucky comes into his life 
chucky is all the rage hes a good guy doll and every little boy 
has one chucky is just as cute as a button with his shock of red 
hair coveralls sneakers and wide innocent smile 
 
chucky also is a malevolent mound of plastic whose soul is pure 
evil 
it is the soul of a sadistic murderer who learns enough of a 
voodoo ritual to zap out of his body as it lay dying in a toy store 
and into the dolls so he can live forever and settle a few scores 
childs play is more than just an odyssey of revenge it is 
a chiller that will make you think twice about cuddling those ugly 
little cabbage patch kids or visiting barbies townhouse 
 
tom holland fright night who also wrote the screenplay 
with don mancini and john lafia plunges into the story with a 
fastbreak shootout in chicago between the psychotic charles lee 
ray brad dourif and police detective mike norris chris 
sarandon follows him into a toy store and slaughters ray with a 
hail of bullets ray though has one more trump card up his 
bloodied sleeve 
cut to the barclay home andy alex vincent is making breakfast 
and a major mess for his mom while he watches a good guys 
commercial on television its his way of buttering her up so he 
can get a doll for his birthday but mom just cant afford it 
later that day her friend maggie takes her to a street peddler 
whos selling one for a fraction of the actual price it is of 
course the doll ray clutched as he died 
like most children in horror movies andy perceives evil long 
before the grownups do and knows that his life must depend on his 
own wits 
holland slowly develops the horror and first unleashes it when 
maggie dinah manoff babysits for andy after ordering andy to 
bed and turning off the late night news shes surprised to 
suddenly hear the tv and see chucky sitting in a chair before the 
set 
its not quite the heartstopper the next few scenes turn out to 
be with her back to the hall maggie hears tiny footsteps rushing 
by she thinks its andy silly woman and like all babysitters in 
these flicks shes the first to go chucky hammers in her head and 
she crashes through the sixthfloor window to the street below 
another good chill scene is when karen barclay catherine hicks 
discovers the doll doesnt have any batteries in his pack and yet 
speaks with a turn almost as frightening as linda blairs head 
swirl in the exorcist chucky snarls at karen with a demonic 
sneer and tells her in some choice fourletter words exactly what 
he thinks of her 
the terrors afoot climaxing in a scene that makes the 
cuisinart bit in the gremlins look like a picnic with mary 
poppins 
holland reteams with sarandon who starred as the vampire in 
night fright sarandons socalled tough urban accent is forced 
and a distraction alex vincent is adorable in his film debut but 
the real star is chucky whos far more interesting than his human 
counterparts kevin yagher designed and supervised the operation of 
the killer doll

ein heldenleben four last songs by richard strauss vienna 
philharmonic orchestra arleen auger soprano andre previn 
conductor telarc 
 
some works are so powerful and interpretations of them so 
distinct and beautiful that it is difficult to compare other 
versions thats the problem here arleen augers recording of the 
four last songs is quite good but it must contend with the 
memorable interpretation of elizabeth schwartzkopf 
schwartzkopf sings these songs with such clarity and personality 
that its difficult for anybody else not to sound on the blander 
side of the character meter 
but theres a lot of good to be said for this disc 
auger always sings prettily except for a surprising coarseness 
in the long phrase of the words freien flugen schweben free 
flight soaring of the song beim schlafengehen time to 
sleep the american soprano also sings with an appealing 
simplicity 
strauss wrote these sometimes melancholy sometimes soaring and 
always beautiful songs the year before his death in 1949 at 86 if 
youre looking for a recording of them specifically look to 
schwartzkopf who recorded them twice for angel if youre looking 
for something from the latest crop of new releases think about 
this disc 
the vienna gives a polished and rousing performance of ein 
heldenleben and sounds great throughout previn in the songs 
keeps the long lines moving and has a sense of drama in a heros 
life

boingo alive mca oingo boingo 
 
live albums have a unique sort of energy unfortunately they 
also have crowd noise which can distract from the performance and 
discourage cranking of the volume knob 
oingo boingo a veteran eightpiece band with a reputation of 
being better on stage than on record has overcome the problem of 
unwelcome audience participation with boingo alive the double 
album was recorded live but on a soundstage sans audience the 
strategy works the music has the spark of a live performance and 
captures oingo boingo at its best 
the band careens at a breathless pace through 10 years of 
material delivering 21 songs on the lp 30 on compact disc two 
are tunes never previously recorded 
alive naturally kicks off with dead mans party leave 
your body and soul at the door led by a threepiece horn 
section the boingos quickly establish a killer groove other 
highlights include the rocking just another day a guitar tour 
de force the catchy call of distress private life a hit in 
1982 and only makes me laugh which shows off the bands great 
singing 
lead vocalist danny elfman is the big star although some of his 
mannerisms make you wonder if hes really freddie mercury after 
all when is the last time you saw or heard anything about the 
singer for queen anyway this is a great primer from a good band 
and about half the cuts are capable of charring your turntable

prince myshkin slumps back in his chair lifting a 
shawl from behind him and pulling it over his shoulders he slips 
on a pair of earrings and with a smooth shift in bearing and 
expression and no other props transforms onstage into the 
glamorous heroine nastasya 
tamasaburo bando one of japans most popular kabuki stars 
performs the remarkable change between male and female characters 
in nastasya a play based on dostoevskys novel the idiot 
directed by the awardwinning polish filmmaker andrzej wajda 
for the 38yearold tamasaburo playing more than one role is 
nothing new hes handled as many as seven in a single kabuki drama 
but as an onnagata or actor who plays womens roles in the 
maleonly world of kabuki performers tamasaburo finds the role of 
prince myshkin more difficult than the transformation into a woman 
at first i felt awkward because ive always played women in 
the past he said in an interview i felt like i was wearing 
another layer of clothes and western clothes at that 
in the play an adaptation of the last chapter of the idiot 
myshkin and his rival rogozhin reminisce over their past with 
nastasya who lies dead behind a curtain murdered by the impulsive 
rogozhin 
in a series of flashbacks tamasaburo changes back and forth 
between the epileptic myshkin and alluring nastasya only at the 
end of the play does he wear a dress after a kabukilike 
lightningquick costume change offstage 
wajda staged the play in poland in 1977 using just the two male 
characters with nastasya only mentioned in the dialogue but in 
1980 while visiting japan the polish director saw tamasaburo 
perform a womans role in la dame aux camellias and decided to 
ask him to portray the roles of both myshkin and nastasya in a 
japanese production 
i dont know of any other actor who would give me the chance 
to create both male and female roles on stage without any change in 
makeup or costume wajda said when the play opened 
at a recent performance the audience sat almost motionless 
through the twohour singleact drama the gloomy stage the size 
of a large living room is surrounded by the theaters 160 seats 
none more than a few feet away wajda chose the small theater to 
preserve the dark oppressive mood of dostoevskys writing 
kabuki is really a kind of enjoyable show with dramatic 
colors dance and music tamasaburo said in that way its 
entirely different from dostoevskys heaviness but my goal in both 
is to link hearts with the audience 
to prepare for the part of nastasya tamasaburo watched old 
american movies carefully studying the gestures and movements of 
such actresses as claudette colbert and greta garbo 
despite wajda and tamasaburos disparate backgrounds and 
language barrier wajda directed the play in polish though the 
dialogue was in japanese tamasaburo says they communicated well 
i could barely understand what he was saying but peoples 
feelings are expressed not only by words he said 
wajda is best known for political movies such as ashes and 
diamonds about poland during world war ii and man of iron 
made during the solidarity trade unions strike at gdansk shipyard 
i think for him the link between peoples hearts and art is 
the most important thing tamasaburo said because he grew up 
in poland he was forced to become involved with politics 
tamasaburo is graceful in his movements elegant and many fans 
say beautiful his popularity resembles that of a movie star or 
popular singer and his fan club attracts both men and women 
like many kabuki actors his rigid training began at age six 
as a child i was interested in anything to do with theater 
my parents told me that if i were going to perform in japan then i 
should become a kabuki actor 
the training included dance classical singing musical 
instruments flower arranging tea ceremony and calligraphy 
because kabuki is closely linked to the arts every major role 
involves performing one of the arts he said 
in 1970 at age 20 tamasaburo stunned japanese audiences with 
his portrayal of lady macbeth in a production of the shakespeare 
play becoming only the second kabuki actor to play a female role 
in a western drama since the meiji period more than 75 years ago 
he performs with the stage name tamasaburo bando v a 
combination of the names of previous accomplished actors granted 
in recognition of his abilities 
kabukis history is traced back to 1603 the beginning of 
japans 250 years of selfimposed isolation when a female shrine 
attendant in kyoto led an outdoor performance of dance and mime by 
a predominately female cast to raise money for shrine repairs 
the theatrical form boomed among common people but the tokugawa 
military shogunate in 1629 banned females from appearing in kabuki 
after performances became increasingly erotic and linked to 
prostitution 
today many japanese believe that kabuki onnagata are better 
than women at portraying classic feminine grace and beauty 
ive played women for 30 years so i can switch to a female 
character whenever i want like switching to a foreign language 
tamasaburo said 
its a matter of association when i put on the shawl i 
think im a woman and unconsciously begin acting like one then 
when i take off the shawl i return to being myself

melissa etheridge may have attended the 
prestigious berklee college of music in boston but shes getting 
her education in a series of onenight stops in crowded music clubs 
across the country 
its been an eyeopening experience for many music fans too 
the emotionally intense rocker whose debut album last year was 
largely overlooked in a flood of records by female 
singersongwriters is building a following with energetic live 
shows that are quickly selling out through word of mouth 
looking back i like how it happened said the 27yearold 
etheridge shortly before stepping on stage for another soldout 
show but when im there and in it i was thinking why isnt 
this getting noticed 
maybe it was the downbeat tone of her sparesounding first 
album fueled by stories of jealousy and rejection in love her 
vivid songwriting also teeters on the edge of cliche with 
prominent fire and steel metaphors 
but her concerts are a revelation which a national audience 
learned when she sang her grammynominated bring me some water 
on the national awards show in february 
the tiny etheridge bounces across the stage belting out her 
songs in a gruff voice that recalls tina turner and fixing her 
audience with a piercing stare and smile increasingly audience 
members are shouting her lyrics back at her 
etheridge grew up in leavenworth kan and was given her first 
guitar at age 8 like many in her generation one of her first 
musical memories was listening to the beatles i want to hold 
your hand through a transistor radio 
her parents didnt dissuade her from a musical career her 
father even drove her to performances before she got her drivers 
license but said if she was serious she had to get a serious 
education so they sent her to berklee 
i learned some things but for what i do it wasnt all that 
useful she said of her formal music education i knew it was a 
way out of a small town 
she knew the real way to learn her craft was to take her 
acoustic guitar onstage etheridge did that in boston and later in 
the los angeles area where island records founder chris blackwell 
spotted her in a tiny long beach club and signed her to a contract 
etheridge swears it wasnt a conscious decision to put out a 
record that deals almost exclusively with the dark side of love 
it wasnt until after i recorded them and sat down and 
listened to them 1 through 10 that i said people are going to 
think im pretty upset about something she said 
on bring me some water etheridge is burning alive with 
jealousy over a lover whos abandoned her for another the anger on 
like the way i do is directed outward with etheridge asking an 
old flame whether a new lover can shock and electrify and rock 
you like the way i do 
all of her songs are autobiographical the ones on her first 
album traced from a dark period in her life she said 
i was in a real learning situation she said i was 
learning a lot about relationships and my career it was a whole 
lot of things going on at once im a little older now ive 
learned some of those lessons now 
etheridge jokes about her image during concert appearances 
everywhere i go people ask me melissa why are you so sad 
i tell them im not so sad she says with a sly grin im just 
experienced 
her unreleased material which accounts for about half her live 
show doesnt stray much from her basic sound but many of the 
songs are cheerier and encouragingly even stronger than those on 
her debut 
etheridges second album with the working title brave and 
crazy is already recorded and is scheduled for release this fall 
shell be on the road for most of the summer usually as an opening 
act for little feat 
her track record on the road is even surprising some veteran 
promoters jim koplik a promoter for cross country concerts in 
connecticut and upstate new york said etheridge sold out three 
separate venues at least three weeks in advance usually with 
little advance publicity 
her grammy performance was one of the few good grammy 
performances this year he said shes a tough rock n roller 
and there arent too many females who are tough rock n rollers 
out there 
etheridge admitted she practiced a grammy acceptance speech in 
her shower she didnt win tina turner took the award in the 
female rock category but she said she was pleasantly surprised 
just to be noticed 
my goals are just to get better she said i want to write 
better i want to sing better i want to perform better success to 
me is the opportunity to just keep doing what i love to do knowing 
ive made my second album means ive been successful with my first 
one 
the lack of instant album sales makes the current success all 
the more satisfying she said 
the biggest selling point of this album was a friend telling a 
friend word of mouth etheridge said thats the way i buy 
most of my music from a friend telling me its something good it 
takes a lot longer that way but you can really see it multiply

ward justs latest novel of political intrigue is 
drawing critical acclaim and focusing attention on its 
formerjournalist author which raises an interesting question 
does success mean waking up to discover one has become at 
least partly the character one wrote about 
for just former newsweek and washington post reporter and son 
of an illinois publishing family the answer is yes and no 
all my books really have to do with people who have two lives 
a private life and a public life just said in a recent 
interview over coffee and cigarettes in a michigan avenue cafe i 
mean a public life in the way that say you and i dont have a 
public life i didnt used to have one i guess im getting one now 
when you are in that kind of world half public half private 
and the two things bear on each other it makes the choices a 
little more difficult and often a whole lot more interesting 
than sort of ordinary people and since we live in this world of 
glaring media attention that makes anybody who is involved in that 
kind of life a very modern man 
jack gance is justs 12th book and he is quick to point out 
he is not the title character 
the book examines the life of chicagoborn jack gance son of a 
successful real estate developer who winds up disgraced and jailed 
in a scandal gance parlays his university of chicago education and 
contacts and his accumen for deciphering the numbers of politics 
to land work in the early 1960s with the operatives in the citys 
political machine 
gance becomes an operative himself he moves to the white house 
new locale same job of making things happen the book ends with 
gance making a successful bid for the senate from illinois the 
private man becomes public 
that is the background and as just pointed out jack gance 
is a book about politics with a small p 
its a novel with politics as its background he said you 
know it could have just as easily been with the army retailing 
the news business i just chose politics because its a world that 
interests me and i know a little bit about it almost entirely from 
my experience as a journalist 
the politics of jack gance are more the politics of people 
than of parties 
as the book explores gances troubled relationship with his 
father and the attraction for a workaholic lawyers wife jack 
gance throughout examines the motives of its central character 
looking for what propels him to make his choices 
the show politics in washington is very attractive to an 
illinois boy like jack or like me just said i think it is a 
book maybe more about attractions than about compromise what 
attracts people 
and i want to explore also in this country this large 
capitalist country the nature of work what work does to people 
the kind of work that you have what bearing that has on your 
character and what bearing your character has on your work the 
author said 
what just finds is that compromise is more symmetrical than 
defiance that loyalty has its rewards at a price it is laid out 
in the last lines of the book when he writes that washington was 
a great city always giving more than it received it gave and gave 
and gave and gave and expected nothing in return except loyalty 
loyalty just said is the greatest thing that can be given 
to expect nothing except loyalty well that is expecting 
everything that is what hes given and his reward is the united 
states senate what he gives in return is his loyalty to this 
really rather appalling system 
just is looking for the novel to build a more loyal readership 
nine of his 12 books are out of print and he hopes that success 
with jack gance will help get the books back into print 
the gestation period for justs books is about two years he 
said he works from a base in paris where he lives with his wife 
and is planning a book about a group of americans in paris 
ive always worked very well in foreign countries 
particularly foreign countries where i didnt speak the language 
just said i sort of like to work on the margins like that and 
its fun for me to be in paris not even speaking the language very 
well 
it enhances something i cant even say what

adversity has taught country singer lacy 
j dalton about being positive in her life 
and her new lp survivor sums it up 
i am a survivor this was a healing process she said 
ive learned that no matter how tough things get and how 
unfairly you think you are being treated if you get your mind off 
that if you think about your goals and feel you can attain them 
things turn around for you a lot faster 
dalton began a country music career five years after her husband 
died in a swimming pool accident in 1974 she was 27 and had an 
infant son food stamps and a brief stint as a topless dancer 
helped them get by 
determined and dedicated she launched her career and was voted 
most promising female vocalist in 1980 by the academy of country 
music 
although she had hits with such tunes as 16th avenue and 
hillbilly girl with the blues her career slipped and until 
this year she had not cut an album for three years 
but 1989 brought an upswing the new universal records signed 
her and released survivor shes back on the country singles 
charts with the heart and im a survivor shes also 
recorded a duet with glen campbell woodcarver 
and on valentines day she married aaron anderson her tour 
manager for the past four years 
i felt like a big arm had been put around me she says about 
her new recording contract still the huskyvoiced 42yearold 
performer adds im a little scared 
born jill byrem into a musical family in bloomsburg pa 
daltons songs often are about hope and strength and are frequently 
aimed at women 
i never sing from a negative point of view she said i 
try to look for something to entertain or enlighten or uplift the 
underlying emphasis on everything im doing is to be positive 
i think about women a lot i feel that they can open doors if 
you feel you are equal you automatically are treated that way the 
most important thing to me is if i can believe the song if its 
real to me will i want to be singing this song for 20 years 
despite her emphasis on looking at the bright side she felt 
compelled to quit recording for three years because of a dispute 
with her former record label it came down to a matter of 
principle with dalton contending that her work was not being 
promoted enough 
careers come and go in three years she said my lawyer 
told me i was committing career suicide management went crazy and 
everyone went nuts but it was the only thing i knew to do 
honorably to save the career in the long run 
she says universal took a chance by offering her a contract 
when you havent been heard from in a major way for a few 
years its like starting the career all over again she said 
a lot of people have come in since i went out a lot of fans 
dont know who i am i am so grateful and amazed they universal 
would give me a home and a shelter i hope i can be worthy 
it had been a long long time since i had a big hit i didnt 
know if anyone would be interested in signing me 
one of the country singers who became very successful during 
daltons hiatus was kt oslin who has had no 1 hit records with 
candid femaleoriented songs such as 80s ladies and hold 
me 
i love her work dalton said 80s ladies was one of the 
best records i ever heard when i heard it i went halleluiah 
praise god she has tremendous honesty and courage 
there is so much young talent thats come in since i started 
in 1979 they have fresh ideas and wonderful talent people coming 
in now are very sophisticated and very polished

fire ant colonies with hundreds of 
queens are making it harder for people to get rid of the pests than 
the previously found colonies with only one queen experts say 
when a queen dies in a singlequeen nest the whole nest 
dies said mike glancy of the us agriculture departments 
agricultural research service but with multiplequeen mounds 
they just scatter the workers do not have loyalty to a single 
queen and will accept any queen 
the development also means four times as many ants and almost 
one solid ant nest said entomologist phil koehler of the 
university of floridas institute of food and agricultural sciences 
an ifasusda study in ocala found 30 to 40 fire ant mounds per 
acre in the days of single queens now there are 5000 mounds per 
acre about every 5 feet with 200 queens per mound 
multiplequeen fire ants live in greater concentrations and are 
more aggressive in hunting for food than singlequeen fire ants 
they have been known to attack sick people in hospital beds and the 
nipples of nursing goats 
this is a more aggressive insect which means more human 
contact which means more health problems glancy said fire ants 
also cause trouble by eating foam expansion joints in highways and 
insulation in machinery 
queens from multiplequeen nests fly eight to 10 miles on their 
mating flights compared to a halfmile for queens from 
singlequeen nests 
multiplequeen fire ants were discovered in 1981 in louisiana 
and in ocala and texas in 1983 since then multiple queen colonies 
have spread throughout florida and are found all over the 
southeast koehler said that as singlequeen colonies are killed 
off it clears the way for the multiplequeen nests 
fire ants were accidentally imported from brazil and argentina 
in the 1920s and 1940s in the ballast of ships

a good railroad tie can withstand 30 years 
of freight trains and snow storms but only a few weeks with 
scientist poo chow 
chow a university of illinois professor of wood science 
delivers a concentrated dose of mother natures fury we soak 
them and make them swell we dry them and make them shrink we put 
them in the freezer to simulate winter and in the oven to simulate 
summer 
a dozen treatments produce the kind of cracking splitting and 
rotting a tie would show after 40 years on the track 
we are all looking for a tie that will last longer and give us 
some economic savings said don gallery roadway engineer for the 
illinois central railroad he said chows research should tell 
railroads how ties made from new types of woods will hold up over 
long periods 
the nations railroads spike their steel track to more than 1 
billion ties blocks of wood about eight inches square and eight 
feet long they transfer the weight of the trains to the roadbed 
and keep the tracks at the correct angle so trains dont derail 
there is a tie every 19 inches 
a typical tie made of domestic wood and treated with creosote 
to preserve it lasts about 30 years depending on climate and 
traffic evaluating new tie materials on the track is impractical 
so chow with financial support from the association of american 
railroads devised a lab to simulate weathering and the effects of 
squeezing bending and movement of spikes 
raymond wingard executive director of the railway tie 
association in mars pa said chows tests will tell railroads 
which ties offer the best service potential so they can be tested 
further in the field 
two promising woods are tough oak varieties from west africa and 
southeast asia chow said he predicted domestic wood will continue 
to be used for most ties though the preservative may change 
because of environmental concerns

women on welfare have fewer children than other 
women do despite a popular impression to the contrary a new study 
suggests 
the economic social and psychological costs of becoming 
pregnant and having a child while on public assistance are 
perceived as clearly outweighing the benefits wrote researcher 
mark rank 
the assistant professor of sociology at washington university in 
st louis presents his results in the april issue of the american 
sociological review 
working from a sample of 2796 wisconsin households drawn 
randomly from those receiving welfare benefits rank studied 
fertility among 965 women ages 18 to 44 he also interviewed 29 
women 
analysis showed that for every 1000 women in his sample 458 
women gave birth per year that fertility rate is substantially 
lower than the rates of 753 for wisconsin women in general and 
711 for the national population in 1980 which corresponds to the 
time covered by his analysis rank said 
in an interview he said wisconsin was a likely place to find a 
potential impact from welfare because its benefits were relatively 
generous his report cautioned however that the study focused on 
only one state 
he also noted that the work did not address the question of 
whether public assistance programs encourage women not on welfare 
to have a child in order to collect benefits 
mary jo bane a professor of public policy at harvard 
universitys john f kennedy school of government said ranks 
study looks to me like a good piece of research and the findings 
seem to be plausible 
bane who has studied the impact of welfare on families said 
previous research gave no reason to believe women on welfare have 
higher fertility rates but the finding of a lower rate at least 
in wisconsin was a surprise she said

talks between libyas national oil corp 
and five us oil companies on resuming operations in the north 
african country are deadlocked the middle east economic survey 
reported 
it said monday that the negotiations which began in vienna last 
month are continuing with both sides aiming for an agreement by 
june 30 the deadline set by the libyans 
but the respected nicosiabased oil industry newsletter noted 
that the libyans are unhappy with us sanctions that ban american 
technology exports to libya and imports of libyan oil 
the five companies marathon oil co conoco inc amerada hess 
corp occidental petroleum corp and wr grace amp co all have 
equity holdings in libya 
the negotiations began after the jan19 decision by 
thenpresident ronald reagan to modify trade sanctions imposed on 
libya in 1986 because of col moammar gadhafis alleged support for 
international terrorism 
the us companies assets in libya were frozen when the 
sanctions were imposed and the companies face seizure of the assets 
by the libyans if no agreement is reached by june 30 
the libyans are particularly interested in securing us 
expertise and technology for their oil industry amid tripolis 
efforts to expand exploration and production 
but they see no advantage in taking back the us companies if 
they are not allowed to import american oilfield equipment and 
technological services the survey reported 
the newsletter also noted that libya does not want to see the 
americans shipping crude to europe libyas main market if the 
companies resume operations 
the libyans would like a full unconditional return by the 
companies concerned supported by a clear us commitment on the 
matter and freedom to ship libyan crude to the us market the 
survey said 
however it seems unlikely that such us clearance will be 
forthcoming in the near future given that the department of 
treasury office of foreign assets control has shown no flexibility 
and libya is not high on the agenda of president bushs current 
priorities the newsletter said

the pacific stock exchange plans to file an 
application with the commodity futures trading commission for 
permission to establish a futures market for computer chips 
dale carlson spokesman for the san franciscobased pacific 
stock exchange said monday that the exchange also plans a cash 
chip market the application is to be submitted to the federal 
agency within two weeks 
the exchange appears to be competing with the minneapolisbased 
twin cities board of trade to set up the first chipfutures and 
cash markets in the united states 
last week the twin cities exchange said it hopes to open a cash 
chip market in the fourth quarter of this year and a futures market 
in 1990 
the pacific stock exchange plans to open both markets in the 
first quarter of 1990 according to carlson 
chipfutures trading on the pse would involve critical computer 
memory devices called drams each contract would consist of 1000 
chips 
a cash market would help buyers find the lowest price for chips 
the computer industry has recently experienced problems tied to 
escalating chip prices 
calson while saying pse officials have not seen the minneapolis 
boards plans said the san francisco exchange is better suited to 
chip futures trading because of its location near the nations top 
computer manufacturing area he also cited the pses 100year 
history 
our location near silicon valley and our position as a gateway 
to the pacific rim gives us some strategic advantages said 
carlson 
federal law does not bar two exchanges from trading futures for 
the same product but the market has traditionally gravitated to 
one exchange only 
a buyer and seller under a futures contract agree to exchange a 
given amount of a product for a set price at some time in the 
future the contracts are usually for three six or nine months and 
can be bought for little money down 
the contracts allow buyers and sellers to hedge against future 
price fluctuations because they are guaranteed a set price

the weekly tally of oil and gas rigs operating in 
the united states continued its yearlong seesaw trend with this 
weeks count posting a gain of 12 to total 749 according to baker 
hughes inc 
last week the nationwide count plunged by 34 a year ago the 
count totaled 905 
the gain this week came despite a drop of 19 rigs in oklahoma 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs actively 
producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
besides oklahomas 19rig decline pennsylvania and wyoming were 
among the major oil producing states to show a rig loss each down 
one in the latest count 
louisiana and michigan each gained six while ohio was up three

isosceles plc a consortium of dissatisfied 
british institutional shareholders in gateway corp plc on tuesday 
raised its hostile bid for the british food retailer to 187 
billion pounds 29 billion 
gateway holders can choose between 210 pence 330 in cash per 
share or 195 pence 306 in cash plus at least 15 pence 24 
cents worth of stock in isosceles 
the new offer compares with the original cash offer of 17 
billion pounds 27 billion or 195 pence 306 per share 
which was launched on april 18 
isosceles a company formed specifically to make the bid for 
gateway said the new offer wouldnt be increased unless another 
bidder for gateway emerged 
gateway shares rose on the announcement gaining 75 pence 12 
cents to 2045 pence 321 by midafternoon on londons stock 
exchange the shares had been trading above 195 pence 306 in 
recent trading sessions in anticipation of a higher bid 
isosceles is seeking to split gateway by selling its nonfood 
interests and its larger stores the consortium already has a firm 
agreement to sell 62 of the larger stores to asda group plc 
another british retailer for 702 million pounds 11 billion 
the remaining gateway interests would then be privately held by 
the isosceles consortium which aims to float its shares on the 
london stock exchange within the next three to five years 
as a result the isosceles stock offered under the revised bid 
would be unlisted though the consortium said the shares would be 
freely transferable 
isosceles said the revised offer could involve the issue of as 
much as 52 percent of isosceles share capital in addition if the 
bid succeeds isosceles plans to issue as much as 15 percent of its 
stock to gateway managers as part of a scheme of share option 
incentives

pan am corp announced today it has secured bank 
financing for its proposed 36 billion bid for nwa inc the 
parent of northwest airlines and the target of a bidding contest 
in an announcement pan am stated it has received commitments 
from five banks bankers trust co citibank first national bank 
of chicago morgan guaranty trust co and security pacific national 
bank 
pan am declined to specify the amount of the banks commitments 
sources close to the company however said it exceeded the 16 
billion which pan am said last week it was seeking 
these commitments together with the equity commitment of at 
least 400 million from prudentialbache and the airlie group will 
enable pan am to put forward a very attractive offer to the 
shareholders of nwa pan am chairman thomas plaskett said in the 
statement 
northwest public relations spokesman bob gibbons said today the 
airline would have no immediate comment on the pan am announcement 
nwa meanwhile prepared to open bids from suitors for the 
company nwa had set a 3 pm cdt deadline today for takeover 
offers and said last week that it planned on a single round of 
bidding the nwa board of directors however could decide not to 
accept any of the bids and some analysts say the process could 
start over if a higher bid came in later 
sources close to pan am said the company planned to submit its 
takeover proposal to nwa by the deadline 
once the bids are in a committee of four outside directors must 
scrutinize each offer a complex financial proposal that must 
include not just a price per share but a host of details about who 
is providing equity or loans how much and in what form as well as 
the purchasers plans for nwa once it is bought 
an nwa spokesman has said the board may issue a decision by the 
end of june 
other likely bidders for nwa include oil billionaire marvin 
davis whose first offer of 272 billion was rejected and an 
investment group led by financier al checchi 
after davis made his bid the nwa board said it would explore 
restructuring alternatives the board said last thursday it had 
appointed a special committee to oversee that process 
possible alternatives include acquisition of another company a 
partial or complete liquidation of the airline a repurchase of 
shares a special dividend or a sale of equity to third parties 
plaskett has said he is not contemplating layoffs of union 
employees at northwest which is much larger than pan am 
cooperation from northwests unions is considered crucial to the 
bid 
industry analysts have been cautious about pan ams prospects 
because of its 900 million in debt 535 million in outstanding 
pension liabilities and continuing losses 
in a meeting last week with investment fund managers plaskett 
outlined plans for pan ams bid which would include the sale of 
highyield notes and bank financing for the 36 billion package 
he said the offer would be all cash and fully financed 
plaskett told investors he plans no sales of operating assets 
and no sale or leaseback of existing planes 
he said he is not assuming any revenue from a sale of 
northwests japanese real estate but expects to save 240 million 
by streamlining the new carriers corporate headquarters marketing 
operation maintenance and other support services

in perhaps no other industry must the producer 
obtain permission from regulators for each individual unit of 
production housing in other words is a very highly regulated 
industry 
housing is also expensive for most people it is the most costly 
item of a lifetime for young couples it is the biggest financial 
hurdle of their lives regulations have a lot to do with that 
situation 
could something be done to lower such costs such as reducing 
regulations 
certainly regulations that proliferate at the local level could 
be thinned out will it be done probably not or if so only by 
bits and pieces 
previous attempts at least have always met with frustration 
there are good and necessary regulations and poor and undesirable 
regulations and no way to separate the two types without endless 
battles in thousands of communities 
still the idea of less regulation is always on the minds of 
builders and their representatives for a simple reason any price 
cut can be translated into more sales and bigger profits to say 
nothing about making housing affordable 
seeking to determine what savings might result from a relaxation 
of local regulations the joint venture for affordable housing a 
program involving the industry and state and local officials 
conducted demonstration projects 
reviewing the results the experimenters concluded that the 
average savings per unit in land and construction cost was 8573 
with the range of savings differing markedly from place to place 
in portland ore for example unit savings amounted to 15647 
for homes in a price range of 50000 to 55000 in elkhart city 
ind the savings amounted to only 855 on a home priced to sell 
between 37500 to 54920 
in general according to the national association of home 
builders the savings were found in four categories 
land use regulations mainly about density development 
standards such as road width sewers and sidewalks construction 
methods such as in allowing new materials and wider spacing of 
studs and streamlined paper processing 
most of the savings in the first category were a result of 
allowing more units to be built on the same amount of land 
reducing not only the land cost per unit but the cost per lot for 
streets and sidewalks 
in some instances local agencies may insist on questionable 
development practices such as requiring suburban residential 
streets to meet the same standards as urban thoroughfares with 
square curbs and wide sidewalks 
do such requirements serve the neighborhood perhaps but maybe 
not wide streets for example may encourage more through traffic 
and higher speeds raising the danger to children playing in the 
neighborhood 
while most localities base their local codes on national models 
they often exercize their right to add amendments or adopt only 
parts that suit them there could also be a bias against 
innovations in materials and techniques 
the home builders report also suggests that economic interests 
and social preferences of existing residents often favor 
limitations to growth sometimes limiting new construction to very 
expensive homes 
in fact it suggests some local regulations wouldnt stand up 
in court but it concedes that the fact they are illegal doesnt 
mean they are not present and effective 
obviously however most local regulations are necessary and 
beneficial for all parties involved in the absence of regulations 
chaotic competition would develop among builders hurting them the 
buyers and the communities 
if there is an answer to the regulatory problem nobody has yet 
stumbled on it it is an allamerican problem snarled in the 
grassroots peculiarities of 9000 local agencies it is democracy 
at its best and worst

most grain and soybean futures prices closed 
lower tuesday on the chicago board of trade 
analysts said a strong us dollar and expectations for more of 
the wet weather that touched key growing areas over the recent 
threeday holiday weekend affected prices 
traders coming off last weeks lifeofcontract lows began the

and soybean regions and wheat opened lower in sympathy

europe 
i think its a good thing the president said its good 
for nato i happen to think its good for the entire free world 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said the summit paved the way 
for a historic chance for realistic and significant arms control 
progress 
british prime minister margaret thatcher kohls main european 
antagonist in the missile flap said she was very very 
satisfied with the agreement on shortrange missiles it was she 
said a pretty tight document 
french president francois mitterrand described the meetings 
results as very positive and felipe gonzalez spains prime 
minister said european unity is reaffirmed 
the germans entered the summit demanding immediate negotiations 
with the sovietled warsaw pact to reduce shortrange nuclear 
missiles in europe 
us and british officials said attention should be focused 
first on slashing the easts enormous superiority in conventional 
arms in newly opened talks in vienna between nato and the warsaw 
pact 
they also worried that entering into those negotiations would 
inevitably lead to outright elimination of the missiles known in 
military jargon as the third zero nato contends it needs a 
nuclear arsenal to offset the easts massive conventional force 
after discussions lasting until early tuesday nato foreign 
ministers fashioned a compromise 
the allies said they would make every effort to bring the 
vienna talks to an early and satisfactory conclusion possibly 
within six months to a year 
once implementation of such an accord has begun the united 
states is prepared to enter into negotiations to achieve a 
partial reduction of shortrange nuclear missiles to equal 
levels the word partial was underlined 
there will be no third zero partial means partial bush 
insisted at a news conference 
the leaders also said reductions in shortrange missiles will 
not be carried out until the results of these conventional 
negotiations have been implemented 
they agreed that the troublesome question of deploying a new 
more powerful generation of surfacetosurface nuclear missiles 
will be dealt with in 1992 in the light of overall security 
developments 
they said they recognize the value of the american effort to 
develop a replacement to the aging lance missile the weapon was 
introduced in 1972 and military analysts say it will become 
obsolete in 1995 
the united states wanted a strong endorsement from the allies 
for its development program kohl worried about the survival of 
his centerright government wanted to delay a decision on 
production of the missile until after important elections next year 
in germany 
the leaders reaffirmed that their strategy for deterrence was 
based on a mix of adequate and effective nuclear and conventional 
forces 
where nuclear forces are concerned land sea and airbased 
systems including groundbased missiles in the present 
circumstances and as far as can be foreseen will be needed in 
europe they said 
overshadowed by the arms control push was a set of guidelines 
for encouraging the enormous changes under way in the soviet union 
and eastern europe 
we welcome the current reforms that have already led to 
greater openness improved respect for human rights active 
participation of the individual and new attitudes in foreign 
policy the leaders said in a separate statement but much 
remains to be done 
they called on the east to tear down the physical and political 
walls separating europeans simplify border crossings and allow the 
free movement of people and information 
the nato allies said they will try to increase contacts among 
individuals in the east and west and seek more economic and trade 
ties

the stakes are a lot higher than they were in the 
days of sutters mill or the klondike rush but gold fever still 
drew hundreds to an international gold show that began tuesday 
anyone expecting the grizzled prospectors of yore might be 
disappointed though to find that modernday goldbugs often 
dress in pinstriped suits and care more about geophysics and 
electromagnetics than grubhoes and hammers 
despite their formal appearance however many of the mining 
company officials at the exposition said that those who devote 
their lives to the pursuit of gold are still a breed apart 
youre like a detective unraveling the secrets of mother 
nature said robert s middleton president of tarzan gold inc 
which mines gold and mineral deposits in canada but the old guys 
are kind of being phased out theyre being replaced by unemployed 
geologists 
gold miners from companies with names like galactic resources 
inc pegasus gold and rayrock yellowknife swapped tales of 
hightech mining practices like induced polarization they also 
attended lectures on such diverse topics as how to develop a 
mine and platinum star of the metals market 
but middleton and others who staked their claims behind display 
booths at the boston gold show were on the lookout for investors in 
what has been a lean period for gold 
the price of gold has been down for three years after a boom 
period on tuesday it hovered near 363 an ounce on world markets 
as a result said some gold analysts at the exposition many 
smaller companies that deal in precious metals are in precarious 
financial health while the approximately 20 major companies have 
been expanding 
gold may be in more of a bear market but the spirits of mining 
company officials tuesday were still upbeat 
were risktakers optimistic people said robert dickinson 
president of continental gold corp which discovered a major 
deposit outside vancouver british columbia in november 1988 that 
has so far yielded 4 million ounces of gold 
for some perspective south africa the worlds largest producer 
of gold produced about 60 million of ounces last year according 
to industry officials the soviet union is the worlds 
secondlargest producer followed by canada the united states and 
australia are tied for fourth place officials said 
dickinson said most of the miners and investors who attend 
expositions like the gold show consider themselves goldbugs 
a goldbug is a person who believes that because of all the 
problems in the world that an investment in gold is a protection 
against collapse and the foundation of all money said dickinson 
but its also someone who has gold fever 
these days high technology has made mining for gold far more 
sophisticated than what took place during the gold rushes in 
northern california in 1849 or in the yukon territory in 1898 
but much of the work that goes into finding a new vein is still 
backbreaking labor and surprisingly primitive 
the actual staking of the claim is pretty barbaric said 
douglas martin a miner and geologist with tarzan gold 
as martin as others explained it modern prospectors begin to 
scout possible locations by using government maps of areas near 
known gold fields then they walk the bush in chosen areas 
using simple tools to clear away brush and scrape rock outcroppings 
once they have found a likely location they use what they call 
airborne geophysical instruments mounted in aircraft to measure 
electromagnetic fields that may signal the presence of precious 
metals in the bush below 
if the sensors pick up evidence of gold the miners return to 
the ground they stake out their claim by walking a 40acre site 
and placing a post in four corners that are each 1320 feet apart 
after they receive mineral rights to the spot they go in with 
backhoes and bulldozers and drill for gold 
and when they strike gold the feeling is timeless the miners 
said 
its really a thrill said middleton who still remembers 
the dimension of a major deposit in gold he found after drilling 
one hole in ontario it was 98 feet of 256 ounces of gold he 
said

gail gentry whose lower back was crushed when 
a mine roof caved in 11 years ago pushed his wheelchair in front 
of a caravan of massive coal trucks and held a sign saying 
pittston stole my health card 
im taking a stand against an immoral company and against an 
immoral act the 42yearold miner said last week just before he 
became the 2000th person arrested in the united mine workers 
strike against pittston coal group 
such nonviolent tactics have won the union public sympathy but 
little movement at the bargaining table with the strike involving 
nearly 1700 miners entering its eighth week and federally mediated 
negotiations set to resume wednesday officials of the union and 
the company virginias largest coal producer say they are 
prepared for a lengthy battle 
this thing is a long way from being over umw strike 
coordinator marty hudson said 
morale though remains high among the striking miners who dress 
uniformly in camouflage and head every day to the coal fields 
located in virginias southwestern tip 
miners have brought their wives and children along and the 
atmosphere on the main picket line is festive at times 
during a recent demonstration a few dozen picketers with a 
banjo and mandolin setting the pace for flatfoot dancers joined in 
a stanza criticizing the companys withdrawal of some health 
benefits from their modified tune of oh susannah 
the music stopped when a handful of burly miners and their wives 
sat down in the road to block a caravan of coal trucks from 
entering pittstons processing plant 
as state troopers arrested the demonstrators the crowd sang 
we shall overcome 
on wednesday a dozen priests nuns and church activists were 
arrested in sitdown demonstrations 
the miners went on strike april 5 after working 14 months 
without a contract they claim the company which refused to go 
along with an industrywide umw agreement is trying to break the 
union by reducing job security and setting up an independent 
pension fund 
pittston officials say they want to maintain a union shop but 
under its own rules to provide labor flexibility such as increased 
subcontracting and sevenday work weeks to meet growing 
competition from nonunion and foreign companies 
both sides say the outcome of the strike could affect future 
contract negotiations throughout the coal industry 
negotiators from both sides are scheduled to meet with 
representatives of the federal mediation and conciliation service 
wednesday after taking a break last week 
union officials and industry analysts say there is little chance 
the federal mediators will reach a settlement in part because they 
are not empowered to arbitrate a binding agreement 
if were going to win this strike were going to win it right 
here hudson said gesturing to the crowd of several hundred 
picketers 
pittston president michael odom referring to the industrywide 
contract negotiated by the bituminous coal operators association 
said the union is dead set on cramming that bcoa agreement down 
our throats 
were not going to take it if the unions going to stick to 
that position were going to be here a long time odom said from 
his office in lebanon 
russell county circuit judge donald mcglothlin fined the union 
650000 earlier this month for vandalism and for breaking his 
rules against mass picketing and blocking coal trucks he said the 
union will face daily fines ranging from 20000 to 100000 if the 
tactics continue 
a federal judge is scheduled to decide thursday whether to issue 
his own restrictions on strike activities based on a complaint 
filed by the national labor relations board which accused the 
union of unfair labor practices 
only one confrontation between strikers and drivers hired by 
pittston has resulted in injuries seven miners and two drivers 
were injured when miners pelted the trucks with rocks and the 
drivers plowed into demonstrators 
hudson said heavy fines will hurt the union but will not stop 
the civil disobedience 
the company and the judge say this is an economic struggle 
but to me its a moral fight that goes to the heart of the people 
to preserving a way of life he said you make a decision that 
youre right and you dont back down

the dollar slipped below 2 west german marks in 
late trading tuesday in a choppy session dominated by speculation 
about an interestrate increase by the west german central bank 
the dollar finished the day above the levels in reached last 
friday in new york but below where it traded monday in europe the 
us and british currency markets were closed for holidays on 
monday 
last week the dollar rose above 2 marks for the first time in 2 
years and went over 140 japanese yen for the first time in 1 years 
trading tuesday was dominated by speculators known as 
jobbers who try to cash in on shortterm price trends while 
ignoring fundamental factors said carmine rotondo chief corporate 
dealer in the new york office of security pacific national bank 
with speculation causing sharp ups and downs the market looks 
like an ekg or electrocardiogram rotondo said 
in an early show of strength the dollar shrugged off the bank 
of japans decision to raise its official discount rate on 
wednesday to 325 percent from 25 percent 
the daily highs were reached in asian trading when the dollar 
at one point went over 202 west german marks and touched 144 
japanese yen 
dollar sales by european central banks did little to knock down 
the dollar which reached a twoyear high against the british pound 
in european trading 
but later in new york the dollar was hurt by speculation that 
west germanys bundesbank would decide at its weekly council 
meeting on thursday to raise base lending rates which would make 
the mark more attractive 
also weakening the dollar late in the session was intervention 
by the federal reserve which sold dollars when the currency 
already was sliding 
higher interest rates in japan and west germany would tend to 
weaken the dollar by making yields in their currencies more 
attractive in comparison to yields on us investments such as 
treasury bills 
the british pound appeared to bear the brunt of the 
interestrate hikes many traders moved money from sterling into 
marks said bruce brittain managing director for foreignexchange 
trading at salomon brothers inc 
sterling fell in london to 15570 from 15710 late monday 
later in new york sterling traded at 15710 up from its london 
level but down from 15905 late friday in new york

yen later in london the dollar rose to 14325 yen in new york 
the dollar traded at 14275 yen down from earlier in the trading 
day but up from 14110 yen on friday

japans central bank announced tuesday it will 
raise its official discount rate by 075 percentage points to 325 
percent in the first increase in the key rate in almost a decade 
bank of japan governor satoshi sumita said the decision to raise 
the rate effective wednesday resulted from the banks desire to 
stem inflation and strengthen the yen which has fallen against the 
us dollar in recent months 
commercial bank interest rates will rise in midjune officials 
said 
sumita told a news conference that the rate hike was a 
precaution to stem inflationary threats and stabilize prices 
the discount rate the interest rate the central bank charges 
commercial banks has stood at 25 percent the lowest level of 
any industrialized nation since february 1987 
finance minister tatsuo murayama called the banks decision a 
timely measure and said japan should continue to watch prices 
especially the effects of the lower yen exchange rate and higher 
oil prices 
eishiro saito chairman of the powerful japan federation of 
economic organizations keidanren said the rate hike was 
unnecessary but perhaps unavoidable because of the need to 
stabilize exchange rates and maintain coordination with other 
countries 
the longterm prime lending rate is expected to rise by 020 to 
030 percentage points in late june analysts say 
rates on japans overseas loans may rise as well although 
lowinterest development loans are less likely to be affected said 
a bank of japan official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
hirokazu yoshida of sanwa bank said the increase would have 
little impact on currency trading because the market had been well 
prepared by media speculation about the rise 
even when the speculation first began it didnt give much of 
a psychological boost to the yen he said if it didnt work 
then it wont work now 
finance minister murayama said hikes in commercial bank interest 
rates would go into effect june 19 
money in regular savings account will earn 038 percent interest 
per year up from 026 percent he said 
in recent years the bank of japan has followed a policy of 
lowinterest rates to encourage economic growth and slow the 
earlier rapid appreciation of the yen 
the discount rate peaked at 90 percent in 1980 in an attempt by 
thebank to halt skyrocketing consumer prices during an inflationary 
wave 
since then the bank consistently lowered the rate until the 
decision on tuesday

the supreme court on tuesday agreed to 
consider reviving a federal lawsuit stemming from the collapse of 
old court savings amp loan association in maryland 
the court said it will review a ruling that barred depositors 
from using a federal antiracketeering law to sue old courts 
former owners and others 
old courts collapse helped trigger a savings and loan crisis in 
maryland in 1985 and led to the criminal convictions of former 
owners jeffrey levitt jerome cardin and allan pearlstein 
levitt was sentenced to 30 years for stealing 147 million from 
the thrift institution cardin 15 years for stealing 385000 
pearlstein eight years for stealing 640786 
civil suits seeking hundreds of millions of dollars were filed 
against the owners in federal and state courts there have been 
multimilliondollar settlements of some of the state claims 
old court owners and the others including a law firm and 
accounting firm that worked for the institution were accused in 
the suits of the largest financial fraud in marylands history 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals last january upheld 
dismissal of the federal suit 
the appeals court rejected depositors arguments that 
certificates of deposit issued by old court were securities as 
defined by the federal securities exchange act of 1934 
the appeals court relied upon a 1982 supreme court ruling that 
said a longterm certificate issued by a federally insured bank is 
not a security within the meaning of the 1934 law 
the 4th circuit court said the 1982 ruling means the existence 
of a comprehensive regulatory and insurance system governing the 
issuer removes certificates of deposit issued by it from the 
general definition of securities 
maryland had such a regulatory system the appeals court said 
even though it failed to protect old courts depositors 
the appeals court also said that the federal racketeer 
influenced and corrupt organizations act does not provide an 
automatic basis for a federal lawsuit against old court the lower 
court said since the old court owners and others were sued in state 
court for violating the antiracketeering law the federal courts 
properly may decide to step aside 
the justices today limited their review to the 4th circuit 
courts dismissal of the rico allegations 
the case is tafflin vs levitt 881650

cocoa futures prices plunged tuesday following a report that the 
ivory coast the worlds largest cocoa producer will cut by almost 
40 percent the prices it pays farmers for the crop 
the strong us dollar which also contributed to the drop in 
cocoa futures helped depress grain and soybean futures and 
contributed to a mixed performance by precious metal futures 
on other markets frozen pork bellies turned sharply lower 
because of rising inventories and petroleum futures were mixed 
the july cocoa contract on the new york coffee sugar and cocoa 
exchange settled 79 lower at 1141 a ton with deferred months 
showed drops ranging from 26 to 49 a ton 
cocoa may have ended off the days lows only because of some 
late shortcovering said kim badenhop of merrill lynch capital 
markets inc in new york it was plummeting for a while 
according to projections ivory coast will sell an estimated 
685000 tons of cocoa this year compared with 385000 tons for 
brazil the worlds no 2 marketer and its producers already are 
the highestpaid in africa 
analysts had been anticipating that ivory coast president 
houphouetboigny would announce a cut in the producer prices soon 
to save government funds and ease overproduction 
reports that houphouetboigny would announce the cuts from 
about 1190 per ton to 744 later this week apparently 
originated with remarks to that effect by a world bank official 
tuesday in washington 
the us dollars continued rally in foreign exchange helped 
nudge prices lower because significant amounts of cocoa are bought 
and sold on the london mercantile exchange and the dollar improved 
its position relative to the british pound 
the stronger dollar which makes us exports more expensive 
helped depress the grain markets on the chicago board of trade 
although the principal market feature was weather analysts said 
grain and soybean futures prices closed lower nearly across the 
board 
traders said wet weather that touched key growing areas over the 
threeday holiday weekend and forecasts calling for more of the 
same helped push prices lower 
wheat settled 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with july at 
391 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 6 cents lower with july at 
261 a bushel oats were 3 cents to 4 cents lower with july at 
165 cents a bushel and soybeans were 6 cents higher to 19 cents 
lower with july at 718 a bushel 
precious metals futures were mixed gold was 20 cents lower to 
150 higher on the comex with june at 36570 a troy ounce 
silver was 25 cents to 34 cents lower with june at 523 a troy 
ounce platinum traded on the new york mercantile exchange was 
140 to 190 higher with july at 509360 a troy ounce 
frozen pork belly futures fell to lifeofcontract lows at the 
chicago mercantile exchange because inventories are not shrinking 
fast enough analysts said 
because theres so much stockpiled about 130 million bellies 
have to go out between june 1 and october 1 or its competing 
against whatevers being produced in the fresh market said chuck 
levitt an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
everybodys seeking lower and lower levels until they find the 
right price 
frozen pork bellies were 1 cent to 16 cents lower with july at 
2947 cents a pound live hogs were 33 cent to 95 cent lower

china is moving to solve a major trade dispute 
with the united states by agreeing to provide legal protection from 
piracy of imported computer programs or software us industry 
and government officials said tuesday 
a chinese delegation last week signed a bilateral agreement with 
us trade representative carla a hills to cover computer programs 
by law and indicated that by the end of this year the beijing 
government would submit a copyright law for legislative approval 
the us computer and business equipment manufacturers association 
announced 
the industry views this agreement with the chinese as a 
landmark in uschinese intellectual property rights negotiations 
but we are keenly aware that progress is still merely in the 
conceptual stage said oliver r smoot the associations 
executive vice president 
in february a cbema statement asserted that piracy of 
computer programs is rampant in china 
industry officials said the agreement was concluded in 
washington last thursday hours later mrs hills mentioned recent 
significant agreements with china taiwan and colombia on 
copyright and patent protection issues but still named china and 
seven other countries to a priority watch list on copyright and 
patent protection it calls for intensified negotiations and review 
by nov 1 of their antipiracy safeguards 
mrs hills office did not immediately comment on the industry 
statements a state department official insisting on anonymity 
described the uschina accord as a memorandum of understanding 
which is less binding than a formal agreement 
computer association officials said they understood the thursday 
agreement staved off harsher treatment for china in the us 
governments first application last week of the new 1988 omnibus 
trade act three countries japan brazil and india were 
designated for negotiations and potential punitive tariffs for 
alleged unfair trade barriers 
the chinese embassy quoted a foreign trade ministry official as 
saying in a recent speech in china that administrative and 
legislative measures can be taken to protect the interest of the 
intellectual property rights holders 
draft regulations on computer software protection should be 
ready by the end of 1989 and chinas 1989 legislative program 
provides for submission to the peoples congress of a draft 
revision of the patent law the official liu xiangeong was quoted 
as saying 
liu also mentioned the traditional chinese position that 
intellectual property such as computer software could be protected 
with buyerseller contract terms providing for confidentiality 
us officials have said this fails to prevent copying and piracy 
by outside parties 
differences over customs and patent protection have kept china 
and the united states from making the customary fiveyear renewal 
of their science and technology agreement instead they extended 
it for only nine months in january
