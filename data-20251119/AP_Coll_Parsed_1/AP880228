a salvage crew raised a sunken oil barge 
sunday from the murky depths of guemes channel one month after it 
sank and spilled some 70000 gallons of heavy bunker oil into 
washingtons inland waters 
with the inverted barge held at the surface by thick cables 
strung from two giant cranes crews began pumping the more than 
300000 gallons of oil that remained in the vessel into a second 
barge officials said they wanted to get the stricken barge 
floating on its own before they attempted to slowly roll it right 
side up 
a helicopter hovered overhead to track the movement of an oil 
sheen that appeared as the barge was raised the sheen was caused 
by 500 to 1000 gallons of lighter oil that was detected after the 
barge broke the surface about 7 am said mark stewart of the 
state division of emergency management 
the barge initially held about 22000 gallons of light oil in 
addition to the heavy oil 
stewart said surface skimmer boats had cleaned up about 160 
gallons while absorbent pads collected an additional undetermined 
amount 
the oil sheen moved about two miles south coast guard lt eldo 
delong said the sheen reached some kelp beds near burrows bay but 
did not touch any beaches 
state department of ecology workers said three seabirds were 
contaminated but they did not appear badly injured and were not 
captured for cleaning 
marine biologists and state environmental experts were assessing 
the damage from the bunker oil spill which had been difficult to 
determine because the heavierthanwater oil had sunk 
but ats kiuchi a doe spokesman said it appeared the fragile 
inner coastal environment had avoided a disaster that if the barge 
had spilled its entire cargo would have been the worst oil spill 
in the states history 
western washington universitys shannon point marine laboratory 
has found some oil in sea cucumbers said paul cassidy the labs 
director of operations 
the us coast guard tug spike used absorbent pads to clean 
up some oil after the barge was raised while a second boat was 
positioned near shannon point 100 yards away to prevent any oil 
from reaching shore 
the 176footlong barge operated by olympic tug and barge of 
seattle sank jan 31 in about 130 feet of water four miles west of 
anacortes and about 100 yards off shannon point 
the barge had been loaded at an oil refinery at anacortes and 
was being towed by a tug to seattle when it began listing and 
capsized 
the cause of the sinking remained undetermined 
coast guard lt eldo delong said the barge will be taken to the 
anacortes city dock where a boom would be put around it and any 
remaining holes would be patched eventually it will be taken to 
seattle he said

a london newspaper said sunday that the united 
states has sent a secret envoy to iran to discuss reestablishing 
diplomatic links 
the observer in an unattributed story did not identify the 
official but said he is apparently a close friend of president 
reagan and went to tehran two weeks ago it said the envoy was 
traveling under the name of clark 
the observer said the envoy met middleranking iranian 
officials who asked for assurances that any arms embargo against 
them as proposed by the united nations should be delayed until 
early this summer 
the united states is seeking a un ban on arms sales because 
iran has not accepted a ceasefire agreement in its eightyear war 
with iraq 
there have been no diplomatic relations since the us embassy 
in tehran was stormed nov 4 1979 and held for 444 days with 
diplomats and others kept hostage inside

leaping luggage and sniffing out sneaky smugglers 
the latest addition to miami international airports k9 corps has 
racked up impressive credits in his first two months on the beat 
his human colleagues say 
king a romping 2yearold cross between a black labrador 
retriever and a german shorthaired pointer has a nose that makes 
news 
since the us customs service gave king to metrodade police 
he has sniffed out 86000 in drugscented cash 347 pounds of 
cocaine and helped collar four suspects said police lt larry 
martin 
the beloved rookie one of three canines used by metrodade 
police at the airport has all but matched the 400pound career 
total of ringo who just retired after about a decade martin said 
hes an upandcoming dog martin said of the enthusiastic 
pooch who with handler detective ken buzzi graduated from the 
us customs dog training school in front royal va 
king and buzzi were still getting used to the domestic flight 
areas of miami international after their december graduation when 
they made their first score dec 17 
a man carrying christmas presents on a flight from denver fit 
the profile of a smuggler denver police had been suspicious 
the man agreed to a search and king alerted to a drug odor 
in his packages more than 40000 in drugtainted cash was 
discovered buzzi said 
the fact that a specially trained dog identified the money as 
having been associated with narcotics was probable cause to seize 
it buzzi said 
soon afterward king found a similar amount of drugtainted cash 
packed in a mercedes benz 
the two occupants of the car were arrested and are awaiting 
trial in dade county circuit court buzzi said 
kings abilities also led to the discovery of 185 pounds of 
cocaine and the arrest of two eastern airlines employees on feb 1 
the next day he sniffed out 155 pounds of cocaine concealed 
underneath the floor in the belly of an l1011 aircraft he 
detected 7 pounds of cocaine on an earlier search to bring his 
total to 347 pounds martin said 
i worked mostly narcotics for the last 16 years said buzzi 
the biggest seizure i made was 600 pounds and it took me almost 
10 years but working with a detector dog weve found almost 400 
pounds in the first two months we were back from school 
were both still a green team ive been a police officer for 
18 years but i feel like a rookie again its like a whole new 
career he said 
while king has a superfine nose he is not perfect buzzi 
said 
king gets tired sometimes while working his eighthour shift 
but so far hes been on the money he said 
detector dogs cannot sniff the enormous volume of luggage 
freight and planes used to smuggle narcotics and money through this 
primary port of entry for drugs buzzi said 
any dog and its handler are only as good as the watchful 
authorities who suggest likely targets 
it was mostly luck and being in the right place at the right 
time buzzi said

mohammed ali abu leban accused of hurling a 
firebomb at israeli soldiers saw his lawyer for the first time 
five minutes before he appeared in military court 
the 19yearold signed a confession written in hebrew a 
language he does not know and said interrogators abused him 
as authorities round up growing numbers of arab suspects in an 
effort to quell nearly three months of unrest israels methods of 
detaining and trying palestinians has drawn a hail of criticism 
i feel totally helpless in this sham of a system said abu 
lebans attorney jonathan kuttab a palestinian who graduated from 
the university of virginia law school in charlottesville 
in 98 percent of the cases lawyers cannot see palestinian 
clients until after they confess and judges will accept the 
confession at face value no matter what you say kuttab told 
the associated press 
abu leban shackled and dressed in a bluejeans jacket flashed 
a vforvictory sign as he entered the tiny courtroom in a closed 
army base he waved to his father whom he was seeing for the first 
time since his arrest 
abu leban had been held incommunicado for 18 days until he 
signed a fourpage confession he said he signed only after 
interrogators beat him deprived him of sleep and forced him to 
squat in a corner for hours 
kuttab said it was unlikely his clients contentions would be 
accepted in court allegations of unfairness in the military court 
system prompted the attorneys association in the gaza strip to 
decide to boycott all military court proceedings 
but israeli officials argue the system is fair 
there are some exceptions but a defendant who feels he was 
mistreated during interrogation can raise the issue in court where 
due process of law is ensured army prosecutor amos giora a 
native of ann arbor mich said in an interview 
giora and other israelis argue the only obvious shortcoming in 
the military court system was redressed by defense minister yitzhak 
rabin earlier this month when he announced that israel after 20 
years of occupation would establish army appeal courts 
kuttab said figures assembled by palestinian lawyers show the 
total number of arab detainees normally about 3000 at any one 
time has doubled and the army has set up four new prisons with 
tent barracks in the occupied west bank and gaza 
according to the army 1927 palestinians were arrested and 93 
placed in jail for six months without trial under emergency 
regulations from dec 8 to feb 9 the arabowned palestine press 
service puts the number of arabs jailed without trial at 147 
the process from arrest to trial in the military court system is 
well documented a palestinian suspected of participating in 
antiisraeli activities is usually detained in the middle of the 
night because soldiers fear their presence in arab towns or refugee 
camps during the day might spark protests 
the detainee is handcuffed often blindfolded and taken to a 
military prison no arrest warrant is ever shown and family members 
are not told where the suspect is being taken 
it often takes a lawyer several weeks to track down his new 
client who can be held incommunicado for up to six months a judge 
is required to order a detention extension after the first 18 days 
during the period of interrogation the detainee is routinely 
subjected to beatings forced to spend long hours in uncomfortable 
positions threatened and submitted to other psychological 
measures kuttab said 
usually before the first 18day period is up the defendant 
breaks down and confesses to a variety of illegal activities 
kuttab said only after this is he permitted to see an attorney 
and only then is the attorney told what charges his client faces 
abu leban entered court with five other arab defendants four of 
whom had no attorney present kuttab was able to see his client and 
the charge sheet against him only minutes before the court session 
began 
kuttab argued in court that abu leban signed the confession only 
after being abused he asked for and was granted a separate 
hearing about the admissiblity of the evidence 
kuttab said he did not intend actually to present a case on 
whether the evidence should be admitted but only to use the extra 
time to try to plea bargain a shorter sentence 
if i protest his interrogator will deny it and he will just 
end up getting a tougher sentence kuttab said 
what hurts most about the process is the pretense of 
propriety he said with a judge and a prosecutor and a defense 
attorney it looks all right from the outside but in fact on a 
certain level i feel i am a collaborator in the evil system 
at least i brought him some cigarettes kuttab said of abu 
leban shaking his head as he left court ive turned into a 
social worker more than a lawyer in this system

the fertile missouri river bottom lands 
where the arikara hidatsa and mandan indians thrived for seven 
centuries are gone forever buried beneath the waters of lake 
sakakawea 
the 200milelong reservoir drove the indians onto higher less 
productive land sliced their reservation into isolated sections 
and is blamed for precipitating soaring unemployment and alcoholism 
the three tribes who say they were coerced into surrendering 
the bottom lands without just compensation as the lake filled 
behind garrison dam believe they have a chance this year to get 
1784 million that they and a special federal commission think 
they deserve 
the problem has been with us for 40 years the time is right 
for a resolution said tribal chairman edward lone fight 
the tribes which total about 7700 people are asking the 
states congressional delegation to introduce legislation that 
would give them 36 million a year for 50 years plus 4 percent 
interest on the unpaid balance of the settlement 
the money would come from federal hydropower revenues rather 
than the us treasury which tribal leaders believe should make 
the legislation more palatable to congress 
the bill also would fund municipal water projects on the 
reservation and authorize but not pay for replacement of a 
hospital and other facilities destroyed by the reservoir 
lone fight says the bill is something thats supportable in 
congress 
but the federal bureau of indian affairs opposes further 
compensation for the tribes rural electric cooperatives dont like 
the idea of dipping into hydropower revenues and members of the 
states congressional delegation have yet to support the bill 
we hope that something can be introduced this session but 
until we can find something that everyone feels comfortable with 
nothing can be introduced said mary jo vrem an aide to the 
senate select committee on indian affairs 
the tribes accepted 126 million from congress in 1950 but 
garrison dam was already built and lake sakakawea was forming when 
the money was offered the tribes and their supporters say the 
indians had no choice but to take the settlement 
when the indian people were negotiating for the best possible 
deal the water was up to their ankles and the offers were 
going down lone fight said 
when dam construction began in the 1940s 90 percent of the 
indians lived and farmed in the river valley as their ancestors 
had for seven centuries unemployment on the reservation was 
negligible 
today unemployment exceeds 50 percent and alcoholism is 
rampant problems that have been linked to the disruption caused by 
garrison dam about 3400 indians live on the reservation another 
4300 tribal members live elsewhere 
lake sakakawea is named for a shoshone guide who worked for the 
lewis and clark expedition up the missouri river in 1804 
in my 66 years i have seen a drastic change from being 
selfsufficent to being a very desperate economic situation said 
luther grinnell a tribal judge grinnell grew up on a family farm 
near elbowoods the reservations main town before it was inundated 
the tribes grew their own vegetables and cattle cut firewood 
from trees along the river and mined nearby coal deposits grinnell 
said 
we never heard of unemployment because everyone had their 
farms and those who had jobs didnt farm grinnell said 
a fivemember panel appointed by interior secretary donald hodel 
concluded in 1986 that the tribes were owed 178 million to 412 
million in compensation 
the joint tribal advisory committee agreed with indian claims 
that the lake destroyed their selfsufficient way of life and 
precipitated the tribes continuing social problems 
if the tribes get the settlement the money would be earmarked 
for programs such as work projects and alcohol treatment that 
would attack the reservations social ills lone fight said 
however in a recent meeting with tribal leaders assistant 
secretary for indian affairs ross swimmer claimed that the tribes 
have been adequately compensated through the federal services they 
receive 
swimmers position was characterized by ray cross an attorney 
for the tribes as disingenuous 
bureau of indian affairs officials will meet soon with members 
of north dakotas congressional delegation to discuss the tribes 
proposal bia spokesman carl shaw said

enrollment is up and the debt is down at 
fisk university where only a few years ago students shivered in 
unheated dormitories because the historically black private 
institution could not pay its gas bill 
as fisk winds down its celebration of black history month which 
included the dedication of a stamp honoring author james weldon 
johnson faculty and students also celebrated the universitys 
return from the brink of financial disaster 
when the nashville gas co cut off service in early 1984 until 
fisk paid a 170000 debt students brought space heaters to class 
and joined with faculty and staff members to raise funds to ensure 
the universitys survival the overall debt mounted to 41 
million but classes continued 
henry ponder appointed fisks president in july 1984 led the 
school on a course of austerity programs and aggressive 
fundraising 
when ponder was told for example that boiler repairs would 
cost 350000 he found a fisk alumnus a maintenance expert who 
did it for only 60000 
ponder acknowledged in a recent interview that things are better 
at fisk but added you have to get the public to understand that 
help is still needed to get the resources to move this institution 
to the forefront of educational institutions in this country 
i dont say that lightly thats where weve been and we will 
get back said ponder who said the school did not lower its 
academic standards during its financial troubles 
today debt at fisk has been reduced to 200000 and its 
endowment has reached 39 million an unrestricted gift of 13 
million by entertainer bill cosby in december 1986 gave the school 
a boost but officials say they have received substantial 
grassroots support too 
however three of the universitys 23 trustees announced friday 
that they will resign at the end of the school year one trustee 
said the resignations were related to the accountability of those 
charged with daytoday administration fisks financial aid 
director and assistant director were fired in december for 
allegedly failing to fill out forms to receive financial aid 
faculty salaries have increased 30 percent over the last three 
years to an average of 32000 for a tenured professor although 
still below the 35000 to 40000 ponder said is appropriate 
aggressive recruiting of students brought enrollment which 
dipped to 500 at one point up to 644 students in the 1988 spring 
semester an increase of 27 percent over the 1987 spring semester 
said harrison deshields director of the office of admissions and 
records 
bryon cobb a student from huntsville texas said fisks role 
in black history in america was important to him 
fisk introduced the black spiritual to the world it was 
active in the civil rights movement web dubois went to college 
here cobb said 
in addition he said my understanding is that a degree from 
fisk is as respected as one from harvard 
the financial crisis at the school had some positive benefits 
for the fisk community said roland hayes robinson now a graduate 
student 
the student body handled the crisis well we shared space 
heaters it united us we were able to confront a problem and come 
through it robinson sid 
the university founded in 1867 by the freedmens bureau during 
reconstruction is no stranger to struggle in fact the campus was 
purchased with 150000 raised by the colleges jubilee singers 
during a european tour in the 1870s 
the earnings of the singers whose tours still bring 60000 a 
year to fisk also paid for building jubilee hall whose exterior 
was recently restored with a 150000 federal grant 
james weldon johnson a poet who was a diplomat and an early 
organizer of the national association for the advancement of 
colored people was a professor at fisk in the early 1930s web 
dubois a philosopher and writer who graduated from fisk in 1888 
also helped found the naacp and was the first black to earn a 
doctorate from harvard 
i think students are attracted here because it has the 
reputation of a good community when they get here they find out 
we have a dynamic science faculty and many of our students go to 
medical and dental schools ponder said about 60 percent of fisk 
graduates enroll for postgraduate study 
revais mitchell executive assistant to the president and a 
history professor said fisks financial problems mirrored those of 
other liberal arts college but were worse 
in the 1960s and 1970s the philosophy of supporting a liberal 
arts education dried up and the interest shifted to business 
degrees mitchell said 
but mitchell said the quality of education at fisk has never 
suffered and that peeling paint and cold classrooms dont mean poor 
academics 
i try to tell my students that there has always been an 
element of suffering in the tradition of black education he said

three mexican nationals including a former 
mexican police detective charged in the torturemurder of a us 
drug agent were convicted of conspiring to murder a us customs 
agent 
the charges grew out of a series of meetings with an undercover 
investigator in which defendant raul lopez alvarez offered to 
murder the customs agent for a 25000 fee no killing took place 
lopez 29 who also faces charges in the 1985 slaying of us 
drug enforcement administration agent enrique camarena was 
convicted friday of conspiracy to murder a federal agent and 
conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent 
two men lopez hired in mexico to assist him carlos quintero 
maldonado 25 and fabian jimenez martinez 22 also were convicted 
in the conspiracy quintero was acquitted on a charge that he 
traveled to the united states from mexico to carry out the murder 
plot 
the men could receive life imprisonment sentencing was 
scheduled for april 18 before us district judge pamela m rymer 
lawyers for the defendants had argued that lopez and the two men 
he hired never intended to carry out the murder but had planned 
all along to stage a ripoff of the undercover drug agent with 
whom they were negotiating they believed that the undercover agent 
was a narcotics dealer 
lopez a former homicide investigator for the mexican state 
judicial police told undercover agents he was an enforcer for 
the powerful narcotics organization of rafael caro quintero and 
ernesto fonseca carrillo and had a direct role in camarenas 
abduction and torture 
in 12 hours of government tapes presented as evidence lopez 
bragged about his knowledge of camarenas torture and promised to 
repeat it on the customs agent 
if it was part of a scam they oversold it too much said 
jury foreman david armas 28 a postal worker from alhambra 
especially when they talked about killing someone you looked at 
their faces and they showed no remorse 
nine people have been indicted in the camarena case two of whom 
will be tried with lopez caro and fonseca are jailed in mexico 
city in connection with the case lopez had been charged in mexico 
with the camarena murder but was later released

reagan administration officials said saturday 
that eric arturo delvalle recognized by the united states as 
panamas president decided on his own to go into hiding but that 
he remained in telephone contact with us diplomats in panama city 
delvalle is safe and in high spirits after escaping arrest 
and the struggle against the countrys military leader will 
continue delvalles envoy to washington said 
the permanent council of the organization of american states 
after a lengthy and at times heated debate saturday night on the 
situation in panama took no position on the turmoil there 
reagan administration officials denied participating in 
delvalles escape though they said the us ambassador to panama 
arthur h davis was in contact with delvalle by telephone 
they said they were not sure what delvalles next move would be 
president reagan who usually spends weekends at camp david 
md was at the white house receiving reports on the fastmoving 
situation 
the 30member oas council sidestepped a decision on whether to 
seat as panamas ambassador to the organization robert leyton the 
current envoy who is loyal to panamanian military chief manuel 
antonio noriega or larence chewning fabrega delvalles delegate 
there had been indications from officials of the american 
delegation that the council would seat neither man chosing instead 
to recognize soraya cano a panamanian career diplomat who is a 
member of the panamanian delegation to the oas 
the start of the formal council debate had been delayed for five 
hours while the envoys wrangled in private over the question of 
whom to credential as panamas representative 
but when the debate commenced shortly after 9 pm est no 
resolutions were offered dealing with that sticky question 
instead leyton was admitted to take part in the debate at least 
for the time being and he launched into a tirade against the 
united states accusing it of trying to destabilize his government 
i wish to somehow resolve the crisis in the government of 
panama leyton said but this is not the forum 
leyton steadfastly denied us charges that noriega has been 
involved in drug trafficking although the former panamanian 
ambassador to the united states gabriel lewis told the council 
we are suffering a new phenomenon narcomilitarism this 
narcotic militarism knows no frontier 
richard t mccormack the us ambassador to the oas said the 
united states could not accept the decision by the panamanian 
national assembly in which delvalle was deposed in a 10minute 
rump session 
in a riveting moment lewis had oas technicians play an 
audiocassette in which he had taperecorded the telephone 
conversation with delvalles wife mariela as panamanian military 
personnel surrounded her house after her husband had fled 
mrs delvalle in a trembling voice described how she had told 
the officers my husband isnt here nor are you going to find 
him 
a member of the us mission declining to be identified 
publicly indicated that a part of the problem for the oas 
ambassadors in deciding which panamanian representative to 
credential was that they had doubts about what stance they should 
take theyre afraid of doing something which might prejudice the 
position their government has taken on noriega the official said 
chewning said questions also had been raised about whether el 
salvadors ambassador ernesto rivas gallont had the right to 
request the special session with some ambassadors who support 
noriega opposing it 
chewning said those who oppose having the issue debated in the 
oas simply dont want the rest of the world to know whats going 
on in panama 
he said the ambassadors had not allowed him or leyton to address 
the gathering 
jose b sosa the panamanian ambassador accredited to the us 
government said in an interview on cable news networks 
newsmaker saturday that he was in touch with delvalle 
supporters in panama city and we understand he is physically all 
right hes safe and in high spirits 
the struggle that president delvalle is leading now is a 
struggle to get the country back to civilian rule and get the 
country into democratic process and thats what the panamanian 
people want sosa said thats why we feel we are going to 
carry the struggle carry this fight 
the panamanian people are going to rally behind the 
constitutional president he is going to win this out sosa said 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
united states had nothing to do with delvalles decision to leave 
his house to avoid arrest but that the panamanian had been in 
touch with davis by telephone 
they denied initially that the united states knew delvalles 
whereabouts but later in the day when asked if us officials 
knew where delvalle had gone they said he is at an undisclosed 
location 
according to the us officials account soldiers came to 
delvalles house at 8 am and were met at the door by delvalles 
wife while the soldiers were telling her they wanted to take 
delvalle the president escaped out a back door the officials said 
it was his own decision we did not do this said one 
official when asked if the united states had participated in 
delvalles escape 
several of delvalles family members including several children 
and grandchildren stayed overnight at the us embassy in panama 
city the officials said 
the officials reaffirmed a us decision to continue recognizing 
delvalle as panamas president despite his replacement by a 
cabinet minister loyal to noriega 
delvalles flight posed a dilemma for us policymakers because 
his departure for the united states or another country would remove 
a key antinoriega symbol around which opposition to military rule 
could gather 
administration officials said on saturday they hoped to marshal 
international support behind delvalles presidency notably among 
central american nations 
highlevel meetings continued at the state department where 
officials described the situation in panama city as calm 
they said the 10000 american troops in panama assigned to 
protection of the panama canal were continuing to keep a low 
profile 
the united states policy toward noriega has grown increasingly 
hostile in recent months and the sentiment intensified after feb 
5 when two federal grand juries returned indictments portraying 
him as a key conspirator in an international drug trafficking 
operation 
delvalle had been viewed by the administration as little more 
than a front man for noriega but that all changed thursday evening 
when he broke with the military chieftain

an oklahoma state penitentiary inmate 
who had armed himself with a screwdriver and took three hostages 
gave up late saturday after he was apparently overpowered by a 
hostage staff member 
correction department spokesman jerry massie said the hostage 
situation ended shortly after 11 pm saturday more than 12 hours 
after it began 
there was some kind of a scuffle inside the office where 
inmate robert taylor was holding two prisoners and a staff 
counselor massie said the four men then came walking out 
everyone seems to be fine massie said there appears to 
be no serious problems 
he said the hostages identified as prison counselor chuck ryden 
and inmates robert king and allen livingston were taken to the 
prisons medical unit to be examined for injuries 
we dont know exactly what happened yet massie said it 
looks like the officer ryden was able to overpower the inmate 
taylors only weapon was apparently a screwdriver authorities 
said 
linda morgan a public information officer at the prison said 
taylor grabbed ryden a correctional counselor at about 1020 am 
after they went together to an office to discuss a problem 
the other two inmates were out cleaning and painting and 
entered the office to get more supplies at which time they became 
hostages themselves she said 
saturday afternoon taylors request for a pitcher of tea was 
granted in exchange for allowing a prison doctor to examine ryden 
the counselor had his blood pressure checked and seemed fine 
ms morgan said 
taylor had demanded that the warden contact the governors 
office and that he be allowed to have an attorney present when he 
presented his grievances ms morgan declined to say what the 
grievances were other than to say that he originally approached 
the counselor with a complaint about his prison diet 
ms morgan said taylor is serving a 15year sentence for 
seconddegree burglary and had been an inmate at the prison since 
1986 
warden james saffle had said he wouldnt meet with taylor or 
contact the governors office until the situation has ended ms 
morgan said 
ms morgan said that approximately80 prisoners live in the cells 
in the section of the prison where the incident took place and 
all are in their cells 
the mcalester penitentiary was the site of an uprising in 
december 1985 when inmates protesting prison conditions held seven 
hostages for nearly 17 hours before releasing them unharmed the 
institution has been under a 23houraday lockdown since that 
episode officials said

a texas infant born with almost no 
brain was taken off lifesupport equipment that was intended to 
help preserve her tiny heart and other organs for transplantation 
a doctor said saturday 
baby evelyn continues to breathe on her own but shows signs 
of gradual deterioration dr joyce peabody chief of neonatology 
at loma linda university medical center said in a statement late 
saturday 
evelyn keys was born with a fatal genetic birth defect known as 
anencephaly in which much of the upper brain and skull are 
missing loma linda has developed the nations first guidelines 
using such infants as organ donors 
however little evelyn never met the hospitals criteria for 
braindeath since she was born seven days ago and machineassisted 
breathing was stopped saturday with her parents consent peabody 
said 
although three newborns needing healthy livers had been 
identified during the week the likelihood of a vital organ 
transplant dropped to nil hospital spokesman anita rockwell said 
baby evelyn will be allowed to die naturally she said 
it is highly unlikely that she will be able to donate organs 
such as liver and heart because without continuation of assisted 
breathing oxygen deprivation of these organs will occur prior to 
her death ms rockwell said 
details about the potential liver recipients werent disclosed 
but ms rockwell said they werent at loma linda 
evelyn was born feb 20 in san antonio texas to judy keys 22 
and airman todd keys 21 stationed at lackland air force base the 
infant was flown to loma linda that same day to be used in the 
donor program 
anencephalic babies usually die within days after birth 
loma linda a pioneer in infant heart transplants has sought to 
establish a practice of sustaining anencephalic babies so vital 
organs can be used after brain death is certified by two 
independent physicians under the hospitals rules however no 
baby is kept on lifesupport longer than a week whether brain 
death has occurred during that time or not 
loma linda doctors anticipate that baby evelyns heart valves 
and perhaps corneas will be donated after her heart stops ms 
rockwell said 
the same day evelyn was born another anencephalic baby 
identified only as baby john died at loma linda after efforts find 
a suitable liver or heart recipient were unsuccessful he had been 
declared brain dead two days earlier in his case doctors were 
able to use a heart valve after he died

roman catholic bishop donald wuerl says us 
catholics should help pay the vaticans 567 million operating 
deficit 
wuerl named head of the diocese of pittsburgh on feb 12 said 
the deficit was created when pope john paul ii raised salaries 
substantially to help employees keep up with the cost of living 
how do we pay for this he said friday in the past we 
have always said to the pope good luck 
considering the size of the church the deficit is not a large 
one and could be paid off with an endowment wuerl said 
details of the 1986 deficit were made public at the insistence 
of us bishops wuerl said the bishops told vatican officials that 
americans must see balance sheets before they would help pay 
the bishop also said the vaticans administration costs have 
increased considerably since 1965 when reforms by the second 
vatican council added commissions secretariats and other boards 
church officials also have increased their missionary work he said

congress faces a confusing choice this week 
between two rival versions of a plan to help the nicaraguan rebels 
a vote is scheduled for thursday to decide whether the 
usbacked contras will get an aid package drafted by house 
democrats a similar one drawn up by house republicans or nothing 
at all 
current authority to aid the contras expires at midnight monday 
and the rebels are said to be rapidly running out of items like 
food clothing and medicine that the new aid plans would provide 
both versions of the new aid package would keep nonlethal 
supplies flowing to the rebels at their positions inside nicaraguan 
territory neither would provide new weapons and both would set up 
a 14 million program to help warinjured children on all sides of 
the conflict 
but while similar in what they would do for the rebels in the 
short term the two versions set starkly different ground rules for 
an impending rematch between the reagan administration and the 
democratic congress over military aid for the rebels 
the democratic version which house leaders say they are 
confident will pass holds out the possbility that a new military 
aid package could be considered sometime after june 1 
but the conditions for such consideration are strict it could 
happen only if the democratcontrolled house intelligence committee 
certifies that the contras and the leftist sandinista government 
have not reached a ceasefire and that it is the sandinistas fault 
then the proposal would allow but not require the partys 
leadership to bring forth an aid proposal of its own design and 
would allow amendment of the package on the floor 
the gop aid proposal would give the president rather than 
congress the right to design the military aid package and would 
leave to him the determination whether a ceasefire is in effect 
and whether any failure to reach a truce is the fault of the 
sandinista regime 
reagan could make such a request as soon as april 16 and it 
would have to be acted on by congress without delay 
a similar expedited procedure was followed when the house on 
feb 3 rejected reagans previous aid request which included 
weapons and other military supplies by a vote of 219 to 211 
another difference between the two packages is that the gop 
version would leave authority to deliver the aid in the hands of 
the central intelligence agency which has been supervising a 
fairly successful airdrop program 
democrats many of whom are suspicious of the spy agency would 
turn the delivery program over to the pentagon to supervise 
keeping the same private contractors planes and crews now doing 
the work 
the showdown over the two competing aid packages was supposed to 
have occured last week but democrats postponed action at the last 
minute citing confusion among lawmakers over the differences 
between the two bills republicans said the real reason for the 
delay was that the majority feared it was losing supporters to 
their competing version 
part of the difficulty democrats have faced is division among 
outside peace groups which lobbied hard to defeat reagans military 
aid proposal earlier this month and were reluctant to now turn 
around and support a contra aid package no matter how 
humanitarian its terms 
some groups including presbyterians lutherans quakers and 
catholics were supporting the democratic package in hopes it would 
lessen the pressure for a future request for contra weapons 
but representatives of the unitarian methodist american 
baptist and brethren churches wrote lawmakers last week that we 
believe it is important that no aid in any form be provided that 
would assist the contras in maintaining an armed force to wage war 
against the government and the people of nicaragua 
house leaders were meeting with such outside groups to try to 
persuade them to unite behind the democratic proposal before 
thursdays vote and rep david obey dwis a supporter the 
partys package expressed impatience with the groups 
allornothing approach 
any theology student will tell you the first thing you learn 
is that the greatest enemy of morality is moralism obey said 
if your goal is to save lives and wind the war down then you 
have to have tactics and strategy as well as good wishes i wish 
liberals could count votes as well as they can feel

fad health diets and marketplace gimmickry 
are giving americans a distorted view of the type and amount of 
foods needed to help prevent chronic disease according to a 
cornell university professor 
in a paper prepared for congressional testimony on tuesday t 
colin campbell said isolated studies taken out of context and 
promoted by special economic interests often trigger changes in 
the american diet that may actually be harmful 
too many americans believe in magic bullets too many 
corporations believe in profitrich products with very specific 
health claims said campbell 
such marketplace gimmickry he said does not help americans 
avoid the socalled diseases of affluence of osteoporosis and 
heart attack 
in a paper prepared for the senate governmental affairs 
committee campbell recommended that the government establish a 
national research center to collect and analyze nutrition 
information so americans can receive more accurate information on 
diet and health 
campbell directed a massive study of the diet and lifestyle of 
6500 persons in 130 locations in the peoples republic of china in 
an effort to determine how nutrition affects such diseases as 
cancer and heart attack 
he said the study is not yet finished but results so far cast 
doubt on some of the popular american beliefs about nutrition and 
health 
among his observations 
american studies have shown that a serum cholesterol reading of 
180 milligrams per decaliter can reduce the risk of heart attack 
yet another us study showed that a reduction in cholesterol 
raises the risk of colon cancer campbell said that in china the 
cholesterol levels are far below the typical american level and 
the incidence of colon cancer also is low this shows he said 
that the study showing an increase in colon cancer with lower 
cholesterol is an experimental aberration 
excess calories may not be the sole cause of obesity campbell 
said he said the chinese consume about 20 percent more calories 
than do americans yet obesity is rare among the chinese he said 
chinese average only about 15 percent of their calories in the form 
of fat far below the typical american 
some american studies have suggested that an increase in fiber 
in the diet may lead to a loss of minerals campbell said the 
chinese consume about 34 grams of fiber per day versus about 10 
grams for most americans and yet the chinese show healthy levels 
of iron zinc and magnesium all important minerals

about 1000 people trying to buck the chinese 
system of assigned jobs for life gathered sunday at the opening of 
beijings first citywide labor market 
a mostly young crowd bundled up in heavy greatcoats peered at 
job description posters lining the street and discussed work 
opportunities with representatives of 22 factories and companies 
who manned desks inside the labor exchange center 
the center said deputy chief zhao fenyong was set up by the 
city labor bureau to carry out the government policy of allowing 
people to find jobs more suitable to their needs and skills 
those who pay a fee of 27 cents will have their names placed on 
the centers computerized list and receive help in finding a new 
job he said 
liu wanxin of the tienma service co which supplies tourist 
items to department stores said many people want to find new work 
closer to their homes 
others just dont like their present jobs he said adding 
that his company found seven prospective new employees sunday 
morning 
li hongjun 34 said she was applying for a job with a beijing 
wine company because it has night shifts allowing her to care for 
a sick sister during the day she said she could also take a bus to 
the winery rather than commute by bicycle as she does to her 
current job 
a personnel officer at qinghua university which is looking for 
nine cooks electricians drivers and other workers said factory 
workers are attracted to the schools long summer and winter 
holidays many said wang jingxiang also want their children to 
attend the excellent kindergarten and primary schools run by the 
university 
since the 1949 communist takeover chinese have had little 
choice in determining their career 
under a system known as fen pei chinese were assigned a job 
for life from which they could not be fired but neither could they 
leave 
high school and elementary school graduates were assigned work 
in local businesses or if they come from the countryside were 
generally returned to the land to farm with the rest of their 
family 
college graduates a scarce resource here were sent anywhere in 
the country that needed them a student majoring in english 
literature at prestigious beijing university could for example 
wind up in barren qinghai province teaching english to barely 
literate peasants 
but in recent years cracks have appeared in chinas iron rice 
bowl as the country has sought to speed its economic development 
the chinese government has recognized that its traditional labor 
system has deadened worker creativity and kept workers from fully 
using their talents 
it also has split families especially those of the educated 
classes indeed it is not unusual for couples with college 
educations to be assigned jobs in different provinces thousands of 
miles away from one another 
as a result china has begun loosening restrictions on 
jobhopping and encouraging the 20 million people who have gone off 
on their own to set up small private businesses 
however the work units to which each chinese is assigned still 
regard employees as the property of the unit and often refuse a job 
transfer or exact compensation for the loss of a worker 
engineers scientists and other trained people in particular 
have had difficulty leaving their old jobs because of their value 
to the work unit 
that creates the ironic condition that the better one does ones 
job here the less of a chance one has to leave it for something 
better 
its true that if a person has a position of responsibility it 
will be more difficult for him to change jobs said the centers 
zhao but if his work unit refuses to let him go we will do what 
we can to help including assist in finding a replacement 
similar labor markets have appeared at the city district level 
in beijing but the center that opened sunday is the first to cover 
the entire city 
illegal work markets have also sprung up in beijing and in 
several other chinese cities their purpose generally is not to 
help employed people find a new job but to help unemployed 
peasants enter the urban labor force allowing them to abandon the 
difficult life in chinas countryside 
zhao said the citywide labor market will also stay open in the 
evenings and on sundays to accommodate people who have difficulty 
getting away from their jobs to look for new ones

archaeologists said sunday they discovered the 
remains of a roman amphitheater 15 feet below londons financial 
district in one of the most important finds in britain this century 
historians had been looking for londons amphitheater for 300 
years amphitheaters were used for weapons training and military 
parades as well as fights with animals and gladiatorial combat 
archaeologists from the museum of london uncovered the eastern 
end of the amphitheaters stone walls during excavations going on 
since last july said john maloney the museums excavations 
officer in an interview with the observer weekly 
the corporation of london which administers london city gave 
the museum 176000 to dig on the site next to the medieval 
guildhall where the corporation meets 
an art gallery and an office building has been planned for the 
amphitheaters site 
the observer reported that the corporation will talk with the 
archaeologists and architects this week to discuss preservation of 
the uncovered amphitheater remains 
a clash could develop if the corporation wants to rebury the 
site and proceed with the art gallery and offices the observer 
said 
london was founded by the romans who called it londinium the 
romans stayed in britain from ad 43 to 410 
the excavators think the amphitheater was built between ad 70 
and 140 during the heyday of roman london 
corroded coins found on the site may help to date the ruin more 
exactly 
the center of the amphitheater is under the open courtyard in 
front of guildhall almost all the area where the seats and walls 
would have been is under guildhall itself the art gallery site and 
neighboring buildings 
the excavators say the amphitheater was oval shaped 100 yards 
from east to west and 80 yards north to south 
that is small compared with roman amphitheaters found in 
southern france and italy but about the same size as four others 
in england at cirencester chester chichester and silchester

india will halt its military 
operations in eastern sri lanka for 48 hours because it wants to 
persuade two tamil women to give up a death fast a senior sri 
lankan government official said sunday 
the women anamma david and nesamma vadivel have been fasting 
inside a hindu temple in eastern batticaloa city for the past nine 
days and are reported to be in a serious condition 
the women have threatened to commit suicide unless india 
declares a ceasefire and tamil separatists agree to discuss a 
settlement in their fiveyear civil war with the majority sinhalese 
a statement by the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the most 
powerful rebel group meanwhile said it was prepared for 
unconditional talks with the indian government 
the tamil statement issued in the southern indian city of 
madras and addressed to the fasting women said we accept your 
appeal in toto and with immediate effect 
there was no immediate reaction from the indian government 
the sri lankan government official who spoke on the condition 
of anonymity said the halt in indian military operations in the 
east would go into effect at midnight sunday 
a spokeswoman of the indian high commission said she had no 
information on the ceasefire but added that india had scaled down 
operations since the beginning of february 
more than 45000 indian peacekeeping troops are battling tamil 
militants in northern and eastern sri lanka to enforce an 
indiansponsored peace pact 
the pact was signed last july to end the tamil separatist war in 
the island nation but it has been rejected by the tigers 
the peace accord grants some autonomy to tamildominated areas 
in the northern and eastern provinces but tamil rebels want a 
separate nation 
jyotindra nath dixit the indian high commissioner last week 
appealed to the tamil women to give up their fast he said they 
were being used and instigated by the rebels to pressure india 
dixit said the tamil tigers had the habit of using old women to 
fight their battles 
the sri lankan official said arrangements had been made by both 
governments to halt the offensive and save the lives of the women 
he said that efforts also were underway to contact tiger leader 
velupillai prabhakaran to persuade him to begin negotiations 
his response is awaited this is a joint indolankan move and 
it is part of the contacts both governments have been making with 
the tigers he said 
president junius r jayewardene on sunday reiterated his general 
amnesty offer to both tamil and sinhalese extremists who have 
opposed the peace accord 
i am prepared to grant all terrorists amnesty provided they 
give up violence he said at the opening ceremony of a pagoda at 
ampara 126 miles east of colombo 
the predominantly hindu tamils make up 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people they say they are discriminated against by the 
sinhalese buddhists who control the government and the army 
india predominantly hindu intervened in the conflict largely 
under pressure from its own large tamil minority

thousands of taiwanese rallied peacefully 
sunday to mark the 41st anniversary of antigovernment riots and a 
crackdown that left an estimated 20000 dead 
the nationalist government owes an apology to relatives of 
tens of thousands of victims of the crackdown said chen 
yongshing a doctor and activitist who chaired the peace day 
committee that planned the memorial 
chen told 500 people at a church service in taipei that the 
riots were painful history that cannot be forgotten or 
coveredsimilar church services were held in three other cities 
demonstrators carried banners and listened to speeches by human 
rights activists to mark feb 28 1947 when thousands of native 
taiwanese rioted against the fledgling nationalist government 
researchers estimate that 20000 died when the government 
suppressed the riots 
taiwan came under nationalist administration at the end of world 
war ii when japan relinquished its 50year rule of the island 
nation between the east and south china seas 
the country is controlled by the remnants of the nationalist 
government that fled mainland china in 1949 after losing the civil 
war to the communists 
opposition lawmakers have urged the government to include the 
riots in school textbooks 
in tainan 202 miles south of taipei about 2000 members of the 
opposition democratic progressive party staged a twohour march 
said party official chang kuotang in a telephone interview 
protesters demanded official condolences to victims of the 
riots chang said he said demonstrators would place more than 
2000 floating lanterns on a canals to commemorate the victims 
president lee tenghui criticized dissidents at a press 
conference monday for using the 1947 riots to incite the 
public he said it is against the principle of love to 
repeatedly make the tragedy an annual topic 
lee the first native taiwanese to become president urged the 
citizenry to leave the incident to historians and remove the dark 
shadows from your mind have confidence in your country 
experts however say the deep divisions are fading with time 
the tension has subdued significantly especially during the 
recent years when the government loosened its political controls 
said lai tsehan professor of history at the national normal 
university 
the government has lifted 38 years of martial law and a ban on 
new newspapers as part of its move toward democratic reforms 
last year about 13000 people rallied to mark the anniversary 
openly for the first time 
researchers say the 1947 rioting occurred after a group of 
taiwanese demonstrated in taipei to protest nationalist agents who 
confiscated money and belongings of a woman selling untaxed 
cigarettes the nationalists fired on the crowd and killed a man in 
the incident 
the shooting touched off a series of riots across the island and 
the subsequent response by the government

for nine months the justice department has 
given the impression attorney general edwin meese removed himself 
from the pollard spy case but now it acknowledges he was briefed 
twice about the case and it says he never was excluded 
in what chief department spokesman terry eastland called a 
correction he said meese is only excluded from the espionage case 
against the israeli air force officer who recruited navy 
counterterrorism analyst jonathan pollard as a spy 
meese is free to be briefed and even to make decisions in the 
stillopen pollard case to the extent that they dont involve the 
case against israeli brig gen aviem sella eastland said 
meeses own lawyer nathan lewin was unaware of that 
distinction as recently as last week even though it was lewins 
work for meese and sella in separate cases that triggered the 
exclusion known as a recusal 
the turnabout comes as a government source said independent 
counsel james mckay is examining another meese recusal for clues 
about his motives in dealing with a mideast oil pipeline proposal 
in 1985 
meese hired lewin last may to represent him in mckays 
investigation of whether the attorney general and his attorney e 
robert wallach violated or conspired to violate a federal law 
barring bribes to foreign officials 
in may 1985 meese was recused from all matters involving 
wallach but arranged for wallach to meet national security adviser 
robert mcfarlane to promote the pipeline investigators say that 
examining that meese recusal might help determine whether the 
attorney general was aiding wallachs plan or as lewin argues 
directing it to the proper official 
at the office of government ethics last week general counsel 
donald campbell explained if youre a federal official and 
youve hired a law firm to represent you you should recuse 
yourself that is take no action in any matter involving that firm 
just as a matter of appearances even if you have no financial 
stake 
for that reason eastland said meese advised justice officials 
last may i hereby recuse myself from participating in any matter 
before the department in which the law firm of miller cassidy 
larroca amp lewin represents any party or is otherwise involved 
the washington post reported then that the recusal covered the 
pollard affair the justice department did not dispute that 
pollard was sentenced last year to life in prison for giving 
reams of secrets to israeli agents but justice officials still 
pursued the case in part because sella had fled to israel and has 
not been brought to trial here 
so there was surprise and consternation when the post reported 
feb 19 after being briefed on the case last month meese 
ordered that the pollard case be kept officially open so 
investigators can pursue their inquiry 
asked by the associated press last monday for an explanation 
justice department spokesman john russell said i have problems 
with that account because meese is recused in pollard 
russell bucked the question to deputy chief spokesman pat 
korten citing the same problem korten bucked it to eastland who 
was with meese in california until wednesday 
on tuesday lewin said hed never discussed pollard with meese 
because i think he certainly has recused himself because i am 
representing sella expressing surprise at the post account 
lewin said at the department they have known all along that it 
has been very much up front that he is not involved in pollard 
while eastland sought an answer a senior department official 
demanding anonymity said wednesday there was no problem because 
meese was merely briefed and made no decisions 
some former department lawyers dispute that view one who once 
worked in the attorney generals office said a recusal has 
always meant a chinese wall you are not even kept up to date 
a former justice career lawyer said that to avoid making a 
decision by a wink or a nod briefings were restricted to 
situations where the information was essential to decisions in 
other areas 
but friday afternoon eastland provided an official explanation 
that did not claim an exception for briefings 
he said the client lists regularly provided by lewins firm 
have not included the pollard case and so the attorney general 
is not recused from pollard 
the lists do include the sella case and the attorney general 
has been very careful to avoid taking any action in that case or in 
any other related case where his action might at all affect the 
sella case 
eastland denied meese kept the pollard case open he didnt 
have to because it has been open for some time 
eastland acknowledged that last month and on one previously 
undisclosed occasion assistant attorney general william weld head 
of the criminal division had briefed meese about the pollard case 
without touching on sella 
why the turnabout we were confused about the sella case 
eastland said it was an honest error

rep richard gephardt moves into super tuesday 
territory with an extraordinarily effective television advertising 
campaign that touched raw nerves and won lastminute support among 
voters in earlier democratic presidential contests 
while critics complain that gephardts populist image is an 
insiders affectation and his hardhitting hyundai trade ad is 
based on bad numbers theres little disagreement about the impact 
of the missouri congressmans tv campaign 
the forceful spots created by political veterans david doak and 
robert shrum are credited with putting gephardt over the top in 
iowa and south dakota and enabling him to stop a new hampshire 
slide that could have jostled him out of the second place finish he 
needed and got 
gephardt is the only candidate who struck a chord and i 
suppose he struck it through his tv ads more than anything else 
said larry sabato a university of virginia professor with a 
personal collection of 1600 political video ads 
he had a different message said gene mahan chairman of the 
democratic party in south dakota where gephardt won his most 
recent victory the economy is not good out here gephardt 
related to a lot of people on that he was talking to the working 
people 
in the course of his campaign gephardt has used a biographical 
spot folksy ads boosting the family farm patriotic ads asking 
voters to restore americas soul trade ads promoting his 
hardnosed views testimonials from other politicians and negative 
ads criticizing his democratic rivals 
most of the spots are accompanying him south this week in 
preparation for the super tuesday contests on march 8 along with 
new commercials a campaign spokeswoman said she could not discuss 
some ads began over the weekend in texas others begin monday in 
states including florida oklahoma arkansas north carolina 
georgia and alabama 
undecided voters flocked to gephardt during the last few days 
before the feb 23 south dakota primary a development analysts are 
attributing largely to an aggressive tv campaign against 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
the ad was called belgian a reference to belgian endive 
which a naive dukakis used at the outset of his campaign as an 
example of how iowa farmers could diversify their crops 
a narrator in the gephardt ad cites the endive recommendation 
contrasts dukakis trade and farm positions unfavorably with 
gephardts and calls the governor one of the biggest tax raisers 
in massachusetts history in a version designed for possible use 
in super tuesday states the narrator concludes those are some 
of the reasons why southerners are for gephardt not dukakis 
pause then with dripping sarcasm belgian endive 
people dont really like negative advertising but youd have 
to say it works said mahan where dukakis made his mistake was 
in not responding back to him he just let it sit there 
gephardts main television weapon in the feb 8 iowa caucuses 
was his controversial hyundai ad 30 seconds of soothing music 
taking the edge off a sharp message 
because of trade barriers a 10000 chrysler kcar costs 
48000 in korea gephardt says as scenes from an auto assembly 
plant fill the screen 
the cleancut candidate appears onscreen in white shirt tie and 
black overcoat to conclude his message if the koreans wont change 
their ways he says theyll be left asking themselves how many 
americans are going to pay 48000 for one of their hyundais 
trade experts say the ad is erroneous they also complain that 
it oversimplifies a very complicated issue but that is precisely 
why it works 
its more in the realm of peoples thinking said phil 
roeder a spokesman for the iowa democratic party it was a good 
example for gephardt to use and it obviously worked here as far as 
what the actual cost might be in iowa thats irrelevant because 
the caucuses are over 
one reason the hyundai ad and a hayfilled farming ad appeared 
to reap such dramatic results for gephardt was that they built on 
the type of grassroots organization impossible to recreate across 
the vast super tuesday landscape 
gephardt for example had worked iowa exhaustively for more 
than a year spending hundreds of days there meeting thousands of 
activists shaking countless hands spending innumerable hours on 
the telephone he was no stranger by the time his ads went on 
television after christmas 
his tv spots would not have had an impact had it not been for 
his foundation out here said roeder its only at the end that 
tv mattered and had any sort of impact at all

president george vassiliou ushered in his 
administration sunday by promising to seek direct talks with turkey 
to unify this island split between turkish and greek cypriots for 
14 years 
vassiliou leader of 500000 greek cypriots said shortly after 
taking the oath of office that he would pursue a meeting with 
turkish prime minister turgut oza as soon as possible 
but vassiliou also cautioned that until we reach a just and 
viable settlement the constant improvement of our defensive 
capability is of the higest priority so that we may be able to 
face the worst eventuality 
after the ceremony vassiliou 56 a millionaire businessman won 
the presidency feb 21 as an independent with communist backing 
announced the makeup of his 11member council of ministers nine 
of whom are political newcomers 
vassiliou said any solution to the cyprus crisis must include 
the withdrawal of an estimated 30000 turkish troops and 65000 
settlers on the northern third of the island 
a settlement also would have to allow 200000 greek cypriots to 
return to their northern homes and include international guarantees 
against foreign intervention he said 
the settlement we seek for the cyprus problem is defined by 
the relevant united nations resolutions and is a settlement 
that safeguards the independence sovereignty territorial 
integrity unity and nonalignment of cyprus vassiliou said in 
his inaugural address before the 50seat house of represenatives 
the east mediterranean island has been unofficially partitioned 
since turkey occupied its northern third in 1974 the turkish 
invasion followed a coup by greek cypriots and greek army officers 
supporting a union with greece 
vassiliou charged that 14 years after the invasion turkey is 
methodically turkeyfying our occupied land while the occupation 
troops increase and are supplied with the latest type of armaments 
the settlers from the mainland are also increasing 
suppressing the turkish cypriots and altering the demographic 
composition of the population 
we are faced by the worst calamity in our centurieslong 
history he said 
the turkish cypriot minority which makes up 17 percent of the 
population of 650000 proclaimed its own breakaway state in the 
turkishoccupied north in 1983 the state only has been recognized 
by turkey 
talks between the two sides have been deadlocked for two years 
vassilious predecessor spyros kyprianou refused to resume 
negotiations until turkey withdrew its troops and settlers 
during the campaign vassiliou said he would be flexible in 
negotiations but maintained that the issue of troop withdrawal 
should be tackled first 
addressing the house of representatives composed only of greek 
cypriots since the turkish and greek cypriot communities split in 
1963 vassiliou said it is sad that the representatives of the 
turkish cypriot community are absent 
we hope to have the turkish cypriots among us again soon so 
that in a democratic free cyprus we shall be able to build a 
better peaceful tomorrow for the good of the whole people of 
cyprus 
vassiliou who built the largest business consulting firm in the 
middle east said he supported a free enterprise economy he also 
said cyprus would remain a nonaligned nation

when the arizona senate opens gov evan 
mechams impeachment trial monday it will embark on a course laid 
out in england as a way to remove cruel kings and brought to 
america in colonial days as a way to protect democracy 
but despite the long and sometimes colorful history of 
impeachment legal scholars say the seldomused laws are ill 
defined arizona lawmakers grappling with mechams fate have to 
make up many rules as they go along 
the arizona constitution provides few standards or procedures 
for how the senate is to perform its role said university of 
arizona law professor robert glennon 
mecham was impeached feb 5 by the arizona house of 
representatives on allegations of concealing a 350000 campaign 
loan misusing 80000 from a special fund and attempting to thwart 
an investigation of an alleged death threat involving a state 
official 
the impeachment amounts to an indictment and the senate process 
to a trial the 30 senators will act as both judge and jury for the 
embattled republican governor 
but an impeachment trial is not a criminal trial its purely 
part of the political system the only penalty the governor faces 
is removal from office 
its basically youre fired glennon said impeachment 
is a way to get out of office those officials that violate the 
public trust 
even before mechams impeachment trial begins political 
arguments arising from the legal vagueness have abounded in the 
republicancontrolled senate 
while setting the rules the senators have agreed for example 
that the evidence against mecham must be clear and convincing 
in order to find him guilty thats not as rigid as the requirement 
in criminal trials that guilt be beyond a reasonable doubt but 
it is tougher than the civil standard of a preponderance of the 
evidence more than half for a verdict 
there is nothing in the constitution about that and the 
senators can do whatever they want glennon said 
its typical of the constitution to leave things so open due 
process and equal protection are very vague words but we have 
thousands and thousands of cases that define what they mean in 
impeachment we have so few cases its not always clear he said 
senators are constitutionally required to do justice according 
to law and evidence 
even the definition of an impeachable offense has been argued 
through history 
former president richard nixon whose watergate activities were 
probed by an impeachment committee in the us house of 
representatives argued that a misdeed had to be dastardly enough 
to deserve a criminal indictment to be impeachable 
but thats not necessarily true glennon said impeachment 
doesnt have to involve illegal activities only high crimes 
misdemeanors or malfeasance in arizona 
no court in arizona has specifically defined high crimes and 
misdemeanors regarding impeachment but the arizona supreme court 
has said malfeasance occurs if an elected official commits an act 
which is either positively wrong or unlawful according to 
arizona supreme court chief justice frank gordon 
the trial may look to observers like a criminal trial but all 
30 senators will have a chance to question witnesses much like a 
congressional hearing a twothirds vote 20 senators is 
required to convict the governor 
gordon the chief justice will sit as a referee and be called 
the presiding officer five members of the house through their 
attorneys will sit as the board of managers and handle the 
prosecution mecham will have his own defense attorneys 
and there wont be any attempt to have an impartial jury 
it is quite clear that the framers of the us constitution 
from which the arizona law is drawn chose to make the senate as 
judge and jury glennon said the governor has no right to 12 
ignorant lay people in this deal in impeachment there is no 
intent to have an impartial jury the framers thought the fact that 
the senators would know something about the case was good 
mecham also has been indicted in state district court on six 
felony counts involving the 350000 loan which amounted to about 
a third of his campaign war chest and faces a criminal trial march 
22 he faces a recall election may 17 
he is the 16th governor to be impeached in us history six 
have been convicted and removed from office he is the first 
arizona governor to be impeached 
if convicted by the senate mecham would be succeeded by 
secretary of state rose mofford a democrat who is acting governor 
pending the impeachment trials outcome

a young man whose body was used for a 
medical experiment while he was in a deep coma died on sunday 
family members said 
the revelation last tuesday that an anesthesiologist had 
performed an experiment on pacal louette 24 considered at the 
time clinically dead touched off a scandal about the ethics of 
using human beings as guinea pigs 
louette injured in an auto accident earlier this year died 
sunday morning at amiens north hospital his fatherinlaw emile 
collard said 
it was not immediately known whether there was a link between 
the death and the experiment in which dr alain milhaud of the 
regional hospital center of amiens placed louette on a sabotaged 
medical device 
milhaud was trying to see if the effects would match those of a 
similar case which has resulted in a trial of three doctors 
last wednesday health minister michele barzach suspended 
milhaud from his duties as chief anesthesiologist at the hospital 
center 
president francois mitterrand condemned such medical exercises 
saying neither scientific progress nor the search for truth could 
justify them 
milhaud had told his superiors about the experiment which he 
videotaped 
it was the second time milhaud said he had used a comatose human 
being for an experiment in 1985 he experimented on a 20yearold 
comatose man in a chronic vegetative state setting off a scandal 
that person also died but no link was established between the 
experiment and the death 
at the time milhaud called such patients almost perfect human 
models who constitute intermediaries between animal and man 
the latest experiment was made public in testimony tuesday by 
dr jean lassner a medical expert at a trial in the town of 
poitiers where three doctors are charged in connection with the 
1984 death of a 33yearold woman 
the woman nicole berneron died after the removal of a tumor 
she apparently had received nitrogen oxide instead of oxygen during 
resuscitation a report showed that the tubes of the resuscitation 
system had been switched 
milhaud had informed lassner of his experiment but has refused 
all comment since the court testimony

lisa carlson borrowed a truck to take her 
husbands body to the crematory after he shot himself in 1981 in 
the early hours of the morning she could think clearly enough only 
to know she didnt have the money to pay a funeral home 
his ashes are buried in the garden behind their country home 
the spot marked by a slab of granite on which she etched his name 
john brackett with a pocket knife 
she regrets only that she didnt share the intimate farewell 
with her husbands mother and the couples children 
now carlson has written a book to help other people make their 
own funeral arrangements she began writing it after her current 
husband stephen and his three brothers buried their mother in a 
pine box atop a ridge 
its very easy to understand why people give it away to a 
funeral home and indeed if i had had the money i would have 
given away a very special opportunity carlson said during a 
recent interview at her home 
her book caring for your own dead includes a directory of 
each states laws on funeral arrangements cremation and home 
burial a glossary of terms and instructions on completing a death 
certificate it also includes a listing of medical schools that 
accept body donations 
i really tried to take the mystery out of body disposition 
carlson said 
many states allow funerals to be handled privately but carlson 
said there may be obstacles to obtaining needed information on 
short notice including some funeral directors reluctant to offer 
prices over the telephone and local officials unaccustomed to the 
idea she credits many in the funeral industry for their help 
during her nine months of researching the book 
she found that anyone in vermont can do a home burial as long as 
technical requirements involving the death certificate are met if 
the burial is to be on private property it must be away from power 
lines and water and may be subject to local zoning restrictions 
the town clerk keeps a map of private burial plots 
according to carlson a cremation could cost as little as 130 
including a permit transportation and a box would add to the cost 
the professional services and cost of the casket are two of 
the major expenses carlson said 
in 1987 the average cost of a funeral including professional 
services and a casket was 2935 according to an industry 
newsletter funeral service insider 
carlson took on her husbands funeral first from financial 
necessity but then she realized that not only was it all right 
it became clear to me that i needed to do it 
one funeral director whom she had interviewed for the book 
called her after his 7yearold son died 
he didnt realize until afterwards how important it was for 
him to be involved personally she said 
most states do not limit the family in caring for their dead 
but some prohibit home burial and limit the scattering of ashes 
her book says about 80 percent of the 500 crematories carlson 
contacted across the country will accept a body from someone other 
than a funeral director 
no state requires a body to be embalmed in every case but many 
require it if a person died of a contagious disease the book says 
in alaska a body may not be closed after an autopsy in most of 
california burial must be in an established cemetery colorado has 
no state licensing requirements for funeral directors so anyone 
may handle a funeral 
in new england according to carlsons book there are limits on 
private funerals and home burial in new hampshire connecticut 
massachusetts and new york 
other states where the familys involvement in funeral 
arrangements may be limited are indiana louisiana massachusetts 
michigan minnesota nebraska nevada new jersey ohio and west 
virginia she says

presidential candidates from congress work in 
a system where its hard to avoid some flipflopping on issues but 
when a candidate cant offer convincing explanations those charges 
take root with voters experts say 
two democratic candidates battling for super tuesday votes 
missouri rep richard gephardt and tennessee sen albert gore have 
been the most frequent targets even trading those accusations 
themselves both as legislators have voted on two sides of 
several issues 
gephardt has taken fire for moving to the left after deciding to 
run for president on abortion trade and social issues gore has 
become more conservative especially on defense matters 
gordon jones vice president of the heritage foundation a 
conservative washington think tank said there are a lot of 
reasons to vote differently at different times legislative 
strategy means sometimes youve got to hold your nose and vote 
he said 
but that doesnt mean voters should dismiss flipflops lightly 
he said and the candidates should provide substantial reasons 
the most damaging thing to dick gephardt is his response to 
why he voted for the 1981 reagan tax cut said norman ornstein 
who studies congress and politics at the american enterprise 
institute 
during his campaign first he said he fought it voting for 
it only after a democratic alternative failed then he said he 
was proud of it ornstein said 
jones said gore stumbled when he recently tried to deny voting 
for an antiabortion amendment then jones said the question 
becomes whether he remembers his record right and if hes 
falsifying his record 
few members of congress can keep their voting records pure 
often several issues are packaged together with neither side 
getting a clear victory 
for example the house is scheduled this week to consider a 
compromise bill liberals might support it because of its general 
broadening of legal protections for women and minorities but to do 
so theyve got to swallow an antiabortion provision 
to take an individual vote and say that that means somebody 
stood for this or stood for that sometimes takes a lot of 
stretching ornstein said you cant pay a whole lot of 
attention to the individual charges being made not as much as to 
the defense being made he said 
liberal and conservative groups who release annual studies of 
congressional records carefully select votes they believe show the 
true stance of a politician sometimes the tallies are on 
procedural motions or other technicalities obscure to voters 
only a handful of lawmakers get 100 percent ratings from either 
the conservative or liberal groups 
marc pearl national director of americans for democratic 
action a liberal organization said his groups ratings can help 
voters look at the bigger picture rather than individual votes on 
single issues voters should be most aware of when candidates 
abandon longheld positions he said 
i would define a flipflop as when a person had a consistent 
position for a number of years then recently for whatever 
reasons not explained there has been a change in attitude he 
said 
it might be unfair for example to say vice president george 
bush flipflopped because six years he praised ousted philippines 
president ferdinand marcos and now he supports the new government 
gephardt was a consistent abortion opponent until he started to 
run for president and gore consistently opposed military aid to the 
contra rebels in nicaragua now they have changed their positions 
and i think it is legitimate to ask tell us what the change 
process was he said 
i dont want my president locked into an ideology he said 
but i think its legitimate to ask them what were the reasons 
why 
voters are willing to accept changes in position if they believe 
they are sincere he said ronald reagan was on the board of ada 
forty years ago you want to talk about flipflopping pearl 
said 
bob canavan director of the voter education project of the 
american association of retired people said his organization 
avoids releasing votingrecord scorecards on the politically 
explosive issues surrounding social security 
there are so many other things such as committee activities 
putting together legislation which dont show up with a vote 
tally he said the organization also questions whether an 
objective scorecard can be produced 
candidates meanwhile dont always see the inconsistencies in 
their own positions 
politicians dont lie jones said they just have an 
infinite capacity for selfdelusion

during the first month of a cigarette 
liability trial antitobacco attorneys have introduced stacks of 
documents and presented 10 witnesses through much of the evidence 
runs a common thread lawyers and more lawyers 
attorneys for the plaintiff argue that cigarette company 
attorneys kept a keen eye on smoking and health research helped 
shape corporate policy and vetoed putting safer smokes on the 
market 
one reason according to the plaintiffs theory is because the 
companies felt that if they acknowledged the dangers of smoking 
either through public statements or marketing of a less dangerous 
product they would be open to lawsuits over existing cigarettes 
the trial of philip morris co liggett group inc and lorillard 
inc makers of the brands that rose cipollone smoked for 40 years 
before she died of lung cancer at the age of 58 in 1984 enters its 
second month monday her husband antonio is pursuing a suit she 
filed before she died and is asking for unspecified damages 
attorneys for the tobacco companies say legal concerns did not 
dictate research 
lawyers are involved in decisions of industry all over the 
place said chuck wall an attorney for the kansas city mo of 
firm shook hardy amp bacon which represents morris and lorillard 
he said lawyers need to be familiar with research and scientific 
developments because of the rising tide of lawsuits against the 
cigarettemakers since the early 1950s and to advise clients on 
advertising and testimony before public bodies 
the evidence so far has addressed three of the plaintiffs 
allegations that the defendants knew how to make a safer 
cigarette but didnt knew of potential health hazards from the 
1920s through 1940s but did not act enough on the knowledge and 
failed to tell consumers and sought to suppress or shape in their 
favor research on the hazards of smoking 
the jury has heard the testimony of former inhouse and external 
researchers top corporate executives and an expert on smoking and 
health 
testimony during most of last week was from joseph f cullman 
iii chairman emeritus and former president of philip morris 
marc z edell representing the cipollone estate asked cullman 
for example if the companys general counsel advised him on 
cigarette smoking and health issues 
he wouldnt advise cullman said he would monitor them 
id say 
several confidential documents introduced into evidence thursday 
appear to indicate the role of lawyers 
a letter dated april 29 1974 from the chairman of rj 
reynolds to an official of the council for tobacco research 
describes a committee of manufacturers formed to study 
industryfunded research programs the council itself was funded by 
tobacco companies 
the reynolds executive named the committees chairman as david 
r hardy the named partner in the shook hardy firm handling the 
current trial 
a july 3 1974 memo to committee members from another shook 
hardy attorney speaks of gaps in knowledge in the 
smokinghealth field 
included is mention of a paper by tobacco council lawyer ed 
jacob with a section described as a summarization and slight 
updating of research recommendations 
before hardy assumed control of the manufacturers research 
study committee he corresponded with a tobacco council scientist 
another memo showed 
a dec 24 1969 letter indicates the researcher arthur furst 
had discussed with jacob the work of a british cancer researcher 
furst recommended to hardy that the british researcher hj 
eysenck a psychologist at the bethlem royal and maudsley hospitals 
in london be given money for a pilot project the letter said 
eysenck had a theory that there may be a relationship between the 
appearance of cancer for some people and their emotional make up 
twelve years later eysenck wrote to jacob to ask for more 
research council funding although it is unclear from the letter 
also introduced last week what the project involved

president hafez assad has hinted that 
syria may be able to help free kidnapped lt col william r 
higgins a us official said sunday 
the official who spoke in jerusalem on condition of anonymity 
said assad told secretary of state george p shultz during his 
visit to damascus on saturday that he had some ideas about 
higgins case 
the official said shultz and assad talked about the situation in 
lebanon but declined to elaborate we cant get into it he 
said when pressed for details 
higgins 43 of danville ky headed a un observer team 
attached to the un peacekeeping force in south lebanon he was 
kidnapped feb 17 while returning to un headquarters in naqoura 
from the port city of tyre 
the kidnapping brought to 25 the number of foreign hostages held 
in lebanon terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press is the longest held he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
a proiranian shiite moslem faction calling itself the 
oppressed on earth claimed responsibility for higgins 
abduction and said he was a cia spy us and un officials denied 
the accusation 
in beirut a senior militia official said sunday that higgins 
kidnapping has imperiled lebanons shiite moslem sect 
this is the first abduction that has brought the sects two 
giants close to a headon collision said abdulmajid saleh 
chief political officer of justice minister nabih berris 
mainstream shiite amal militia in south lebanon 
the syrianallied amal has been at loggerheads with the 
iranianbacked extremist hezbollah or party of god for several 
years but the kidnapping has increased tensions 
amal has viewed the abduction as a challenge to its dominance in 
the tyre region and has vowed to leave no stone unturned in south 
lebanon to rescue the combatdecorated vietnam veteran hezbollah 
praised the abduction and called higgins a filthy american 
saleh told reporters in tyre that the abduction was more of a 
peril to the shiite community than to the united states it has 
been threatening to kindle an intercommunal strife 
saleh said an unidentified third party was currently engaged in 
a mediation effort to ensure higgins release and head off an 
amalhezbollah clash 
in damascus information minister mohammed salman said sunday 
that syria had assured shultz of its continued efforts to gain 
higgins release 
in an interview with the associated press salman said syrias 
policy is to work with friendly organizations in lebanon in 
particular the amal militia to obtain the release of the onetime 
aide to former us defense secretary caspar weinberger 
salman said president reagan had asked assad for help in 
securing higgins release 
syrian officials noted with irony reagans request and the 
recent parade of us officials to damascus just two years ago the 
united states accused syria of terrorism brought its ambassador 
home and slapped sanctions against it 
salman said he believed the turnabout came when washington 
realized that no middle east settlement was possible without syria 
and the palestine liberation organization 
last october us ambassador william eagleton returned to his 
post in damacus 
salman said eagleton informed him 10 days ago that another 
sanction restrictions on visas for syrians tarveling to the united 
states had been lifted 
shultz explaining the us shift has said syria had distanced 
itself from terrorism 
last year syria closed the damascus office of palestinian 
terrorist mastermind abu nidal 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna split from the plo 
in the early 1970s he was convicted in absentia in italy earlier 
this month of masterminding a 1985 terrorist attack on a rome 
airport in which 16 people were killed

sen al gore is looking into borrowing money 
for extensive tv ads in the super tuesday states critical to his 
presidential campaign but a spokesman said sunday he has taken no 
loans yet 
weve been exploring options about borrowing money because we 
want to have a comprehensive media buy said press spokesman mike 
kopp 
the tennessee senator is running a sonofthesouth campaign and 
has vowed to spend more than any rival campaign on the super 
tuesday primaries 
but campaign finance reports through january show gore was well 
behind rival michael dukakis in spending 
gore began running his commercials three weeks ago on cable tv 
nationwide and on local tv in the 14 southern super tuesday states 
and a new series of ads begins tuesday kopp said 
to date no loans have been taken he said but added that 
our finance people have talked to banks to line up the 
possibilities 
aftern ending january with 2 million in the bank gore has 
boosted that to more than 3 million through fundraisers and mail 
kopp said 
campaign finance reports show that dukakis as of jan 31 had 
spent more in 13 of the 20 super tuesday states than any democrat 
in the race and close to 1 million in all the super tuesday 
states the massachusetts governor had 4 million in the bank at 
the end of january and his campaign says he is now raising 20000 
a day 
gore was a distant second spending only 287542 by the end of 
january 
that was less even than the 345280 spent by his cashpoor 
democratic rival sen paul simon of illinois who has now decided to 
sit out super tuesday 
rep richard gephardt of missouri reported spending 482697 on 
super tuesday states through january 
the figures are from the latest financial disclosure statements 
the candidates filed with the federal election commission covering 
the period through jan 31 
on the republican side vice president george bush had husbanded 
his ample resources while rivals sen bob dole and pat robertson 
both swept past him in laying groundwork for super tuesday 
most of the campaigns with gore the notable exception turned 
their attention to feb 8 iowa contest and feb 16 primary in new 
hampshire then directed their resources to the super tuesday 
states in the latter part of this month figures for february have 
not yet been released 
robertson the former tv evangelist spent more than anyone in 
early super tuesday efforts his total of 32 million included 
11 million in texas which was the biggest allocation reported by 
any of the campaigns for a single state 
bush on the other hand spent 335743 in his adoptive home 
state of texas and 17 overall in the super tuesday states and 
dole reported 81645 in texas expenditures and 2 million overall 
aside from texas bush was putting most of his money 416449 
into florida as of jan 31 dole had spent 150744 in florida and 
robertson 617933 
super tuesday spending could spell strategy problems for 
robertson because as of the end of january he had already spent 
176 million against the 23 million overall ceiling imposed on 
candidates who receive federal matching funds 
the other republican candidate rep jack kemp of new york 
whose campaign has rowed through turbulent financial waters 
reported spending of 11312 in texas 8529 in florida and 
819311 overall however 723027 of his money was allocated to 
massachusetts where several campaigns bought heavily on boston tv 
stations because that market includes viewers in neighboring new 
hampshire 
kemp adviser charlie black said last week that the campaign does 
not anticipate any new loans after borrowing heavily against his 
federal matching funds last year and in january kemp planned to 
run tv ads in seven super tuesday states 
the democrats have raised and spent less money overall than the 
republicans 
dukakis the democratic leader had put most of his resources 
into texas 301829 florida 206861 and north carolina 
146582 
gephardt had spent 482697 on the march 8 contests but most of 
that 316822 was devoted to his home state of missouri which 
his opponents are virtually ignoring 
his spokeswoman ali webb said sunday that the campaign goal 
was to spend 2 million on super tuesday gephardt has targeted six 
super tuesday states for tv texas florida oklahoma arkansas 
north carolina alabama and georgia and will buy in selected 
markets in other states she said 
the gephardt campaign which ended january in debt is 
spending money as fast as it comes in webb said 
as of jan 31 his biggest super tuesday state outside missouri 
was texas where he spent 69809 
gores biggest spending was also in texas 74921 
simon who last week announced he would skip super tuesday but 
stay in the race for later contests had devoted most of his 
345280 in super tuesday spending to north carolina where he 
spent 153582 
jesse jackson had spent less than 10000 in just three super 
tuesday states north carolina maryland and kentucky jackson is 
expected to run strongly across the south where 14 states are 
among the super tuesday battles 
he has raised considerably less money than his competitors but 
his campaign concentrates on the free media that he engenders by 
virture of his international personality status and his ability to 
draw large crowds virtually everywhere he goes 
gary hart the former senator from colorado had spent 37814 
in texas as of jan 31 and just 12000 in five other super 
tuesday states

anglican archbishop desmond 
tutu and other religious leaders called sunday for a sweeping 
campaign of defiance against new restrictions on opposition groups 
prominent clergy told their congregations that the church would 
become more active in opposing apartheid now that the government 
has banned political activity by 18 opposition groups they called 
for a churchled campaign against the latest crackdown 
we have no option but to engage in activities that now are 
prohibited said the rev frank chikane general secretary of the 
south african council of churches 
no matter what the consequences we will continue to seek the 
unbanning of democratic organizations and the transfer of power 
from the white minority to all the people chikane told about 200 
people at central methodist church in johannesburg 
the government on wednesday banned the 18 blackled groups from 
political activity and placed restrictions on the activities of 18 
senior black leaders 
church groups werent included in the crackdown and 
theoretically still were free to engage in resistance campaigns 
but most forms of peaceful protest still are banned under existing 
regulations 
the outlawing of the countrys leading antiapartheid groups 
most of them affiliated with the united democratic front coalition 
is viewed as a clear sign that the government intends to maintain a

high maple syrup prices after two abysmal 
sugaring seasons have prompted more people to tap more trees as the 
sap starts running this year new hampshires agriculture chief 
says 
new hampshire syrup sells for as much as 43 a gallon nearly 
double the price before backtoback bad seasons but demand has 
not lagged said agriculture commissioner stephen taylor 
whats really kept it up there is packaging in ever smaller 
packages we talk about the price per gallon but nobody ever buys a 
gallon of syrup anymore taylor said in an interview last week 
the 150000 gallons of maple syrup sold annually in new 
hampshire most of it in gift shops and country stores comes in 
jugs as small as a pint or less taylor said but not all of it 
comes from new hampshire 
theres some new production coming out of the woodwork in 
ontario ohio indiana that is sold bulk to packagers in new 
hampshire taylor said but we have the aura a geographic 
chauvinism favoring new england maple syrup 
state law ensures that if you call it new hampshire maple 
syrup it has to be made in new hampshire he said 
taylor estimated there are 400 commercial maple syrup producers 
in new hampshire and 1000 backyard farmtype people 
we will tap a lot more trees this year as a result of high 
prices he said sales of equipment and tubing indicate a lot 
more people are getting in this year 
sap runs when temperatures dip below freezing at night and rise 
to the 40s in the day conditions that began to occur in some 
places earlier this month 
new hampshire produced 100000 gallons of syrup in its best 
year 1984 but during the last two years warm weather day and 
night predominated and production was around 30 percent of normal 
technology is revolutionizing the sugaring industry taylor 
said he estimated more than 80 percent of taps this year will feed 
into tubing that carries sap directly to evaporators and other 
processing equipment rather than into buckets 
taylor says higher syrup prices staying around for awhile 
regardless of how good this season is 
if we go in with cupboard bare no carryover syrup from last 
season prices will be substantially higher than previous years 
even with a bumper crop 
a coowner of the states largest syrup producer bascoms sugar 
house in acworth said she was puzzled that demand has remained 
stable despite the price 
i dont buy maple syrup i cant explain it liz bascom 
said we made less gallons at a higher price last year and we 
came out about the same

human occupation without protection said moxley who moved his 
office and staff to a courthouse annex last week after levels of 
0175 were reported in his office

never mind columbus never mind the globes in 
classrooms everywhere never mind those pictures from space of 
earth as a big blue marble 
when you ask children in the early elementary grades what they 
really think most believe what their eyes tell them the earth is 
flat 
that at least is what alan lightman a harvard physicist and 
astronomy teacher philip sadler say 
the two writing in science and children magazine suggest 
that educators are living in a dream world if they assume young 
children understand the earth is round 
nearly 500 years ago columbus proved that the earth was 
round todays students still dont believe it they write in the 
february issue of the science teachers journal 
they cite several studies done in the united states israel and 
nepal in the 1970s and early 1980s in which school children in the 
early grades consistently turned out to be flatearthers 
one of the first scientific facts we announce to our children 
is that the earth is round that flat flat ground we walk on ride 
on and play on stretching endless miles in perfect and reliable 
flatness actually wraps around on itself to form a giant ball 
preposterous yet a scientific fact they said but if we 
expect young children to believe this story were wrong 
lightman a research physicist at the smithsonian astrophysical 
observatory and lecturer at harvard and sadler director of 
project star a high school astronomy curriculum recently asked 65 
elementary teachers to predict how pupils would draw the earth 
the teachers thought 65 percent of kindergarteners knew the 
earth was round 85 percent of the firstgraders 95 percent of the 
second graders and everyone in third grade 
actually according to past studies only 5 percent of second 
graders know the earth is round 40 percent of third graders 55 
percent of fourth graders and 75 percent of fifth graders 
even fourth graders who say the earth is round often picture a 
flat part where people live in the interior of the ball they 
said others draw the earth as a giant pancake or as a curved sky 
covering a flat ground 
the authors offer a solution for enlightening junior 
flatearthers 
they recommend teachers buy a big latex weather balloon at an 
armynavy or surplus store and inflate it to 10 feet 
while a child holds her cheek against the balloon and looks at 
its horizon slowly move a toy ship across the surface of the 
balloon toward the child as the ship comes over the horizon it 
is revealed in parts the top mast first just as it would be in 
the ocean 
but on the flat surface of a large table the child sees the 
entire ship at once no matter how far away it is 
demonstrating this experiment on the cover of science and 
children are lightmans own 7yearold daughter elyse and a 
classmate at alcott school in concord mass 
lightman acknowledged in an interview that there arent many 
flatearthers by the fifth or sixth grade 
so why bother to disabuse them of the notion at an earlier age 
its never too early an age to begin appreciating that the 
world is not always as it seems said lightman

antigovernment protesters sunday 
exploded homemade bombs and set vehicles ablaze in the capital to 
protest parliament elections an opposition leader said three 
people were killed 
sheik hasina leader of the opposition awami league blamed the 
blasts on government intruders and said that police took away 
the three bodies there was no immediate confirmation from the 
police 
after the explosions helmeted riot police broke up crowds with 
tear gas shells and charged with bamboo staves 
at least 10 people were injured three critically including 
local reporters and photographers witnesses said 
the violence began shortly after hasina and opposition leader 
khaleda zia addressed separate rallies at the citys main square 
the women have led a series of strikes and demonstrations since 
nov 10 to try to oust president hussain muhammad ershad the 
former army general who took power in a bloodless coup in 1982 
both women have pledged to boycott thursdays parliamentary 
election and have called for a nationwide strike wednesday and 
thursday to discourage voting they contend that fair elections 
cannot be held while ershad remains in power 
ershads jatiya party and several minor opposition parties have 
put up candidates for the 300 elected seats of parliament 
ershad who has vowed not to resign has ordered army troops 
deployed to allow balloting to be held officials say 300000 
soldiers and police will be on duty election day 
but a big turnout is not expected 
honestly speaking i do not even know the names of the 
candidates for the parliament from my constituency said rafiqul 
islam a 45yearold farmer in the village of konnapara 15 miles 
west of dhaka 
there is no campaigning by the candidates this time he 
said even the people are not talking about it 
more than 80 percent of bangladeshs 105 million people live in 
rural areas during recent visits to villages in the savar district 
and neighboring manikganj the only signs of politicking were stray 
posters showing the plow symbol of ershads jatiya party and the 
torch used by a grouping of small opposition parties 
but a lack of interest doesnt mean the campaign has been 
uneventful 
three candidates have been shot to death in cities like dhaka 
the capital and chittagong in the south homemade bombs have been 
thrown and other strongarm tactics used to disrupt campaigning 
in addition the antiershad campaign has led to at least 25 
deaths and seriously damaged the already downtrodden economy of 
bangladesh among the worlds poorest nations 
this election is not going to resolve the political and 
economic crisis confronting bangladesh said a senior asian 
diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity the election will 
only accelerate the process of bloody confrontation 
on sunday about 5000 people attended the opposition rallies 
which ended peacefully 
but then some protesters split away in groups of about 20 or 25 
and rampaged through the downtown area hurling bricks at shops and 
passing cars witnesses said 
the protesters set fire to at least 12 vehicles some of them 
cars and jeeps belonging to the government they added 
demonstrators also damaged and burned some makeshift camps set 
up by candidates for their campaign workers 
a number of homemade bombs were thrown near the city square and 
blasts were also heard around the dhaka university campus a hotbed 
of antigovernment protests 
the rioters were dispersed by about 300 policemen who were 
stoned near the campus 
hasina repeated her appeal to the military and civilian 
administration to try to block the farcical polls called by 
ershad 
the military has been the driving force in bangladeshs 
politics in the countrys 17year history every change in 
government has been by coup after he seized power in 1982 ershad 
58 was elected president in a 1986 vote that the opposition 
boycotted and contends was rigged

casually dressed and moving easily on his 
artificial limb edward m kennedy jr greeted democratic activists 
at the core of the kennedy familys political base a union hall in 
a heavily irishcatholic section of boston 
the younger kennedys first priority is winning reelection for 
his father to the us senate but as to the inevitable questions 
about his own political future he admitted saturday he is getting 
good practical experience 
kennedy 26 resigned his position as head of facing the 
challenge inc a nonprofit group he founded in 1985 devoted to 
eliminating barriers for the physically and mentally disabled 
as cochairman of his fathers fifth reelection campaign along 
with his sister kara kennedy spends all his working time at 
campaign headquarters or on the road across massachusetts meeting 
local supporters drumming up new backers and fighting to get 
people excited about a race which to date has only one candidate 
whether my father draws a strong opponent or a weak opponent 
its still necessary for him to know whats going on in different 
communities and for my father to be able to tell people what hes 
done for massachusetts kennedy said 
when news of ted jrs involvement in the campaign became known 
last fall observers assumed the post amounted to a training ground 
for the younger kennedy to seek political office 
kennedy said saturday he has not decided whether to return to 
facing the challenge after the senate campaign concludes and while 
he didnt rule out seeking office he said he has no specific plans 
if youre asking me am i going to be involved and active in 
my community the answer is yes said kennedy who lives in 
boston i am always going to be active and concerned about issues 
i dont have any plans right now im concentrating on my 
fathers reelection but he added it is good practical 
experience 
kennedy got some good practical experience in bostons 
dorchester section saturday where he attended a state democratic 
party caucus at florian hall home of one of bostons firefighters 
union locals democrats of irish descent formed the backbone of 
john f kennedys political base in the 1940s and the kennedy 
family appears to have held onto that popularity 
anybody in the kennedy family has his head on straight said 
camilla duffy of dorchester who is gathering nomination signatures 
for the senators reelection campaign 
many of the roughly 100 democratic activists recognized kennedy 
from his work for the disabled and greeted him warmly 
kennedy lost his right leg above the knee to cancer in 1973 he 
has remained active in skiing swimming and weight lifting 
im lucky to be alive kennedy said his own return to a 
full and active life he said was all too exceptional there are 
other people who dont have the same opportunities 
state democratic party chairman chester atkins also attending 
the caucus said democrats would welcome a campaign by the younger 
kennedy hes been a great campaigner he cares deeply about 
people atkins said and as for kennedys political career i 
have to assume hell have the opportunity 
joseph kennedy ii gained some attention before running for 
office by saying he was unsure of the ability of government to help 
people a position he modified after his election to congress on 
that score edward kennedy jr said he has no doubts 
i am one who really believes that public service is an 
honorable profession its what my whole family has believed ive 
had a couple of uncles who gave their lives for public service 
people who think they dont have a say i really reject that 
they can whether in this hall or a parish a homeless shelter

chrysler corps plans to close a wisconsin 
assembly plant and its admission that it might sell its acustar 
inc parts subsidiary are fueling worker anger and distrust as the 
two sides head into this summers national contract talks 
chryslers parts operations were grouped into the subsidiary 
last spring but most of acustars 28000 workers have been with 
chrysler since it battled back from the brink of bankruptcy early 
in the decade when they granted concessions to keep the company 
afloat 
chrysler workers think the potential sale now that the no 3 
carmaker is again earning billiondollar profits indicates they 
wont be able to trust the company in the contract negotiations 
more than 1000 workers vented their anger last week outside 
chryslers highland park headquarters waving signs and shouting 
strike strike at an emotional rally led by united auto 
workers vice president marc stepp 
one sign read concessions in 79 the shaft in 88 
stepp who will lead negotiations with chrysler said he will 
give uaw locals permission to strike on a plantbyplant basis 
based on local disagreements but because of the acustar issue 
workers also are threatening to stop participating with 
management on a variety of joint programs like quality control 
the acustar controversy comes on top of chryslers announcement 
that it will close its assembly plant at kenosha wis this year 
and idle 5500 workers chrysler acquired the plant last year when 
it bought american motors 
state and local officials charged that chrysler had promised to 
keep the plant running for five years wisconsins governor 
threatened to sue and last week the uaw went to court on its own 
in an attempt to keep the plant open 
many of these workers gave concessions and made considerable 
sacrifices to help the company make it said harley shaiken a 
labor and technology expert at the university of california at san 
diego 
they thought they were investing in their future and acustar 
represents an uncertain future if its sold chrysler 
underestimated the strength of the reaction and the fact that it 
has spread beyond acustar workers and affected the entire 
company he said 
one of those workers is roger fitzpatrick a member of uaw local 
1435 at an acustar machining plant in perrysburg ohio 
yes we will strike he said at last weeks rally 
whatever it takes to keep them from selling it 
were also going to shut down all quality meetings anything 
thats joint with management and the union we will not attend 
none of them 
chrysler vice president baron bates said the company is still 
weighing the acustar sale he said the workers anger and their 
future under a new owner will be factors in the decision 
bates said chrysler views the bitter responses to the kenosha 
closing and the backlash against the acustar sale as two separate 
issues rather than a snowballing deterioration in labor relations 
there is also tension over chryslers continuing efforts to get 
more work out of fewer employees 
whats irritating workers is not simply acustar that has 
served as a lightning rod for other issues shaiken said 
theres a lot of pressure in chrysler plants 
workers see another threat with the sale chrysler could become 
the first big three automaker to follow the japanese model of 
treating parts and assembly workers as two distinct classes 
if acustar is sold its workers face lower wages and benefits 
and probably wont receive the job protections the uaw won in the 
threeyear contracts negotiated last fall with ford motor co and 
general motors corp 
chrysler has until sept 14 when its current threeyear 
contract expires to sell acustar and restructure itself as a 
japanesestyle maker that builds engines and transmissions 
assembles vehicles and depends on outside suppliers for all other 
parts 
after the 70000worker contract expires chrysler almost 
certainly will have to accept the pattern contract established at 
ford and gm last fall that makes layoffs for reasons other than 
slow sales costly and difficult 
the contract also discourages moving work to outside suppliers 
the uaw successfully resisted attempts by gm and ford to 
establish separate pay and benefit scales for parts workers last 
fall and doesnt want a precedent that would encourage them to try 
again in 1990 
the stakes here go well beyond chrysler shaiken said 
the pay of chrysler workers who gave concessions from 1979 
through 1983 returned to parity with workers at ford and gm in a 
1984 contract that included a basepay increase in 1987 auto 
workers earn an average 1215 an hour in wages and 810 an hour 
in benefits

lengthy battle when the state coastal commission approved a 
twostory commercial and office building on a lot adjacent to the 
actors hogs breath inn 
eastwood was on location filming his latest dirty harry film 
and couldnt be reached for comment about the action taken friday 
six years after the project on the 7500squarefoot lot in 
downtown carmel was proposed 
eastwoods fight with city planning officials was partial 
inspiration for his entry into politics in a community he 
considered hostile to developers and it provided a plank in his 
1985 mayoral campaign 
he recently announced that he will not seek a second term when 
his current term expires in may 
eastwood sued the city when planners and the council said his 
project was too bulky then compromised on the design to gain 
approval

fourteen months afer he grasped his 
longsought prize the governorship of arizona evan mecham returns 
to the state capitol from exile monday for a senate impeachment 
trial which could end his political life 
in recent days mecham has battled to stop the trial he has 
said that his constitutional rights are being violated he hired 
new lawyers who petitioned senators and the state supreme court to 
halt the proceedings 
but the senate would tolerate no delays and the supreme court 
said it could not breach the separation of powers doctrine by 
interfering in a legislative matter 
the people of this state should be as scared and frightened as 
all getout mecham 63 said at a weekend news conference 
this isnt ev mechams rights were talking about this is basic 
rights in the state of arizona 
the conservative republican governor renewed his vow that he 
would not take the easy way out and resign 
my resignation would write a bad chapter in the history of 
arizona he said as he stood before reporters in down home 
western garb boots blue jeans a powder blue jacket plaid shirt 
and a string tie with a huge silver and torquoise clasp 
that would be giving in to the powers who have schemed and 
planned to put so much pressure on me that i would eventually 
resign he said 
mecham insisted he should be allowed to resolve a march 22 
criminal trial before the impeachment trial and its publicity 
as governor of the state i ask nothing more than is accorded 
to any garden variety criminal he said of the due process rights 
he demanded i certainly do not think that as governor i should 
be accorded anything less 
some members of the senate suspected that what mecham really 
wanted was to delay the impeachment trial until after his scheduled 
may 17 recall election hoping for an outpouring of support from 
constituents who elected him on his fifth try for the office 
but the 30member senate refused to allow any delay 
weve got to get going the people of arizona deserve a fair 
break and the fair break is that the trial moves forward said 
senate democratic minority leader alan stephens 
to convict mecham twothirds of the senators must find that 
mecham committed high crimes misdemeanors or malfeasance in 
office 
upon conviction the senate could bar him from ever holding 
public office again 
although mecham is best known outside arizona for a series of 
public gaffes and outrageous comments which offended many minority 
groups he is not on trial for those acts 
mecham is charged with three misdeeds concealing a 350000 
campaign loan misusing 80000 from the governors protocol fund 
by loaning it to his car dealership and trying to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat by a state official 
the house of representatives which impeached mecham feb 5 
detailed the allegations in 23 articles of impeachment the 
equivalent of an indictment in a criminal case 
after his impeachment mecham was required to step aside as 
governor pending outcome of the trial however he is still 
addressed as governor and draws his regular salary he set up 
offices in suburban glendale in what he calls his government in 
exile 
secretary of state rose mofford is acting governor in his place 
frank x gordon chief justice of the arizona supreme court who 
will preside over the impeachment trial has called it perhaps 
the most important proceeding in the history of arizona 
clearly these are volatile times gordon said perhaps 
never in arizona history have so many of our citizens had such 
fervent beliefs on a given subject we should be thankful that our 
system of government is equipped to peacefully and fairly resolve 
such a volatile situation it is up to all of us as citizens to let 
the system work

mikhail s gorbachev met with two prominent 
armenian writers in an unusual personal campaign to allay concerns 
of armenians demanding annexation of land in a neighboring 
republic two activists said sunday 
the writers silva kaputikyan and zori balayan met with the 
soviet leader on friday said sergei grigoryants a moscowbased 
dissident and hovik vassilian an armenian activist and editor of 
the underground journal the armenian matter 
they said the writers met thursday with politburo member and 
propaganda chief alexander n yakovlev 
gorbachev said hed take the matter under his personal control 
and see to it that it gets the proper attention vassilian quoted 
kaputikyan as saying of the meeting with the soviet leader 
vassilian spoke in a telephone interview from yerevan the capital 
of the armenian republic 
the official media carried no report on the gorbachev meeting 
it was the second time that gorbachev had become involved in the 
sensitive armenian dispute which erupted last week into street 
demonstrations that witnesses said involved thousands of protesters 
on friday gorbachev appealed for civil maturity and 
restraint in an address read on armenian television by a senior 
party official in the address gorbachev promised that the 
communist party central committee would review relations among the 
soviet unions more than 100 nationalities 
until now the 56yearold leader had never injected himself 
into an ethnic dispute since becoming party general secretary in 
march 1985 
he may have stepped in now as a defense of his policy of 
glasnost or openness on social issues 
vassilian said that organizers of last weeks massive protests 
in yerevan announced friday they would hold no more protests until 
march 26 so national authorities could have time to review the 
dispute 
the unrest has focused on the delawaresized region of 
nagornokarabakh in the caucasus mountains the region is inside 
the republic of azerbaidzhan but armenians want it to be annexed 
to their republic 
more than 80 percent of nagornokarabakhs 157000 residents are 
aremenian 
the official news agency tass and central soviet television on 
saturday tried to calm the population and play down reports of 
ethnic trouble by taking up the theme of brotherhood 
they carried interviews with ethnic armenians and azerbaidzhanis 
saying they live together in harmony and that it was important for 
everyone to return to their jobs 
the media said some workers in yerevan even showed up 
voluntarily for work sunday their day off to make up for time 
lost while they were away from their jobs demonstrating 
grigoryants and other witnesses said hundreds of thousands of 
armenians took to the streets of yerevan last week to press their 
demands after the ruling politburo rejected an annexation proposal 
the decision to hold off on more protests apparently was a 
result of gorbachevs address and of an armenian central committee 
decision to ask for a review of the dispute by national leaders 
vassilian said about 150000 demonstrators gathered saturday on 
yerevan streets to continue the protest but he said the city was 
calm sunday 
armenian activists have sent a lengthy report to the central 
government in moscow outlining why they believe nagornokarabakh 
should be made part of armenia vassilian said 
grigoryants said that during a twoday visit to yerevan he 
learned that ethnic russians had been brought in to replace the 
mostly armenian local militia force and that 28 planeloads of 
soldiers had been flown into the capital to help keep order 
at one point last week grigoryants said workers at the state 
broadcasting authority gostelradio threatened to stop all 
transmissions unless soldiers were withdrawn from broadcast studios 
the workers also demanded the right to broadcast reports on the 
demonstrations within a day the soldiers were pulled out of the 
studios and reports on the demonstrations appeared on armenian 
television grigoryants said

cream pies flew old flicks rolled and fans 
talked to to an old three stooges supporting actor when about 1000 
diehard fans of the celebrated knuckleheads gathered for a weekend 
of nyuk nyuk stoogemania 
ive loved larry moe and curly ever since i was 5 years 
old said virginia riviera 30 who came with two friends from 
salem mass 
they and others swapped memorabilia threw pies and watched such 
films as three little pigskins all the worlds a stooge 
dizzy doctors and disorder in the court 
id go anywhere theres a three stooges convention said 
riviera as long as i dont have to fly 
curly impersonator david knight was involved in everything 
joe jerrier one of the conventions organizers said sunday 
when he showed up the place was just jammed 
knight an iron worker from palmyra ny who bears a pate much 
like his cinematic heros tweaked ears and performed curlys 
outrageous antics to the delight of fans who came from as far away 
as san francisco for the twoday exercise in stoogery 
jerrier said nostalgia has sparked a resurgence of interest in 
an act famous for headknocking faceslapping bellybutting 
slapstick pratfalls and endless buffoonery 
the original three stooges created in the vaudeville days of 
the 1920s were morris moe horowitz who later changed his last 
name to howard his brother samuel shemp and larry fineberg 
aka fine 
by the early 30s shemp had left in a pay dispute and jerome 
curly another horowitz brother took over 
the stooges made more than 190 short films and about 50 
featurelength films until the 60s said jerrier moe was the last 
stooge to die in 1975 
in one room three stooges postcards tshirts belts ceramic 
masks and hand puppets were displayed on tables 
also on display were books publicity stills movie posters and 
a canceled check from moe a stooge trivia contest was in progress 
when the pie fight a highlight of the event broke out 
i was emcee and i didnt even get a chance to close my eyes 
said jerrier 37 a firefighter from gardiner maine i got four 
of em 
a telephone call was placed to emil sitka and fans were allowed 
to chat with the man who played a host of older mens roles in more 
than 60 stooge films 
sitka who is in his 70s and now lives in camarillo calif was 
one of the few actors who played alongside shemp as well as curly 
said jerrier who claims one of the countrys largest videocassette 
collections of stooge flicks 
jerrier said shemp quit because each of the stooges was making 
100 a week while their manager earned 2000 
the convention raised more than 4000 by sunday afternoon for 
cancer research said jerrier ron eugley another organizer said 
at least 1000 fans showed up 
in addition to footage from stooge films fans were treated to 
rare footage of curlys wedding moe barbecuing the stooges in 
baseball uniforms in the chicago cubs dugout in 1938 and on the 
queen mary in 1939 
george likar said hes been a member of the national three 
stooges fan club since 1985 
i got hooked 10 years ago watching them on tv said likar 
who flew in from joliet ill the stooges are great curlys my

the seeds of this weeks summit meeting at 
natos sprawling headquarters were planted nearly 16 months ago 
when president reagan faced mikhail s gorbachev across a plain 
wooden table in a house in iceland and seemed to forget western 
europes interests 
it was october 12 1986 and as dusk crept over the windows at 
hofdi house in reykjavik and the whole world waited reagan and 
gorbachev got into a hot negotiation about the possibility of 
scrapping all their nuclear missiles 
they failed but when details of the talks came out western 
european allies who had depended on a nosurprise us defense and 
arms control style for 39 years wondered if reagan had forgotten to 
take their needs into consideration 
we dont think its a fair accusation said a reagan 
administration official weve consulted with the allies 
assiduously before and after reykjavik but theres no denying the 
perception is there among europeans that the us was willing to 
make drastic reductions in nuclear weapons over their heads 
the summit in brussels will give them a bully pulpit to get 
their views across said the official one of several us summit 
planners who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
thats not to say we dont want a summit we think its 
important to have this meeting at this juncture for sound 
alliance reasons the official said 
it will let president reagan show that despite some of the 
recent dents in his teflon shield he is an active and commanding 
presence but on a scale of one to 100 the europeans want it 60 or 
70 and we want it 40 or 30 
the europeans aim for the first nato summit since 1982 is not 
just to remind reagan of their interests as he heads for another 
meeting with gorbachev in moscow in the spring 
it is to talk through him to whoever replaces reagan as 
president next january and to set the stage for what is likely to 
be several years of alliancewide agonizing over the future of its 
internal relationships and its dealings with the soviet union 
the leaders will gather at the sprawling nato headquarters on 
the outskirts of brussels on wednesday and thursday the public 
will be barred from all but a brief opening and brief closing 
session and several hours have been devoted to meetings without 
large numbers of aides 
at the end the leaders will issue a declaration summarizing 
their goals and ideals for natos future there also is talk of 
issuing a separate statement on conventional weapons 
rozanne ridgway assistant secretary of state said sunday that 
two summit issues would be how do we stay strong so that we 
dont make the world safe for conventional war or invite it and 
how to get the soviets to reduce their nowstronger nonnuclear 
forces 
the europeans fear that with the possibility of a nuclearfree 
world they may end up with no protection against the superior 
soviet forces ridgway interviewed on cable news networks 
newsmaker sunday said however she believes the nato alliance 
will always have a combination of conventional and nuclear 
deterrents 
on an issue prompted partly by domestic budget pressure on 
reagan ridgway said the president will take nato a message on 
burdensharing nato jargon for dividing up the manpower and 
financial load of maintaining western defenses she did not say 
what the message would be but said they can do more we can do 
more 
any private understandings at the meeting will be transmitted to 
lowerlevel groups that have been working for months to provide 
answers to some of the questions posed by a new climate of 
eastwest relations ushered in since gorbachevs accession 
the leaders are less likely to dwell on the nuts and bolts of 
defense and arms control problems facing the alliance in the short 
run 
nato has already committed itself to a ussoviet plan to 
reduce longrange nuclear weaponry by 50 percent granted there is 
still some haggling within nato on the pace and scope of 
negotiations on shortrange nuclear forces chemical weapons and 
conventional forces but the leaders are not expected to spend much 
time on these details leaving those tasks to other officials and 
other forums 
nor is reagan expected to get into a general discussion of 
problems the united states is having with some of the allies over 
the continuation of american base rights talks with those 
countries portugal spain and greece are being handled 
elsewhere 
beyond the internal problems perhaps hovering over them is the 
broadest issue of all the relevancy of the western alliance at a 
time when the soviet union is exhibiting signs of major reform and 
appears to be more forthcoming than ever in meeting western demands 
like one for a withdrawal from afghanistan 
the alliance has stuck together for four decades out of fear of 
an expansionist and untrustworthy soviet union dominated by its 
military leaders 
after nearly three years of gorbachev and no sign in letup in 
the ferment in his country and among some of his allies nato 
leaders are wondering how their alliance should respond 
at their summit this week i think its going to be both a 
moment of looking at the success that the alliance has had and 
getting down to the hard issues ahead the analysis of the current 
situation in the soviet union the opportunities it might 
present one official said

the governing body of the organization of 
american states sidestepped a position on political instability in 
panama refusing in an extraordinary eighthour session to chose 
between two men claiming to be the countrys ambassador 
in panama there are two presidents one who represents 
civilian authority and one who represents military power costa 
rican oas ambassador guillermo villalobos arce told the oass 
permanent council 
most of the speakers during the session which ended at about 
midnight saturday voiced support for ousted panamanian president 
eric arturo delvalle 
delvalle sent lawrence chewning fabrega to represent panama 
while military strong man manuel antonio noriega sent roberto 
leyton who has been the envoy leyton protested that the 
discussion violated the organizations charter and said the 
permanent council was an inappropriate forum for an airing of his 
countrys internal affairs 
over the course of the session the oas ambassadors heard bitter 
recriminations about promises the nicaraguan sandinistas failed to 
keep allegations the united states seeks to destabilize panama 
invocation of the name of the late panamanian strong man gen omar 
torrijos and questions about america reneging on its commitment in 
two 1979 treaties to completely transfer control of the panama 
canal to panama by the turn of the century 
just for good measure gabriel lewis a former panamanian 
ambassador to the united states who is now part of noriegas 
political opposition had oas technicians play a taperecording of 
his telephone conversation earlier in the day with a distressed 
mariela delvalle wife of the deposed president 
in it she told lewis what she had told military officers who 
came looking for delvalle my husband is not here nor are you 
going to find him 
but the council failed to come to grips with the question of 
whether to recognize the portfolio of leyton or chewning 
representatives of several nonoas countries seated in a 
section for official observers gave chewning an ovation when he 
briefly entered the mahoganywalled council chamber and conferred 
with sen edward m kennedy dmass who came as an observer 
but from the time the council meeting was supposed to start at 
4 pm est until shortly after 9 pm the action was away from 
the council chamber as the roughly 30 ambassadors wrangled in 
private over whether to seat leyton or chewning 
a carnival atmosphere developed as lewis chewning and kennedy 
alternately met with reporters in the ornate lobby of the oas 
building while musicians waiters and waitresses prepared one 
floor above for a dinnerdance 
at one point the us ambassador to the oas richard t 
mccormack shrugged his shoulders and told a reporter im 
supposed to be up there im the host for that thing 
this was just moments before the formal debate began and just 
after a rumored deal to settle the credentialing problem had 
collapsed 
a member of the us mission talking on grounds of anonymity 
said the oas council members had seriously discussed seating 
neither leyton nor chewning this official said they came close to 
giving the seat to soraya cano a career panamanian diplomat 
but paraguays juan alberto llanes chairman of the oas 
permanent council ruled that for purposes of the debate leyton 
must be seated and he was and thats when the fireworks began 
the chairman feels it is important and necessary to have a 
representative of the sister republic of panama present he said 
given the floor leyton declared a precedent is being set 
here because the representative of panama considers that the events 
taking place in my country are strictly matters of our own internal 
affairs 
guatemalas ambassador francisco villagran countered with an 
assertion that we are faced with a historic decision will we be 
in favor of autocratic governments 
mccormack denounced delvalles ouster by panamas national 
assembly 
what we do or do not do could have a strong bearing on the 
decisions of other generals as they decide whether or not to let 
democracies survive he said 
nicaraguas carlos tunnermann took up for leyton saying the oas 
debate could not be allowed to serve as a pretext for 
interventionist action 
lewis gave the debate its most riveting moments as he came to 
the table as a specially appointed representative of the government 
of el salvador 
when leyton vehemently opposed lewis seating waving his arms 
to emphasize his points lewis reminded the panamanian that it 
was here where we condemned former nicaraguan strong man 
anastasio somoza he repressed the nicaraguan people and now the 
sandinistas take away the right of selfdetermination 
we are suffering a new phenomenon narcomilitarism lewis 
said in attacking noriega this narcoticmilitarism knows no 
frontier it is dedicated to the illicit trade that respects no 
borders no boundaries 
two federal grand juries in florida accused noriega of drug 
trafficking charges earlier this month 
this was not the kind of government torrijos envisioned when he 
joined president jimmy carter in signing the panama canal treaties 
in 1979 he said 
mccormack took the opportunity to say the united states had no 
intention of backing down on the treaty commitments as leyton 
had suggested 
leyton persisted nonetheless 
we demand that the government of el salvador furnish proof of 
these allegations he said leyton directed his fire at el 
salvador because that country had requested the emergency oas 
session 
this forum is being used like a political circus leyton 
screamed

secretary of state george p shultz finally 
made a little headway sunday in his uphill fight to gain arab and 
israeli support for negotiations on a middle east settlement 
they liked the package said a senior us official after 
shultz outlined his proposal in a threehour meeting with egyptian 
president hosni mubarak in cairo 
shultz then flew to israel to resume his discussions with prime 
minister yitzhak shamir sunday night over dinner and with foreign 
minister shimon peres on monday before flying to amman for a second 
round of talks with jordanian officials 
we have a package that is promising at least we think it is 
promising shultz said after seeing mubarak whether anyone 
else thinks it is promising is a question 
egyptian foreign minister ismat abdelmeguid standing alongside 
shultz under cloudy cairo skies did not respond 
but a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity on 
shultzs flight to jerusalem said that egypt had endorsed the us 
proposal 
on saturday syrian and jordanian officials rejected the plan as 
unacceptable 
shultzs plan which he outlined for mubarak on notepaper calls 
for immediate negotiations to provide some selfrule for the 15 
million palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip the second stage would involve negotiations by december on 
an overall settlement of the decadesold jewisharab dispute 
what we are seeking is a comprehensive peace in the middle 
east shultz said after the meeting that means we have to 
consider all the countries security issues the palestinian 
people their aspirations their legitimate rights 
mubarak saw shultz to the door and shook his hand but did not 
emerge to face reporters and cameras 
egypts attraction to the plan could be based in part on the 
fact that mubarak last month in talks with president reagan in 
washington pushed very hard for an overall settlement instead of an 
interim arrangement on the palestinian issue 
shultzs reference to a comprehensive agreement echoed the 
advice from the egyptian leader 
egypt also has had a peace treaty with israel for nine years and 
is in the midst of improving relations with its jewish neighbor 
jordans king hussein on the other hand has ducked and weaved 
for some 20 years on the issue of negotiating with israel he has 
held back until now because he cannot be sure how much of the west 
bank would be returned to his control jordan occupied the 
territory from 1949 to 1967 when israel captured the land in the 
middle east war 
syria meanwhile takes among the hardest lines towards israel 
in the arab world and has been reluctant to approve any 
usnegotiated initiative it also is a close ally of the soviet 
union which shultz is not inclined to give a major role in peace 
negotiations 
indeed syrian and jordanian officials stressed saturday after 
meeting with shultz that they want the soviet union and the 
palestine liberation organization to take part in negotiations for 
a middle east peace 
the united states and israel want the plo excluded and soviet 
influence limited 
plo chief yasser arafat said saturday the plo has named a 
delegation of palestinians to meet shultz but shultz was not 
expected to meet with the plo delegation 
fifteen palestinians from the occupied territories of the west 
bank and gaza strip earlier rejected an invitation to meet with 
shultz 
shultz will return to amman on monday to review again the us 
plan with crown prince hassan prime minister zaid rifai and 
foreign minister taher masri 
but a final decision is unlikely at least until shultz sees 
hussein in london on tuesday 
the king has steered clear of shultzs shuttle reportedly to 
have dental surgery 
a shamir aide speaking on condition of anonymity said its 
a very strong signal that he hussein doesnt want to get 
involved 
in the meantime the us official said the chances are still 
good that shultz will return to the middle east after attending the 
north atlantic treaty organization summit meeting in brussels on 
wednesday and thursday

while a charity was collecting money to 
help a man keep his electricity flowing a city worker quietly went 
to the power company and paid the bill out of his own pocket 
i went down there to take care of that thing and i found 
out it was paid nelson johnson who is unemployed said friday 
he said he was told that george tanner a deputy city marshal 
had paid the bill wednesday the day after a newspaper described 
johnsons problems 
i thought johnson was in need and god has been good to me 
said tanner my heart always goes out to those in need he said 
johnsons troubles included not only the 6341 bill which was 
90 days overdue but the need to keep his 4monthold daughter on 
an electric heart monitor because of seizures and breathing 
problems 
southwestern electric power co which had threatened to cut off 
johnsons electricity had agreed to give johnson until friday to 
pay the bill

collected money to pay the bill 
johnson said he would use the gifts to pay for food and medicine 
for his wife 4yearold son and his infant daughter

its been compared with the colonies 
fight to overthrow king george iii its the little guy against the 
establishment the underdog fighting for a principle 
and its all about congress which changed the name of clarks 
hill lake to strom thurmond lake after the veteran republican 
senator from south carolina without asking local residents what 
they thought of the idea 
i think we should change the constitution from we the people 
to you the congress they could tell us what we need and what to 
call everything down here said dan elswick owner of ridge road 
bait and tackle in appling ga 
some cite an emotional attachment to the name taken from this 
nearby tiny town when the 70000acre army corps of engineers lake 
was first filled 44 years ago others say theyve built a business 
reputation on the name bringing national fishing tournaments and 
speedboat races and investing in souvenirs 
others are upset about the way the name of the lake on the 
georgiasouth carolina border was changed 
rep butler derrick dsc introduced a bill suggesting the 
change on dec 3 two days before thurmonds 85th birthday the 
senate approved a similar measure on dec 4 and by dec 23 
president reagan had signed it into law 
derrick said he was approached by the chairman of the clarks 
hillrussell authority of south carolina about changing the lakes 
name 
the eightmember authority was created in 1946 to assist 
promote and cooperate in the development of the clarks hill and 
russell lakes on the savannah river 
chairman john mcallister said the board members appointed by 
the governor decided amongst themselves that naming the lake after 
thurmond would be a good idea because of all hes done to support 
the area 
he said they didnt seek any public opinion because we were 
not making the final decision we had no control over congress 
but when senate minority leader bob dole rkan introduced the 
measure for the name change in the senate the authoritys 
unanimous support was entered into the congressional record 
it was our impression that the local folks in the area were 
supportive of the change said dole aide jim whittinghill 
a number of businessmen around the lake have posted petitions 
asking for a compromise change the name of the lake back to 
clarks hill and leave the dam and the road across it named after 
thurmond whose name is already on schools federal buildings and 
streets around the state 
the petitions are being distributed by a group called keep our 
lake clarks hill led by roy giles of lincolnton ga and 
phillip white of clarks hill 
the two say they have more than 20000 signatures so far and 
theyve taken out newspaper ads gone on television and radio and 
are applying for status as a nonprofit agency so they can accept 
donations for the fight 
they realize the compromise also will take an act of congress 
and they think that will require support from thurmond 
thurmond has said he was deeply honored by the lakes new name 
and he wont comment on the proposed compromise he said he doesnt 
consider the issue a serious problem and i do hope the 
controversy will subside 
its not the first time the lakes name has been changed when 
it was first created a typographical error caused the name to 
officially go down as clark hill lake instead of clarks hill 
lake 
it took 26 years before congress restored the missing s 
the person who sponsored that legislation was thurmond

the piping plovers and roseate terns due 
to arrive in nesting areas here in the coming weeks will be met by 
thousands of gulls renewing a battle blamed for the decline of the 
endangered birds off cape cod 
thirty years ago piping plovers and roseate terns outnumbered 
the gulls nesting on monomoy island during the spring and summer 
but last year just two pairs of piping plovers and seven pairs 
of roseate terns nested at the monomoy wildlife refuge fighting 
for survival against an estimated 70000 gulls 
the us fish and wildlife service which runs monomoy this 
month released a new master plan for the refuge that permits 
poisoning the gulls to protect the endangered birds 
the gull population explosion has coincided with rampant 
residential development on the coast where garbage in landfills 
has given the gulls a new food source 
were giving them a free hot lunch every day and the terns 
and plovers just arent adaptable enough to take advantage of that 
opportunity said thomas french director of the states 
endangered species program 
they are competing for the same piece of land and the gulls 
are much more aggressive french said they will eat the terns 
for lunch 
there will be no poisoning this year because the plan was 
released too late to conduct the necessary environmental study 
before the migrating shorebirds arrive from winter habitats in the 
south 
but refuge manager jack fillio believes the plan will be used 
next spring 
im of the opinion that the gull population has expanded to 
the point where this seems to be the most viable technology to 
use fillio said in an interview last week you could study the 
issue until the plovers and terns are gone 
animal rights activists have denounced the plan but state and 
federal environmental officials say they reluctantly endorse it as 
a means of restoring balance to the habitat 
only one pair of herring gulls was spotted at monomoy in 1961 
more than 15000 pairs have nested there since 1980 there were no 
blackbacked gulls nesting at the refuge 25 years ago but more 
than 5000 pairs have made it their summer home in recent years 
chris lahey conservation director for the massachusetts audubon 
society said provisions in the new master plan endorsing gull 
poisoning only as a last resort sound like a step in the right 
direction 
because poison cannot be used this year fillio said refuge 
staffers will use wire mesh to fence off tern and plover nests and 
disrupt gull nests near areas the endangered birdss nests 
bradford blodgett a state ornithologist said nature may have 
provided an alternative to poison he said a new barrier island 
created last year when a winter storm cut through a huge sandbar 
off chatham has created what could be a gullfree home for terns 
and plovers 
by breaking up gull nests established on the new island the 
terns and plovers could prosper undisturbed if they settle there 
blodgett said 
if the new island helps protect the piping plovers and terns it 
will be the second time in 50 years that nature helped the birds in 
their fight against mans influence 
many species of shorebirds particularly piping plovers were 
hunted almost to extinction in the latter part of the 19th century 
their populations began to recover after passage of the migratory 
bird treaty act of 1918 and then rebounded dramatically 20 years 
later when a 1938 hurricane reshaped the land and provided new 
nesting areas

amy lynn hardin who underwent a liver 
transplant at the tender age of 11 months thanks to vigorous 
community fundraising has died at the age of 5 
there will never be another one like her not like my amy 
said her mother robin hardin shes at peace now 
amy died at home saturday she would have turned 6 on june 1 
amy was born with biliary atresia in which the bile ducts 
malfunction and the liver becomes hard she underwent surgery when 
she was 6 weeks old and again at 3 months but the operations were 
unsuccessful 
doctors said her only chance for survival was a liver transplant 
amys health became a cause for community residents who rallied 
in late 1982 and early 1983 to raise more than 260000 for the 
transplant 
the rock group kiss performed a benefit concert in 1983 at kiel 
auditorium in st louis that same year amy received a letter of 
support from president reagan 
if it wasnt for the community getting together we wouldnt 
have had five years mrs hardin said she was the joy of our 
life she was very strong she fought all the way to the end 
the transplanted liver amy received on may 10 1983 began to 
fail around thanksgiving mrs hardin said 
on dec 11 the family took amy to the university of minnesota 
hospital in minneapolis where the transplant had been performed 
she returned home jan 16 after doctors said her chances for 
recovery were not good 
she couldnt stand it anymore mrs hardin said we made a 
promise that we wouldnt take her back to the hospital we brought 
her home and the family took turns being with her 
amys transplant was termed a success but her recovery was 
hampered by a series of setbacks caused by rejection of the new 
liver viruses and side effects from medication 
doctors like to say that you are over the hump after five 
years but one can never say never there are just too many 
complications mary stanik spokeswoman for university of 
minnesota hospital said saturday 
besides her parents amy is survived by two brothers 
funeral services will be monday at holy family church in cahokia

missi broussard says christ saved her 
from a life of drugs sin and barroom brawling through one of jimmy 
swaggarts ministries 
now swaggarts fall has shattered her belief in a man she had 
thought incorruptible but she said her faith in god is unchanged 
i had this image built of him swaggart he could do no 
wrong she said now i know differently he can do wrong he 
has done wrong and he can do wrong again 
broussard said swaggarts confession to an unspecified sin 
didnt sway her belief in god 
jimmy swaggart did not change me he did not have the power to 
do so jesus christ changed me she said 
she wasnt at church sunday because she would have had to leave 
halfway through the service but she did go to a service wednesday 
usually she said about 1500 people meet in the crossfire 
building which will hold about 5000 this past wednesday night 
it was packed they had to pull out seats for people to sit in 
broussard 21 said she will continue to attend copastor jim 
rentzs services but she doesnt know what she will do when 
swaggart who reportedly paid a prostitute to pose nude for him and 
tried to cover up the scandal returns to the pulpit 
the lord is the one who led me to the church she said if 
he wants to lead me away im open for him to do so but im not 
going to sway on my own opinion of jimmy swaggart to decide whether 
i go or stay 
i really do feel like that speaks to most of the church 
theyre looking to god now because theyve learned their lesson 
looking to a man 
michael and lisa sexton never saw swaggart as anything more than 
human 
hes a man and all men make mistakes said sexton who left 
his home state of idaho last year to be closer to swaggart and his 
ministry 
i feel nothing but love in my heart for him and his family 
said mrs sexton 21 he is a man of integrity for being able to 
stand there and confess 
the sextons met about seven years ago at an assembly of god 
youth group in idaho where they began watching swaggart on 
television they began donating to his ministry about four years 
ago and first visited his family worship center in baton rouge 15 
months ago 
i felt the lord wanted us to relocate said sexton 27 he 
got a job at the waterford 3 nuclear power plant in taft they 
moved last august to luling and drive 90 minutes every sunday to 
and from swaggarts church in baton rouge 
sexton said he was shocked by swaggarts confession but thinks 
it was a good thing 
it needed to happen i sense he was somewhat relieved because 
hes going to get the help he needs 
and he said the sin doesnt change the good done by swaggarts 
ministries which feed thousands of children a day and provide 
medical care and other services to the poor 
no one will ever know how many lives it ministry has 
touched he said 
after sundays worship service during which swaggart thanked the 
congregation for their support irma keel voiced faith in her 
troubled minister 
i think brother swaggarts a great pastor and i think god will 
bring him out she said you see god forgives us for 
everything we do he has the advocate with the father hes my 
brother in christ 
you have to forgive and forget said david wilkerson 
another congregation member you have to go on in the lord

it has been 10 months since the trial began 
seven months since the first witness appeared and an incredible 
five years since the mcmartin preschool molestation case hit the 
courts 
and there is no end in sight 
prosecutors say they will conclude their presentation by july 
but the defense isnt saying how long it may take 
sometimes it irks me when people talk about how long its 
been says defense attorney dean gits one of the players in this 
longrunning drama on the 15th floor of the downtown criminal 
courts building 
this has to be put into perspective the case is absolutely 
unique he said last week we are dealing with allegations that 
cover four to five years murders dont take that long its a 
split second rapes and robberies dont take that long 
how do you reconstruct a period of time that happened many 
many years ago and covers four to five years if people dont 
understand that then they dont understand why its taking so 
long 
gits represents peggy mcmartin buckey 61 who is on trial along 
with her son raymond buckey 29 charged with 100 child 
molestations at their now defunct family owned preschool in 
suburban manhattan beach 
with time the case has changed 
five teachers originally charged had their cases dismissed for 
lack of evidence the prosecution which once involved 41 children 
now focuses on 13 youngsters who have grown from toddlers to 
preteenagers 
and the childrens sometimes bizarre stories of satan worship 
animal mutilation and trips to remote places have all but vanished 
i sense that they have weeded out those children who went 
into fantasyland says gits 
the latest child witness a slender 11yearold boy took the 
stand last week telling jurors in 15 minutes what he remembered of 
his alleged molestation by buckey and mentioning briefly that he 
once saw buckey kill a horse 
in a now familiar pattern the crossexamination by gits and 
buckeys attorney danny davis extended for days as the lawyers 
tried to elicit details which the prosecution never sought 
details of the horse incident for example were almost 
impossible to extract from the young witness who repeatedly 
answered i dont know 
but the boy nervous and embarrassed told of being fondled and 
forced into oral copulation by buckey and said he felt sick and 
dirty when he drew pictures of the incident for his mother 
davis says he sees a pattern of fading memories but deputy 
district attorney lael rubin who has guided the case almost from 
its inception says the child witnesses have improved with age 
the children are more articulate their memories may not be as 
detailed as several years ago but theyre older more articulate 
and less intimidated she says 
so far the jurors who have sworn to stick with the trial no 
matter how long it lasts have heard from only five of the 
children other prosecution witnesses called so far have included 
doctors police officers and parents 
the really important witnesses are the children themselves 
says ms rubins cocounsel deputy district attorney roger gunson 
and the children have testified very well 
the trials duration has had a personal impact on all 
participants 
the jurors initially restless have settled into a routine 
taking copious notes many of them carry lunchboxes as if they are 
going to work 
theyve become part of the case and the commitment is coming 
through says gits 
gunson jogs and rides a bicycle to relieve tension ms rubin 
and davis found that they had enrolled in the same health club and 
they often encounter each other working out in preparation for 
their courtroom battles 
gits shuns exercise saying when i want to relax i smoke a 
cigarette and drink a cup of coffee 
the greatest strain is on the defendants the grayhaired mrs 
buckey free on bail sits and knits during recesses chats with 
courtroom spectators or thumbs through a small bible 
she has her faith and believes very much that god has helped 
carry her through this says gits 
her son who has been jailed without bail for nearly five years 
was granted 3 million bail just before christmas in spite of 
pledges of property he has been unable to raise the necessary 
300000 in cash to gain release 
but davis says his client is in pretty good spirits 
sustained by the knowledge he will one day get to tell his side 
from the witness stand 
perhaps the most powerful figure in the courtroom is superior 
court judge william pounders who tries every day to move things 
along quickly 
last november one year after he took over the mcmartin case 
pounders marked the date by declaring i dont intend to see 
another anniversary date i intend to conclude the case within the 
next year

when a small fire broke out above the stage of 
the marquis theater me and my girl star jim dale kept cool as 
did the full house of 1600 
nobody was hurt in the incident which interrupted saturdays 
matinee about 15 minutes into the first act of the 
tonyawardwinning musical and sparked dales sense of humor 
youve got to expect this if you come to see the hottest show 
on broadway dale told the playgoers after they filed back into 
the theater after a 40minute interruption 
an overheated cable ignited a piece of rope in the proscenium 
arch out of view of the audience said stage manager john bonanni 
there was a smell of smoke during the first scene and after i 
made my exit i said somethings burning dale recalled sunday 
then i heard a commotion and i thought thats not in the 
scene shouting and carrying on i looked out and people were 
rushing out up the aisles 
one of the shows managers calmed the crowd which filed out in 
an orderly fashion bonanni said the fire was quickly extinguished 
by stagehands 
after city firefighters made a safety check the audience was 
let back in 
a few jokes got them in a damn good mood and then dale 
recapped the plays action up to the point of the fire and 
retreated backstage 
dale who plays a cockney commoner who lands in the lap of 
english aristocracy said he couldnt resist an ad lib in a 
later scene 
i say to the butler you havent got a cigarette have you 
mate then i turned to the audience and said i promise i wont 
light up he said 
he thinks the incident cast a warm glow over the audience 
figuratively speaking 
they love to be involved in something fresh and new he 
said we cant supply a fire every day though

sen bob dole charged on sunday that vice 
president george bush condoned trading arms for hostages in the 
irancontra affair saying in a republican presidential debate 
we shouldnt do those things 
in a key confrontation before the march 8 super tuesday 
primaries across the south rep jack kemp slammed bush and dole 
the partys frontrunners as two moderates who would raise taxes 
and end the reagan revolution 
they sound alike they talk alike theyve supported every 
single tax increase over the last eight years kemp said if 
theyre nominated the reagan revolution is over gone dead 
bush and dole objected saying they have fought against tax 
increases and for the reagan administrations agenda for the past 
seven years 
they fired back at kemp for what they contend is his casual 
attitude toward the federal budget deficit 
jacks never met a deficit he didnt like dole said 
bush told the new york congressman you dont care about 
deficits you never have and theyre public enemy no 1 
on the recent turmoil in panama both dole and kemp warned that 
the united states will not tolerate instability near the panama 
canal 
if weve learned anything from irancontra we ought to give 
military strongman manuel antonio noriega 30 days to get out of 
panama or tell him were going to have a trade embargo dole 
said adding the united states should derecognize noriegas 
regime 
kemp said if the panamanians want to keep noregia the united 
states of america is going to keep the panama canal 
it was the first debate with all four hopefuls since the new 
hampshire primary and it may be the last one for bush 
campaign manager lee atwater told reporters that bush is not 
scheduled to do any more debates including the league of women 
voters confrontation next sunday in nashville tenn dole campaign 
manager bill brock said bush is following a frontrunners 
strategy by skipping the debate 
bush tried at one point in the debate to say republicans should 
not be criticizing each other but that didnt stop dole from 
attacking the vice president for the reagan administrations 
decision to trade arms for hostages in the irancontra affair 
we never should trade arms for hostages we shouldnt issue 
these reports and say we shouldnt trade arms for hostages the 
vice presidents report and then later go to a meeting and say 
its all right we shouldnt do those things dole said holding 
up a report on terrorism that was written by a commission headed by 
bush 
bush did not respond directly but did say mistakes were 
made in the irancontra affair asked later if the affair had 
occurred on his watch bush replied i think when the 
president found out what happened he took the proper steps 
bush has maintained throughout the affair that he did not know 
the arrangement was an armsforhostage deal 
measures to protect the souths textile industry also caused 
sparks with kemp accusing dole and pat robertson of changing their 
stands to please southern voters more than onethird of the 
republican nominating delegates are at stake in contests across the 
south and elsewhere on march 8 
pat robertson and bob dole sound like dick gephardt to me on 
trade and george bush and bob dole say the budget deficit is 
public enemy no 1 i want to say i belive the soviet union is 
public enemy no 1 kemp said after the debate 
democratic rep richard gephardt of missouri is the sponsor of a 
tough trade measure that would require us retaliation against 
unfair practices by other countries 
kemp claimed that robertson and dole had said in iowa well 
raise exports of food and grain and then go to south carolina and 
say were going to put up barriers to imports 
robertson retorted that he didnt want american jobs being lost 
to workers in china with its communist regime 
there were also sharp exchanges on the question of how to reduce 
the federal deficit although each denied that they would raise 
taxes as president 
the problem is not revenues its spending kemp said we 
have a deficit because we have a congress who spends too much 
moneyand interest rates are too high 
bush outlining his ideas said ive proposed a fouryear 
freeze that allows for inflationthat gives the president 
flexibility 
dole defended his own voting record displaying a multipage 
list of what he said were his votes against tax increases since 
1975 he complained that some campaign ads distort his record on 
taxes a reference to bush ads and then hit at bush directly 
ive been leading the efforts to reduce tax rates dole 
said you dont go the bush route its a fouryear 
copoutweve got to reduce the deficit no one in this group 
is advocating raising taxes 
later bush fired back at dole saying the kansas republicans 
plan for a oneyear spending freeze would hurt defense 
it will cut into the muscle on defense bush told dole 
and he defended his own fouryear idea i wouldnt call it a 
copout it disciplines the spending side 
robertson said the problem is not one of economics 
its a question of will he said asking if congress can 
make hard decision to cut spending 
robertson who has spent much of the past two weeks explaining 
various statements on missiles in cuba hostages in lebanon and the 
source of the expose of problems afflicting fellow tv evangelist 
jimmy swaggart said the press is a big problem for candidates 
i know its very difficult dealing with the press of america 
to get the truth out they love to distort our words robertson 
said we are making it so difficult in our society for anyone to 
serve

iranian warplanes usually crippled by 
shortages of spare parts bombed three key economic targets in iraq 
on sunday iraq retaliated with air raids on two iranian cities 
baghdads state radio said iraqi jets bombed the cities of 
hamadan in eastern iran and dezful in the southeast in simultaneous 
raids at 9 pm 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia said the attacks were in 
retaliation for recent atrocities and crimes committed by the 
charlatans of iran 
iran did not immediately confirm the iraqi raids 
in a separate dispatch the iraqi news agency said iranian 
artillery over the weekend shelled purely civilian targets in 
six iraqi border towns and cities it said said several people were 
killed or wounded but gave no casualty figures 
an earlier communique said two women and a child were killed and 
several people including four women were wounded in sundays 
shelling it said seven civilians were killed and 16 wounded in 
basra and alqurna on saturday 
tehrans war information headquarters said in a statement that 
iranian warplanes bombed a petrochemical plant in the southern port 
of basra oil installations in abul khassib and a bridge linking 
umm rassas island in the disputed shatt alarab waterway with 
mainland iraq 
the tiny island is a forward iraqi position southeast of basra 
on the southern sector of the front with iran 
all iranian planes returned safely to base from the 
successful midmorning raids said the communique broadcast by 
tehran radio and monitored in nicosia 
an exchange of air raids that began saturday have prompted fears 
that a new round of the war of the cities is beginning 
thousands of civilians have been killed in iraq and iran during 
such attacks hostilities on population centers generally are 
preceded by accusations and warnings similar to those tehran and 
baghdad exchanged this weekend 
the iranian air force was out of action for most of 1987 in 
january iranian warplanes resumed combat missions against iraq an 
indication that tehran had somehow acquired spare parts for its 
usbuilt jets 
western military analysts say iran has about 70 operational 
combat aircraft including f4 and f5 fighterbombers and f14 
interceptors 
iraq with more than 500 soviet and french warplanes has 
maintained air supremacy in the 7yearold gulf war 
the iranian war communique said the raids sunday were in 
retaliation for iraqi strikes the day before on civilian targets in 
a tehran suburb and in the town of saghez in the northwestern 
azerbaijan province 
irans islamic republic news agency reported 25 civilians killed 
and an unspecified number wounded in the iraqi raids saturday 
the iraqi news agency denied iraq hit any civilians targets over 
the weekend 
iraqi air force commander air marshal hamid shaaban also warned 
the iranians against carrying out their threats 
it is an illusion that iran believes iraq will succumb to 
threats of attacking the cities shaaban said in an interview 
with baghdads official aththawra newspaper 
shaaban said iraq had drawn plans to strike at strategic 
iranian targets and also at the nests where the rotten heads are 
being sheltered 
that was a reference to headquarters of iranian leaders

a 77yearold soviet jew who battled for 
13 years to leave the soviet union embraced his daughter when he 
arrived sunday in israel 
some of us managed to get out many are still left behind 
said mathematician naum meiman referring to soviet emigration 
policies 
meiman arrived in israel the same day as another leading soviet 
jewish activist electrical engineer lev shapiro who came here 
with his wife and two children 
meiman hugged his daughter olga plam 50 of boulder colo 
after she arrived at ben gurion airport aboard a flight from the 
united states she left the soviet union 14 years ago and had not 
seen her father since then 
soviet authorities said they delayed meimans emigration request 
because of his access to state secrets meiman had worked in 
classified mathematical calculations in 1955 
meiman linked his release to the policy of glasnost greater 
political openness on some topics initiated by soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev 
it is true that its easier to breathe in the soviet union 
nowadays after glasnost he said however in essence nothing 
has changed 
the soviet union allowed 8011 jews to emigrate in 1987 up from 
less than a thousand annually in recent years but still far short 
of the more than 50000 permitted to leave in 1979 
meiman was met by representatives of the weizman institute of 
science and tel aviv university both institutions have offered the 
scientist opportunities to continue his work in israel where 
meiman plans to settle 
meiman left moscow friday and rested in vienna saturday his 
wife inna kitrosskaya struggled for years for an exit visa for 
cancer treatment in the united states she received permission and 
left the soviet union last year but died 15 days later of a stroke 
meiman was not allowed to accompany his wife or to attend her 
funeral 
shapiro of leningrad was accompanied by his wife leah 38 his 
son yisrael 13 and the 9yearold daughter naomi 
the shapiro family which had been refused emigration permits 
for 11 years gained international prominence when naomi wrote a 
letter to gorbachev saying 
you are known as a kind and good grandfather why dont you 
let me meet my grandparents who live in israel 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain and us and french 
authorities also intervened on behalf of the shapiros

deposed president eric arturo 
delvalle stayed in hiding sunday and defied gen manuel antonio 
noriega the military strongman who ousted him and ordered him out 
of the country 
the expresidents whereabouts were a closely guarded secret 
but family members said he was in a safe and secure place in 
panama in good spirits and determined to regain his job 
i am going to stay here and stick it out delvalle told 
abc television in a telephone interview saturday night im going 
to fight it all the way 
delvalle did not reveal his hiding place 
roderick esquivel delvalles vice president also was in hiding 
both men were ousted from office early friday in an action by 
the national legislative assembly orchestrated by noriega the 
defense forces chief 
delvalle ignited the latest crisis in eight months of continuing 
civil unrest in panama on thursday when he tried to fire noriega 
who is charged in florida with corruption and narcotics 
trafficking the united states also has urged noriega to step down 
as military chief 
on friday delvalle returned to his home in an upperclass 
neighborhood police surrounded the house friday evening and 
delvalles telephones were cut leaving him incommunicado and under 
an undeclared house arrest 
sometime that night he reportedly climbed over a patio wall at 
the rear of the house and escaped through a neighbors yard 
avoiding the policemen who had been posted on the street in front 
of his home 
raul diaz a brotherinlaw and other family members said 
military officials had warned delvalle that if he didnt leave the 
country voluntarily he would be arrested and forcibly deported 
diaz said sunday that delvalle was telephoning leaders 
throughout the world seeking their support 
he said delvalle was not with his wife and three children but 
that all were safe they are in one place and he is alone in 
another diaz said 
the us state department said saturday some of delvalles 
children or grandchildren were at the american embassy or the home 
of us ambassador arthur davis the us embassy declined to 
comment sunday on that report 
the panamanian government claimed us officials were hiding 
delvalle at an american military installation in panama 
but gabriel lewis a former panamanian ambassador to washington 
said sunday he was under the protection of a good panamanian 
family and they will never find him 
cynthia farrell a spokeswoman for the us embassy said she 
could not confirm or deny anything she said the embassy was 
under orders from washington not to discuss the situation 
delvalles hopes of regaining the presidency suffered a setback 
saturday night when the permanent council of the organization of 
american states meeting in washington declined to take any action 
on panama 
delvalle and the reagan administration in washington had hoped 
the oas would agree to impose trade sanctions against panama or at 
least approve a resolution condemning the presidents ouster by the 
military 
on the eve of a planned nationwide protest strike priests in 
roman catholic churches throughout the country read a communique to 
parishoners from archbishop marcos g mcgrath 
the communique first issued two days ago decried corruption 
that has spread throughout the public and private sectors of 
panama and said the events of the past few days had deepened the 
crisis and damaged the credibility of the government and the 
constitutional process 
but the archbishop urged his followers not to resort to violence 
in an attempt to resolve what he called the grave national and 
international problems facing panama 
the strike was called by the national civic crusade a coalition 
of about 200 professional business labor and political groups 
that has been seeking noriegas ouster since last june 
crusade leaders said they hoped to totally paralyze the 
country early this week but there were indications the strike 
would not meet its goal 
osvaldo velasquez president of the panama human rights 
commission predicted sunday that many store owners would open for 
business monday out of fear of government repression 
he said military people already had threatened some 
businessmen telling them they would kick in their doors if 
they tried to close monday 
delvalle was dismissed by the legislative assembly in a 
tumultuous 10minute meeting friday about seven hours after he 
went on national television thursday afternoon and announced he had 
fired noriega 
noriegas followers command a majority of 45 seats in the 
67member assembly delvalles backers boycotted the session 
leaving the outcome a foregone conclusion

five us senators who accepted a total of 
297000 in contributions from an arizona company and its employees 
met with federal bank examiners investigating one of its 
subsidiaries a newspaper reported sunday 
within three months of the meeting examiners backed off and 
ultimately cleared the subsidiary lincoln savings and loan 
association of irvine calif of wrongdoing the detroit news 
quoted unidentified sources as saying 
the thrift is owned by phoenix arizbased american continental 
corp executives of the company and its subsidiaries made the 
donations over the past several years the newspaper reported 
those accepting the contributions and the amounts according to 
the news were alan cranston dcalif 41900 dennis deconcini 
dariz 43000 john glenn dohio 34000 john mccain 
rariz 112000 and don riegle dmich 66100 
riegle said there was no connection between the contribution 
toward his 1988 reelection campaign and the april 9 1987 meeting 
in which he and the four other senators discussed the investigation 
with federal home loan bank board examiners 
if there was the slightest suggestion or hint that somehow 
somebody was going to contribute in return for some kind of 
favorable consideration we dont want that money riegle said 
i wouldnt accept it 
aides to the other senators said none was available to comment 
late last week the newspaper reported 
the banking investigators were looking into highrisk 
investments made by lincoln that could threaten its solvency the 
news said 
the contributions were permissible under federal election laws 
riegles campaign chairman kevin gottlieb said the timing of the 
donations and the meeting with regulators was an interesting 
coincidence 
riegle told the newspaper he attended the meeting because he is 
a senior member of the senate banking committee and wanted to 
ensure lincoln savings received a fair review 
he said he was invited to the meeting by the other senators and 
was concerned lincoln was being harassed 
the newspaper quoted an unidentified source as saying that after 
the meeting the probe changed direction 
san francisco bank examiners were ready to ask for an 
enforcement action against lincoln an unidentified california 
bankig official was quoted as saying but that has changed the 
scope of the examination has changed 
american continental spokesman andy baer characterized the 
events differently 
i wouldnt say the examiners backed off i would say there 
is a new spirit of cooperation baer said 
the final bank examiners report recommended no sanctions 
against lincoln said robert kielty american continentals

one of two american hostages released sunday after their arrests 
by israeli authorities in the occupied west bank said the most 
frightening part of the ordeal was being denied access to us 
authorities or an attorney 
it was confusion and of course fright because when youre 
denied access to a lawyer and youre denied access to your own 
government its frightening to realize that youre cut off from 
any sort of legal protection alison glick 25 said in a 
telephone interview with wcpotv in cincinnati 
ms glick said the arresting authorities didnt tell the two why 
they were being held 
israeli officials allege that ms glick of north college hill 
ohio and john benvenuto 42 of boston were carrying posters 
bearing the names of slain palestinians in ramallah a west bank 
city they were arrested saturday on charges of incitement 
benvenutos mother who talked to her son by telephone sunday 
morning said she was relieved that the two were unharmed during 
the ordeal which lasted more than 24 hours 
he said if he hadnt been an american they would have beaten 
him said marian benvenuto of rochester ny she said her son 
had written to her of israelis beating palestinian protesters 
mrs benvenuto said her son told her the two were not 
demonstrating at the time of their arrest though she said her son 
has been involved in past demonstrations against the israeli 
occupation of the west bank 
benvenuto and ms glick teach at a private school in of ramallah 
israeli police tried to make benvenuto an art teacher sign a 
confession in hebrew that he was guilty of incitement said mrs 
benvenuto however she said her son doesnt speak hebrew fluently 
and refused to sign 
authorities didnt allow the two to consult a lawyer or american 
officials until early sunday when david goode a representative of 
the us consulate in east jerusalem was permitted to see them 
said mrs benvenuto the two were released shortly afterward 
the israelis have been trying to quiet three months of protest 
against their 20year occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
more than 70 palestinians have been reported killed by israeli 
forces during that time 
benvenuto and ms glick were arrested in a street near the 
friends girls school a quakerrun facility in ramallah mrs 
benvenuto said 
he was just walking down the street he and this other 
teacher going home for lunch she said soldiers from the 
israeli army stopped them and searched them and then turned them 
over to the police in ramallah 
he said he and this girl each had a plastic shopping bag and 
inside the bag he had pieces of cardboard with names of different 
palestinians who had been killed allegedly by israeli occupation 
forces 
she said she wasnt sure if the names were intended for use in a 
protest but that the two were not protesting at the time 
he was in different protest marches hes been teargassed 
and obviously they have a picture of him she said the 
american consul goode told me it was a warning to john to back 
off and mind his own business 
mrs benvenuto said her son believed press coverage of the 
arrests prompted the israelis to release the two americans early 
he was initially told he would be detained for 48 hours

the democratic presidential candidates debated 
the problems of the south on sunday minus frontrunners michael 
dukakis and richard gephardt 
it was the democrats second debate in two days with one more 
talkfest on the schedule monday 
apparently they dont care much about texas and the south 
former colorado sen gary hart said of the missing contenders 
tennessee sen albert gore jr also criticized the two absent 
candidates at the first opportunity 
maybe they didnt enjoy the debate last week in dallas gore 
said we miss them and i want them to know theyre missed he 
added 
simon who announced last week he would not campaign actively in 
the super tuesday states said his presence sunday proved he was 
not writing off the south 
i need and want and care for your votes he said after the 
debate he said there were no winners or losers in the debate 
with the exception of dukakis and gephardt 
the massachusetts governor and the missouri congressman have 
been trading victories in the early contests gephardt won iowa 
dukakis won new hampshire gephardt won south dakota dukakis won 
minnesota on sunday dukakis won maines democratic caucuses 
jackson was the only candidate who did not criticize gephardt 
and dukakis for not coming to houston 
i do not know why they chose not to be here i do not think it 
reflects a lack of interest or lack of integrity they simply made 
other priorities he said 
debate spokeswoman dee shoup said gephardt and dukakis cited 
scheduling conflicts 
about 800 people attended the debate at the george r brown 
convention center and the forum was televised

did not question the candidates television journalist linda 
ellerbee was the moderator

leadership to the rest of the field

you now hear gephardt saying we must challenge the multinational 
corporations thats jesse jackson when you now hear congress 
saying stop the drug flow thats jesse jackson when you hear 
other candidates talking about south africa for the first time 
thats jesse jackson 
hart too said he was showing the way for the rest 
im the only one who has put out a budget although i see each 
of these people gradually creeping towards that inevitability that 
i think they are going to have to face 
the fundamental point here is that paul talks about his 
programs jesse talks about his programs and al talks about his 
im the only one who puts out a budget to tell americans the 
truth he said 
on another subject gore said he supports a national energy 
policy that includes a price floor incentives for domestic oil 
production and discouragement of oil imports 
we have got to have a national energy policy he said

world merchandise trade grew more quickly last 
year than in 1986 and barring economic upheavals should expand at 
least as quickly this year a report by a world trade group said 
monday 
the crash of world stock markets last october does not appear to 
have had an immediate adverse impact on global commerce said 
the secretariat of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
early estimates show the volume of world merchandise trade rose 
by 4 percent last year compared to 35 percent in 1986 the world 
trade agencys analysts said 
barring a further major upheaval in financial markets or a 
serious recession in the united states it should grow at least as 
rapidly in 1988 they said 
last september gatt had predicted only about 35 percent growth 
for 1987 
the report expressed concern about trade imbalances among the 
worlds largest economies also third world debt and protectionist 
pressures still burden the world economy it said 
but consumer and investor confidence has survived the stock 
crash better than analysts forecasted immediately after the crisis 
the report said 
the improvement in the outlook for trade in recent months 
means that all other things being equal the risk of a recession 
in 1988 is smaller gatt chief economist richard blackhurst said 
the value of merchandise exports rose 155 percent in 1987 to a 
new record of 245 billion partly reflecting the depreciation of 
the us dollar and higher prices for crude oil and other 
commodities the report said 
manufactured goods led the expansion with a 5 percent rise in 
volume up from 35 percent in 1986 farm exports rebounded to an 
estimated 4 percent rise after a decline of 1 percent the report 
said 
reduced petroleum trade helped push trade volume in mining 
products down 1 percent 
imports by industrialized market economies remained the 
strongest force in world trade expansion though growth slowed to 5 
percent from 85 percent in 1986 the report said 
another factor cited was fast growth in asian economies such as 
hong kong south korea singapore and taiwan these countries have 
become significant buyers of manufactured goods on world markets as 
well as exporters gatt said 
export growth in developing countries slowed to 6 percent from 9 
percent in 1986 but remained more vigorous than in other parts of 
the world 
the report noted improved trade performance by a group of 15 
heavily indebted countries including 10 in latin america 
statecontrolled economies like china and the soviet bloc 
expanded their trade less than other countries particularly 
because they squeezed imports to adjust to lower export revenues 
from fuels and debt service requirements the report said 
the gatt includes about 100 member nations and was set up after 
world war ii it is both an agreement and a forum for removing 
trade barriers and ensuring the free movement of goods around the 
world it is administered by a permanent commission by the same 
name in geneva

bowtied drivers in refrigerated vans are 
rushing prime rib and triplelayer carrot cake to upscale homes 
here to test the water for homedelivered gourmet meals in an 
industry dominated by pizza 
the creation of the order inn an experimental division of 
food giant general mills inc was spurred by some compelling 
demographics industry analysts say the secretive test targets 
affluent singles and professional couples 
what were seeing is the beginning of an escalating delivery 
war not just with pizza but with all kinds of homedelivered 
food said charlie henderson vice president of marketing for 
godfathers pizza an omaha nebbased division of pillsbury inc 
people are timeshort and dollarrich said henderson whose 
company is shrinking sitdown areas in its new restaurants and 
mobilizing larger road forces they dont want to eat out 
theyre more than willing to pay to have it brought to their houses 
and i dont see it ending 
the explosion of convenience food in all its frozen and 
homedelivered variations can be traced to two late80s phenomena 
said stephen carnes managing director of research for the 
brokerage firm of piper jaffray amp hopwood 
carnes said his companys research shows 65 percent of us 
homes now have microwave ovens and 55 percent of all married women 
work households typically are short on time for cooking and long 
on money to pay others to do it 
but restaurants have shortcomings as an alternative to kitchen 
toil henderson and others note costs can be high and theres 
usually a wait 
moreover food industry analysts say that in an age of vcrs 
staying at home cocooning as its been dubbed is becoming 
an end in itself 
grocery stores around the country have scurried to meet the 
demand with wider offerings of prepared and semiprepared dinners 
the choices range from macaroni and cheese on the low end to london 
broil and rattlesnake at the top 
even a drive to the grocery store can sometimes be too strenuous 
for the workweary said peter flatow president of the new york 
market research company brainreserve inc 
the goal is delivering a nice dinner to them the challenge is 
overcoming high cost and logistics 
dominos pizza has done it now all youve got to do is get 
veal marsala there and youve got it flatow said the need is 
there nobody has fulfilled it yet 
a general mills spokesman would not discuss the order inn 
venture citing competitive factors local analysts say it has been 
under way for roughly six months 
industry watchers describe it as a logical step for general 
mills which also owns the red lobster yorks and olive garden 
restaurant chains based in golden valley a minneapolis suburb 
the company also has takeout experience it recently sold its chain 
of leann chins chinese restaurants which offered both sitdown 
and eatathome meals 
order inn menus being dropped off at twin cities homes in recent 
months promise free delivery usually in less than 20 minutes both 
lunches and dinners are available seven days a week 
the menu offers four selections in the appetizers and salad 
section including chilled shrimp and popcorn chicken two 
sandwiches are available and five entrees ranging from 575 for 
lasagna to 1095 for prime rib whitechocolate macadamia nut 
cheesecake highlights the three dessert choices 
the menus include detailed instructions on reheating in a 
microwave or oven and a questionnaire asking what was ordered and 
how the food and service ranked 
no verdict is in sight on the order inn but experts say general 
mills seems to have the right idea 
i dont think theres any question there will be more to 
follow said craig carver senior vice president of the 
minneapolis brokerage firm of dain bosworth 
a chief obstacle to success is keeping costs under control with 
pizza for example gasoline drivers insurance and other costs 
take a 3 to 4 slice out of a 10 pizza godfathers henderson 
says 
an extra hurdle for order inn is the daily gamble on how many 
orders will be placed for each item leftovers must be disposed of 
at days end general mills spokesman craig shulstad confirmed 
whatever the future of the experiment industry watchers predict 
scratch cooking will become ever more a recreational weekend 
pastime and restaurants they say should beware 
its really a fight for share of stomach carver said

a taiwanese dissident arrested trying 
to board a flight to taiwan with a false passport said monday he 
agreed to leave the philippines and would depart for the united 
states 
hsu hsinliang said he would leave monday aboard a korean air 
flight for seoul south korea and would travel on to hawaii 
hsu who edits the taiwan times newspaper in los angeles was 
banned from taiwan in 1979 for political activity 
immigration officials said hsu agreed to selfdeportation 
meaning he would be free to return to the philippines philippine 
authorities had offered to accept him as a political refugee but he 
declined saying he wanted to return to taiwan 
hsu was arrested feb 11 while preparing to board a flight for 
the taiwanese capital of taipei 
taiwanese officials refused to allow him to return to taiwan 
because people charged with sedition are not allowed to enter the 
country under the national security law which replaced martial 
rule last july 
taiwan had been under martial law since 1949 when the 
nationalist chinese lost a mainland civil war with the communists 
fled to the island and established a government 
hsu was charged with sedition for his alleged involvement in an 
antigovernment riot in taiwans southern port of kaohsiung in 
1979 the riot occurred two months after hsu had left for the 
united states but taiwanese officials said he helped organize it 
in september 1986 hsu organized a usbased taiwanese group 
the democratic progressive party overseas that is affiliated with 
taiwans opposition democratic progressive party

madonnas divorce plans were created by the 
press says her husband sean penn who vowed in an interview 
published sunday to refocus himself to avoid outbursts like the 
one that landed him in jail 
penn filmdoms bad boy discussed the strain of being married 
to the darling of american pop in a chicago tribune interview 
billed as the first since he was jailed for 32 days last summer 
after striking a movie extra 
i feel uncomfortable commenting about my family situation 
because im no expert on the subject obviously making any family 
work is an endless job thats hard enough even when the family 
isnt public penn said 
madonna filed divorce papers in santa monica calif on dec 4 
citing irreconcilable differences two weeks later she asked to 
withdraw the petition and the court granted the request the same 
day court records show no reason was given in the court papers 
for her change of heart 
but penn 27 said nevertheless that talk about the possibility 
of divorce was more people magazine than reality my attitude 
with the press right now is that i hope theyve had their share of 
me theyve been very busy trying to find or make dirt id like to 
get back to acting 
penn said his reported marital problems with madonna 29 stem 
from her fans view of him as lessthanideal marriage material 
the couple were married aug 16 1985 in a lavish ceremony on a 
malibu calif bluff overlooking the pacific ocean while news 
helicopters buzzed overhead 
she belonged to them to the public penn said and if 
anybody took her i think they thought it should have been someone 
more acceptable like donald trump 
the public is very possessive about rock stars penn said 
and about her in particular they dont want to share their 
love 
penn may not be able to shed his reputation but he said he 
plans to try to avoid future confrontations 
certainly ive thought about it he said i just have to 
refocus myself in another direction 
of his california jail experience penn said he was never afraid 
i was in a jail with all the big shots one person to a cell 
solitary confinement for 24 hours so afraid no but bored yes 
after about two weeks of that kind of boredom i think i would have 
preferred some fear 
penn spoke with the tribune after dinner he had fettuccine with 
shrimp madonna had a caesar salad he said she always has 
caesar salads

george bush claiming a solid victory sunday in maines 
republican presidential caucuses was attacked by chief rival bob 
dole on the irancontra affair while rep jack kemp blasted the 
two gop frontrunners on taxes 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis won the maine democratic 
caucuses scoring another victory on his new england home turf and 
jesse jackson scored a surprisingly strong second followed by an 
uncommitted bloc 
today our message continued to shine the massachusetts 
governor said in a statement todays victory gives our national 
campaign another push toward success on super tuesday 
the state republican party provided no official count but 
various campaigns agreed bush who makes his summer home in maine 
was far ahead with former television evangelist pat robertson 
next followed by the uncommitteds 
i am delighted with what appears to be an overwhelming victory 
in the maine caucuses assuring my campaign of all 22 national 
delegates bush said from washington 
the maine caucuses pick delegates to the parties state 
conventions this spring where national convention delegates are 
chosen 
four of the six democrats meanwhile gathered for a debate in 
houston where the absentees dukakis and rep richard gephardt 
came under fire for skipping the event 
at a republican debate in atlanta the first fullscale gop 
faceoff of the southern campaign dole took aim at bush for the 
reagan administrations decision to trade arms for hostages in the 
irancontra affair that he said was a big mistake 
we never should trade arms for hostages we shouldnt issue 
these reports and say we shouldnt trade arms for hostages the 
vice presidents report and then later go to a meeting and say 
its all right we shouldnt do those things dole said holding 
up a report on terrorism that was written by a presidential 
commission headed by bush 
bush did not respond directly but did say mistakes were 
made in the irancontra affair 
kemp whose campaign has been faltering after poor showings in 
early contests accused bush and dole of supporting tax hikes 
they sound alike they talk alike theyve supported every 
single tax increase over the last eight years the new york 
congressman said if theyre nominated the reagan revolution is 
over gone dead 
dole hit back saying jacks never met a deficit he didnt 
like and bush told the new york congressman you dont care 
about deficits you never have and theyre public enemy no 1 
bush is planning to skip the league of women voters debate next 
sunday in nashville his campaign manager said 
at this time there are no debates on the schedule lee 
atwater told reporters after the atlanta debate were simply at 
a point where weve got 20 states youve got to maintain control 
of your schedule 
the gop contest was sponsored by the atlanta 
journalconstitution newspapers which also organized a democratic 
faceoff on saturday there dukakis made stinging attacks on 
rivals gephardt and sen albert gore jr of tennessee 
gore who largely bypassed early contests in new hampshire and 
iowa is pinning his hopes on a strong showing on super tuesday 
march 8 on that day 20 states mostly in the south will hold 
primaries or caucuses 
sen sam nunn of georgia who disappointed many democrats when 
he decided to sit out the presidential race said sunday he still 
hasnt decided whether to lend his backing to his fellow southerner 
i like al gore nunn said in an interview on nbctvs meet 
the press i like what he says on national security 
but he said i also like dick gephardt im not ducking 
it i just havent decided who im going to vote for yet i like 
gore and i like gephardt 
gephardt and dukakis responsible for the sharpest sparring 
among the democrats lately did not attend sunday nights 
democratic debate in houston gary hart attacked the absentees 
apparently they dont care much about texas and the south 
the former colorado senator said those who did attend the debate 
however admitted theyre getting a bit tired of such gatherings 
we really are kind of trapped in these 90second sound bites 
trying to say a thing that makes a difference said jackson 
there really is a problem in these debates in that we have to 
answere in 60 seconds or 90 seconds and in some debates 30 
seconds said paul simon 
dukakis campaigned sunday from the deck of a fire boat in 
baltimores harbor and pledged to make affordable housing a 
priority if elected maryland is one of the states voting on super

health insurance for all americans and to make fighting drugs his 
top priority 
the sandinistas are not threatening the streets of tampa this 
morning he said the no 1 threat is coke crack and heroin

chrysler corps plans to close a wisconsin 
assembly plant and its admission that it might sell its acustar 
inc parts subsidiary are fueling worker anger and distrust as the 
two sides head into this summers national contract talks 
chryslers parts operations were grouped into the subsidiary 
last spring but most of acustars 28000 workers have been with 
chrysler since it battled back from the brink of bankruptcy early 
in the decade when they granted concessions to keep the company 
afloat 
chrysler workers think the potential sale now that the no 3

presidential candidates from congress work in 
a system where its hard to avoid some flipflopping on issues but 
when a candidate cant offer convincing explanations those charges 
take root with voters experts say 
two democratic candidates battling for super tuesday votes 
missouri rep richard gephardt and tennessee sen albert gore have 
been the most frequent targets even trading those accusations 
themselves both as legislators have voted on two sides of 
several issues 
gephardt has taken fire for moving to the left after deciding to 
run for president on abortion trade and social issues gore has 
become more conservative especially on defense matters

rep richard gephardt moves into super tuesday 
territory with an extraordinarily effective television advertising 
campaign that touched raw nerves and won lastminute support among 
voters in earlier democratic presidential contests 
while critics complain that gephardts populist image is an 
insiders affectation and his hardhitting hyundai trade ad is 
based on bad numbers theres little disagreement about the impact 
of the missouri congressmans tv campaign 
the forceful spots created by political veterans david doak and

does anyone pay attention to a 6foot7 
kibbitzer who used to be the second most powerful man in washington 
paul volcker is beginning to find out 
the former chairman of the federal reserve recently broke a 
selfimposed vow of silence to resume offering opinions on 
deficits taxes and the health of the economy 
he seemed to show a little of the old magical influence last 
thursday when stock and bond prices sank soon after he called for a 
tax increase and predicted that interest rates would rise 
but some skeptics said the markets behavior had nothing to do 
with what volcker said 
hes not even associated with the fed anymore said 
hildegarde zagorski a market strategist at prudentialbache 
securities inc 
when you get a day like thursday everybody tries to say 
what killed the market and they drag out every news item that would 
have passed unnoticed she said 
so is volcker capable of moving the market no not at all 
ms zagorski said 
volcker still has not settled down to a new job since his 
departure from the federal reserve last august when he was 
succeeded by alan greenspan but volcker is expected to announce 
his career decision within the next few weeks 
meanwhile he is borrowing an office on wall street and heading 
a washingtonbased commission on how to improve the quality of the 
nations civil service 
speaking on the lecture circuit helps pay the bills and gives 
volcker a forum to express his views on the need to cut the federal 
budget deficit 
the forum for his remarks thursday was a luncheon meeting in san 
antonio of the national association of industrial and office parks 
the night before volcker had spoken in peoria ill at the 
washington day banquet of the creve coeur club 
in peoria volcker was chosen as a contrast to the 1987 speaker 
bob hope 
we certainly know its difficult to upstage a bob hope so we 
said lets go back to something thats not comparable said henry 
allovio the clubs vice president 
according to those who believe in volckers continuing 
influence his remarks in san antonio triggered a selloff in the 
bond market which scared owners of stockindex futures which in 
turn dragged down stock prices 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which had been up as 
much as 33 points ended up with a loss for the day of 2238 
points most of it in the final hour of trading 
i have deep respect for paul volcker and in my opinion there 
is not a single more influential economist in this country said 
john v sebastian executive vice president and chief economist of 
clayton brown amp associates in chicago 
but can volcker influence trading decisions even without the 
control over the nations money supply that he once had yes 
sebastian said 
as an example he mentioned henry kaufman a prominent economist 
for the giant wall street investment firm salomon brothers inc 
whose outlooks used to move interest rates in the bond market in 
december kaufman announced plans to start his own consulting firm 
henry kaufman in his heyday had no authority and yet he was 
able to influence the markets sebastian said

irving bank corp target of a 108 billion 
hostile takeover proposal by bank of new york that was sanctioned 
last week by government regulators said sunday it would brief 
shareholders on why they should reject the bid and predicted a 
bitterly fought battle for their votes 
irving plans to bring to the attention of its shareholders all 
the factors they should consider regarding the offer as well as 
questioning exactly how bank of new york intends to meet the 
numerous conditions to which its offer is now subject the bank 
said in a press statement 
it was irvings first official reaction to the approval given 
last thursday by the federal reserve board and new york state 
banking board bank of the bank of new yorks hostile 60 a share 
bid in cash and securities 
the takeover fight has attracted attention because hostile 
acquisitions are unusual in the normally staid banking world some 
analysts have said government approval portends hostile takeovers 
of other banks 
fed and state officials dismissed the unfriendly nature of the 
bid as irrelevant and said they saw no competitive threat to a 
merger of the two new york banks which would create the nations 
12th largest banking company with assets of nearly 42 billion 
nevertheless the fed imposed one important condition of 
approval by requiring bank of new york to sell additional stock to 
replenish the 264 million cash portion of the takeover in 
addition the fed said at least 60 percent of that amount must be 
raised before the transaction can be completed 
although bank of new york officials expressed confidence they 
could meet the condition irving called it significant hurdles 
because it will dilute the stocks value and must be approved by 
bank of new york shareholders 
the bank of new yorks offer depends on receipt of twothirds of 
irvings shares the offer could encounter more difficulty because 
of a new york law that impedes hostile takeovers 
irving said the feds approval clearly opens the way for a 
bitterly fought proxy battle 
proxies are written statements authorizing others to vote stock 
on the behalf of shareholders a normal arrangement in publicly 
held companies management routinely solicits shareholder proxies 
but they are also used by others attempting to win control away 
from management 
the feds approval does not change the nature of the proposal 
which continues to make no business sense and is not in the best 
longterm interest of irving said the irving statement 
it said the bank is fully committed to continue opposing this 
grossly inadequate and highly conditional proposal which the 
corporations unanimous board is convinced is not in irvings best 
interests
