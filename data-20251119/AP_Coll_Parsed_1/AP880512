the actors yves montand likes are the kind of 
actor he is himself 
i admire sean connery very much he said i like columbo 
peter falk i like this kind of actors who become older but they 
dont lose their youth really they go on with some charm and are 
human beings they dont destroy themselves with face lifts which 
are terrible 
montand was recently in new york to receive this years tribute 
from the film society of lincoln center the 17th person to be 
honored and the first frenchman his two most recent films are 
jean de florette which won the british film academys prize 
for best picture and manon of the spring in both he portrays 
a farming village patriarch cesar soubeyran 
the reason i didnt want to make the movies was not because i 
look 20 years older said the 66yearold montand i said let 
the years do their job it was because i wanted to go on tour 
montand started as a singer was discovered by the legendary 
edith piaf made his first movie with her in 1945 and sang on stage 
and made movies until 1968 when he decided to concentrate on film 
acting in 1982 he made a world singing tour which was a smash 
success and planned to repeat in 1984 but made the two movies 
instead 
i think it is a very good story based on a wonderful book 
marcel pagnols leau des colines but it was courageous to 
make this kind of part contrary to what people wait for from you 
he is a nasty man he could be very cruel in some ways he said 
montand and actress simone signoret who were married from 1950 
until her death in 1985 used to read each others movie scripts 
sometimes she would say youre going to shoot this thing it 
is awful i would say youre right but i promised this young 
director of course the movie is a flop he recalled 
sometimes you fall in love with a story youre reading if a 
director has good taste he puts you in his pocket 
montand has advice about getting older humor tenderness and 
lucidity cannot change and are important in life as you become 
older you need to laugh have a sense of humor first of all 
against yourself everybody needs tenderness tenderness cannot 
become old never and if you are clear this is right this is 
not right you stay a young man or woman 
im going to look a little pompous now but i say never never 
stop working with your memory you remember a girl what is her 
name you say it isnt important forget it no no make the 
effort to discover again the name of this girl even if it is not 
important this is exercise like for the muscles 
for physical exercise montand walks four or five miles every 
day when he can sometimes i make a seven or 10minute dance in 
the morning then i take a shower and thats it 
at the tribute french filmmaker louis malle called montand 
one of the most romantic figures the french cinema has ever 
known 
montand however still hasnt figured out romance i 
remembered this morning lying in bed the first time a girl kissed 
me or i kissed her i didnt like it two months later someone 
else comes you collapse both are very nice looking its very 
peculiar 
when you are an adult it is a mystery you love me i love 
you its the only thing you can say you are mad its 
unbelievable its a volcano inside what does it mean we can 
understand nothing death love we dont know anything about 
maybe its better i dont know its a wonderful mystery anyway 
thank god 
during the interview in montands suite in hotel maxims the 
telephone rang several times and a film society representative 
spoke to women who wished to stop by im sure it is only for 
autographs the actor said with a charming smile 
since jean de florette and manon of the spring montand 
has done a few tv appearances he plans a tv version about alfred 
dreyfus the french army officer who was convicted for treason but 
later found to be the victim of antisemitism he also plans to do 
a movie about terrorists 
montands next movie though will be a musical three seats 
for the 26th directed by jacques demy with music by michel 
legrand who collaborated on the umbrellas of cherbourg 
i dont want to tell you the story i want it to be a 
surprise he said it will not be a beautiful masterpiece as 
made by gene kelly or fred astaire

a year after a military coup ended democratic 
government in fiji the south pacific nation is still reeling in 
the aftermath of a conflict that arose over fijian fears of 
domination by the indian population 
the economy is shaky and skilled professionals and civil 
servants mostly indians are leaving for canada australia and new 
zealand at a rate of 500 a month double the precoup figure 
sugar production the countrys major cash crop is down 203 
percent tourism has dropped 269 percent the currency has been 
devalued 33 percent inflation has tripled to 6 percent 
unemployment has reached 75 percent and the gross domestic product 
is down 11 percent 
the coup of may 14 1987 was led by lt col sitiveni rabuka 
who claimed that a newly elected coalition government dominated by 
the decendants of immigrants from india threatened the future of 
ethnic fijians 
the indians outnumbered fijians 348704 to 329305 at the time 
and controlled trade and commerce 
the election of an indiancontrolled government led to the army 
coup prime minister timoci bavadra a fijian and his cabinet were 
arrested the constitution was suspended and rule by decree was put 
in force 
since then ethnic fijian fears of indian political supremacy 
have eased 
but the coup virtually ended organized political activities but 
the country is now seeing factional and clan rivalries among fijian 
chiefs in a feud over a fijian king 
it was to solve just such rivalries that king seru cakobau 
handed over the islands then known as the cannibal isles to queen 
victoria of britain in 1874 after first having tried to interest 
the united states 
ratu sir george cakobau grndson of the king and a former prime 
minister now claims the royal title which had been vacant since 
the british took control 
but other chiefs and clans are disputing cakobaus claim to the 
title 
bavadra the ousted prime minister said he feared squabbling 
among the chiefs could provoke a violent reaction from fijians 
feeling the effects of the economic downturn since the coup 
watching the tribal feuds with interest is the 39yearold 
rabuka who is a commoner 
he has become a cult figure to many ethnic fijians who regard 
him as the savior of their culture 
he is the minister for home affairs in the interim government he 
appointed to run the country until a new constitution is drafted 
and elections held 
a new book rabuka no other way giving rabukas account 
of the coup became an instant best seller 
also in demand is an autographed color poster of rabuka in an 
army tshirt and bearing the slogan fiji in gods hands 
a documentary film titled operation surprise the code name 
for the coup has been showing to packed houses fiji has has no 
television 
one of the first acts by rabuka a methodist lay preacher 
former rugby star and veteran of the united nations middle east 
peace force was to make the religious observance of sundays 
compulsory 
no shops are allowed to open no sports can be played public 
transport halts and the populace is expected but not yet 
compelled to go to church 
but the sunday observance law has become so unpopular that even 
the fiji council of churches has called for its repeal 
in the bestselling book written by a fijian and an australian 
rabuka says the majority of fijis indians are heathens and should 
be converted to christianity most of the indians are hindus 
i dont think they will resent it rabuka is quoted as 
saying because all we are trying to do is the same thing that 
missionaries did here in fiji when we were cannibals and heathens 
in the year since the coup indian leaders have fled or taken a 
low profile 
but one indian who remains prominent is irene narayan 56 
rabukas minister for indian affairs 
she said in an interview the indian community is now without a 
political leader but added she saw little likelihood of communal 
violence between fijians and indians 
she expressed the view that while some indians have left the 
majority will remain and probably accept their loss of political 
rights 
if fijians want dominance and they are happy with it perhaps 
thats not high a price for indians to pay mrs narayan said 
meanwhile fijis relations with traditonal friends and 
neighbors are taking time to mend australia new zealand and the 
united states condemned rabukas coup they called their 
ambassadors home and suspended aid but the envoys of all three 
have since returned 
australia and new zealand have resumed nonmilitary aid but 
relations remain chilly

a scientist is planning to use nazi studies 
of concentration camp prisoners deliberately frozen to death to 
further his research about hypothermia 
but some scientists and jewish leaders have sharply criticized 
his intention to use data obtained during the holocaust 
dr robert pozos director of the hypothermia research 
laboratory at the university of minnesota duluth says he plans to 
analyze and republish the treatment of shock from prolonged 
exposure to cold a study by doctors at dachau it includes 
observation and physiological measurements of people placed in vats 
of freezing liquid often to the point of death according to those 
familiar with the study 
we should under no circumstances use the information it was 
gained in an immoral way said dr daniel callahan director of 
the hastings center a medical ethics think tank in briarcliff 
manor ny 
i think it goes to legitimizing the evil done i think the 
findings are tainted by the horror and misery said abraham h 
foxman national director of the antidefamation league 
because mammals differ widely in their physiological response to 
cold hypothermia research is uniquely dependent on human test 
subjects says pozos a specialist in the field for 12 years 
it could advance my work in that it takes human subjects 
farther than were willing he said 
several medical ethicists contend study of the nazi research 
could save lives and if published with a condemnation of the 
methods call attention to the plight of the jews poles and 
gypsies killed in the experiments 
because the egyptians used slave labor does that mean we 
should never gaze at the pyramids asked dr thomas murray 
director of the center for biomedical ethics at case western 
reserve university in cleveland 
it sends a chill down every normal human beings spine to 
think of the horrible things the nazis did there but im 
separating the results and the circumstances said ephraim 
zuroff israeli representative to the simon wiesenthal center in 
los angeles actually if the us doctor dedicated his study to 
the memory of those victims of the nazis it would serve as a nice 
way of reminding people about the horrible experiments 
use of nazi science by postworld war ii researchers is rare but 
not unprecedented after facing a similar quandary this year the 
federal environmental protection agency deleted references to nazi 
research in its own draft report on a toxic gas 
pozos 45 says he decided to use the nazi hypothermia data 
after seeing a resurgence of public and scientific curiosity about 
it he says copies of a 1945 english translation of the dachau 
study have been available in about a dozen libraries around the 
country 
motivated in part by the loss of pilots in the frigid north sea 
the germans used 100 to 300 prisoners to test the bodys response 
to extreme cold pozos said how many died is unclear besides 
testing the phenomenon of freezing the doctors experimented with 
warming techniques ranging from bodytobody contact to alcohol 
ingestion pozos said 
word of pozos plans for the old nazi experiments spread after 
he contacted university of minnesota medical ethicist arthur caplan 
for advice caplan wrote a newspaper column about the issue 
pozos said he has had a generally positive response including 
calls from about a halfdozen holocaust survivors they said i 
should get something out of this so these people would not have 
died in vain said pozos 
within two months pozos said he hopes to republish the german 
study in a scientific journal with his own analysis of its quality 
and application to modern hypothermia research 
while calling the study a record of unimaginable horror and 
cruelty caplan said he believes pozos should be allowed to 
republish it under strict guidelines among other stipulations 
caplan urges omission of the nazi doctors names to ensure no 
credit is conferred 
if the data can prevent a single death then it is worth 
tolerating the stench of past deaths that will cling to each 
page caplan wrote 
caplan has organized an international symposium on nazi science 
tentatively scheduled for may 1989 at the university of minnesota

the united auto workers on wednesday ratified a 
contract giving 66000 chrysler corp employees in 15 states 
greater job protection the union said 
the twoyear contract was approved by about 54 percent of those 
voting according to union officials who spoke on condition they 
not be identified 
two former american motors corp locals in wisconsin also voted 
wednesday approving separate pacts reached during the national 
contract talks at chryslers highland park headquarters chrysler 
bought amc in august 
the uaw and the no 3 automaker reached the agreement may 4 
after 2 weeks of early negotiations aimed at mending a series of 
conflicts talks normally would have begun in july or august 
the contract which replaces a threeyear agreement that would 
have have expired sept 14 mirrors that signed last fall at ford 
motor co and general motors corp 
the big three contract prevents layoffs except when production 
is cut because of slow sales forbids plant closings not announced 
before talks began and makes it harder for companies to transfer 
work to outside companies or foreign countries 
the chrysler contract also provides 3 percent lumpsum bonuses 
in 1989 and 1990 a 1000 signing bonus and for the first time 
profitsharing according to the formula that has generated 
thousands of dollars for ford workers 
but the chrysler pact also prevents the company from paying cash 
or stock bonuses to executives in years when a profitsharing 
formula included in the contract generates no payout for workers 
the uaw was angered in the past two years when gm workers 
received no profitsharing while executives were awarded generous 
bonuses 
union leaders including vice president marc stepp have said 
they expected the pact approved last week by local union leaders 
on the uaws 140member chrysler bargaining council to be ratified 
by a comfortable margin 
however the contract was rejected at several large locals 
including detroits jefferson avenue assembly plant and mound road 
engine plant and a stamping plant in sterling heights union 
officials said 
chryslers 3500worker warren truck plant approved the contract 
with 65 percent in favor said local 140 president gil wojcik 
im surprised im flabbergasted i thought it would pass by a 
wider margin said wojcik chairman of the elected 10member 
bargaining committee 
unlike the gm and ford pacts the chrysler contract also 
protects 2200 workers at four closing acustar inc parts plants 
from layoff when any of the plants are closed workers will be 
paid their regular wages and placed in a job bank 
if any of the four plants one in van wert ohio and three in 
the detroit area are sold instead workers can choose whether to 
go into the job bank and wait for a chrysler opening or go with the 
new employer

a top department of energy official conceded 
wednesday that two whistleblowers from washington state may have 
been harassed by their superiors after testifying last year before 
a house subcommittee about safety problems at the hanford nuclear 
reservation 
under secretary of energy joseph salgado who has responsibility 
for the department of energys safety programs at facilities such 
as the hanford reservation said that both he and the department 
had failed to protect casey ruud and james simkin from any 
retaliation by their employer 
it was negligent on my part salgado told the oversight and 
investigations subcommittee of the house energy committee 
salgado said the handling of ruud and simpkin called into 
question the departments efforts to improve its safety programs 
and that the two should have been praised rather than harassed 
we failed to acknowledge what they had done said salgado 
it was the wrong thing to do 
salgado also said that doe had sent the wrong message to 
employees who are concerned about safety at federal nuclear 
facilities 
during an october hearing before the same subcommittee ruud and 
simkin had outlined a series of safety problems at the central 
washington nuclear facility and salgado had pledged they they would 
not suffer because of their testimony 
ruud and simpkin said wednesday they had been harassed and 
intimidated since their last appearance before the subcommittee 
and that other workers at the hanford reservation are afraid to 
report safety problems for fear of reprisals 
ruud laid off in february by the westinghouse hanford co said 
he was told by his superiors there was an unwritten 
understanding that he would never be promoted 
in addition ruud said one supervisor roger johnson who now 
heads one of westinghouses employee concerns committee told him 
if his testimony before the subcommittee prevented him from getting 
anotherjob thats just too bad 
william jacobi president of westinghouse hanford admitted that 
johnson heads the employee concerns committee but said he was not 
aware of ruuds allegation prior to wednesday and promised to 
investigate ruuds claims 
there are many other people at hanford who are afraid to 
come forward with serious problems because they fear reprisals 
ruud testified 
simpkin still works at the hanford reservation but said he has 
been transferred to a department where he cannot contribute 
to correcting the safety problems at hanford 
less than a month after last falls hearing simpkin said he 
received a letter of reprimand from his supervisor the letter was 
withdrawn after an energy department investigation found it was 
unfair and unjustified 
some republican members of the committee suggested that perhaps 
simpkin and ruud were not qualified for the transfers they had 
sought 
others suggested the two hadnt been singled out but had been 
caught up in the massive layoffs and employee reshuffling resulting 
from the closing of the reactor and the decision not to locate the 
nations first highlevel nuclear waste dump at hanford 
no congressional committee can function if witnesses have 
apprehensions about what will happen if they tell the truth said 
rep john dingel dmich subcomittee chairman the matter will 
not end with this meeting today 
but the function of this hearing was not to demean you or your 
department dingell told salgado

a navy technician accused of having sex 
with his fiancee without telling her he was infected with the aids 
virus was acquitted of assault wednesday by a military jury 
petty officer 2nd class john e crawford 27 of magnolia ark 
stood at attention in the packed courtroom as the sevenmember jury 
delivered the verdict after 4 hours of deliberation 
the sailor was convicted of a minor charge of having a visitor 
in his room after hours and was given 15 days in the brig and 
reduced in rank one grade he could have received up to two years 
in the brig for the offense 
it was what i felt was right crawford accompanied by his 
present fiancee karen skavdahl said of the verdict 
crawford could have been stripped of his rank dishonorably 
discharged and sentenced to a decade behind bars had he been 
convicted of assault 
the jury also acquitted him of adultery and of exposing his 
former fiancee jeannie elmer to the aids virus elmer is a 
civilian 
the case was unprecedented in the navy although there have been 
similar cases in other branches of the military 
crawford was accused of having unprotected sex with elmer in 
1987 without warning her he had tested positive for the aids virus 
he was charged with adultery because elmer was separated but not 
divorced from her third husband 
crawford an avionics technician testified he told elmer about 
his test results and wore a condom when the couple made love in his 
barracks room 
but elmer said that she didnt learn crawford had been exposed 
to the virus until the next day when her housemate who also had 
been crawfords lover told her about the sailors test elmer has 
tested negative for the aids virus 
five of the seven members of the jury had to agree to reach 
verdicts 
the government is attempting to explore how far the uniform 
code of military justice can be applied against an individual 
with the aids virus defense attorney lt ron richman charged as 
the case went to the jury the government seeks to hold out petty 
officer crawford as a guinea pig to see how far it can go on the 
aids issue 
lt cmdr jane gilliland prosecutor in the case said in her 
closing statement that crawford depicted as caring and concerned 
by the defense simply didnt care enough about elmer to tell her 
about the tests 
she had no idea that the act of sex which she engaged in with 
petty officer crawford was potentially fatal to her gilliland 
said 
crawford has said elmer was bitter that he had broken off their 
brief engagement and filed charges for revenge 
meanwhile in arizona the aidsrelated courtmartial of adrian 
g morris jr resumed for the hearing of motions after a ninemonth 
delay 
morris a 28yearold army private from caseyville ill is 
accused of having threatened the health of three soldiers by not 
using condoms during sex and failing to warn them he had tested 
positive for the aids virus 
judge raymond d cole set a july trial date after denying 
motions for dismissal of charges cole will hear the case without a 
jury at morris request 
he is charged with aggravated assault conduct prejudicial to 
the good order and discipline of the army and sodomy 
the proceedings were adjourned aug 5 by cole to allow the army 
to appeal his ruling barring the army from introducing morris aids 
blood test as evidence coles ruling was later reversed 
the national centers for disease control estimates that 20 
percent to 30 percent of those who show antibodies to the aids 
virus will develop the fatal disease within five years

more than 100 descendants of colonial 
planter john drayton are expected at his plantation this weekend to 
celebrate the 250th anniversary of the family homestead 
drayton hall a twostory brick georgian structure northwest of 
charleston has passed through seven generations of the drayton 
family 
now it is one of 13 sites maintained by the national trust for 
historic preservation that is open to the public it attracts more 
than 52000 visitors a year 
the thomas drayton family settled in south carolina in 1679 
nine years after the founding of charleston the youngest son 
john began construction of drayton hall in 1738 it was completed 
four years later 
his father lived at nearby magnolia plantation which also is a 
popular tourist attraction 
there are an estimated 4000 descendants of thomas drayton 
scattered around the world and at least 100 are expected for the 
celebration which will include dancing under the stars and 
workshops on archaeology said meg lavin curator at drayton hall 
drayton hall is the only ashley river plantation to survive the 
civil war intact two small flanking buildings one used as a 
kitchen and one as a utility building were destroyed in the 1886 
charleston earthquake and a hurricane seven years later 
george neil assistant director of drayton hall said that 
according to family legend the house emerged from the civil war 
unscathed because of the quick thinking of its occupant dr john 
drayton 
as union troops marched through toward the end of the war 
drayton had the house posted with flags signifying it was being 
used to treat smallpox patients however its not known whether it 
actually was used as a hospital 
the story comes down both through the owners and slave 
descendants whether it was a ruse or not is unclear said ms 
lavin 
the builder of the house was a successful planter who owned up 
to 125 slaves and acquired 30 other properties including townhouses 
in charleston 
the cost of building the manor located on a 125acre tract is 
not known said neil however in the later part of the 18th 
century the house was referred to as mr draytons palace

have been more prompt action after last octobers stock market 
crash this thing happened over seven months ago he said 
regan told the senate banking committee that a form of 
computerized trading called index arbitrage should be prohibited 
and that all transactions involving stock index futures should be 
temporarily halted both practices he said make the markets 
excessively volatile and have scared worried individual investors 
off 
a stock market whose main participants are speculators and 
their programs cannot be a healthy market and an unhealthy wall 
street will sooner or later drag down the real economy said 
regan the former chief executive officer of merrill lynch amp co 
the banking panel has been holding hearings on the dramatic 
price swings that have dominated the markets since oct 19 when 
the dow jones industrial average fell a record 508 points 
regan who was white house chief of staff for two years after 
being treasury secretary has spent most of his time recently 
talking about his new book for the record from wall street to 
washington in it he says first lady nancy reagan often consults 
astrologers when planning the presidents schedule and making other 
decisions 
regan declined to discuss his book wednesday with reporters 
but he did blame computerdriven trading especially index 
arbitrage for the markets problems 
traders conducting index arbitrage use computers to profit from 
price discrepancies between the stock and futures markets by 
simultaneously buying in one market and selling in the other 
in my mind we should start by banning index option arbitrage 
and then proceed with other reforms which will restore public 
confidence in the financial markets regan said 
he said problems also have been caused by stock futures which 
are traded in chicago in a stock index futures transaction an 
amount of cash equal to the value of a collection of stocks changes 
hands with an agreement that the portfolio will be bought back at 
whatever those stocks values are at a specific future date 
opponents of the practice say the massive amounts of money 
involved add unpredictability to the stock market when traders buy 
or sell equities to protect their futures transactions 
i think there should be a pause in index futures trading 
regan told reporters after his testimony it wont hurt very much 
for a threemonth or sixmonth pause here while we take a look at 
the instrument itself and how its used to see whether or not it 
should be permitted to continue 
regan told the senators the nations financial markets or the 
federal agencies that regulate them should initiate the steps he 
recommended if not congress should act he said 
at the same hearing george l ball chairman and chief 
executive officer of prudentialbache securities inc said the 
abolition of stock index futures should be considered 
most knowledgeable professionals agree that if it were not for 
index futures stock market moves would be far less wild sudden or 
irrationally large he said 
charles r schwab who owns the discount brokerage firm that 
bears his name also told the lawmakers that program trading should 
be abolished if other steps to restore market confidence dont work 
in surveys we have conducted we hear over and over again the 
theme that individual investors fear they cannot compete in markets 
that are so dominated by the volatility introduced by program 
trading and index arbitrage he said 
earlier leo melamed chairman of the executive committee of the 
board of governors of the chicago mercantile exchange told 
reporters that index arbitrage helps stabilize the markets by 
ensuring that stock and futures prices closely track each other 
im not going to defend perception he said the reality 
is it is not a factor in the volatility

theres a creaky plank in the platform 
president reagan stands on when he sounds off against legislation 
aimed at protecting workers against sudden plant closings 
reagan speaking against the provision recently said that as 
an old labor union president i suggest thats a matter that 
belongs in the managementlabor contracts between the unions and 
the people 
but that suggests organized labor plays a largerthanlife role 
in todays economy many government statisticians unionists and 
even business executives know better 
reagan headed the screen actors guild in hollywood in the late 
1940s when unions were far more powerful than they are today 
representing roughly a third of all workers 
because unions now represent only about 15 percent of all 
workers and about 20 percent in manufacturing it doesnt 
necessarily follow that plant notification protections can be left 
for employers and unions to settle 
doing that would leave open the question of who takes care of 
the interests of the other 80 percent of bluecollar workers 
whats happened is that the administration has essentially 
accepted the boardroom argument that executives must be free to 
make their own decisions reagans shopworn argument 
notwithstanding 
and labor secretary ann mclaughlin conceded to a manfacturers 
audience tuesday that this may prove politically costly especially 
if reagans expected veto of the bill is sustained 
the polls have indicated that from the people ive talked to 
62 percent of the people think that plant notification is the right 
way to go she said this issue is going to drive us kicking 
and screaming for the next five months 
the plantclosing provision in the 1000page trade bill was the 
product of heavy lobbying by the aflcio and many democrats were 
unwilling to see it pulled from the bill 
the workers who do not have the benefit of a union are treated 
like dogs said brian turner assistant to howard samuel 
president of the aflcios industrial union department 
the fact is that although a lot of companies talk a good game 
and a lot of them do a good game the overwhelming fact is that 
many workers do not get sufficient notice turner said 
he cited a government accounting office study which found that 
workers hit by plant closings but not represented by unions had an 
average of only two days warning 
mark de bernardo special counsel for domestic policy at the 
us chamber of commerce said reagan is correct in opposing any 
move by congress to legislate worker notification protections 
eightyeight percent of the employers do give some notice and 
more and more employers are giving more whether they have unions 
or not he said but its not always possible for businesses in 
financial turmoil 
plant closing legislation he said would handcuff employers 
at a time which is particularly troubled and turbulent 
audrey freeman a labor economist at the conference board a 
business research organization in new york challenged arguments 
used by government business and labor on this issue 
referring to reagans statement about leaving plantclosing 
protection to companies and unions she said i think thats a 
cynical response that youre getting from the white house 
the strength of unions tends to be more and more in government 
and governmentaffected employment rather than in manufacturing 
she said 
the whole plantclosing thing is kind of artificial she 
said i have the impression that theyre the opponents and 
proponents just acting in front of a painted scenery 
ms freeman said she thinks business overstates its concern 
about governmental interference and that organized labor merely is 
trying to get back a greater say in the decisionmaking process

kim youngsam regained control of the 
opposition reunification democratic party on thursday when he was 
elected its president at a special party convention in seoul 
kims reemergence at the helm of the party comes only three 
months after he resigned from the top party post in an attempt to 
forge a merger with the breakaway opposition party for peace and 
democracy led by rival kim daejung 
in his acceptance speech kim youngsam said he would reform the 
party and lead it to victory in the general elections four years 
from now his party fell from first to second place in the 
opposition lineup after the party for peace and democracy gained 
more seats in last months parliamentary elections 
the two kims came under public pressure to retire from politics

opposition leaders both ran on separate tickets despite widespread 
calls for a single opposition candidacy and lost out to governing 
party candidate roh taewoo 
kim daejung resigned from his partys leadership post in march

lawmakers who like to boast about how they 
brought their district a new dam deeper harbor or irrigation 
system will find no cause to brag in a spending bill approved by 
the house appropriations committee 
the committee on wednesday approved its first fiscal 1989 
spending bill a 178 billion proposal for the department of 
energy army corps of engineers and the bureau of reclamation 
and for the first time in the memory of panel members and 
veteran staffers theres no money for the corps or the bureau to 
begin construction of any new water projects in fiscal 1989 which 
begins oct 1 
you cant have just one new construction start said rep 
tom bevill dala chairman of the appropriations energy and water 
development subcommittee if we do one we have to do all the 
requests 
bevill said the unusual austerity was necessitated by last 
years budget summit at which the white house and congressional 
leaders agreed on a twoyear blueprint designed to cut mounting 
federal deficits 
this has been the most difficult appropriations bill weve 
ever put together bevill said as the full committee approved the 
spending bill the first of 13 it will handle this year 
rep vic fazio dcalif said the nonewstarts decree could 
spell an end to an old capitol hill juggling act satisfy as many 
member project requests as possible by putting up enough money to 
get the shovel in the ground with the big bucks coming in later 
years 
those days are over fazio said maybe the t word 
taxes needs to be mentioned weve run out of room 
bevill said that sen bennett johnston dla his senate 
counterpart in the appropriations process has informally agreed to 
try to keep money for new starts for the corps and the bureau out 
of the senate spending bill 
another major casualty in the house bill is the administrations 
request for 363 million in fiscal 1989 to start construction of 
the super collider the megabucks physics project that would 
explore exotic theories of matter 
the committee voted 100 million to keep the planning process 
alive but said the next president should decide whether to proceed 
and how to pay for the huge experiment which has construction cost 
estimates ranging from 44 billion to 9 billion 
bevill said the committees hands were tied by the budget 
summits targets for his spending area and an agreement that there 
would be no reductions for defenserelated nuclear activities by 
the department of energy 
he said that because these total about 81 billion there was 
little discretionary money for new projects after financing other 
activities like continued work on some 400 water projects already 
under construction and paying for operation and maintenance of 
hundreds more 
there just isnt a dollar left added rep john myers of 
indiana the ranking republican on bevills subcommittee this is 
by far the toughest year weve had 
missing from the bill that goes to the house floor next tuesday 
are six new corps flood control projects requested by the 
administration they are nonconnah creek in tennessee and 
mississippi cache creek and santa ana river in california 
sheyenne river west fargo and riverside in north dakota ramapo 
and mahway rivers in new jersey and lock haven in pennsylvania 
had past practice prevailed the administrations wish list 
would have risen to 20 or more new construction starts as 
influential lawmakers got their pet projects added as the spending 
legislation progressed through congress 
the nonewstarts posture would have less of an impact on the 
bureau of reclamation the interior department agency that operates 
west of the mississippi 
for the second straight year the administration sought no new 
construction for the bureau which has announced it is phasing down 
its building activities in favor of water conservation and 
environmental restoration congress added no bureau starts last 
year

american soldiers who served in vietnam suffer 
from more depression anxiety and alcohol abuse than do other gis 
but medical examinations reveal no physical indications of exposure 
to agent orange a herbicide used widely during the vietnam war 
those are among the findings of the vietnam experience study a 
federal report prepared for release today at a hearing before a 
senate committee 
the study conducted by the centers for disease control and 
released for publication in the journal of the american medical 
association also showed that vietnam veterans have a greater 
hearing loss and a measurably lower sperm count 
cdc based its findings on telephone interviews with 7924 gis 
who served in vietnam and 7364 veterans who served elsewhere 
those interviewed were selected randomly from enlisted men who 
entered the army from 1965 to 1971 a subsample of 2490 vietnam 
veterans and 1972 other soldiers also underwent extensive physical 
examinations as part of the study 
vietnam veterans were almost twice as likely 196 percent to 
111 percent to report that they had health problems yet when 
physicians who did not know the military history of the two groups 
examined the former soldiers they could detect few medical 
differences between the vietnam veterans and the others 
the study said the difference between what the vietnam veterans 
reported and what was found in examination may be the result of 
increased stress 
vietnam veterans may have reported more symptoms and past 
medical conditions because they experienced more stress than did 
nonvietnam veterans said the study vietnam veterans also 
showed more anxiety and depression in a battery of psychological 
tests 
stress can produce anxiety depression and a variety of 
somatic physical symptoms the study said 
the vietnam veterans are more likely to experience psychological 
problems the study said about 14 percent of the viet vets are 
abusing alcohol compared to 9 percent of the other group for 
anxiety the difference is 5 percent to 3 percent and for 
depression the difference is 5 percent to 2 percent 
drug use was about the same between the groups but the study 
said data suggest that more vietnam veterans suffered drugrelated 
deaths 
fifteen percent of the vietnam veterans also suffered some 
symptoms of combatrelated post traumatic stress disorder and 2 
percent reported such symptoms the month of the interviews 
the study also said that the perceived exposure to herbicides 
a perception that in itself may lead to additional stress is 
associated both with psychological problems and with selfreported 
adverse health conditions but is not associated with objective 
measures of exposure 
many in the vietnam veterans of america organization have blamed 
health problems on exposure during the war in southeast asia to 
agent orange a herbicide used to thin vegetation in dense jungle 
combat areas use of agent orange was discontinued after it was 
determined that it contained dioxin a potent cancercausing 
chemical 
the cdc study however said it found no difference in the rate 
of cancers between the two groups of soldiers 
soldiers who served in vietnam particularly those in combat 
suffered more hearing loss than those who served elsewhere the 
study said 
vietnam veterans were 40 percent more likely to have 
highfrequency hearing loss than gis not in vietnam the study 
said it added that this is consistent with results of several 
studies of army troops that show that exposure to military noise 
results in irreversible hearing impairment 
a study of semen samples taken from 571 members of the two 
groups showed that the vietnam veteran is twice as likely to have a 
low sperm concentration and 15 times as likely to have low levels 
of normal sperm cells and yet the study said the two groups 
fathered about the same number of children 14 each for the 
vietnam vets and 15 for the nonvietnam soldiers and reported 
about the same rate of birth defects in their children 
we were not able to determine the reasons for the differences 
in sperm characteristics between vietnam and nonvietnam 
veterans the report said 
the vietnam experience study was ordered by congress as part of 
a veterans benefit bills passed in 1979 and 1981

theyre all old men now but the soldiers of 
the multinational jedburgh unit today are remembering the days 
in world war ii when they parachuted behind enemy lines with a 
radio and a small fortune 
were getting a bit thinner every year said ivor hooker of 
haverhill england after some of the old soldiers chanted a 
raunchy putdown of superior officers in the dulles international 
airport waiting area on wednesday 
the american and british veterans welcomed their french 
comrades along with widows and family members of some who have 
died 
in what is billed as probably their last full reunion the 51 
american 26 french and 18 british jeds some have not seen 
each other for 44 years were beginning activities today that 
would include wreathlaying ceremonies at arlington national 
cemetery honors at the british and french embassies and a visit 
with president reagan on friday 
some are bragging a little others speak softly of lost comrades 
in one of the most heroic and secretive exploits of the war the 
top secret classification for hundreds of boxes of government 
documents on the unit was only lifted in 1985 
in teams of three 279 jeds were dropped across france belgium 
and the netherlands to help lead the resistance against german 
occupation their name comes from a town in scotland where 
jedburgh justice for sheep rustlers meant hang them first and 
question them afterwards 
douglas bazata who said he is still involved in government work 
and accepts the description redheaded soldier of fortune even 
though his hair is now pure white asked another jed at the airport 
if hed ever lost any of the money they were given to aid the 
resistance around the time of the june 6 1944 normandy landings 
bazata of bethesda md said he parachuted in with 300000 in 
cash 
i loved it you were totally your own boss responsible for 
everything when you sent messages back to headquarters they 
listened and you had unlimited money said bazata 
the jeds sabotaged german troops blew up bridges and helped 
organize and arm resistance forces most spoke french and blended 
into cities and villages taken over by the germans 
some of the americans went on to similar missions in china 
organizing popular resistance against japanese forces 
because they could pick their targets few were killed during 
the mission said retired col frank mills of fairfax va who is 
writing a book about allied efforts behind enemy lines mills 
worked in the jedburgh operation and supervised some of the forces 
in china but was not a jed himself 
they were guerrillas they had to design operations that would 
keep them alive he said 
daphne friele who has helped organize the reunion was so taken 
by the american jeds when she was an 18yearold secretary to their 
british commander that she later married two of them her first 
husband col robert c mundinger died in the korean war two 
years ago she married berent e friele jr of redding conn 
after they met again at a jed reunion in france 
it took some of them this long to find each other and they 
wont let go said mrs friele 62 who is still trying to find 
out what happened to the only two americans in the unit she hasnt 
accounted for arthur gruen and ian forbes 
american members include former cia director william colby 
retired army maj gen john singlaub who has organized a 
controversial worldwide effort to support resistance groups against 
communism and internationally known yachtsman hod fuller a 
retired marine general

the occupational safety and health 
administration says serious health problems among workers required 
to do repetitive physical labor on assembly lines prompted the 
agencys secondlargest fine ever against a single company 
ibp inc says osha is trying to impose alice in wonderland 
theories on industry but the union representing workers at ibps 
dakota city neb meatpacking plant hailed wednesdays decision to 
get tough with the company 
osha said it was imposing a 31 million fine against ibp for 
willfully ignoring the hazards of repetitive motion the agency 
maintains that ibp could have taken numerous steps to reduce the 
risk of injury but did not 
the affected employees work on production lines doing such work 
as cutting trimming hide removal and lifting meat with hooks 
said osha spokesman terry mikelson all the work is done while the 
meat moves at high speed through work stations in a cold damp 
environment 
mikelson said safety inspectors from the agency first noticed 
a pattern of repetitive motion injuries during a preliminary 
review of safety records in november 1987 such injuries can be 
crippling and are caused by repeated hand wrist and arm motion 
osha deputy assistant secretary frank white said repetitive 
motion injuries are a major health hazard in one of the most 
dangerous occupations in the country and we want the meatpacking 
industry in general and ibp in particular to eliminate the 
problem 
osha says ibp refused to slow its production lines change 
equipment designs or educate workers about the need to change 
positions periodically 
ibp has known about the high toll that these disorders have 
had on its work force but has chosen not to deal with it white 
said 
were most pleased about the recommendations the occupational 
safety and health administration made in their lengthy complaint 
against ibp recommendations for some very simple ways of 
preventing injuries said al zack a spokesman for the united 
food and commercial workers union 
ibp a subsidiary of occidental petroleum co has 15 working 
days to contest the fine the company already is contesting a 26 
million fine levied by osha last july for safety and record 
violations at the dakota city plant 
in a statement issued late wednesday ibp officials indicated 
they will fight the case in court 
the citation the company statement said represents a 
misguided attempt by osha to force the meatpacking industry to 
blindly accept untested theories about the prevention of repetitive 
motion disorders 
oshas goal the statement continued is to intimidate 
companies by threatening enormous penalties unless they accept 
alice in wonderland theories 
the company said it has urged osha to develop a special program 
for the meatpacking industry but that osha has not done that 
zack said the union is disappointed that ibp continues to deny 
there is a problem it would be far preferable if ibp would start 
working on solutions 
after the preliminary study revelaed a pattern of injuries osha 
hired an expert in ergonomics david cochran of the university of 
nebraska at lincoln to do more extensive studies mikelson said 
the studies found that 620 workers at 45 work stations at the 
dakota city plant were at grave risk of developing repetitive 
motion illnesses he said of those 377 workers actually had 
developed injuries mikelson said some required surgery some are 
on restricted work schedules and some are on permanent disability 
leave he said 
the 31 million fine represents a 5000 penalty for each of 
the 620 workers 
mikelson estimated that a total of 3000 people work at the 
dakota city plant one of 15 ibp plants 
workers at the dakota city plant went on strike in the winter of 
1987 following a bitter lockout by ibp the strike ended last july 
the fine is the second largest osha has ever imposed against an 
individual company the largest was 42 million against bath iron 
works in bath maine in november 1987 for health and safety 
violations 
the largest fine against multiple companies came in march of 
this year 511 million against five contractors that worked on a 
brideport conn apartment building that collapsed in april 1987

the two zoos with the institute of zoology form the zoological 
society of england which has been losing up to 376 million 
annually ms copsey said

the governors of mississippi arkansas 
and louisiana will join forces aboard a mississippi river barge 
friday for a fight against the delta regions depressed economy 
govs ray mabus of mississippi bill clinton of arkansas and 
louisianas buddy roemer will sign an agreement to address chronic 
problems of unemployment illiteracy and poverty in the fertile 
farmlands along the river 
we decided to use a barge for the signing so we could get to 
the point where the three states come together mabus said we 
thought the coming together was symbolic 
mabus said he hoped the ceremony would mark the start of a 
regional economic development effort one that will signal a new 
focus on our region of the country and attract international 
investments and national attention to the threestate region 
the governors will sign two agreements 
one will seek support for a congressional bill requesting 
federal assistance for the region we are going to try to present 
a united front to washington roemer said 
he said the states could share administration of some programs 
to help the area and he cited as an example the possibility of 
schools in which children and their parents could be taught 
i can see a mother bringing her child to a firstgrade class 
to read and write and go down to a hallway where she would learn to 
read and write roemer said 
the other agreement involves coordination of international trade 
efforts and attempts to attract foreign investment with the first 
target country being japan 
clinton said the region has been devastated by national farm 
problems that had dried up markets for deltagrown soybeans rice 
milo and cotton industries that once offered jobs to displaced 
farmhands have moved overseas in quest of cheaper labor 
statistics show the arkansas and mississippi counties and 
louisiana parishes in the delta region the flatlands on both 
sides of the river from memphis to natchez are among the nations 
poorest many with poverty levels of above 50 percent 
sen david pryor dark a sponsor of legislation to authorize 
federal aid said the delta should be the target of an antipoverty 
crusade similar to president kennedys effort to improve conditions 
in appalachia 
sen dale bumpers dark said he hoped a federal study would 
produce a report that will almost shame congress into taking 
action 
reps jamie whitten and mike espy dmiss have filed similar 
legislation in the house

teams of elected officials from a democratic 
party group plan to campaign in coming months for a voluntary 
program that would link federal education housing and job training 
aid to participation in civilian or military service 
sen sam nunn dga said the plan proposed by the democratic 
leadership council would say essentially that if youre going to 
get assistance from society for your education then youre going 
to serve society 
the group released its 66page proposal on wednesday it calls 
for creation of a citizens corps made up of young volunteers 
who would work one or two years at subsistence wages in civilian or 
military service 
for each year of service in the corps a volunteers would earn a 
10000 voucher that could be used for college vocational training 
or a home down payment 
nunn said the vouchers would eventually replace existing federal 
grant and loan programs as the primary source of federal aid to 
students 
the proposal also calls for enlistment of volunteers over the 
age of 65 who would earn modest wages instead of vouchers and 
would perform primarily administrative and supervisory tasks within 
the corps 
former virginia gov charles robb past chairman of the dlc 
said the proposal is an attempt to move away from the politics of 
pure entitlement to some sort of system that involves mutual civic 
obligation 
the dlc is composed primarily of moderate and conservative 
democrats many from the south and was a prime mover behind the 
creation of this years super tuesday multistate primary day

doctors often fail to recognize serious side 
effects of psychiatric drugs leaving patients with unnecessary 
anxiety and lethargy and at risk of giving up the medication 
according to a study 
the side effects are being missed in epidemic proportions 
said peter weiden assistant professor of psychiatry at cornell 
university medical center in new york 
while the study dealt with hospitalized patients the side 
effects are so unpleasant that they could make patients stop taking 
the medications once they are discharged he said 
doctors must be better trained to spot and treat side effects 
while patients and their families must be taught to recognize the 
problems and point them out to doctors weiden said 
weiden presented his study wednesday at the annual meeting of 
the american psychiatric association similar findings have emerged 
from studies at several psychiatric hospitals he said 
its cause for concern its a good reason for education of 
doctors patients families and health systems said john talbott 
chairman of the psychiatry department at the university of maryland 
school of medicine and a former president of the association 
the study dealt with side effects of drugs called neuroleptics 
which are used to treat hospitalized patients for schizophrenia 
manicdepression and severe depression 
the same drugs are used in lower doses for outpatients with 
schizophrenia and related conditions and some other illnesses 
serious side effects are fairly common one recent study found 
them in about 62 percent of patients on the drugs 
if recognized the side effects can be treated with other 
medications or by reducing dosages of the neuroleptic 
weiden and colleagues looked for side effects in 48 patients 
admitted to a private psychiatric hospital they then compared 
their assessments with those of the doctors treating the patients 
they found that the doctors overlooked side effects in 
20 of 27 patients with akathisia a physical or mental 
restlessness that can include pacing leg motion agitation and the 
urge to move or flee 
12 of 29 patients with parkinsonism which includes tremor 
rigidity and slowing of movements 
two of three patients with acute dystonia an often 
frightening attack of muscle contraction that can last several 
seconds 
nine of 23 patients with akinesia a decrease in spontaneous 
movements and gestures or a zombielike feeling 
some unrecognized cases of akinesia were so severe that the 
patients could hardly move weiden said 
in rare cases side effects can be fatal he said in an 
interview 
doctors overlook side effects for several reasons weiden said 
they are not extensively trained in spotting side effects some 
of which mimic symptoms of a patients illness working in a 
psychiatric hospital ward they also tend to get used to seeing the 
side effects he said and you kind of forget how distressing it 
is 
in addition the acutely psychotic patients often cannot 
communicate about the problem effectively he said 
to improve diagnosis of the side effects doctors in psychiatric 
wards should ask specifically about the symptoms carefully record 
the patients physical and pharmacological history and do physical 
exminations apart from therapy sessions weiden said 
nurses and doctors should get early training in spotting the 
problem he said 
jeffrey lieberman of the long island jewish medical center in 
glen oaks ny said part of the discrepancy weidens study found 
might result from different opinions on when symptoms are serious 
enough for a diagnosis 
but he agreed that many physicians are not adequately trained on 
spotting side effects

a congresswoman is accusing a justice 
department official of harassing one of his senior attorneys who is 
seeking to extend her maternity leave to seven months instead of 
the usual three to four months 
has war on maternity leave replaced the war on drugs rep 
pat schroeder dcolo wrote attorney general edwin meese iii the 
letter was directed against assistant attorney general john bolton 
head of the departments criminal division 
bolton has ordered joan bernott to return to work may 31 or 
submit additional medical information from her doctor giving a 
reason why her leave should be extended to midaugust 
on may 4 bolton rejected ms bernotts request which is 
supported by a note from her medical doctor to extend her leave 
without pay to aug 15 asked whether she would report to work may 
31 ms bernott who went on maternity leave jan 25 said that she 
would defer to the advice of her doctor 
in an interview wednesday bolton responded that there was no 
intent whatsoever to harass ms bernott and that the idea that 
there is discrimination here is absolutely untrue 
he referred to an april 21 comment in which he told ms 
bernotts lawyer that nobody is going to ask ms bernott to do 
anything which would in any way jeopardize her health and said he 
simply wanted more information from her doctor regarding the 
medical basis for the additional leave time 
bolton said the civil division faces an enormous workload and 
that it was vital that its 25 senior attorney positions one of 
which is held by ms bernott be staffed fully 
ms bernott obtained a letter from her physician dr sandra m 
chase on march 28 saying that an additional four months of 
recuperation from a difficult pregnancy was required 
return to work now in my opinion represents health risk to 
this patient the doctor said in a followup april 26 letter 
submitted as a result of boltons request for more information 
bolton said ms bernott had told mary ann beck director of the 
office of administration on march 25 that she didnt want to 
return to work before midaugust because she wanted to attend a 
wedding of her husbands brother in geneva switzerland the week 
before aug 15 
ms bernott said she did not want to come back earlier in august 
and then simply have to ask for another week off to go to the 
wedding he said 
ms bernott hired a lawyer to represent her after bolton told 
her in a letter april 13 that there was evidence that you may 
have willfully submitted a fraudulently based claim for excessive 
leave 
ms bernott 42 who has three children was the justice 
departments lead attorney in successfully defending the government 
against litigation surrounding the use of the defoliant agent

army officers who were halted leading soldiers toward the capital 
the defense minister said 
the minister gen hector alejandro gramajo morales gave no 
details of wednesdays rebellion and would not confirm an earlier 
defense ministry statement that a coup attempt had taken place 
he did not say how many soldiers were involved what kind of 
arms they used or if there was any violence 
gramajo morales said the two officers arrested whom he refused 
to identify by name or rank had staged shortlived acts of 
indiscipline 
reading a prepared statement he told a news conference the two 
ringleaders met with officers and soldiers at bases in jutiapa 75 
miles south of the capital and retalhuleu 115 miles southwest of 
guatememala city and led them toward the capital wednesday morning

while his government has wanted the world to see guatemala as 
safe for the return of exiles including leftist leaders the 
military has made known it does not welcome them 
both the cerezo administration and military leaders have opposed 
a prompt resumption of peace talks with leftist guerrillas who 
have been fighting the civilian government and a succession of 
military or militarydominated governments for 27 years

power in august 1983 from another military ruler gen efrain rios

a feisty 3yearold girl who made medical 
history with a fiveorgan transplant died after a sixmonth 
struggle that doctors say will help advance research into the 
experimental surgery 
tabatha foster of madisonville ky who spent most of her life 
in hospitals died wednesday afternoon a month shy of her fourth 
birthday in the intensive care unit at childrens hospital of 
pittsburgh 
the 36pound pigtailed child was the worlds longest survivor 
of a fiveorgan transplant she received a new liver small 
intestines pancreas and parts of a stomach and colon during a 
15hour experimental operation that ended nov 1 
similar procedures had been performed only twice before in the 
world and both patients died within a few days 
an infection in tabathas bloodstream caused her heart kidneys 
and liver to fail said hospital spokeswoman sue cardillo 
it was system failure everything it was like a chain 
reaction she said 
among those expressing sympathy was president reagan who had 
mentioned tabathas plight in a national radio address in january 
and contributed 1000 toward her medical expenses 
many americans were drawn to her because of her courageous 
battle against birth defects we extend our deepest sympathies to 
her family the president said in a statement 
tabathas parents roy and sandra foster were at her side and 
had told doctors not to try to revive her if her heart stopped ms 
cardillo said 
i was a little surprised that it ended as suddenly as this 
said dr thomas e starzl director of transplant surgery at 
childrens hospital even though she was a child of enormous 
physical and enormous emotional strength it was just slowly ebbing 
away 
as starzl described the devotion of tabathas parents at a news 
conference he stopped speaking in the middle of a sentence and sat 
down fighting back tears 
tabatha won the hearts of hospital staff with goodnatured 
teasing playing peekaboo giggling each day at sesame street 
and singing the itsybitsy spider 
bless her little heart said deborah b morrow a family 
friend in madisonville a lot of times you see a child who has 
been sick and theyre kind of moody but tabatha was an outgoing 
girl she wasnt afraid of anything 
wellwishers from around the country including frank sinatra 
donated more than 350000 to help cover her medical expenses much 
of the money came from black churches tabatha who was black also 
received boxloads of toys cards and notes from schoolchildren 
starzl said a study of tabathas case in coming weeks will help 
determine the feasibility of future multipleorgan transplants 
this is not the loss meaninglessly of a life the surgeon 
said along with death came the accrual of something really 
worthwhile 
tabathas parents decided they did not want an autopsy 
performed but starzl said he hoped they would allow doctors to 
study some tissues from the transplanted organs 
because of an intestinal deformity doctors had been forced to 
remove 95 percent of tabathas small bowel three days after she was 
born she was placed on a highly concentrated liquid diet which 
damaged her liver 
doctors had said tabatha would soon die without undergoing the 
transplant they determined it would be easier to replace the 
entire fiveorgan group rather than just her liver and small 
intestine 
another multiple transplant has since been done at 
rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center in chicago the 
10monthold patient was reported in good condition wednesday after 
receiving a new liver small intestine pancreas and part of a 
stomach feb 9 
tabathas condition began deteriorating monday when she 
developed trouble breathing her blood pressure fell after surgeons 
changed drainage tubes inserted last month to relieve a buildup of 
bile in her transplanted liver ms cardillo said 
doctors had ruled out the possibility of another transplant for 
tabatha because she was too weak to withstand the operation ms 
cardillo said

the bill along with a measure to make the praying mantis south 
carolinas state insect 
the state already has a state fish deer bird wild game bird

supporters of a constitutional amendment to 
make english the countrys official language fear that hispanics 
are taking over says a congressman who opposes the idea 
if it is a symbolic measure with no impact whatsoever on our 
rights then it is a frivolous exercise rep albert bustamante 
dtexas told the house judiciary subcommittee on civil and 
criminal rights wednesday 
if it restricts civil rights on the basis of ones proficiency 
in english then it is divisive and a dangerous amendment said 
bustamante a former migrant worker who is the son and grandson of 
mexicanamerican migrant workers 
supporters testified wednesday that the amendment was not 
intended to stifle freedom but rather to clarify public policy and 
give legal protection to english the glue that holds the country 
together 
rep norman d shumway rcalif said he does not want to see 
the nation drift unwittingly into a bilingual country 
we cannot afford to wait a decade or a generation until our 
government is conducting its affairs in languages other than 
english said shumway who has proposed one of the english 
amendments 
and rep william s broomfield rmich said english is our 
nations language only by tradition and if action is not taken 
soon we could face a future of uncertainty in our basic 
communication as well as ethnic and racial polarization 
rep gerald d kleczka dwis an opponent said it is in 
fact a direct attack on hispanics no doubt about it 
rep john conyers jr dmich a member of the panel conducting 
the hearing said he questioned the motives behind the movement 
what are we trying to get at here he asked 
after the hearing bustamante said advocates of official english 
have this fear they hispanics are taking over theyre saying 
theres too many of them 
bustamante testified the amendment could alienate nonenglish 
speakers from vital services such as health care and deprive them 
of public translators for courts hospitals emergency services and 
police departments 
according to testimony 14 states have enacted officialenglish 
laws 
linda chavez president of a group called us english and 
former staff director of the us commission on civil rights 
appointed by president reagan said the amendment would shift 
educational emphasis for bilingual children 
the children would work more on acquiring englishlanguage 
proficiency than on learning in their native language she said

by naming a littleknown khomeini 
loyalist as armed forces chief of staff irans leaders appear to 
be trying to end friction between the regular army and 
revolutionary guards western anaylsts say 
brig gen ali shahbazi was sworn in monday three weeks after 
iraq recaptured the faw peninsula in a lightning assault april 
1618 that caught the iranians by surprise 
in addition us warships sank or crippled two iranian frigates 
and four other armed vessels april 18 after knocking out two 
iranian oil platforms 
shahbazis appointment by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini is a 
direct consequence of those defeats said hansheino kopietz a 
middle east specialist with the londonbased international 
institute for strategic studies 
western analysts have speculated that more heads will roll among 
military and naval commanders 
shahbazi 42 replaced brig gen ismael sohrabi who had been 
the armed forces chief of staff since 1984 promoted from colonel 
shahbazi had been sohrabis deputy for four years its like this 
fellow came out of nowhere kopietz said in a telephone interview 
irans official islamic republic news agency said shahbazi has 
an outstanding record in the guerrilla warfare headquarters at 
ahvaz in the oilrich southwestern khuzistan province and it 
stressed his revolutionary and religious commitment 
anthony cordesman a middle east specialist at georgetown 
university said in a telephone interview that shahbazi is a 
khomeini loyalist a khomeini professional who has close links 
with the revolutionary guards 
that indicated that the tehran leadership is making a new effort 
to end friction and often outright hostility between the 
regular army and the increasingly powerful revolutionary guards 
corps 
the 350000strong revolutionary guards made up of islamic 
zealots who outnumber the army have their own air and naval wings 
and get the pick of new hardware 
when he swore in shahbazi on monday president ali khamenei 
declared the revolutionary guards and the army must work more 
closely together and coordinate their operations in every area 
iran had held faw a dusty strip of land in the northern gulf 
since capturing it in february 1986 but iran apparently had 
reduced its force in the enclave to about 20000 men half the size 
of a year ago 
faw was the only significant chunk of iraq that iran had seized 
in the 7yearold iraniraq war

political action committee to fund and train conservative christian 
political candidates 
robertson announced wednesday in washington that he had offered 
his endorsement to vice president george bush who has 
mathematically clinched the gop nomination and indicated he would 
withdraw from the race on monday 
however after robertsons announcement an aide richard 
pinsky said robertson would suspend his campaign rather than 
withdraw outright and would release his delegates but at a later 
date 
after his meeting with bush robertson was asked by reporters at 
the white house whether he was withdrawing i will be making that 
official on monday he replied and asked whether he would be 
releasing his delegates he answered of course i will be 
releasing them 
the robertson campaign later put out a press release saying 
robertson had spoken with reporters about the meeting with bush and 
told them he is not withdrawing from the race nor is he releasing 
his delegates the campaign did say robertson would make a 
statement about his campaign status on monday 
calls to robertson headquarters requesting a clarification were 
not returned wednesday night 
the new political action committee americans for the republic 
will actively support christian candidates according to barbara 
gattullo a spokesman for americans for robertson robertsons 
campaign organization she said the staff of americans for 
robertson would switch to the new organization keeping the same 
office in virginia after the papers are filed with the federal 
election commission

christian broadcasting networks chief executive officer a job his 
son has held since robertson announced his candidacy 
that came as a surprise to cbn officials 
i dont have a comment to make cbn spokesman benton miller 
said wednesday none of the staff or i have been provided any 
information by him at this point concerning what his future plans 
are 
robertson had appeared since 1967 on the 700 club program

organize his presidential campaign and in september 1987 resigned

the southern baptist church to run for office 
the network immediately reported a dramatic drop in revenues and 
began laying off personnel at the time spokesmen refused to blame 
robertsons political ambitions for the shortfall

a texas savings association wrote off a loss 
of nearly 12 billion in march a portent of what could become the 
largest bailout ever for the federal regulator of thrift 
institutions 
the federal home loan bank board in a report on the march 
balance sheets of the 3120 sampls it oversees said wednesday that 
one institution in texas accounted for roughly half of the 
industrys decline in capital of 24 billion 
bank board spokesman william fulwider said the agency had 
decided not to identify the institution by name explaining its 
not a public institution and it has not filed its report yet for 
the period 
nearly all of the remaining capital declines were also in the 
southwest where the economy is hard hit by depressed oil and real 
estate prices the bank board said 
the biggest sampl bailout ever was the 13 billion rescue in 
september of vernon savings and loan association in dallas if the 
unidentified texas institution has posted losses in months before 
march its bailout likely would top the vernon rescue 
the impending rescue of californiabased financial corp of 
america which owns the largest sampl in the nation also is likely 
to surpass the vernon figure 
the bank board said the industrys capital declined by 33 
billion in the first quarter compared with an increase of 548 
million in the first quarter of 1987 
the figures indicate that the industry which suffered its worst 
loss since the great depression last year at 68 billion is in 
for another bad year 
those are terrible numbers said bert ely an alexandria 
va financial institutions analyst whats really concerning is 
that annualizes out to a 12 billion to 13 billion loss for 
the year which is roughly double what the industry showed in 
1987 
an institutions capital represents the amount of money left 
over after its assets are sold and its deposits and debts are paid 
off 
as the number of insolvent sampls has soared during the 1980s the 
industrys capitaltoassets ratio a key measure of health has 
dwindled from 451 percent at the end of 1986 to 412 percent at 
the end of last year it plummeted again in the first three months 
of this year to 344 percent 
youre seeing a rate of decline that would exhaust the 
industrys capital in about 3 years ely said the losers in 
the industry the insolvent thrifts are just sinking much faster 
than the healthy thrifts can pull them out of it 
the report lends new credence to arguments that the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp does not have enough money to 
resolve the problems of the more than 500 insolvent institutions 
and that taxpayers money may be needed 
congress in passing legislation last august pledged to stand 
behind the insurance fund 
bank board chairman m danny wall said it is too soon to tell 
whether the 20 billion available over the next three years will be 
enough 
however bank board officials said last month that an audit of 
the insurance fund which backs deposits up to 100000 showed 
that its liabilities exceeded its assets by 116 billion at the 
end of 1987 up from 63 billion at the end of 1986 
an audit report due this month from the congressional general 
accounting office is expected to show an even larger deficit at the 
end of 1987 and some analysts say the insurance fund may eventually 
be 30 billion to 60 billion in the hole 
the march decline at the single texas thrift alone accounts for 
a fifth of the money 6 billion that the bank board is 
allotting to clean up southwest institutions 
the industrys earnings prospects at least in the next few 
months look dim ely said because interest rates on what 
institutions pay for funds are rising faster than the rate they 
earn on their loan portfolios 
one bright spot in the bank board report is the sixth 
consecutive monthly increase in deposits in march deposits flowed 
into savings institutions during the first three months of 1988 at 
the fastest rate since the fourth quarter of 1984 
the bank board said net deposits increased by 45 billion in 
march bringing net deposits for the first quarter of this year to 
152 billion 
that compares with net withdrawals of 5 billion in march 1987 
and 82 billion for the first three months of 1987 
the industry until the october stock market crash had been 
suffering a drain of deposits in what analysts labeled a 
slowmotion run however that trend reversed as investors pulled 
their money from the volatile stock market and sought the relative 
safety of governmentinsured sampl accounts since then an increase 
in americans savings rate has helped keep the deposits coming

a hormone that causes the body to produce 
immune cells is in the final stages of clinical testing and may 
provide a breakthrough in protecting the elderly against death from 
influenza and pneumonia two researchers say 
this may well be a research breakthrough for the treatment of 
disease among elderly people dr william b ershler of the 
university of wisconsin told the senate committee on aging 
the committee is conducting a hearing on research into the 
health problems of the elderly 
thymosin alpha one a form of the hormone thymosin has now been 
given to elderly patients in two early clinical trials and in both 
cases the level of immune action was increased ershler said 
wednesday 
flu vaccine generally is effective in only about 25 percent of 
the elderly who receive it he said but in studies using thymosin 
alpha one the effectiveness was increased to 70 percent 
researchers have long known that the immune system becomes 
increasingly weaker as people age he said as a result 
infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in 
elderly people he said 
ershler said a deficiency of one of the immune cells called 
tcell lymphocyte is caused by a decline in the function of the 
thymus gland this in turn has been traced to a shortage of 
thymosin 
an expanded study using 400 patients at the us soldiers and 
airmens home here was conducted last fall and winter results 
have not been analyzed said ershler but it may be a research 
breakthrough 
allan l goldstein a professor at george washington university 
and a codiscoverer of thymosin said the washington study has 
great promise 
it is hoped that within two years well be able to apply this 
new approach to lower the incidence of flu and pneumonia among the 
elderly goldstein told the committee 
he said influenza affects millions of elderly americans 
annually costs hundreds of millions of dollars in medical care and 
causes about 25000 deaths among people over age 65

the government said gen manuel 
antonio noriega has made no deal with washington about stepping 
down and there will be none if us aggression and violation of 
panamanian sovereignty continue 
the official news agency panapress reported on wednesday night 
that president reagan had entered in direct contact with gen 
noriega 
the report came shortly after an administration source in 
washington said the united states would drop drug charges against 
noriega if he agrees to step down as defense forces chief and leave 
the country at least temporarily 
boris moreno director of the governments national information 
system or sni told the associated press he did not know if reagan 
had telephoned noriega in an effort to find a way out of the crisis 
between the two nations 
moreno also said he did not know if the offer to drop the 
charges had been formally presented to the general 
there has been no agreement about anything said a statement 
he read to the ap over the telephone upon being informed of the 
existence of such reports gen manuel antonio noriega told sni 
categorically the sovereignty of panama is not negotiable 
such reports only come from sources interested in sidetracking 
the conversations and in aggravating the existing situation these 
reports form part of the confusion and confrontation provoked by 
certain elements of the washington establishment 
panapress said on wednesday night gen noriega has said there 
can be no deal if the us aggression and the violation of 
panamanian sovereignty continue 
the source in washington who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said that under the proposed deal noriega would step down probably 
in august and would stay out of panama until after its next 
presidential elections 
the reagan administration began imposing economic sanctions on 
panama 2 months ago washington hoped the measures would force 
noriega into exile but he has resisted and appears entrenched 
the general as chief of the 15000strong defense forces is 
the countrys de facto ruler last summer he was accused by his 
former secondincommand of involvement in political assassination 
and electoral fraud 
on feb 5 noriega was indicted on federal drugsmuggling and 
moneylaundering charges in florida he denies the charges 
contending they are part of an attempt to replace him with a leader 
amenable to a strong us presence in panama into the next century 
the 1977 panama canal treaty obliges washington to cede control 
of the waterway and us military bases along it by the year 2000 
panapress said reagan sent a special mission to panama to 
dialogue with the leader of the panamanian defense forces 
us embassy spokesman terence kneebone responded no 
comment when asked if state department envoy michael kozak who 
the reagan administration has sent to panama in recent weeks to 
talk with noriega met in panama on wednesday with the general or 
his representatives

meeting with their leaders more 
than 4000 nicaraguan rebels sought to resolve a simmering dispute 
over whether to continue peace talks with the leftist sandinista 
government 
also wednesday nicaraguas vice president said at the united 
nations that the rift among the rebels threatened the peace 
negotiations 
rebel sources said the usbacked fighters also known as 
contras met with their civilian and military leaders at the jungle 
town of yamales 185 miles southeast of tegucigalpa and six miles 
from the nicaraguan border 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
dissident rebels accuse contra military commander enrique bermudez 
of corruption and inefficiency and want him replaced unlike the 
civilian contra leaders bermudez reportedly opposes forging a 
lasting peace with the sandinistas 
bermudez said in a telephone interview there was only 
minimal opposition to his command from a group of parasites 
within rebel ranks whom he did not identify 
bermudez 46 was nicaraguas representative to the 
interamerican defense board in washington dc under president 
anastasio somoza the rightist dictator overthrown by the 
sandinistas in 1979 
he is said to command a total of 8000 rebels 
three civilian leaders of the nicaraguan resistance pedro 
joaquin chamorro azucena ferrey and bosco matamoros were at the 
jungle meeting the sources said 
also present were eight dissident contra military leaders who on 
sunday publicly accused bermudez of opposing negotiations for a 
more permanent truce with the sandinistas the sources said 
nicaraguas vice president sergio ramirez mercado said on 
wednesday at the united nations in new york that his government was 
not sure if rebel fighters would honor any agreement reached by 
their political leaders 
ramirez said the open rebellion against bermudez 
represents a serious limitation to the talks 
we dont know now if what the political leadership of the 
contras is going to discuss with us in the next round of 
negotiations is going to be accepted by this military leadership 
under the command of col bermudez ramirez said he spoke at a 
news conference before the opening of a special un session on 
economic aid to central america 
bermudez hinted he might use force to bring the dissidents back 
into line but expressed hope that he and adolfo calero the top 
contra civilian leader will find a solution to the problem 
i am sure that once the fighters understand the reality of the 
situation they will change their attitude he said in the 
telephone interview 
on march 23 sandinista and contra leaders signed a preliminary 
accord aimed at ending the 6yearold civil war a 60day truce 
went into effect april 1 during which the two sides were supposed 
to negotiate conditions for a lasting peace 
two rounds of highlevel negotiations in managua since have 
failed to produce substantial progress foremost among issues 
dividing the two sides is a sandinista demand that the contras lay 
down their weapons 
the date for the next round of talks has not been set

for harriet hope years of congressional 
wrangling over whether to compensate natives of the aleutian 
islands who were forced into camps during world war ii have taken 
their toll 
its just too little too late she said the old ones who 
deserve it the most are gone 
hope and her family were among 110 aleuts from unalaska island 
villages ordered from their homes in july 1942 after the japanese 
bombed and strafed the islands dutch harbor they were herded 
aboard a steamship that took them to a camp in southeast alaska 
purportedly to protect them from harm 
they were not alone an estimated 880 aleuts were evacuated from 
the aleutians many houses later were ransacked or destroyed by 
soldiers and sailors photographs diaries icons and other 
possessions left behind were damaged or stolen residents say 
about 10 percent of the aleuts died in the camps some never 
went home it has been estimated that half the camps survivors 
have since died 
the japanese seized three of the western aleutians attu 
agattu and kiska and occupied them between 1942 and 1943 
in washington conference committee staff members were scheduled 
to meet today to work out differences in house and senate versions 
of a measure authorizing reparations to japaneseamericans and 
aleuts forced from their homes in the opening months of the war 
the senate bill considered likely to be adopted would pay the 
aleut camp survivors 12000 each set up a 5 million trust fund 
for the six villages where people were forced from their homes 
authorize 14 million to restore and rehabilitate churches damaged 
or destroyed in the war and pay the aleuts between 12 million and 
15 million for the loss of attu island which has remained under 
military control 
japaneseamericans forced into camps would receive 20000 each 
and virtually nothing else 
john c kirtland a washington lawyer hired in 1978 to represent 
the aleuts before congress thinks the legislation reintroduced 
each year since 1983 will make it to the president this year 
hope was 5 years old when the japanese planes arrived her 
father was english her mother aleut her father the village 
postmaster was allowed to remain behind because of his nationality 
we had 48 hours to get ready we were told to take nothing but 
a very very few belongings she recalled 
hope her mother two brothers and a sister joined other aleuts 
from the islands three villages for the voyage eventually they 
were deposited at a burnedout cannery at burnett inlet on the 
alaska panhandle 
it was nothing but a ghost gown there was no plumbing no 
heat just an abandoned old cannery there was no running water 
you could see through the ceiling 
medical facilities were virtually nonexistent tuberculosis was 
a threat village hunters and fishermen used to the treeless 
mountains of unalaska were thrown into a strange environment 
it was like trying to live a subsistence lifestyle in a 
foreign country hope said 
for the three years the family was held at the camp hopes 
father was allowed only one 10day visit hope said her mother 
worked at canneries to earn money and provided medical care to 
camp residents her brother left to work on a fishing boat 
i just dont understand why they did what they did hope 
said 
the aleut corp a regional native corporation and the 
aleutianpribilof islands association led the drive for aleut 
reparations 
kirtlands firm searched archives and put together reams of 
evidence about camp conditions and the wrongs committed during and 
after the evacuation 
at about the same time a ninemember federal commission on 
wartime relocation and internment of civilians was appointed by the 
president and congressional leaders nine volumes of documentary 
evidence were given to commission kirtland said 
the panel held hearings around alaska and recommended 
compensation for the aleuts in june 1983 
just as the compensation is pending the scars of war remain on 
unalaska 
trench lines cut the mountains bunkers pillboxes and 
machinegun nests dot the landscape the past is never far away 
hope works as a receptionist at unalaska city hall near the 
house where she was born 
i dont feel like i deserve anything its my mother and 
father they went through the anguish theyre the ones who really 
deserve it 
her father died in 1956 her mother 10 years later

beef which for years has been cast as the villain 
in the fight against heart disease may not be so bad after all 
say researchers who found that a major form of saturated fat lowers 
cholesterol 
while too much fatty beef such as hamburger and prime rib will 
clearly raise cholesterol levels most people can eat moderate 
helpings of lean meat without fear the researchers said 
the researchers cautioned that only men were enrolled in the 
study so the findings might not apply to women 
but other experts said the study of 11 men is too small and 
preliminary to reach a conclusion all 11 were healthy volunteers 
ranging from their late 50s to early 70s 
beef got a bad name because it is high in saturated fat until 
now it was assumed that all saturated fats endangered the heart by 
increasing cholesterol which clogs arteries 
the study published in todays new england journal of medicine 
suggests that the situation may be more complicated beef contains 
two major forms of saturated fat and the researchers found that 
one raises cholesterol while the other lowers it 
this means that meat is probably not as bad as health experts 
have long believed said dr scott grundy the studys senior 
author and a researcher at the university of texas southwestern 
medical center at dallas 
grundy who also is a past chairman of the american heart 
associations nutrition committee said people should still follow 
the widely adopted dietary guidelines for avoiding all kinds of 
fat including saturated fat but he believes beef can be a regular 
part of a sensible diet as long people eat small portions of about 
3 ounces and stick to lean cuts especially selectgrade meat 
you dont really have to cut meat out of the diet in order to 
keep a low cholesterol level he said in an interview 
wednesday thats an important message because beef is rich in 
protein and iron 
fats from plants and animals differ in their proportions of 
various fatty acids safflower oil for instance is high in oleic 
acid which lowers the bodys cholesterol levels while palm oil 
contains high levels of palmitic acid which raises cholesterol 
beef fat is high in both palmitic acid and stearic acid both 
are saturated fatty acids unlike polyunsaturated fats such as corn 
oil they are solid when cool 
in the study the volunteers drank three liquid formula diets 
for three weeks each they were high in palmitic acid stearic acid 
or oleic acid 
the researchers found that the volunteers blood cholesterol 
levels dropped 14 percent while they consumed stearic acid and 10 
percent while on oleic acid compared to when they used the 
highpalmitic acid diet 
todays report was accompanied by an editorial by drs irwin h 
rosenberg and ernst j schaefer of the us department of 
agricultures human nutrition research center on aging at tufts 
university in boston 
they wrote that the study demonstrates convincingly that 
stearic acid lowers cholesterol however they added people should 
still try to hold down fat consumption and this study should not 
change our chief dietary message to the american public 
dr john c larosa of george washington university chairman of 
the heart associations nutrition committee agreed its a nice 
little piece of work la rosa said but its not the basis for 
dietary recommendations 
guidelines adopted by the association and other groups urge 
people to limit total fat intake to about 30 percent of total 
calories saturated fat should be less than 10 percent of the days 
calories

us trade representative clayton yeutter has 
told several steelstate senators the american steel industry will 
be a clear winner under the proposed uscanada free trade 
agreement 
there is no doubt in my mind that the us steel industry will 
be a net beneficiary of this agreement no doubt yeutter said 
wednesday during a joint meeting of the senate steel caucus and the 
senate judiciary antitrust subcommittee 
yeutter said american steelmakers will benefit from the gradual 
elimination of the two nations tariffs because canadian tariffs on 
imported steel are about double the us average 
and he said they will also gain from the increased economic 
activity the free trade agreement or fta is expected to stimulate 
between the two countries 
to the degree that we have an expansion of economic activity 
and demand the steel industry wins generally in both countries 
yeutter said in the absence of an fta that isnt going to 
happen

will be the last one

over one senators objection a bill that would place a statue of 
an army nurse at the memorial

objected to the starkness of the granite wall unveiled in 1982 
that lists the names of american war dead 
the bill which has 63 cosponsors contained an amendment that 
strengthens a declaration that congress would not allow any other 
statues to be placed at the memorial if the bronze sculpture of an 
army womens sculpture is approved 
this will be the last one said sen bennett johnston 
dla the committee chairman but the last for how long 
retorted evans who stressed that his opposition had nothing to do 
with his respect for american women

johnny carson returned with a vengeance 
to his latenight show poking fun at revelations of white house 
astrology in a monologue he wrote himself to end reruns forced by a 
2monthold writers strike 
i just could not stay away any longer from all things that are 
going on in the country i was compelled to come back carson 
said wednesday in his first new show since the strike began march 7 
you know we finally have a clue now as to what the hell are 
the looney tunes things that have been coming out of washington 
he told viewers of the tonight show 
carson referred to revelations by former white house chief of 
staff donald regan that nancy reagan regularly consulted an 
astrologer to determine president reagans schedule 
we apparently have a new cabinet officer in the government i 
was not aware of the secretary of health education and 
soothsaying 
i am not an expert on astrology i know a little bit about it 
but i understand the horoscope with the chart as they call it is 
divided into the socalled 12 houses and i just didnt know the 
white house was one of them carson quipped 
apparently the astrologist says that reagans sign is the 
rising house of aquarius nancys house is i think in the house 
of adolfo i could be wrong it could be bill blass but i think 
thats close he joked referring to the fashion designers 
carson also quoted an astrologist as saying that reagan 
performs at his best during a full moon 
big deal carson said so does the wolfman 
carson pointed out that reagan said he never made a policy 
decision based on astrology then dropping into an imitation of 
reagans voice carson said well because that little pointer 
on my ouija board moved to no 
the host of the nbctv show also found time to poke fun at his 
marriage and california earthquake predictions involving 16th 
century seer nostradamus 
things were getting a little testy around the homestead he 
said i really believe that one more week off and my marriage 
would be resolved by small arms fire 
carson mentioned the stir in los angeles because of persistent 
rumors that nostradamus forecast an earthquake for a city widely 
believed to be los angeles 
he was a flimflam man of the 16th century carson said 
if nostradamus were alive today he would be geraldo rivera 
rivera entertained millions of television viewers with stunts such 
as the opening of al capones vault 
carson announced last week he would return to the air writing 
his own monologues 
carson who is not a member of the striking writers guild of 
america said at that time there had been goodfaith negotiations 
and that all possibilities of reaching an agreement with the movie 
and tv industry were exhausted 
were glad to be back as far as the writers strike were 
not going to discuss it he said i have a lot of friends who 
are writers it is not fun to come to work when you see your 
friends who youve known for many years standing out on a picket 
line 
and its a weird picket line the writers are out there 
holding up these signs and theres nothing on them he quipped

america blessed irving berlin on his 100th 
birthday as such diverse celebrities as leonard bernstein walter 
cronkite and garrison keillor sang the legacies of the composer who 
set the world tapping 
the prolific songwriter a longtime recluse didnt attend the 
threehour celebration wednesday night before a packed house at 
carnegie hall although he was believed to be listening via a 
hookup from his new york mansion 
the pageantry started big and ended bigger with the army chorus 
and soldiers from fort dix nj filling the stage in front of a 
30piece orchestra boy scouts and girl scouts standing in the 
aisles and marilyn hornes mezzosoprano voice soaring above them 
in berlins god bless america 
then most of the evenings performers stood in front of the 
audience of 4000 joined hands and arms and everybody sang a 
lusty theres no business like show business another berlin 
classic 
when irving berlin began writing 83 years ago american 
popular music had no voice of its own said the violinist isaac 
stern we were a hodgepodge of nationalities and noises but he 
heard nothing but melodies 
american music was born at his piano by 30 he was a legend 
out of the fabric of our lives irving berlin has given us a place 
we call home it was this love of america that gave him the 
strength to write the music that now lasts forever stern said 
composer morton gould president of the american society of 
composers authors and publishers recounted the origin of the 
birthday tribute which is to be televised may 27 on cbs 
a year ago i received a call from irving berlin during the 
conversation i said next year is your 100th birthday may ascap 
present a tribute without skipping a beat he said whats the 
hurry so we waited six months later gould said berlin 
approved the celebration and suggested ticket sales benefit the 
ascap foundation and carnegie hall society gould said that berlin 
has written 1500 songs 19 broadway musicals and 18 hollywood 
musicals beginning with the first talking picture the jazz 
singer 
the event was a finale to a full day of tributes that began with 
a midnight serenade outside berlins manhattan house at midday 14 
cast members of the broadway show a chorus line offered an 
enthusiastic songfest at the central park arsenal 
their spirited medley ranged from love songs such as they say 
that falling in love is wonderful to the torch song whatll i 
do to the humorous you cant get a man with a gun 
on staten island 15 handicapped boy scouts sang happy 
birthday and god bless america during the dedication of a new 
log cabin named for berlin he had donated the residuals from the 
patriotic tune to the boy scouts and girl scouts 
meanwhile patients in 100 veterans administration hospitals and 
nursing homes around the nation geared up to sing god bless 
america simultaneously 
berlin was part of a pantheon of great musical comedy composers 
that included george gershwin jerome kern cole porter and richard 
rodgers of his theater contemporaries only director george 
abbott who turns 101 in june survives 
no one could take your mind off your troubles like irving 
berlin his music set the world tapping you just had to let 
yourself go said joe williams who then sang let yourself go 
among the other celebrities who joined in the speeches and songs 
were bernstein cronkite keillor shirley maclaine ray charles 
frank sinatra and rosemary clooney 
born israel baline in russia berlin came to the united states

as a young boy berlin got jobs singing on the bowery he worked as 
song plugger and a singing waiter at a chinatown cafe it was there 
he learned to play the piano laboriously picking out tunes with 
one finger the selftaught musician writes the same way 
berlin spent the day quietly at home and did not plan to be 
at carnegie hall said his secretary hilda schneider 
hes never made a big thing about his birthdays she said

a private study says discriminatory voter 
registration procedures are disenfranchising the poor minority and 
disabled citizens throughout the country 
among the practices are arbitrary registration hours 
inconvenient registration locations mysterious purging of voters 
without notice denial of registration before an election said a 
statement from sen alan cranston dcalif who is the author of 
legislation to correct such practices 
the citizens commission on civil rights in hearings in new york 
atlanta and phoenix in 1984 and 1985 documented numerous examples 
of discriminatory practices the group said on wednesday 
among the specific problems are refusal by local officials to 
designate sites in black communities for mobile registration units 
requirement of excessive identification from black applicants 
undue scrutiny of hispanics and asianamericans to determine 
their citizenship sites that require extraordinarily long 
trips and dual registration requirements for tribal and state 
elections for native americans 
the commission recommended legislation to permit registration by 
mail electionday registration and a congressional investigation 
into denial of the right to vote for homeless people

singapores second deputy prime minister said 
american political leaders often do not know what their sneaky 
arrogant confused and untrustworthy bureaucracy is doing 
we are not antiamerican ong teng cheong also told 2000 
trade union members at a rally protesting alleged us interference 
in local affairs 
but we do not welcome any antisingapore foreign elements to 
meddle in our domestic politics singapore politics is for 
singaporeans only similarly american politics is for americans 
only said ong third in the political line to prime minister lee 
kuan yew 
e mason hank hendrickson first secretary of the us 
embassys political section left singapore on tuesday at the 
governments request he was accused of seeking out disaffected 
singaporeans and encouraging them by criticizing the government in 
their presence 
the government also asked that hendrickson be reprimanded along 
with two senior state department officials identified only as mr 
x and mr y who it said sanctioned his activities 
the reagan administration retaliated by asking singapore on 
tuesday to withdraw robert chua hian kong first secretary of the 
singaporean embassys political section in washington 
in a statement wednesday singapore said it agreed to chuas 
withdrawal with deep regret the singapore government wants to 
get this issue over with for it shares with the us government 
the desire to put this unfortunate matter behind us 
ong also secretarygeneral of the national trades union 
congress called the gathering at congress headquarters a union 
rally not a political demonstration however busloads of union 
members chanted antiamerican slogans as they were driven past the 
us embassy after the rally they carried signs saying usa stop 
meddling and singapore politics for singapore 
the hendrickson affair confirms our assessment of us 
bureaucracy sneaky arrogant confused and untrustworthy ong 
said 
the political leaders in the us often do not know what the 
bureaucracy is doing sometimes one arm of the bureaucracy does not 
know what the other arm is doing they think they are always right 
they do not admit mistakes they seldom apologize they prefer 
denials and sometimes resort to lies 
us embassy spokesman richard gong said he had not read ongs 
speech and declined comment gong denied the singaporean 
governments allegations against hendrickson saying 
mr hendrickson was doing what american diplomats are expected 
to do in any country namely to keep in touch with a broad spectrum 
of individuals in order to report accurately developments in the 
country in question 
a home affairs ministry statement on may 7 said hendrickson 
urged patrick seong and other lawyers to contest the elections 
against the government and had involved himself in singapores 
domestic politics 
the governing peoples action party is heavily favored to retain 
control of this island republic of 26 million people in elections 
that must be held by december 1989 the party holds all but one of 
79 seats in parliament and there is no viable opposition capable of 
dislodging it 
hendrickson was trying to manipulate and instigate 
singaporeans in order to bring about a particular political 
outcome the government alleged 
his ouster was a surprising jolt to normally warm ussingapore 
relations the diplomatic row is the latest in a complex chain of 
events that began with the mayjune 1987 arrests of 22 singaporeans 
accused of belonging to a clandestine communist network they 
were seized under the internal security act which allows indefinate 
detention without trial 
all but one were freed by last dec 26 most of them with 
restrictions on their movements 
seong was arrested april 19 with eight of the 22 former 
detainees that was less than 24 hours after the eight proclaimed 
their innocence and said they had been abused and coerced into 
making incriminating statements 
on april 28 the home affairs ministry said the eight had sworn 
new declarations withdrawing their allegations and reconfirming 
their original guilt they are still behind bars and officials said 
a probe continues 
besides seong 34 hendrickson was linked by the government to 
lawyer francis seow 59 seow was arrested on friday just hours 
after he appeared in court seeking the release of two of the eight 
who were rearrested 
seow one of singapores more prominent attorneys is a former 
solicitorgeneral and expresident of the law society he is being 
held without charge under the internal security act for purposes 
of investigation into foreign interferences in singapores internal 
affairs

two masked gunmen who invaded the home 
of cartoonist charles schulz tried to kidnap his wife officials 
said 
it was obviously an attempted kidnap ransom sonoma county 
sheriff dick michaelsen said wednesday 
this was a targeted criminal act they knew exactly who the 
victims were 
the incident took place on sunday but did not become public 
until tuesday when neighbors of the cartoonist spoke to reporters 
from the santa rosa press democrat and recounted that two armed men 
had invaded the home 
however it was not until the sheriffs department issued a 
statement wednesday that it became clear that a kidnap attempt had 
been made 
there is a delicate balance between the rights of victims and 
the need to know the sheriff said in explaining why he did not 
release the information earlier victims should always come 
first 
schulz creator of the peanuts comic strip declined to 
comment 
the men were armed with revolvers when they entered the home but 
were scared off when the cartoonists daughter jill pulled her 
car into the driveway minutes later 
neither schulz 65 nor his wife jean was hurt 
the men told the schulzes at gunpoint that they were going to 
take the wife according to the news release 
they got in there and got started with the episode and were 
interrupted i think before they could do everything they set up to 
do detective sgt mike brown said 
michaelsen said the decision to keep the incident quiet was made 
to protect the schulz family 
press democrat editor mike parman said the sheriffs department 
apparently has a policy of releasing information at their 
discretion 
the public has a right to know that there are two armed 
dangerous men at large in this community he said

a vincent van gogh painting sold for 1375 
million the fourth highest price paid at an auction but the sale 
disappointed a standingroomonly crowd after a string of record 
prices for the artists paintings 
portrait of adeline ravoux which van gogh finished shortly 
before his suicide sold at christies auction house wednesday 
night to an anonymous buyer who bid by telephone 
christies had estimated van goghs 1890 portrait of his 
innkeepers 13yearold daughter would bring 15 million and the 
reaction of the audience was subdued in contrast to the applause 
that usually greets a record price 
however auctioneer christopher burge insisted afterward that 
christies was not disappointed its a wonderful price for a 
beautiful picture he said 
daniel varenne an art dealer from geneva switzerland said he 
was a little surprised that the painting fetched only 1375 
million but he added the portrait was not an easy one to live 
with and that may have affected the price 
its of a girl whos attractive but not that attractive and 
theres the possibility that the blue background is not that 
appealing to a lot of people he said 
in the painting adeline dressed in blue sits in profile on a 
chair her blond hair is tied with a blue ribbon her gaze is 
serene her posture correct and her hands are folded demurely in 
front of her the background is a deep midnight blue 
the painting is the latest in a string of paintings by van gogh

researchers say they are encouraged by 
experimental use of a derivative of cows milk to prevent 
travelers diarrhea and hope to test their discovery on people 
going to developing countries 
in a report today they said that powdered concentrations of 
milk antibodies appeared to protect people from the effects of e 
coli bacteria a common cause of diarrhea 
these preliminary results are highly encouraging they wrote 
in the new england journal of medicine 
the researchers led by dr carol o tacket of the university of 
maryland school of medicine found that the treatment may provide 
an alternative to prescription antibiotics and overthecounter 
bismuth subsalicylate which can keep people from getting diarrhea 
the researchers said that about half of all travelers to 
developing countries get diarrhea 
we want to do a field study to see if it works among 
travelers said tacket our study was a very artificial 
situation 
to make the concentrate cows were first vaccinated with 
varieties of e coli that cause diarrhea the cows then produced 
antibodies in their milk that protected them from these microbes 
the researchers removed these antibodies and prepared them in 
powder form 
ten volunteers drank the powdered e coli antibodies dissolved 
in water three times a day for three days ten others got other 
forms of antibodies 
then all were given diarrheacausing e coli none of the 10 who 
got the e coli antibodies developed diarrhea however nine of the 
10 in the comparison group got the illness

a scientist in the skylab program of the 
early 1970s says the plodding soviets have since surpassed the 
americans in manned space missions 
all our accomplishments of 15 years ago should be buried in 
the dust by now unfortunately there is some dust on them but it 
is not american dust exastronaut edward gibson said wednesday 
at a reunion with eight other former skylab crew members 
the russians are the people who have continuously manned space 
stations up there they are the turtles of the space race they 
kept plodding along 
the three skylab flights from may 1973 to february 1974 took 
almost 183000 pictures of the sun and more than 40000 of the 
earth 
we learned a lot about solar physics how the sun works 
said gibson now a space consultant at reston va it is the 
largest contribution ever made in that area 
in earth observations it led into what we currently are doing 
better monitoring and understanding of our environment and how to 
control part of it to some degree 
also we learned a lot of the physiological aspects of man 
going into space important information for future flights and 
also for spinoffs for medicine on earth 
the united states could regain the lead in space technology 
gibson said if the government and nation understand what is 
needed establish longrange goals and make financial commitments 
to match them 
we need to find the best way to draw in all the good talent 
that exists in our country and a way to retain them in the work 
force for many years he said we need to streamline the 
organization the whole military and nasa infrastructure in the 
way in which we manage the combined effort as well as in the 
individual agencies themselves and the programs 
there is enthusiasm capability and knowledge ready to put us 
out ahead again not only for competitive reasons but for practical 
benefits and human reasons 
at one of the reunion sessions jim odom the national 
aeronautics and space administrations associate administrator for 
its proposed space station noted that america has been without a 
permanent manned orbiting facility for almost 10 years 
important research could have been accomplished during that 
time odom said 
unlike skylab the space station will lend itself to ongoing 
modifications he said we will be able to tailor it to meet 
the changing requirements of experimenters over its projected 
30year lifespan 
odom said that some parts of the apollo program were scrapped 
in the wake of the apollo 1 fire in which three astronauts died 
on the launch pad 
he added it would be tragic if this should happen again as a 
result of the challenger accident which killed seven astronauts 
in 1986

four whites charged with 
possession of an impressive arms cache may have been involved in 
previous attacks carried out by the african national congress a 
newspaper reported today 
police announced on wednesday they had made their biggest arms 
seizure ever in connection with the arrests of three men and one 
woman who allegedly were acting on behalf of the ancs military 
wing 
the four suspects also had a hitlist of top police 
officials according to police 
arms seized included a sovietmade sam7 groundtoair missile 
limpet mines hand grenades assault rifles pistols machine guns 
mortars and explosives police said 
they said the four had planned to use the missile to shoot down 
a police helicopter at a recent fair 
police have not released the suspects names but have said the 
three men are south african citizens and the woman is a foreigner 
the four are college educated and in their 20s and 30s police 
said adding that two are military draft dodgers and one is a 
former journalist 
the citizen a progovernment daily said without citing sources 
that at least one of the four was believed involved in anc attacks 
carried out in the early 1980s 
the mostly black anc was outlawed in south africa in 1960 and 
began a sabotageandbombing campaign the following year aimed at 
toppling whiteminority rule 
tom lodge a leading authority on the anc and a lecturer at the 
university of the witwatersrand said the arrests illustrate the 
continuing trend of young welleducated liberal and leftwing 
whites to identify themselves with the anc 
lodge said white participation in the ancs military wing 
obviously has a greater impact on the attitudes of white south 
africa than the involvement of blacks 
few whites have been involved in the ancs military operations 
although there have been several highly publicized cases in recent 
years 
following a march 17 car bombing that killed three people 
police said the leading suspect was heinrich grosskopf a white 
south african and an alleged anc member who remains at large 
law and order minister adriaan vlok described the four suspects 
as a highly specialized terror unit he alleged that the 
suspects had been trained in moscow cuba and angola and had radio 
transmitters which they used to communicate with anc headquarters 
in lusaka zambia 
he said they were captured sunday at a farmhouse near pretoria 
where they had been staying since early this year 
the south african press association citing unidentified police 
sources said a disenchanted anc member apparently gave authorities 
the tip that led them to the four suspects 
vlok said police still were investigating how the weapons were 
brought into south africa but he said the arms came overland 
through zambia and botswana 
police have announced numerous arrests of alleged anc members in 
recent months and say they have substantially weakened the groups 
ability to operate inside south africa 
there have been more than 70 bombings in south africa since a 
nationwide state of emergency was imposed in june 1986 but the 
frequency has fallen sharply in recent months

death row inmate james smith bitter 
over a reprieve from his scheduled execution acknowledged killing 
a houston insurance office manager and said those trying to save 
him were bleedingheart jerks 
smith whose lethal injection was halted about six hours before 
it would have been carried out blamed death penalty opponents for 
persuading his mother in indiana to pursue a request to the us 
supreme court for a reprieve 
this woman doesnt know me smith said of his mother 
alexzene hamilton of indianapolis she may understand some child 
who was under her care but she doesnt understand this mature 
adult male 
smith said he did not want the stay because he does not want to 
waste away on death row 
this was a decision i had made it was the last act of freedom 
i could make he said its frightening to tell you the 
truth 
smith 37 was sentenced to die for the 1983 robberyslaying of 
larry rohus manager of a houston insurance office he previously 
insisted he was innocent but in an interview wednesday detailed 
that murder and what he said were at least six other slayings 
including the mutilation deaths of three people in south carolina 
and one of a baby in new york city 
but authorities in both areas said there was no evidence such 
killings had occurred 
he also told of a murder in miami in 1978 and a second besides 
the baby in new york city in 1979 he said the baby was purchased 
in spanish harlem for 300 used in voodoo rituals and left on a 
highway leading to the verrazanonarrows bridge where it likely 
would be run over 
look what youre trying to save he said describing death 
penalty opponents who want to keep him alive as just a bunch of 
bleedingheart jerks 
im still going to be executed he insisted it may take a 
little longer 
smith said rohus was shot to death because of snide remarks the 
insurance office manager made while smith was robbing the place 
i killed him the same as i would a fly in my soup bowl he 
said i shot him through the heart almost at pointblank range 
to get money and then i ran out 
harris county assistant district attorney roberto gutierrez who 
prosecuted smith has described the former new orleans tarotcard 
reader as the most evil and dangerous man hes ever prosecuted 
that guys got a little bit of insight smith responded 
when told of gutierrezs comment 
smith said his involvement in voodoo began in high school the 
south carolina ritual slayings occurred in orangeburg county the 
spring of 1981 he said 
records there show five murders in 1981 four shooting victims 
and one in a fire county sheriff cr smith jr said wednesday he 
could recall no such incidents like those described by smith in 
1981 in the few years before that or since 
if smith committed such crimes in orangeburg county the bodies 
were never found there the sheriff said 
in new york city police spokeman sgt peter sweeney said he was 
unaware of any homicide involving a mutilated infant whose body was 
left on the verrazanonarrows bridge 
mrs hamiltons appeal questioned her sons mental competence 
he said the competency issue was linked to a 1978 miami armed 
robbery charge to which he pleaded innocent due to temporary 
insanity 
the insanity issue is brought forth by lawyers to get people 
off smith said thats what my lawyer recognized

the military charged today that foreign sponsors 
have stepped up weapons shipments to afghan guerrillas and sent in 
more military advisors endangering soviet troops who are about to 
march out of afghanistan 
the defense ministry newspaper red star reported in a frontpage 
dispatch from its military correspondents at soviet headquarters in 
kabul that there is great anxiety about the withdrawal that begins 
sunday 
they are facing 1500 kilometers 940 miles of mountainous 
wartorn roads the newspaper said of soviet soldiers who will be 
among the first to pull out of the soviet unions southern 
neighbor and we know very well that roads in afghanistan are on 
the forward edge of the undeclared war it is necessary to be 
prepared for the possibility of armed provocations 
the newspaper said rebel activity had been stepped up in kabul 
kandahar ghazni paktia and other provinces 
taking advantage of the pullback of soviet and afghan troops 
from border areas of those regions in the depth of the country the 
opposition and its foreign patrons have sharply increased the 
number of caravans with weapons delivering them not only at 
night now but also in the daytime the paper claimed 
in the military formations there has been a noticeable growth 
in the number of foreign military advisers who organize joint 
actions by groups from different moslem parties the newspaper 
said 
the united states has been the insurgents chief arms supplier 
red star said the preparations for withdrawal were nearly 
complete at the kabul headquarters of the limited military 
contingent as the 115000 soviet soldiers in afghanistan are 
referred to in the staterun press 
the dispatch did not make clear however how many would leave 
in the first march north or when headquarters would be evacuated 
it said the first troops to leave would be motorized rifle 
regiments paratroopers scouts and pilots but gave no other 
details 
afghanistan has been in the throes of civil war since april 
1978 when a sovietinspired revolution brought a marxist 
government to power 
soviet soldiers intervened in december 1979 to install babrak 
karmal as the afghan leader and to help troops loyal to him put 
down a widespread insurrection karmal was replaced by najib in may 
1986 and has since taken refuge in the soviet union

a survey of former major leaguers concludes that 
baseball is a healthy way of life and the infield is the best 
place to be 
doctors from the university of alabama at birmingham poured over 
baseball encyclopedias and death certificates to learn when and how 
players died 
the main thing we found was the overall protective effect of 
being an athlete said dr john waterbor the death rate we 
found was 94 percent of that expected 
the researchers said the findings support the idea that getting 
plenty of exercise and being in good physical shape early in life 
help keep folks healthy as they age 
the report found that infielders had the lowest death rate 
while catchers had the highest pitchers and outfielders were in 
between waterbor said the mens body builds may help explain these 
differences 
the infielders tend to be averagelooking to thin people who 
can move quickly compared to catchers who are built more like 
bricks waterbor said in an interview 
the study also found that those who had lengthy playing careers 
or good records lived the longest although these differences were 
small 
the study published in todays new england journal of medicine 
was based on 985 men who played majorleague ball between 1911 and 
1915 their longevity and causes of death were compared to the us 
white male population of the same age 
among other findings 
by far the most common cause of death was heart disease the 
researchers were surprised to find that the death rate from the 
disease was 10 percent higher for ball players than for average 
american men 
baseball players were also somewhat more likely than other 
people to die from cancer but they were substantially less apt to 
die from infections lung disease diabetes and accidents among 
other things 
catchers were more likely than usual to die from pancreatic 
cancer pitchers from hodgkins disease and outfielders from 
digestive ulcers 
the researchers successfully followed up on 958 players of 
whom 16 were still alive in 1984 the average age of death was just 
under 71

the foreign ministry has informed the associated 
press that its correspondents have been barred from traveling to 
afghanistan to cover the scheduled withdrawal of soviet troops 
foreign ministry officials said on wednesday the afghan 
government had objected to a question posed by an ap correspondent 
during a recent news conference held by afghan leader najib in 
kabul 
yevgeny b isayenko a ministry press official said afghan 
authorities would refuse a visa to any ap correspondent several of 
whom had applied to cover the withdrawal scheduled to begin sunday 
michael putzel ap chief of bureau in moscow had been given 
oral assurances tuesday that an associated press reporter and 
photographer would be given seats on the official plane carrying 
correspondents to kabul 
the afghan government generally permits news coverage by western 
journalists only when they are invited as members of an officially 
sanctioned press tour 
isayenko said that during a news conference in kabul last 
month carol j williams a veteran ap moscow correspondent asked 
a question that was very insulting to najib 
ms williams asked najib whether if rebel forces in afghanistan 
emerge victorious after the soviet pullout he would seek refuge in 
the soviet union the prosoviet afghan leader replied he would 
never allow such a victory 
he did not object to the question at the time 
isayenko said refusal to grant visas was the sovereign right 
of the afghan embassy in moscow 
andrei silantiev a foreign ministry official who serves as 
government liaison with foreign news agencies said the british 
news agency reuters would file pool reports to the ap and other 
western news services

harvard law school will renew its 
commitment to a diversified faculty under an agreement reached 
between the dean and about 50 students most of them black who 
staged an overnight studyin at his office 
we feel we were very successful over the last 24 hours said 
robert wilkins a secondyear law student who is president of the 
black law school association which staged the protest this is a 
great step forward 
but dean james vorenberg said wednesday the administration had 
only agreed to look into seven of the students 12 demands 
i dont think theres any major commitments on either side 
he said its more of a sharing of understanding how issues 
look 
however vorenberg said a policy statement on diversity first 
issued in 1982 would be updated and reissued and an effort to 
interest minority students in teaching would be made 
the students camped out at vorenbergs office tuesday night in 
their protest for more black professors and for vorenberg who is 
retiring to be replaced by a tenured black professor 
after a meeting wednesday the dean specifically agreed to 
going ahead with commitments on seven demands wilkins said 
he said the demands included establishing a fellowship to entice 
black professors to teach at harvard issuing a policy statement 
expressing a commitment to diversity as part of the schools hiring 
policy and allowing students a broader role in the hiring of 
minority faculty 
the students also failed to bring about a commitment to 
diversify the curriculum to reflect the experience of people of 
color and a request that a black assistant professor receive 
tenure 
harvard law school has 61 tenured positions two of them held by 
blacks there are three black assistant professors and no black 
women on the staff

a court today ordered a young lebanese 
held in custody for eight days after police said he was the owner 
of a dynamitepacked car that blew up near the israeli embassy and 
killed three people 
the car exploded wednesday about 200 yards from the embassy 
after police prevented it from parking outside the building and the 
car sped off 
police said they suspected the owner omar ahmad hawillo 28 of 
being involved in the bungled attack which killed the driver and 
two bystanders 
police said the car was rigged with 300 pounds of dynamite and 
interior minister christodoulos veniamin said the embassy was the 
intended target 
witnesses reported seeing hawillo running from the scene police 
said adding that there was also evidence linking him to a 
remotecontrol detonating device found nearby 
there was speculation that the attempt to blow up the embassy 
was to avenge the assassination of khalil wazir the plos military 
chief 
but the palestine liberation organizations office in nicosia 
issued a statement denying involvement 
five of the 15 people hurt in the fiery blast remained 
hospitalized today and were listed in serious but stable condition 
with burns and cuts 
hawillo who arrived from lebanon on march 21 was brought to 
court under heavy security with the hand that wasnt handcuffed 
he covered his face so it could not be photographed 
detective takis komodikis said hawillo was arrested four hours 
after the explosion police earlier reported he was picked up 
shortly after the blast 
the judge remanded the suspect to police custody for eight days 
pending the investigations completion 
a detective who spoke on condition of anonymity said hawillo had 
admitted to owning the car but denied any involvement in the 
attempt to bomb the embassy claiming he had lent the vehicle to a 
friend 
komodikis told the court that the driver who was blown to 
pieces had not been identified yet 
a police statement said the driver had tried to park outside the 
israeli embassy building twice before the blast but was told to 
move on by police when asked for his identification he sped away 
and rammed another car at an intersection 
adamos markides one of the injured cypriots said he saw the 
car coming out of a side street near the embassy he was driving 
so fast he didnt even stop at the traffic lights and hit another 
car markides said 
he said his was the second car behind the one that exploded 
suddenly there was this flash and boom with a black cloud of 
smoke enveloping everything and a terrible heat i staggered out of 
my car with my face and arms on fire 
an anonymous caller telephoned a mideast bureau of the american 
television network nbc to claim responsibility for the explosion in 
the name of the palestinian terrorist abu nidal abu nidal whose 
real name is sabri banna has been blamed for a series of terrorist 
attacks around the world 
wazir the plos deputy commander was killed april 16 in tunis 
israeli sources have said he was killed by an israeli squad of 
agents palestinian groups have pledged to avenge the his death

iraq said today its warplanes raided two 
ships off iran during the night bringing to eight the number of 
attacks on commercial shipping in the persian gulf it claimed in 
two weeks 
only one of the reported attacks has been confirmed by the 
londonbased lloyds shipping intelligence unit which monitors 
maritime traffic around the world 
gulfbased shipping executives had no local independent 
information for any of the attacks since april 29 such attacks 
normally would precipitate an iranian retaliatory blow in the 
socalled tanker war an offshoot of the 7yearold iraniraq war 
lloyds said the iraqis fired two frenchmade exocet missiles at 
an iranian tanker on tuesday causing considerable fire damage to 
the vessel 
the vessel whose name was not known according to lloyds was 
owned by the national iranian oil tanker co and was sailing from 
irans key oil loading terminal at kharg en route to the larak 
terminal in the southern gulf 
the attack took place about 40 miles off the northern iranian 
coast according to the lloyds report 
the baghdad high command on wednesday reported the sixth attack 
and today the seventh and eighth attacks in two weeks on large 
maritime targets off iran the term usually means a tanker 
sailing to or from kharg 
kharg accounts for 90 percent of iranian oil exports and baghdad 
has vowed to block the iranian oil flow as long as the tehran 
rulers refuse to accept a negotiated end to their war 
ship attacks claimed by iraq often are not confirmed until some 
time later because they occur inside the maritime war zone some 
ships maintain radio silence to avoid being targeted again some of 
the raids are never confirmed 
the lloyds report would be the first confirmed ship attack in 
the gulf since the us navy was empowered to defend any vessel 
attacked by either belligerent outside exclusion zones off enemy 
coastlines if a us warship happened to be in the area at the 
time of the attack 
iran retaliates for the iraqi raids by striking at neutral 
commercial shipping the iranians have not hit any vessel since 
april 24 and before the us navy rules in the gulf were broadened

a navy avionics technician acquitted of 
assault for having sex with his former fiancee despite knowing he 
carried the aids virus said he was not surprised by the verdict 
it was what i felt was right petty officer 2nd class john 
e crawford said after the verdict was announced wednesday 
crawford 27 was accompanied by his present fiancee karen 
skavdahl 
crawfords family and friends applauded after the sevenmember 
jury announced their verdict before military judge richard mollison 
at the treasure island navy station 
jeannie elmer crawfords former fiancee and accuser said she 
was upset by the verdict and fears it will encourage others not to 
reveal to sex partners that they are infected with the deadly virus 
thats why aids is probably going to be carried on and on and 
on because people will not tell their partner said elmer and 
now this will prove they can probably get away with it 
elmer has tested negative for the aids virus three times 
crawford stood at attention in a packed courtroom as the jury 
which deliberated 4 hours also acquitted him of charges of 
adultery and of exposing his former girlfriend to the aids virus 
wrongfully and in wanton disregard for human life 
he was convicted of the minor charge of having a visitor in his 
room after hours for which the jury gave him 15 days in the brig 
and reduced his rank by one grade from e5 to e4 
if convicted of the primary charges crawford could have been 
stripped of his rank dishonorably discharged and sentenced to a 10 
years behind bars 
the charges stemmed from a sexual encounter crawford and elmer 
had on april 15 1987 
crawford a native of magnolia ark testified he told elmer 
about his test results and wore a condom when the couple made love 
in his barracks room he said elmer 28 was bitter that he had 
broken off their brief engagement and filed the charges for revenge 
lt cmdr jane gilliland the prosecutor countered in her 
closing statement that crawford simply didnt care enough about 
elmer to tell her about the tests 
the case was unprecedented in the navy although there have been 
similar cases in other military branches 
in arizona on wednesday the aidsrelated courtmartial of 
adrian g morris jr resumed after a ninemonth delay 
morris a 28yearold army private from caseyville ill is 
accused of having threatened the health of three soldiers by not 
using condoms during sex and failing to warn them he had tested 
positive for the aids virus 
the national centers for disease control estimates that 20 
percent to 30 percent of those who test positive for exposure to 
the virus will develop aids within five years it is not known 
whether everyone with the virus will eventually develop the 
incurable disease

until their boss found out 
the windfall began when heavyweight boxing champ mike tyson and 
his new wife actress robin given were involved in a fenderbender 
sunday near the manhattan entrance to the holland tunnel 
when the officers whose names have not been released went to 
see if they could help tyson according to police reports quoted 
in todays new york post told them ive had nothing but bad 
luck and accidents with this car you guys take this car and keep 
it 
port authority police said the officers at first resisted but 
the nearly 6foot 216pound tyson whose ring record stands at 
340 insisted 
the officers drove the gift to a private garage in jersey city 
nj where it stayed until monday morning when the commander of 
the holland tunnel police detail heard about the incident 
the port authoritys internal affairs unit sent detectives to 
retrieve the car and return it to the company that handles tysons 
business interests 
ive got real problems with this behavior said port

scientists who were once smuggled into 
this town from all over the country as part of the manhattan 
projects secret attempt to build an atomic bomb in the 1940s 
returned openly for a reunion this week 
we were put on trains with the shades pulled down we 
arrived in oak ridge at 5 am recalled jeptha a wade jr a 
mechanical engineer who was one of about 60 members of the special 
engineer detachment at the reunion 
it was raining everything was muddy we were told this is 
going to be your new home it was a couple of days before we knew 
we were in tennessee said a chuckling wade who returned for the 
first time in 42 years sunday from hillsborough calif 
glynn clark met his future wife evelyn shortly after arriving 
at what became known as the atomic city in january 1944 
we were all working with a dedication there was no night 
or day said clark a chemical engineer 
the work went on around the clock after a night shift clark 
said some might go to a midnight dance others to a 2 am movie 
i have a great affection for the town it was a pioneer 
effort clark said 
the effort was an arm of the manhattan project the code name 
for americas effort to build atomic weapons before nazi germany 
did during world war ii its members came from all over and most 
did not know where they were going or why 
it wasnt scary it was secret they put the fear of god in us 
about telling anyone what we were doing said wade who was 
assigned to work on the electromagnetic separation project 
enriching uranium 
the project based in oak ridge and hanford wash eventually 
yielded the two atomic bombs dropped on japan in 1945 
oak ridge was chosen because the government could get land for a 
reasonable price there was a good labor supply the climate 
allowed yearround construction and the inland location made the 
project safe from foreign attack 
gordon lindner and mary jane his wife were married in may 1944

largely of playing pool listening to the radio and telling stories 
at the px

ii to an end and we were all ready to go home he said 
lindner a mechanical engineer said he and his wife went back 
to montana after the war only to return to oak ridge two years 
later to live 
its exciting to reminisce and see everyone again he said

anything when he returned to oak ridge for the first time in 1975 
i thought it would all shut down when the war was over he

here are some of the jokes involving the 
reports of astrology in the white house that host johnny carson 
featured in his return to the tonight show 
i am not an expert on astrology i know a little bit about it 
but i understand the horoscope with the chart as they call it is 
divided into the socalled 12 houses and i just didnt know the 
white house was one of them 
we apparently have a new cabinet officer in the government i 
was not aware of the secretary of health education and 
soothsaying 
apparently the astrologist says that reagans sign is the 
rising house of aquarius nancys house is i think in the house 
of dress designer adolfo i could be wrong it could be bill 
blass but i think thats close 
do you get the feeling if this gets out of hand the national 
security council will be sitting around a table with a pack of 
tarot cards planning the nations defense gee a black queen 
frank launch the missiles 
reagan performs at his best during a full moon big deal 
so does the wolfman 
carson also noted that reagan has said he never made a policy 
decision based on astrology why well imitating the presidents 
voice because that little pointer on my ouija board moved to 
no

opposition leader kim daejung today 
said expresident chun doohwan was involved in crushing the bloody 
1980 revolt in the southern city of kwangju 
kim demanded that chun be investigated in connection with the 
nineday kwangju uprising but said he opposes bringing him to 
trial 
mr chun doohwan was one of those deeply involved in the 
kwangju incident kim told reporters there should be no 
sanctuary in our efforts to disclose all truth 
at least 191 people were killed and more than 800 injured in the 
uprising by official count dissidents say the toll was much 
higher 
kim whose party for peace and democracy emerged as the largest 
opposition force in the april 26 elections for a national assembly 
previously has called for an investigation of the revolt but tis 
was the first time that he named chun as a central figure 
president roh taewoos governing democratic justice party has 
said it would object to any parliamentary investigation of chun and 
his family 
at the time of the uprising chun was a general leading other 
military officers who seized power after a coup most of them later 
retired to take on key political posts and chun became president 
roh then an army general helped chun seize power with military 
backing in 1980 kim did not name roh in the kwangju case 
kim 62 said he was arrested one day before the uprising began 
on may 18 1980 a military court found kim guilty and sentenced 
him to death on what he called doctored sedition charges 
kims sentence was later reduced to life and then to a 20year 
term under pressure from washington kim was later allowed to go 
to the united states for medical treatment 
kim said a parliamentary investigative team should look into all 
aspects of the kwangju uprising including the exact number of 
casualties who ordered troops to open fire and any us role in it 
kim took the political offensive as rohs government was being 
reorganized after last months elections which left the nations 
governing party without a parliamentary majority for the first time 
in south koreas 40year history 
roh said he humbly accepted the election setback promised 
to work with the opposition and reshuffled the top securityrelated 
government posts

the telephone outage in chicagos western suburbs 
dragged into a fifth day today as illinois bell officials tried to 
find out why an hour went by before firefighters arrived to fight a 
blaze at a switching station 
sundays fire at the unmanned hinsdale station left 35000 
customers without telephone service in du page county west of 
chicago and there was no indication when they would get normal 
service back 
adjusting to life without telephones has been difficult say 
those affected 
you dont miss it until you dont have it said bill saad 
one of more than 100 people waiting in line wednesday for 17 phones 
provided free of charge outside the firedamaged switching station 
bell learned of the fire at 359 pm when alarms at a 
monitoring station reported a fire and power failure said bell 
spokeswoman pat montgomery the alarm is not designed to sound at 
the hinsdale fire department which arrived at the fire at 458 pm 
she said an illinois bell worker arrived at the station at 420 
pm and flagged down a car and asked the driver to alert 
firefighters 
were still trying to find out why there was the big 
difference in the time the bell worker came and when the fire 
department came ms montgomery said 
she had little encouragement for customers 
we dont know when we will be able to bring back local 
service she said wednesday and when we do it will be a slow 
process of a few thousand customers a day we cant estimate when 
we just dont know 
between 150 and 200 illinois bell employees have been working to 
restore operations and some local calls between suburbs and some 
longdistance calls that normally run through the hinsdale station 
were finally ringing phones ms montgomery said 
cable and hightech equipment were badly damaged by flames and 
the water sprayed by firefighters the cause of the fire has not 
been determined ms montgomery said 
saad a resident of downers grove was standing in line for the 
second time to make the same business call to kansas city the 
operator had cut off saads first call but under rules set up at 
the center that still forced to go him back at the end of the line 
before another try 
it has definitely been a headache said gloria telander 
president of print media services ltd in elk grove village whose 
business publishes campground guides for travelers around the 
country 
she said her customers calling from outside illinois get a 
recorded message due to mechanical difficulties we cannot 
complete your call please try again 
well theyve been trying now for three days and theyre 
hysterical why doesnt the phone company just say whats going 
on

four of the golden temples five top 
priests and about 30 followers were arrested today when police 
blocked their attempted march on the sikh shrine which was ringed 
by government security forces 
among those arrested was head sikh priest jasbir singh rode his 
talks wednesday with government officials to try to end the 
fourday confrontation at the 400yearold temple were inconclusive 
two sikh militants were killed this afternoon in a heavy 
exchange of fire with security forces on the temples perimeter 
police said a third was seriously injured 
the deaths raised to at least 14 the number of people killed 
since shooting broke out monday at the temple sikhisms holiest 
shrine eleven others have been injured 
rode has called for the estimated 100 sikh extremists inside the 
temple complex to dismantle their bunkers and for the 2500 police 
and paramilitary forces ringing the shrine to withdraw 
the priest and his followers were arrested at another sikh 
shrine about a third of a mile north of the golden temple as they 
were about to start marching in defiance of a police ban 
deputy police commissioner sarbjeet singh asked the group to 
call off the march because two bursts of gunfire inside the temple 
were reported this morning after an overnight lull 
punjab police chief kps gill told a news conference that 
there were no plans to end the siege asked where it was leading 
gill said we are waiting to see how the situation develops 
we want the militants to stop firing so that normalcy can be 
restored he added 
we take responsibility for any firing from inside the 
temple rode responded you take responsibility for firing from 
outside 
sikh militants placed a mediumsized machine gun atop a tower 
inside the complex and were in a position to fire down on anyone in 
the area 
the sikhs have also built fortifications on the northern edge of 
the complex from which police tuesday evacuated 800 pilgrims to 
keep them out of the crossfire 
all shops and businesses in the old walled sector of amritsar 
which surrounds the temple remained shuttered today and people 
stayed off the streets as a policeimposed curfew entered its 
fourth day 
staterun all india radio said the government was trying to 
ensure that milk and other supplies reach civilians in curfewbound 
areas 
police had hoped to lift the curfew wednesday but the effort 
failed 
the temple complex covers an area equivalent to more than five 
city blocks and includes offices hostels and dining halls 
the sikhs whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam claim they are discriminated 
against by indias majority hindus 
sikh militants have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1983 
for more autonomy for an independent homeland in punjab state 
sikhs make up less than two percent of indias 800 million people 
and punjab is the only state where they are a majority 
more than 940 people have been killed this year in punjab in 
attacks blamed on the extremists most have been hindus or moderate 
sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign 
the indian army was sent into the golden temple complex in june 
1984 to drive sikh extremists from the shrine more than 1200 
people were killed in the attack including jarnail singh 
bhindranwale a militant sikh preacher 
later that year prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated 
by two of her sikh bodyguards in revenge

crashed wednesday into water about 30 feet deep a mile off the 
island of oahu said chief warrant officer eric r carlson a 
marine spokesman 
three helicopters searched unsuccessfully for the crew until 
sunset with the search continuing at night with a coast guard 
cutter an air search was scheduled to resume again at dawn he 
said 
marine divers located wreckage on the sea bed but were unable 
to find the helicopters crew carlson said 
carlson said repair crews had removed the helicopters rotor 
blades and reinstalled them during routine maintenance he said the 
crew had taken the chopper out for a test flight to make sure the 
blades were in balance 
it started falling and i saw something fall off of it maybe 
it was the tail part that fell said carolyn kam who saw the 
crash through a window 
kam a newscaster at radio station krtr said the craft was 
smoking as it fell to the water 
the helicopter was attached to the marine medium helicopter 
squadron 262 one of five squadrons based at kaneohe 
the ch46 has been out of production since 1971 after orders 
declined with the end of the vietnam war said robert torgerson 
spokesman for boeing helicopters in philadelphia 
it has been used by the marines since the early 1960s as a troop 
transport aircraft and the navy has also used it to airlift 
supplies torgerson said 
since discontinuing production boeing has made kits to maintain 
the reliability of the helicopter and extend its life into the 
1990s he said 
torgerson said there has been no history of mechanical problems 
with the ch46 although all aircraft that operate for that long 
have had some incidents

not once in the 13 harrowing minutes it took 
the crew of aloha airlines flight 243 to land the severly damaged 
plane did copilot madeline mimi tompkins doubt she and pilot 
robert schornstheimer would keep control of the craft she said 
today 
i didnt feel nervous even though the crew saw sky through 
the cockpit doorway had one engine out and communicated with hand 
signals because of the noise ms tompkins said on abctvs good 
morning america 
schornstheimer said he struggled to fly the plane by feel 
unaware that a 20foot chunk of cabin ceiling had been shorn off 
the boeing 737 sweeping a stewardess to her death 
our whole emphasis was focused on feeling it that it was 
flyable and being able to land it safely he said in the 
interview 
the dramatic tape of the conversation between the crew and the 
air traffic control tower at maui released wednesday shows ms 
tompkins voice was strained but under control as the troubles 
began on april 28 
we have rapid decompression we are unpressurized declaring 
an emergency she told the tower 
schornstheimer described the moment the roof was ripped away 
all of a sudden there was this loud thump sound and debris was 
flying everywhere in the cockpit i turned around and looked out 
the door and everything above shoulder level was blue sky 
the cockpit door was blown off he said i didnt really 
know how far the damage went all i could see was blue sky 
ms tompkins said training and experience took over as the 
plane shook in the air and debris flew through the cockpit 
we just immediately started into the things were trained for 
getting on our oxygen masks and started down and making a decision 
about where we wanted to land said schornstheimer 
mimi and i are both experienced even though we havent flown 
that much together we just pointed and we both knew where we were 
going and what we were doing and continued on with our normal 
procedures he said 
the plane shook violently when the pilot dipped below a certain 
speed and the problems multiplied as the plane descended 
somewhere along that line we lost an engine and we started 
our auxiliary power unit and used the generator on it for part of 
the electrical power on the airplane said schornstheimer 
adding to his concerns schornstheimer said in an interview 
published in todays editions of usa today was the fact that when 
he looked through the open doorway into the main cabin enough 
pieces of flooring had been ripped up that the crafts control 
cables were exposed 
ms tompkins meanwhile spoke coolly with the controllers as 
the plane dipped below 11000 feet and was cleared for a headon 
approach to the runway 
were going to need assistance we cannot communicate with the 
flight attendants ah will there be assistance for the 
passengers when we land ms tompkins asked the air traffic 
control tower 
schornstheimer said after their initial shock on seeing the 
plane after landing he and ms tompkins went on helping passengers 
in the rescue operation 
it did fly we were glad it hung together he said it 
was just amazing to walk around the airplane after we landed and 
look at it 
hours before a tape of the radio transmissions was made public 
wednesday by the federal aviation administration the two pilots 
received an award from the air line pilots association for landing 
the crippled plane with all passengers and all but the one 
stewardess safe 
earlier in the week ms tompkins and schornstheimer had met 
with vice president george bush and made the rounds at offices in 
congress they declined to discuss the incident with reporters 
what seemed like a short time to mimi and me because of our 
busy cockpit duties must have seemed like an eternity to our 
passengers and flight attendants schornstheimer told fellow 
pilots wednesday while accepting the alpa award 
his copilot ms tompkins praised the captain bob analyzed 
the situation confronting us and he reacted all of his decisions 
were the right ones 
the two pilots said their ability to work as a team under 
adverse conditions was key to bringing the boeing 737 to a safe 
landing 
as bad as flight 243s situation was the tape showed that the 
two pilots thought erroneously it turned out that it was even 
worse 
according to the tape the pilots were certain that for some 
reason the nose landing gear was not deploying this would have 
made landing the already severely damaged aircraft especially 
dangerous according to aviation experts 
be advised we have no nose gear we are landing without a nose 
gear ms tompkins told the maui airport tower in a strained but 
controlled voice as the plane headed toward the airport well 
need all the emergency equipment you got 
it is believed that a malfunctioning indicator light misled the 
pilots into thinking the nose gear had not deployed 
only seconds before the plane set down on the runway did the 
controller see that the nose gear actually had deployed and advised 
the flight crew then the boeing 737 landed ambulances and fire 
trucks waiting 
despite the experience ms tompkins told the alpa gathering 
wednesday that she is ready to get back to the cockpit im 
looking forward to going back to hawaii and flying again she 
said

half the city is still mourning said alderman bill henry 
youre going to tell me its art 
the city council contingent charged the work was racist and an 
insult to the washington family 
the painting has been arrested alderman ernest jones said 
the portrait wrapped in brown paper was carried off in a squad 
car that left the school with sirens wailing 
students at the school a fouryear college affiliated with the 
art institute of chicago argued that the work was artistic 
selfexpression and protected by the first amendment 
this has nothing to do with race it has to do with art 
said student kevin landers dont tell us what to draw 
the painting depicted washington clad in a frilly white bra 
panties and stockings holding a pencil and frowning at viewers it 
was displayed in a school hallway with dozens of others in a 
student competition closed to the public

aldermen took it down the aldermen eventually took the work to 
school president tony jones who agreed to allow police to impound 
the work

found it insulting inciting and causing unrest ernest jones 
said 
tony jones who signed a statement at the aldermens request 
indicating the work would not be displayed again at the school 
later said police were concerned the painting would lead to 
riots 
incitement to riot was the phrase they actually used he 
said 
artist david nelson left the school hours before the 
confrontation jones said adding he had tried unsuccessfully to 
reach the student to seek voluntary removal of the painting before 
the city hall delegation arrived 
a school statement said the artist chose this work himself 
and noted students bear the sole responsibility for selection of 
their work in this exhibition 
nelson could not be reached to explain what the painting was 
intended to represent school spokesman kevin frech would not 
provide his telephone number and calls placed to listed telephone 
numbers for that name went unanswered or were answered by people 
who denied any knowledge of the painting 
the exhibit also included a selfportrait of nelson showing a 
young white man embracing people of various races and titled im 
sensitive and i love all humanity 
the city council passed a resolution wednesday calling for 
withdrawal of city subsidies to the school unless the painting was 
removed and demanding a public apology

but the measure was almost certain to fail because the governing 
liberal democratic party has a 302seat majority in the 512seat 
lower house 
a foreign ministry spokesman said okunos comments and previous 
lapses by other officials have severely damaged relations with 
asian nations 
okuno came under fire from china south korea and north korea 
for an april 22 statement that japan was not an aggressor in world 
war ii and fought to protect itself at a time when the white race 
had turned asia into a colony 
he made the remark after visiting yasukuni shrine where war 
heroes and convicted war criminals are enshrined other countries 
including china have protested official visits to the monument in 
central tokyo 
okuno said the objections were unfortunate 
in separate policy committee meetings the japan socialist party 
and the komeito agreed to call a noconfidence vote against the 
75yearold minister said the komeito official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
japans two largest opposition groupings were supported by the 
democratic socialists and the communist party 
news reports said the opposition was privately pressing prime 
minister noboru takeshita to dismiss okuno widely regarded as the 
thirdhighest ranking official after takeshita and finance minister 
kiichi miyazawa 
okunos comments and his refusal to apologize have embarrassed 
the government spokesmen have stressed that his views do not 
reflect official policy 
takeshita fielding questions from opposition diet members 
wednesday said our country feels deep responsibility for the 
grave damage japan inflicted on the chinese people during the past 
war we believe the government should fully recognize that our 
countrys actions during the war have been criticized severely as 
aggression 
foreign minister sosuke uno who tried to soothe chinas anger 
on a trip to beijing last week said today he had telephoned okuno 
and urged him to withdraw his comments 
today north korea termed the comments an expression of a 
sinister intention to open a chapter of a new history of militarist 
aggression 
beginning in 1937 china and japan fought an eightyear war that 
killed 571000 japanese and 13 million chinese soldiers and an 
untold number of civilians 
the dead included an estimated 42000 chinese civilians and 
captured soldiers killed by the japanese in the nanking massacre in 
the winter of 193738 
china and japan signed a treaty in 1972 that says in part the 
japanese side is keenly aware of japans responsibility for causing 
enormous damages in the past to the chinese people through war and 
deeply reproaches itself

after six days of fighting guns fell 
silent in south beiruts slums today as rival shiite moslem 
militias observed a ceasefire arranged by the presidents of syria 
and iran 
police said the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
controlled 70 percent of the 16squaremile slums before the 
ceasefire went into effect at 11 pm 5 pm edt wednesday 
tension remained high in the slums as both sides armed in their 
positions exchanged occasional sniper and machinegun fire one 
woman was killed by a snipers bullet in the ghobeiri district 
today 
police said 33 people were killed and 160 wounded wednesday 
before the truce began the overall toll from nearly a week of 
violence was 188 killed and 532 wounded 
a police spokesman said the syrianbacked amal arabic for hope 
had lost most of its positions in south beiruts narrow alleys and 
redeployed its militiamen along the disputed terrains southern 
western and northern edges 
amal controls all the gateways to south beirut and hezbollah 
controls most of the area from inside said the spokesman who by 
regulation cannot be identified 
reporters who toured the embattled slums saw amal militiamen at 
those positions in south beirut 
hezbollah fighters in light green fatigues and green headbands 
controlled most of the area from inside 
bullet scars appeared on nearly every building in the area 
smoke billowed from several shellpocked apartment blocks and shops 
that were hit during wednesdays battles 
several amal jeeps were seen destroyed along the side roads of 
districts under hezbollahs control 
dozens of cars were damaged several others were burned beyond 
recognition glass shards and rubble littered the dusty streets and 
alleys of the embattled slums 
iranian flags rose from at least 15 amal positions overrun by 
hezbollah 
the final ceasefire was ordered by president hafez assad of 
syria and his iranian counterpart ali khamenei after telephone 
consultations late wednesday evening the two presidents also set 
up a fourman committee to supervise implementation of the accord 
the committee groups irans deputy foreign minister hussein 
sheikholeslam the head of syrian military intelligence in west 
beirut brig gen ali hammoud ayoub homeyed of amal and hassan 
khalil of hezbollah 
four observer teams formed by the committee entered south beirut 
early today to supervise evacuation of the wounded from both rival 
factions the police spokesman said 
he said a convoy of about 10 ambulances from the lebanese red 
cross also drove across amal lines into the bombscarred slums to 
evacuate the wounded 
however the evacuation was delayed because at the last minute 
hezbollah demanded guarantees that its wounded will be safe in 
hospitals of west beirut outside its area of influence the 
spokesman said 
he said the syrians agreed to guarantee safety of wounded 
hezbollahis 
at the height of the fighting doctors said militiamen forced 
surgeons at a hospital to operate at gunpoint and that there were 
gunbattles inside the hospital 
syria deployed 7500 troops in west beirut 14 months ago after a 
month of bloody clashes between justice minister nabih berris amal 
and the militia of druse warlord walid jumblatts progressive 
socialist party 
the syrians however did not deploy in south beirut a 
traditional stronghold for iranianbacked underground factions 
holding most of the 18 foreign hostages 
the truce was reached after amal lost most of south beirut to 
the proiranian radicals 
the truce calls for withdrawal of all militiamen from the 
streets of the southern suburbs this afternoon the withdrawal 
will be the big test the police spokesman said 
four previous ceasefire accords have collapsed due to 
hezbollahs refusal to withdraw to positions it held before the 
confrontation broke out friday 
an amal official speaking on condition of anonymity said his 
militia insists on returning to the districts we controlled 
before the clashes started he refused to say whether amal would 
try to regain its lost positions by force if hezbollah refuses to 
withdraw

jesse jacksons call to white democratic 
legislators who benefited from black votes to back him for the 
presidential nomination has failed to attract much support from 
those who count at the national convention 
since the days leading up to the super tuesday primaries on 
march 8 jackson ha said that white democratic legislators 
especially those in the south who were elected with a major share 
of the black vote should be willing to support him based on that 
basis 
he recently renewed that call and added a new twist jackson 
named names 
its reasonable to expect that sen terry sanford will 
endorse my campaign thats a reasonable expectation jackson 
said during an appearance in greensboro nc 
sanford who was elected to the senate in 1986 is one of the 
unpledged public officeholders who will attend the democratic 
national convention as a super delegate 
earlier in the campaign sanford backed tennessee sen albert 
gore jr who captured north carolina on super tuesday in the wake 
of gores decision to suspend his campaign sanford moved into the 
uncommitted ranks 
he wants to enjoy his uncommitted status for a little bit 
said sanfords spokesman tom lawton sanford chose not to comment 
on jacksons call for his support lawton said 
back in 1986 when sanford sought the democratic nomination for 
the senate seat he did not have the backing of jackson ted 
kinney a black candidate seeking the democratic nod picked up 
jacksons endorsement instead 
kinney was not a serious candidate by any stretch of the 
imagination said merle black a political science professor at 
the university of north carolina 
in the general election sanford edged james t broyhill 52 
percent to 48 percent with a major share of the black vote and 
nearly half of the white vote about 45 percent 
by the early 70s the late 60s the percentage of white 
votes began dropping precipitously said larry sabato a 
political science professor at the university of virginia 
democrats dont need a majority to win the election thanks to 
the black vote but they need a healthy slice of the white vote 
black says that in the south the white vote has become the swing 
vote 
the achilles heel for republicans is they get little support 
from blacks so they have to get a landslide of whites the 
republicans need a landslide to make it close he said 
the ability to capture a large share of the white swing vote 
combined with strong black support made the difference for a 
number of southern senators elected in 1986 
wyche fowler of georgia has been elected for nine years to 
represent the black majority fifth congressional district in his 
state in the general election fowler won his old district by 
nearly a 2to1 margin but he also won the support of 4outof10 
white voters 
fowler who also is a super delegate remains uncommitted 
louisiana senator john breaux did well in the cajun parishes but 
also carried or finished even in the white baptist parishes for his 
1986 victory breaux also remains uncommitted 
not only did these candidates target the white swing vote but 
they had to battle the staunch white voters who refuse to support a 
candidate who has the backing of black voters according to 
pollster natalie davis 
its hard to document but about onefifth of the typically 
democratic voters will not back a candidate with black voters 
ms davis said democrats are caught perenially between a rock 
and a hard place 
some of these southern senators who managed to capture both the 
black vote and a large enough share of the white vote have decided 
not to endorse a presidential candidate before the democratic 
national convention in atlanta july 1821 
in fact 11 of the 12 southern senators who will be attending 
the convention as super delegates have chosen the uncommitted 
ranks only bennett johnston of louisiana remains steadfast in his 
support of gore 
jackson has also hinted that his supporters might stay away from 
the polls in november if they perceived that he was being treated 
unfairly 
we define our friends by their willingness to be fair and to 
be just jackson said one thing about politics it does not go 
up and down it goes round and round anything that goes around 
comes around 
jacksons indication of possible party problems in the general 
election presents a real dilemma for democrats who are treading 
carefully on the issue 
if jackson is not treated well there could be a low turnout 
for the ticket black said if its not as high they need a 
larger share of the white vote

big bird and scads of preschoolers are delighted 
and oscar the grouch is predictably unimpressed perhaps the only 
ones nervous about fridays wedding of maria and luis are the 
creators of sesame street 
the marriage of two of the shows longtime characters represents 
the first attempt by the public television program now in its 19th 
season to show how romantic love works 
valeria lovelace the shows director of research said the 
staff found no books for preschoolers on love and marriage only 
death and divorce 
when interviews with 90 manhattan preschoolers showed that young 
children did not make the connection between love and marriage the 
general outline of the theme was born 
we wanted the wedding to make that connection for them said 
ms lovelace 
the message has been carefully cultivated since last december 
when maria and luis longtime friends and partners in the shows 
fixit shop realized that their feelings were changing as they 
cared for a sick kitten together 
i saw them kiss said vicky velasquez a 4yearold on a 
brooklyn playground full of chatter about the impending match so 
i know theyre happy 
we thought what could we say to 3yearolds about love 
said sonia manzano who plays maria and writes for the show and 
since kids see love in terms of physical things like kissing 
hugging giving flowers we showed maria and luis doing a lot of 
that 
dulcy singer executive producer said ms manzano who was 
married two years ago inspired the wedding when she told her she 
was thinking about having a baby the show was actually taped last 
january 
ms singer declined to say whether maria and luis who is played 
by emilio delgado would have a child after the wedding

cambodian guerrillas say they have 
broken vietnams control of thousands of villages in cambodia 
forcing vietnam to send soldiers to defend the villages 
the claim came in a khmer rouge radio broadcast in which 
guerrilla commanderinchief son sen reported on fighting from 
october 1987 to april 1988 the regions dry season a text of the 
broadcast was obtained today 
the communist khmer rouge with about 30000 guerrillas is the 
strongest of three groups opposing vietnams 9yearold occupation 
of cambodia khmer rouge claims are widely regarded as exaggerated 
in the broadcast a text of which was obtained today the 
guerrillas claimed they killed 11200 vietnamese soldiers and 
repeatedly attacked and dismantled or dispersed the vietnamese 
administrative networks in 4033 villages and 236 communes and 
attacked 23 townships and seven district towns 
vietnam responded by transferring an important part of its 
troops from the western battlefields bordering thailand the 
traditional area of fighting to the interior for village defense 
the broadcast said 
that allowed the khmer rouge who are based along the thai 
border to infiltrate more men into the interior it said 
therefore the vietnamese enemys strategy to seal off the 
western border of cambodia and prevent the khmer rouge from 
attacking it inside cambodia suffered a total setback the 
broadcast said 
a coalition of three cambodian groups is fighting to drive out 
the vietnamese who invaded cambodia in 1979 to drive out the khmer 
rouge the khmer rouge killed hundreds of thousands of people 
during their 197579 reign of terror 
the united states had assisted the republican side against the 
khmer rouge during the 197375 civil war

france today detonated its first 
underground nuclear bomb this year in the south pacific new 
zealand protested the explosion and said it could not have happened 
at a worse time 
the 50kiloton device equivalent to 50000 tons of dynamite 
went off at 5 am at a nuclear test site on the frenchcontrolled 
mururua atoll about onethird of the way between new zealand and 
the central american coast 
the explosion was the 92nd underground test there since france 
abandoned atmospheric testing in 1975 said to warwick smith 
director of the new zealand seismological observatory in wellington 
the new zealand government will keep expressing its strong 
concern about french nuclear testing whenever it occurs said new 
zealand foreign mnister russell marshall the timing could not be 
worse 
the testing has strained frances relations with countries of 
the south pacific which have declared the region a nuclearfree 
zone 
the french government in 1985 ordered the bombing of the 
greenpeace flagship rainbow warrior to prevent the vessel from 
leading a protest flotilla from the new zealand harbor of auckland 
to the mururua nuclear test site 
french relations with new zealand were severely strained by the 
bombing in which one crew member died the two french agents 
responsible for the attack were sentenced to exile on the hao atoll 
in the south pacific but since have returned to france despite of 
strong objections from new zealand

the pentagon has serious deficiencies in 
the way it manages the safety of its research programs into 
chemical and biological warfare a senate subcommittees staff 
report maintains 
the review found inadequate regulations lax safety 
enforcement and documented safety lapses said the report by the 
majority staff of the senate governmental affairs oversight 
subcommittee 
the study released wednesday noted that it did not examine 
the current safety practices of particular facilities conducting 
research nor does it reach final conclusions as to whether 
research is being conducted in a safe manner 
air force maj randy morger a pentagon spokesman said today 
that defense department officials hadnt seen the report we need 
to look at it carefully but were greatly concerned when there are 
questions from any corner about possible safety issues in programs 
overseen by the department of defense 
the united states recently began building new chemical weapons 
after halting the program in 1969 the nation produces no germ 
weapons and has unilaterally renounced the use of biological 
weapons but does conduct research into chemical weapons that might 
be used against american troops 
sen carl levin dmich chairman of the subcommittee said he 
plans to hold hearings later this year to discuss the pentagons 
safety practices in the two research fields 
the study noted that us spending on the programs has increased 
sharply during president reagans two terms from about 63 million 
in 1980 to 348 million in 1986 
the number of laboratories involved in research has also 
increased the study found there are about 150 labs doing 
pentagonsponsored research in chemical and germ weapons 
the subcommittee staff said it was unable to locate a 
comprehensive safety program that is a readily identifiable 
set of safety regulations and an office with overall safety 
responsibilities 
in the biological weapons area the review found that there is 
no comprehensive set of safety regulations for research with 
biological warfare agents and toxins no emphasis on safety in 
the contractor program and no office that monitors contractor 
safety 
for chemical weapons the approach is better although it also 
appears to have major shortcomings the study said the 
military has a wide number of safety steps but many are violated

a soviet newspaper has painted a highly 
sympathetic portrait of andrei d sakharov and yelena bonner 
countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as 
traitors by the staterun media 
but the account in moscow news only indirectly mentioned the 
nearly seven years sakharov spent in forced internal exile for 
criticizing the soviet drive into afghanistan indicating that 
topic is still too sensitive 
in its latest issue the weekly devoted its entire back page to 
describing the home life of sakharov 66 the 1975 nobel peace 
prize winner and said the words most often heard in his 
seventhfloor moscow apartment are help me 
sakharovs apartment on a major thoroughfare has been a mecca 
for soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed to 
return from exile in the closed city of gorky in december 1986 
since then sakharov who was one of the creators of his 
nations hydrogen bomb has vocally supported soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachevs reform campaign but has called for the liberation 
of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of 
human rights 
past soviet reports published before gorbachev became soviet 
leader accused bonner of marrying sakharov for his money and said 
the couple lived in oriental luxury amid scandals between 
spouses 
moscow news depicted the couple as living peacefully and 
frugally eating cabbage beet soup potatoes and other simple 
fare and marveled that sakharov a member of the prestigious 
academy of sciences always does the dishes himself 
while sakharov was in exile in the closed city of gorky the 
author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and 
scandalridden existence came to ask for an interview moscow news 
said 
sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed 
that he write an apology for all the lies that were published 
the paper said 
it reported that when the unidentified author refused sakharov 
said its too bad that duels are abolished in our times and 
slapped him 
sakharov has been quoted numerous times by soviet media since 
his return from exile but the article in moscow news was the 
longest devoted to him so far 
but most of the newspapers circulation is among foreign 
tourists and readers abroad so relatively few soviets would see 
the sakharov article as well as appearing in russian moscow news 
also prints editions in english french and other languages

train crewmen involved in a fiery conrail crash 
suffered from lack of sleep and could have unwittingly dozed off 
while still performing basic duties an expert on work schedules 
said today 
donald i tepas an industrial psychologist from the university 
of connecticut reviewed the six mens hours for the national 
transportation safety board investigation into the jan 14 accident 
two conrail trains one hauling coal and the other hauling 
trailervans smashed headon at thompsontown killing the engineer 
and the brakeman on both trains and derailing all five locomotives 
damage was estimated at 5 million 
after examining the work schedules of the crew members 
involved in the thompsontown accident im quite comfortable in 
concluding that many or all of the crew members involved were 
suffering from chronic sleep deprivation tepas said in remarks 
prepared for an ntsb hearing today 
a normal manifestation of this state is brief or extended 
periods of sleep some of which workers themselves may not be aware 
of 
during such periods he said people can react to signals 
presented to them 
the industrial psychologist blamed erratic work schedules 
harsh monotonous work environments and a failure to instruct 
workers in dealing with fatigue 
given current approaches to rail operations and the use of 
human resources there is little doubt in my mind that rail crews 
often fall asleep on the job he said 
during the opening day of testimony wednesday neither of the 
two survivors said they received any warning before the headon 
collision or saw or heard the other train approaching 
donald l hull conductor on the train carrying the 
trailervans testified the accident occurred when a dispatcher 
switched his train to another track before receiving a signal that 
the coal train had stopped 
hull a 35year conrail veteran said there are no strict rules 
for the dispatcher to go by 
james nearhoof the dispatcher testified that he had perceived 
no indication that one of the trains had gone through a stop signal 
jerry l haselbarth 33 the conductor of the coal train said 
he received a report from rockville police on the day of the wreck 
that the trains rear brakes were sticking he then stopped the 
train and corrected the situation 
shortly before the accident hull said he felt the train 
decelerate rapidly but he does not remember anyone applying the 
emergency brakes 
hull said he then saw the brakeman on his train charles s 
desantis fall from the lead locomotive 
i knew something was wrong he said it all happened so 
fast it didnt register that we were hitting anyone i thought 
everything was caving in i was just holding on 
toxicology tests showed a small amount of marijuana present in 
haselbarths urine but he testified he was not under the influence 
of drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash 
throughout the hearing questions arose on the amount of sleep 
rail workers get before they must report for duty 
hull reported that he had had about 4 hours of sleep before 
beginning his shift on the day of the accident 
haselbarth said he thought he had slept for just one or two 
hours the night before he reported to work for the fatal run but 
added he felt rested from the previous nights sleep 
the railroad has complete 100 percent control of your life 
you dont he said

a group of public interest lawyers say they 
are alarmed that only onequarter of the illegal aliens whose 
amnesty applications have been denied are filing appeals 
many of the rejected applicants may be confused by the letters 
of denial from the immigration and naturalization service attorney 
susan alva said wednesday 
these denial letters are three pages all in english said 
ms alva an attorney with the public counsel an organization 
financed by the los angeles county and beverly hills bar 
associations for many immigrants theyre just about impossible 
to understand 
but joe thomas director of the ins regional processing facility 
in laguna niguel said many of those denied amnesty under the 1986 
immigration reform act may be choosing not to appeal because they 
realize they will not succeed the deadline for seeking amnesty was 
midnight may 4 
many denials were issued because applicants were ineligible 
disqualified by criminal records or because of fraudulent 
applications he said to qualify illegal aliens had to prove that 
they had lived in the united states continuously beginning jan 1 
1982 
as of may 7 4047 denials had been sent to amnesty applicants 
in the agencys western region which includes california nevada 
hawaii arizona and guam of those 1001 have appealed 
those rejected have just 30 days to appeal a process that costs 
50 
federal officials argued the applicants were able to fill out 
english applications and should be able to deal with denial letters 
in english 
theyve been treated fairly said william s king jr 
director of immigration reform for the western region 
if they amnesty applicants have a problem with 
interpretation of their denials they can get help from the same 
people who helped them file their applications he said

five people trying to cash in on gold 
fever were arrested today on charges of running a treasurehunting 
scam that fleeced 17 million from 700 investors state officials 
said 
this was a treasure salvage company but the only treasure 
found was the money that was taken from the pockets of investors 
said state comptroller gerald lewis 
he announced the arrests at a joint news conference with 
statewide proscutor peter antonacci and commissioner tim moore of 
the florida department of law enforcement whose offices helped in 
the probe 
lewis said the three agencies also are investigating as many as 
15 other treasurehunting operations seeking investors with 
treasure fever most of the operations are in florida but a 
few are out of state 
most of those under investigation have been trading on the 
success of treasure hunter mel fisher whose find of the spanish 
galleon nuestra senora de atocha was worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars 
in this case the people bought a ship from mel fisher and 
they bought apparently a small amount of treasure so they could 
show this and use it and use mel fishers name lewis said 
arrested and charged with multiple counts of fraud securities 
fraud sale of unregistered securities and racketeering were jack 
r donovan 43 of deltona donald r durant 69 of new orleans 
allen c jones 41 and his wife elizabeth jones 39 of orlando 
and ernest rice 64 also of orlando 
they were indicted may 5 by a grand jury the indictment states 
the alleged scam involved donovans tesoro usa jones tesoro ltd 
and world treasure finders inc 
lewis said the operators claimed they found three wrecks and 
that treasure would be sold to a museum in orlando none of which 
was true 
at its very best treasurehunting is a risky business lewis 
said he pointed out that it took fisher years to find his fortune 
and his son and daughterinlaw were killed during the effort 
frankly in my opinion if a person wants to do this theyd be 
better off getting a boat going out in the water taking their 
money and throwing it overboard lewis said 
theyre as likely to have that turn into treasure pop back up 
to the surface as they are investing in one of these bogus 
operations he said and theyll come out actually a little bit 
better because they would have had a nice boat ride in the 
process

a geology professor demonstrating an 
instrument for measuring radioactivity to a high school class 
accidentally found a longabandoned canister containing radium 
officials said 
the canister posed little danger and no injuries were reported 
said al warlick director of public affairs for the state division 
of crime control and public safety 
the canister was discovered tuesday when geologist john 
callahan who had shown a science class how a geiger counter 
reacted to uranium rocks and put the instrument against the 
classroom wall to show normal readings instead of remaining 
silent the device went off 
behind the wall was a storeroom where officials found a canister 
marked army corps of engineers and dated 1944 
the canister had apparently been on a shelf since the school 
opened in 1965 watauga high school principal jim day said it was 
bought along with three boxes of other scientific instruments more 
than 20 years ago by a teacher he said 
the device which contained a small amount of radium was used 
for checking the moisture in soil state radiation experts said it 
was probably used before building roads 
a team of physicists from the state examined the device warlick 
said it was to be analyzed later this week to determine how to 
dispose of it 
warlick said his office received numerous telephone calls 
wednesday from news media representatives who heard rumors that a 
nuclear accident had occurred

americans have become more casual about 
cholesterol and good nutrition in general according to a 
prevention magazine survey issued today that shows a decline in 
health practices for the first time in five years 
we dont know whether this years score represents a temporary 
setback on the way to further progress or whether it is an early 
warning sign said thomas dybdahl director of the private 
publications socalled prevention index 
the 1988 score is 648 out of a possible 100 down from 652 
last year but still 33 points above 1984 when the first index 
was compiled 
the latest sampling found that more americans are using smoke 
detectors and getting strenuous exercise but falling behind in the 
area of good nutrition 
for example the number saying they are making efforts to limit 
highcholesterol foods fell from 46 percent in the 1987 report to 
42 percent and there also was a fourpoint decline in the number 
who said they make an effort to get adequate vitamins and minerals 
from 63 percent to 59 percent 
one clear message from this years survey is that the spread 
of good health habits is not automatic dybdahl said at a news 
conference 
people may know more than ever about good health but they may 
not be acting on what they know in key areas such as diet 
exercise and weight control there is still much room for 
improvement 
dr james michael mcginnis director of the federal governments 
office of disease prevention and health promotion said the survey 
is the only one to track the same data over a fiveyear period 
the sharpest gains from the 1984 report were the 57 percent who 
reported wearing seat belts now compared with 19 percent then and 
the 82 percent who say they have a smoke detector in their home 
compared with 67 percent then 
the biggest drop was in those who said they obey the speed limit 
from 61 percent in 1984 to 55 percent 
the emmaus pabased magazine has retained louis harris amp 
associates for the past five years to poll americans on their 
practices in 21 healthrelated areas ranging from not smoking to 
exercising to using a smoke detector in the home and wearing auto 
seat belts 
the same questions have been asked each year to give an accurate 
yeartoyear comparison and relative weights assigned to each of 
the 21 areas for example not smoking is assigned the highest 
ranking a 978 on a scale of oneto10 
the current years report was based on telephone interviews 
conducted with 1250 randomly selected adults nov 1125 humphrey 
taylor president of louis harris and associates acknowledged the 
surveys 3 percent margin of error could call into question 
yeartoyear changes that are within that margin 
taylor said however that the theoretical chance for error is 
largely overriden because consistent trends tracked over the 
fiveyear sampling period give added credence to the figures 
reported in any one year

a fire that gutted the top floor of the 
building where the louisiana purchase was signed in 1803 was 
apparently touched off by workers doing repair work a fire 
official said today 
wednesdays fire which raged out of control for two hours 
destroyed or damaged priceless artifacts and threatened the 
nations oldest roman catholic cathedral next door 
the blaze destroyed 18th century french furniture stored in the 
upper floor and consumed the cupola atop the threestory cabildo a 
spanishstyle gray stucco building with a slate roof officials 
said 
no injuries were reported 
fire chief william mccrossen said today that workers repairing 
the roof and waterproofing the stucco walls apparently touched off 
the fire we think its tied up to the restoration he said 
there was speculation that a soldering iron used in repairing 
metal flashing touched off timbers that originally came down the 
mississippi river as flatboats the mansard roof and the top floor 
were added in 1847 using timbers salvaged from the river barges 
theres all the cultural heritage of louisiana in that 
building it makes me want to cry said james f sefcik museum 
director of the 193yearold landmark in new orleans french 
quarter 
smoke and water stained and soaked contents of the first and 
second floors where paintings tapestries doll and fan 
collections mardi gras memorabilia pottery and other items were 
on display officials said 
next to independence hall in philadelphia this is the most 
historic building in america said sam wilson a new orleans 
architect who renovated the cabildos interior 20 years ago 
the cause of the fire remained uncertain but wilson said the 
building remained structurally sound and could be repaired 
an estimate of damages was not immediately available the 
building alone was assessed at 50 million and is insured said 
sefcik 
every painting every artifact suffered some water or smoke 
damage sefcik said 
france and the united states signed the louisiana purchase 
inside the threestory building in 1803 it also was the repository 
for a death mask of napoleon and other priceless antiques and 
artifacts the bronze death mask was saved 
the marquis de lafayette stayed at the cabildo as a guest and 
pierre lafitte brother of the notorious buccaneer jean lafitte 
was jailed there for smuggling 
firefighters managed to keep the flames from spreading to the 
adjacent st louis cathedral which remained undamaged except for 
some melted copper on the outside 
built in 1794 st louis cathedral is the oldest active roman 
catholic cathedral in the united states pope john paul ii 
celebrated mass there when he visited new orleans last september 
the cabildo was built a year later and served as the seat of 
louisiana territorial government for france spain the confederacy 
and the united states the building which has been used as a 
museum since world war i was closed recently to tourists because 
of exterior renovations

the vatican today said it was shocked at 
what paraguays decision to cancel a meeting between pope john paul 
ii and an opposition political group next week 
the chief vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said the action 
announced wednesday by paraguayan president gen alfredo 
stroessner latin americas longestruling military chief hindered 
the exercise of the pastoral mission of the holy father 
stroessner cited grounds of security for canceling the meeting 
scheduled for tuesday in the paraguayan capital of asuncion he 
also charged the group would use a religious encounter for 
political ends 
the group called constructors of society has about 350 members 
and includes politicians peasant farmers catholic laymen and 
lawyers 
it was the first time in john pauls 37 trips abroad that a 
foreign statesman interfered with his schedule but the church in 
paraguay said it would try to switch the meeting site from a 
governmentcontrolled site to one under direct church control 
this morning john paul traveled from cochabamba in central 
bolivia to sucre another centrally located city known for its 
spanishcolonial architecture and its many churches 
crowds lined five deep to welcome the pope along a 2mile 
motorcade on a clear mild day greeting john paul in this 
university city 9150 feet above sea level was 88yearold 
germanborn cardinal jose clemente maurer the retired archbishop 
of sucre and this countrys only cleric of cardinal rank 
in his homily at an openair mass the pope praised european 
missionaries who have worked in bolivia for nearly 500 years 
saying they have strived to maintain the cultural identity of the 
bolivian people who are mostly of native indian descent 
on wednesday night john paul addressed 22000 young people 
gathered in a soccer stadium in cochabamba gateway to a large 
cocaineproducing region 
bolivia is a major source of the refined cocaine that reaches 
the united states and bolivians themselves are becoming addicts in 
increasing numbers 
the pope dressed in a red cape and white scullcap first warned 
against marxism then told his audience to avoid the temptation of 
easy riches through drug trafficking 
be alert not to be seduced by doctrines that try to justify 
violence and hate that reduce members of the human family to 
simple factors of historical evolution and that place them in a 
class struggle he said 
he went on do not fall either into that selfish and false 
flight of seeking irrational satisfaction of appetites abuse of 
alcohol drugs the absence of all moral norms in sexual conduct 
and the temptation of easy riches through drug trafficking 
the youths cheered and applauded and waved vatican and bolivian 
flags 
the pope clearly enjoyed the youth rally where he was greeted 
by native folk dances and songs the young people lighted candles 
in the gathering darkness and sang happy birthday to you john 
paul will be 68 on may 18 
muchas gracias the beaming pontiff said this was one of 
the most beautiful ceremonies ive ever seen 
paraguay whose military regime has been in office since 1954 
is the last country the pontiff is to visit on his 12day 
fourcountry tour 
paraguay and chile have the only remaining military regimes in 
south america an openair mass in chile which the pope visited in 
1987 flared into a riot between police and foes of president

us and soviet negotiators today reached 
agreement on all the technical issues that caused the senate to 
postpone debate on a nuclear missile treaty before the moscow 
summit a senior us official said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
reagan administration would report the results of secretary of 
state george p shultzs meetings with soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze to the senate on friday 
the negotiators had disagreed over monitoring compliance with 
the treaty to scrap all american and soviet medium and 
shorterrange missiles president reagan and soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev signed the accord last dec 8 
it was not known whether the senate would accept the agreement 
worked out over two days in geneva shultz already has predicted 
further problems might arise in carrying out an unprecedented 
arrangement for onsite inspection of us and soviet missile 
plants and bases 
he refused to criticize the soviets as some senators had done 
and suggested the difficulties were the logical outcome of 
grappling with new verification procedures 
shultz flies to brussels on friday to report to the north 
atlantic treaty organization on his talks 
the dispute over how far american inspectors may go and what 
they may look at caused the us senate on monday to postpone 
consideration of the treaty the moscow summit is scheduled for may 
29june 2 
while shultz and shevardnadze discussed the middle east the 
iraniraq war and other regional issues their senior arms control 
advisers worked on the technical issues 
maynard glitman who negotiated the intermediate nuclear forces 
or inf treaty led the us team col gen nikolai chervov an 
arms control expert of the soviet armed forces headed the soviet 
delegation 
the armscontrol specialists reportedly reached a tentative 
agreement on the verification issues wednesday night 
on wednesday the two ministers held very businesslike and 
constructive talks and made progress in some areas state 
department spokesman charles redman said the two met twice in the 
afternoon and evening 
one of their first tasks was to instruct their arms control 
negotiators to conduct separate talks to try to resolve outstanding 
issues 
the senate had been due to begin debate on the treaty this week 
but postponed it indefinitely after the disputes arose 
two principal stumbling blocks reportedly were among the issues 
settled wednesday one deals with us demands to inspect soviet 
missile containers big enough to hold only a stage of a rocket the 
other involves how much access us inspectors will have to soviet 
missile plants and bases 
in another sign of progress the two sides agreed on wednesday 
to exchange notes on futuristic weapons the aim is to persuade 
sen sam nunn dga the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee and other critics that the ban would apply to 
intermediaterange weapons that have not been developed yet 
the two sides also discussed prospects for a treaty reducing 
intercontinental nuclear forces in a group headed by presidential 
arms control adviser paul nitze and chief soviet arms control 
negotiatior alexei obukhov 
shultz and shevardnadze centered their talks wednesday on 
scheduling and logistical arrangements for the summit the two men 
also discussed human rights on wednesday redman said but he did 
not provide details 
the pact on intermediaterange missiles is unprecedented in its 
provisions for onsite inspection to guard against infractions it 
also is the first ussoviet agreement to eliminate an entire 
category of nuclear weapons 
under its provisions the soviets would destroy 683 missiles and 
the americans 364 all their rockets with ranges of 315 to 3125 
miles

an american airlines boeing 727 lost 
cabin pressure and had to make an unscheduled landing because of a 
15inch crack in the fuselage an airline spokesman said today 
the cause of the crack near the right wheel well could take 
several weeks of study to determine said american spokesman steve 
mcgregor the incident occurred monday and federal investigators 
examined the plane wednesday 
a boeing 737 lost the top of its fuselage less than two weeks 
ago over hawaii but mcgregor said the incidents were not related 
american flight 984 with 105 passengers and seven crew members 
was en route monday from chicago to philadelphia when it suddenly 
lost cabin pressure 
cabin oxygen masks were deployed automatically before the 
landing there were no injuries and no apparent disruption at 
detroit metropolitan airport in romulus mich after the landing 
officials said no emergency was declared during the landing 
mcgregor said 
the aircraft was flown to americans maintenance center in 
tulsa okla and investigators from the federal aviation 
administration and the national transportation safety board were 
called in 
an investigator has obtained the portion of the aircraft with 
a crack in it and has sent it to our metallurgical lab here in 
washington and it is being examined by our lab people ntsb 
spokesman alan pollock said today in washington 
he said investigators would try to determine whether the crack 
was due by metal fatigue or some other cause such as an impact on 
the fuselage 
he declined to say whether the crack could have been hazardous 
to the aircraft and its passengers 
after the federal inspection american replaced the cracked 
fuselage section and was testing the repaired jet today mcgregor 
said 
mcgregor said the plane had made 39983 takeoffs and landings 
and for a 727 thats not a high number of cycles 
the problem occurred less than two weeks after a 19yearold 
aloha airlines boeing 737 lost part of its upper fuselage while 
flying over hawaii killing a flight attendant and injuring 61 
passengers and crew members the cause was suspected to be 
structural failure 
but mcgregor discounted the similarity between the two incidents 
what happened to our jet was in no way related to what 
happened in hawaii he said

the senate today voted down an effort to ban 
most us underground nuclear testing rejecting claims by 
supporters of the ban that it would help stem the atomic arms race 
the chamber voted 5739 to kill the proposed ban as it worked 
through a pentagon budget bill 
we must maintain unquestionable confidence in our nuclear 
deterrent and our experts tell us that this requires continued 
testing said sen strom thurmond rnc a chief opponent 
sen mark hatfield rore the sponsor of the ban said no 
other issue addresses so clearly the runaway technology which is 
the lifeblood of the arms race 
the house has approved an underground test ban in its version of 
the defense bill meaning the issue will have to be resolved by a 
housesenate conference committee that will resolve differences 
between the two measures 
the house passed its defense bill wednesday and the chairman of 
the house armed services committee said the us military is 
stronger and more capable now than when president reagan took 
office despite reagans recurring complaints about not getting 
enough money for the pentagon 
by almost any measure our armed services are better than they 
were in 1981 said rep les aspin dwis the most dramatic 
increase is the quality of people which is much much better 
aspin commented shortly after the house voted 252172 for a 
pentagon budget which will be the last defense budget of reagans 
eightyear presidency 
house approval split along party lines with majority democrats 
supporting the bill and republicans opposing it reagan didnt like 
it either joining complaints by house republicans that the bill 
unfairly restricts his arms control policies and star wars program 
the house measure bans star wars tests that violate the 
socalled narrow interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty and bars the purchase of any nuclear weapons that 
violate the numerical limits in the unratified 1979 salt ii nuclear 
arms treaty 
the senate by a 5145 margin rejected an attempt wednesday to 
add the salt ii restriction to its defense bill 
reagan opposes both restrictions and is also unhappy with the 
35 billion approved by the house for the strategic defense 
initiative as star wars is formally known the senate voted 
wednesday for 46 billion 
reagan wanted 48 billion for star wars next year compared 
with the current sdi budget of 39 billion 
aspin said he couldnt understand the presidential complaints 
i dont believe the president has any reason to be upset i think 
its a good bill we gave the president a lot of what he wanted 
both the house and senate bills authorize 2995 billion worth 
of defense spending in the fiscal year starting oct 1 a slight 
reduction from the current 300 billion pentagon budget 
the measures would essentially freeze defense spending for a 
fourth straight year following four large annual increases in 
reagans first term 
no increases are likely in the future aspin predicted i 
would guess that youre looking at perhaps a freeze or maybe a 
decline of 1 or 2 percent for the foreseeable future which is the 
next three or four years no matter who is elected president 
several factors will contribute to the reluctance to increase 
defense budgets said aspin first there are the worries about 
the federal budget deficit then second you have the fact that the 
soviets appear to the american public to be less threatening under 
mikhail gorbachev so theres less a push because of fear 
you also have the fact that there are other fears like 
drugs he said noting that the house bill orders reagan to use 
the us military in the fight against illegal drug smuggling 
in addition there is a growing perception that national 
security depends on other things than simply military might that 
it needs to include economic strength he said 
while the house measure restricts reagans arms control policies 
and star wars it granted his proposals for a vast variety of 
weapons 
that total includes 180 f16 jet fighter planes 84 fa18 jets 
42 f15 jets a dozen f14 jets three new navy destroyers two 
more attack submarines one trident missilefiring sub the first 
of the new seawolf class subs and 611 m1 tanks 
the senate decision on star wars came as the chamber voted 5048 
against a deep reduction in the 5yearold program 
that vote defeated a proposal by sen bennett johnston dla 
to reduce the sdi budget to about 38 billion and devote the extra 
750 million to the space shuttle and a space station

bank customers with loans pegged to the prime 
rate are about to feel the impact of the rising cost of money but 
economists say a big increase in interest rates is unlikely this 
year 
the first spike in the prime rate since the october stock market 
crash was announced wednesday by major banks the rise from 85 
percent to 9 percent heralded a period of more expensive loans for 
purchases ranging from plant machinery to homes and cars 
the prime rate reflects the banks costs of borrowing money and 
trails more subtle increases in other interest rates but the rate 
is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for 
calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types of 
fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans including popular 
homeequity loans 
stock traders reacted badly to the rate rise partly because it 
renewed memories of the higher interest rates that preceded the 
stock market crash the dow jones industrial average fell 3780 
points to a threemonth low of 196585 
the widely watched index partly recovered by late this morning 
up nearly 10 points to the 1976 level in the bond market a 
sensitive barometer of interest rates prices were little changed 
many economists said they didnt believe interest rates would 
rise much further largely because the economy could stumble badly 
if borrowing costs increased substantially 
these economists argue that federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan a reagan administration appointee who has wide power to 
influence interest rates doesnt want to make any sudden move to 
tighten credit especially in an election year 
but the fed also wants to heed inflationary warning signs that 
have appeared notably a 14year low in the unemployment rate 
reported last week by the labor department 
it wants to tap the brakes a little bit rather than slam them 
on in a great fury said robert brusca chief economist for nikko 
securities international inc in new york 
john wilson chief economist at bank of america in san 
francisco said clearly were on an upward move in interest 
rates and theyll continue to move upward but i think theyll 
flatten out 
david blitzer chief economist for standard amp poors corp the 
investment research and creditrating concern said he believed the 
prime rate would stay at 9 percent perhaps moving to 95 percent 
by june 
but blitzer said he didnt believe the fed would move to nudge 
rates much higher than they are now 
i think this year the fed wants to keep the economy 
growing he said the fed injected billions of dollars in 
reserves into the banking system after the october crash to 
forestall a possible recession but in recent months evidence of 
surprisingly strong economic growth has shifted concern to rising 
inflation 
this concern has been most evident in the bond market where 
interest rates have been rising in anticipation that the fed would 
tighten its credit policies economists say its clear the fed has 
moved recently to nudge interest rates higher by controlling the 
amount of money in the banking system 
sandra shaber an economist at the futures group a 
washingtonbased forecasting firm said the prime rate increase 
would have a broader impact on consumers now than in years past 
because it no longer is simply a benchmark for loans to bank 
corporate customers 
once upon a time the impact would have been limited she 
said but now because of the increased use of homeequity loans 
and other adjustable rates even people who have current debt 
outstanding they feel the effects their financing costs rise it 
squeezes their discretionary spending in general

china the worlds leading hog producer has 
ended pork rationing according to an agriculture department report 
a chinese agriculture official privately stated that pork 
rationing in beijing had stopped being enforced the departments 
foreign agricultural service said wednesday other officials said 
that pork rationing had ended throughout the country though no 
official announcement has confirmed this 
china began rationing pork in most major cities last fall in 
response to shortages pork traditionally supplies about 80 percent 
of the total animal protein in the chinese diet 
the pork shortages that led to the rationing did not however 
affect chinas ability to supply hogs to its limited export markets 
primarily hong kong the report said in fact the country 
has had a surplus of hogs for export to hong kong but increases in 
hog trade between the two countries has been limited by a chinese 
export quota 
an end to rationing shows that chinese agricultural officials 
believe the tight pork supply situation is now being resolved as 
producers respond to lower feed prices higher pork prices and 
government incentives to promote larger production the report said 
it also is an indication that many urban consumers are willing 
to pay more for the higherquality free market pork instead of 
enduring the cheaper fattier meat that has been sold at lower 
prices in state markets the report said 
a usda study last year showed that china had a 1983 yearend 
inventory of 2985 million hogs compared with 558 million in the 
united states 
but with more than five times the number of hogs chinas pork 
production was less than double the us output 132 million 
metric tons to 76 million tons the usda study said a metric ton 
is about 2205 pounds 
the reason it took only six months for an american farmer to 
raise a 243pound hog ready for slaughter while a newborn chinese 
pig can take from eight to 18 months to reach a comparable 
slaughter weight 
also the study said the average us hog will produce a 
dressedout carcass of about 173 pounds compared with the chinese 
carcass of about 140 pounds

the world health organization on thursday endorsed 
a massive immunization campaign to protect all children against 
polio and eradicate the crippling disease by the year 2000 
only half the worlds children are immunized and 275000 new 
cases of polio occur each year mainly in developing countries 
according to who 
a committee of the 166nation un agency passed by consensus a 
resolution calling for the eradication program approval by whos 
full assembly is expected friday at the final session of the 
agencys annual meeting 
polio is the major disease with the best chance of being stamped 
out the resolution said it asked whos director general to seek 
funds needed for the campaign and urged all countries to step up 
surveillance to permit quick identification of outbreaks 
eradication is expected to require doubling the 500 million the 
organization spends each year on immunization programs against six 
major childhood diseases in the third world including polio the 
others are measles diphtheria whooping cough tetanus and 
tuberculosis 
about 10 million people worldwide have been crippled by polio 
and one patient in 10 dies of the disease who said 
india has reported the most cases of polio in recent years 
14629 in 1986 afghanistan reported 1843 cases vietnam 1600 
china 1537 bangladesh 810 and brazil 665 
who estimates that only one case in 10 is reported to its 
headquarters in geneva switzerland 
eliminating polio will be an appropriate gift together with 
the eradication of smallpox to the next century the resolution 
said 
who led a global drive that eradicated smallpox by the late 
1970s 
polio became rare in developed countries after us scientists 
developed two vaccines in the 1950s who expects to eliminate the 
polio virus from the americas europe and the western pacific by 
1990 
the organization says it costs 10 to immunize a child against 
polio and other major diseases although the cost can be higher to 
reach children in remote areas

ethiopian rebels claimed thursday that 
they destroyed some aircraft when they shelled the airport at 
asmara ethiopias second largest city and a provincial northern 
capital 
the airport was heavily damaged by the accurate shelling 
the eritrean peoples liberation front said over its clandestine 
radio in a broadcast monitored in nairobi an as yet unknown 
number of aircraft were destroyed 
rebel spokesman tesfai ghermazien in a telephone interview from 
his washington dc office said the planes probably were military 
aircraft but he had no further information 
asmara is an important military air base as well as a pickup 
point for cargo planes ferrying relief food to ethiopian drought 
victims 
president mengistu haile mariams government rarely comments on 
claims of the separatist rebels who are waging wars in the 
provinces of tigre and eritrea there was no way to independently 
confirm the rebel report 
western diplomats and relief officials in the ethiopian capital 
addis ababa said they had heard nothing about an attack but they 
said little information has come out of the region since the 
government expelled foreign aid workers from eritrea and tigre on 
april 6 
eritrea and tigre in the extreme north of ethiopia are the 
hardest hit by the current drought a massive westernfinanced 
relief operation has been crippled by the expulsion of relief 
workers but the government says the expulsions are for security 
reasons 
asmara eritreas capital is 670 miles north of addis ababa 
the airport is about 1 miles from the town and is guarded by 
troops in trenches along its perimeter 
in the past week the rebels and the government have both 
claimed victories in battles being fought within 60 miles of asmara 
rebels have shelled asmara airport periodically over the past 
few years

uppercrust englishman harold kim philby who 
for nearly three decades spied for the soviets from the heights of 
british intelligence died a decorated kgb officer in moscow he 
was 76 
the foreign office said it learned from the soviet embassy in 
london that philby had died wednesday the embassy gave no cause of 
death four months ago philby said he was suffering from 
arrhythmia a heart irregularity 
the most damaging double agent in modern british history the 
suave handsome philby sent many western agents to their deaths 
with three nowdeceased colleagues he met at cambridge 
university in the 1930s donald maclean guy burgess and anthony 
blunt philby turned britains most precious secrets over to the 
kremlin 
by extension he betrayed the united states too since he was 
privy to topsecret information exchanged by the two allies 
tass the official soviet news agency today eulogized philby as 
an outstanding master spy who helped defend the soviet union 
from western intelligence it did not say how or where he died 
tass said philby waged a direct battle against the special 
services of capitalist countries whose activity was directed 
against the soviet union against the movement for peace and 
progress 
philby was on his way to becoming head of british intelligence 
when he came under suspicion in 1951 when maclean and burgess 
who had been posted at the british embassy in washington fled to 
moscow 
philby was forced to resign from the service the following year 
but he continued to freelance for mi6 the british intelligence 
agency 
by the time he was unmasked as the third man who tipped off 
burgess and maclean in time for them to escape british punishment 
philby was settling into moscow as a senior kgb officer 
the macleanburgessphilby spy scandals damaged the exchange of 
intelligence information between britain and the united states for 
years but of perhaps even more profound impact in britain was that 
the establishments own could be traitors 
in 1979 blunts treachery was exposed publicly in exchange for 
information he had been allowed to escape disgrace to receive a 
knighthood and to serve as the queens art adviser for years 
philbys death was frontpage news in britain today the times 
and other papers referred to him as traitor philby 
there was no immediate comment from prime minister margaret 
thatchers government but legislator ted leadbitter of the 
socialist opposition labor party said philbys death brings an 
end i hope to the unhappiest period of betrayal of this century 
philby told phillip knightley of the times of london in january 
in his first and only press interview with a western reporter that 
he had no regrets except for personal friends he lost 
asked would you do it all again philby replied 
absolutely 
he said he had found peace that he was happy in his fourth 
marriage to a russian woman and felt moscow to be his home 
harold adrian russell philby was born on new years day 1912 in 
india where his father was a colonial official and was nicknamed 
kim after the boy spy hero of a rudyard kipling story 
his father was harry st john bridger philby an eccentric 
explorer of arabia who converted to islam and settled in beirut 
the lebanese capital 
later philby would write that he never felt patriotism toward 
any country 
at cambridge he fell under communisms spell in those days of 
depression and early fascism it was not unusual for idealistic 
young englishmen to look to moscow 
the western democracies in the 1930s were too weak and corrupt 
to fight nazi germany philby wrote in his autobiography my 
silent war published after he defected 
knightley said a secret philby guarded to the last was who first 
recruited him as a spy for the soviets in 1934 not long after he 
returned from vienna where he had been helping communists escape 
from the austrian authorities 
in 1940 philby joined british intelligence and rose to become 
head of its antisoviet section in 1949 he went to washington as 
britains liaison officer with the cia and fbi 
a decade after burgess and maclean fled to moscow evidence of 
philbys involvement in espionage with them continued to mount 
on jan 23 1963 while working as a journalist in beirut 
philby failed to pick up his third wife for a party six months 
later the soviet newspaper izvestia announced he was in moscow 
later philby claimed mi6 deliberately engineered his defection 
fearing embarrassment if he stood trial in england 
after an initial heros welcome in moscow philby sank into 
obscurity and confessed to knightley that he went through 
depression and began heavy drinking when he believed the kgb no 
longer had any use for him 
philby had several children one a son john lives in london 
johns wife said the family had no comment on philbys death

the national institutes of health will stop 
funding artificial heart research and will focus instead on smaller 
devices intended to assist rather than replace hearts according to 
a report published today 
while the artificial heart device seemed to work well the 
biology didnt work said dr claude lenfant director of the 
national heart lung and blood institute 
the human body just couldnt seem to tolerate it we were left 
wondering whether the idea of a permanent replacement will ever 
work lenfant said in an interview published in the atlanta 
constitution and the atlanta journal 
the decision means four institutions awarded contracts last year 
for artificial heart research will receive only about 1 million of 
the 5 million each was expecting over the next five years 
this is a tremendous setback for scientific advancement in the 
field said dr donald olsen head of artificial heart research 
at the university of utah which had received one of the contracts 
he said the decision will set back development of a permanent 
artificial heart for more than 10 years 
this does not mean the end of the artificial heart program it 
means we are taking a different approach it may take somewhat 
longer but it may also help us develop a device that works 
better lenfant said 
barney clark became the first recipient of an artificial heart 
dec 2 1982 in surgery performed at the university of utah by dr 
william devries he died the following march 
four other patients have received permanent artificial hearts 
three at humanaaudubon hospital in louisville ky where devries 
now works and one in stockholm sweden william schroeder was the 
longest survivor living almost two years with the jarvik7 
artificial heart 
all of the patients however suffered severe complications 
including strokes and major infections 
lenfant said reports about those problems were one reason the 
government decided to withdraw support for continued development 
instead the agency will focus its funding on smaller 
ventricular assist devices as stopgap measures for patients 
awaiting a transplanted human heart he said 
we believe it is time to try them in patients who need 
longterm support lenfant said 
so far such bridge devices have been been used only for a 
few weeks lenfant said the government wants to see if they will 
work for three or four years at a time 
the newspapers said the nih decision would be officially 
announced next week

forest service officials asked congress today 
for hot pursuit authority against heavily armed marijuana 
growers who forced the closure of 886000 acres of national forest 
land last year as unsafe for tourists and timber interests 
deputy forest service chief william l rice told a senate 
hearing that his 150 law enforcement agents need statutory 
authority to pursue fleeing marijuana farmers beyond the boundaries 
of national forests and grasslands especially in the far west 
where the problem is most acute 
his request was endorsed by sens tom harkin diowa and wyche 
fowler dga who said these marijuana gardens are protected by 
a marquis de sade torture chamber of devices intended to maim 
cripple or kill intruders 
rep ron wyden dore testifying at a senate agriculture 
subcommittee hearing said illicit marijuana cultivation is a 
problem of staggering proportions in the west 
wyden is chief sponsor of a bill that would grant forest service 
agents authority to conduct investigations searches seizures and 
arrests outside the boundaries of national forests if drug crimes 
originate there 
he said the agents are hamstrung under current law because 
they are authorized to go after these criminals but only as long 
as they remain within the boundaries of the federal forests 
wyden also proposed to stiffen federal penalties for 
unauthorized use of chemical herbicides and fertilizers in national 
forests and to increase the maximum penalties for marijuana 
cultivation on those lands which total 191 million acres in 44 
states puerto rico and the virgin islands 
frank g packwood a special agent in the trinityshasta 
national forest in california blamed the lack of hot pursuit 
authority on the poor success rate in prosecuting marijuana 
growers who have an estimated 14 billion in annual profits 
in 1986 packwood said 70 percent of californias 872 arrests 
for illegal marijuana farming went unprosecuted because of hampered 
investigations 
law enforcement has failed to establish a deterrent to 
cultivation activity and has become in the eyes of the grower just 
another business expense packwood said 
the subcommittee chaired by harkins heard testimony that 
marijuana growers are using a wide variety of sophisticated weapons 
to guard their farming plots in national forests including attack 
dogs who get their commands from radios mounted on their collars 
wyden said that during a raid on a drug lab near a national 
forest in southern oregon the josephine county sheriff seized a 
cache of weapons that could outfit a small army including 51 
machine guns semiautomatic rifles and other automatic weapons 
100000 rounds of ammunition and 150 pounds of gunpower

national forests 
however he said the agency also needs to speed up appeal 
procedures for recovery and rehabilitation activities that resulted 
from 1987s severe fire season in california and oregon it was 
this natural disaster that brought to our attention the need for 
special appeal procedures 
under the interim rule adopted today anyone may appeal 
decisions on recovery and rehabilitation activities that result 
from natural disasters such as wildfires flooding earthquakes 
and high winds he said 
those who appeal will be entitled to a onelevel appeal 
process which must be completed within 90 days robertson said 
previously appeal processes could be reviewed at two 
administrative levels 
an estimated 22 billion board feet of national forest timber 
were destroyed or damaged in california and oregon in the 1987 fire 
season with about 40 percent of that volume offered for sale he 
said 
a delay in firecaused salvage sales and related 
rehabilitation activities in california and oregon could result in 
unnecessary losses of valuable natural resources robertson said 
the fires disrupted the timber sale programs of several national 
forests he said as a result the economies of timberdependent 
communities in the burned areas could suffer from delays in salvage 
and rehabilitation work

hydroelectric power authority 
the dam 50 miles north of san salvador supplies 22 percent of

the outage of the system of these five transformers 
practically leaves the dam out of service for a while how long we 
cannot say melendez told a news conference

electricity with threehour daily cuts nationwide beginning 
wednesday the attack forced the authority to increase daily cuts 
to four hours melendez said

a swedish scientist won the 150000 tyler 
prize for environmental achievement for helping focus international 
attention on how air pollutants are warming earths climate by 
creating a greenhouse effect 
bert bolin 62 director of stockholms international 
meteorological institute will receive the money and a gold 
medallion friday night in los angeles the prize committee 
announced thursday 
committee spokesman howard stone said bolin helped lay the 
groundwork in the 1940s and 1950s for modern computerized weather 
forecasting but he was awarded the 1988 tyler prize for research 
done since the mid1950s on the chemistry of earths atmosphere and 
the effects of pollutants especially carbon dioxide produced by 
the burning of fossil fuels stone said 
carbon dioxide methane and certain other gases trap heat in 
earths atmosphere much like glass traps heat in a greenhouse 
scientists say this greenhouse effect will warm earths 
atmosphere significantly during the next century possibly causing 
sea levels to rise and triggering droughts crop failures and other 
environmental damage 
research by bolin who also is a meteorology professor at the 
university of stockholm and science adviser to swedens prime 
minister is of fundamental scientific importance the prize 
committee said 
he has been instrumental in determining how mans activities 
have drastically increased concentrations of carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere since the industrial revolution 
in a statement released by the committee bolin urged 
reassessment of energy policies asking how much coal oil and 
gas can we continue to burn in light of the mounting evidence of 
negative atmospheric effects 
the annual tyler prize administered by the university of 
southern california was established in 1973 by outdoor enthusiasts 
alice c tyler and her husband the late john c tyler founder of 
farmers insurance group 
tyler prizes worth nearly 2 million have been awarded to 23 
scientists on several occasions the committee named more than one

president reagan is mortified that his 
wednesday night endorsement of george bushs presidential candidacy 
may have been seen by some as merely lukewarm reagans spokesman 
said today 
he feels it was a very strong endorsement very appropriate 
sets the stage for him to talk about the vice president throughout 
the campaign said marlin fitzwater 
reagan gave bush a terse statement of support wednesday night 
mispronouncing the name of his vice president at one point but 
bush aides quickly expressed enthusiasm for the endorsement 
at the white house today fitzwater said any reports that the 
endorsement was merely lukewarm were most unfortunate he said 
of reagan he is mortified he thought the speech was terrific 
he wrote it himself he thought it was strong a full endorsement 
of his vice president who he thinks incredibly highly of 
reagan delivered the longawaited endorsement of his 1980 and 
1984 running mate at a republican fundraising dinner wednesday 
night telling his audience he would campaign as hard as i can 
for bush 
the president bestowing his approval on bushs campaign more 
than two weeks after the vice president mathematically clinched the 
gop nomination in the pennsylvania primary came in a brief three 
sentences at the conclusion of a 15minute speech 
while reagans backing was never in doubt the president had 
stuck to a promise to remain netural as long as there were other 
challengers bushs remaining rival pat robertson announced 
earlier wednesday that he would support bush 
during his speech reagan mentioned bush only three times 
mispronouncing his name on one of those occasions as george 
bosh 
but bush aides immediately stressed that they were pleased with 
reagans announcement no matter how brief 
its a total endorsement said bushs chief of staff craig 
fuller i would not look for what wasnt said i would look for 
what was said im fully satisfied i dont think it gets any 
better 
bushs press secretary stephen hart said it looks like an 
endorsement to me 
these guys love each other he added 
speaking at a 1500aplate banquet attended by more than 3000 
republicans reagan concluded a speech about the accomplishments of 
his administration with these words 
i intend to campaign as hard as i can my candidate is a 
former member of congress ambassador to china ambassador to the 
united nations director of the cia and national chairman of the 
republican party im going to work as hard as i can to make vice 
president george bush the next president of the united states 
in endorsing bush reagan said he was breaking a silence ive 
maintained for some time with regard to the presidential 
candidates 
earlier in the speech reagan said eight years ago george 
bush and i said to the american people the time is now it still 
is the story of america is one of people who have made their 
dreams come true by realizing that the time for action is always 
now 
it was in that reference that reagan mispronounced the name of 
his vice president 
bush was traveling to new mexico and california today for a 
sevenday campaign trip to the west 
reagans formal endorsement follows several weeks of jockeying 
among white house and bush campaign aides over a time and place for 
the announcement 
at the end of reagans speech bush and his wife barbara worked 
their way through the crowd on the floor to join the president and 
first lady nancy reagan at the podium reagan and bush held clasped 
hands aloft as hundreds of balloons were released from the ceiling 
bush who spoke before reagan praised the president saying 
you began a great national renewal 
senate republican leader bob dole whose own presidential bid 
was stopped in bushs march to the gop nomination displayed his 
sometimes barbed wit 
thank you thank you very much he said when he was 
applauded i was going to say i would accept the nomination but 
i think its already been spoken for 
i cant remember the guy who got it said dole 
robertson announced his suport for bush after a private session 
between the two at the white house claiming the race is pretty 
much over 
the former television minister has won only 46 delegates he 
said he would wait until monday before formally withdrawing to give 
his supporters a chance to win additional national convention seats 
at gop caucuses this weekend in arizona and virginia 
i didnt ask anything for myself i spoke about education and 
the need to bring the 1984 platform into line with the realities of 
1988 robertson said we definitely had a meeting of the minds 
on the platform 
robertsons campaign later said in a statement that robertson 
had said he was not withdrawing but that he would address his 
campaign status on monday

california democrats are likely to go for the 
favorite next month abandoning their longtime penchant for backing 
underdogs in presidential primaries pollsters say but the 
tradition may not succumb without a fight 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis is substantially ahead of 
jesse jackson in opinion polls most recently in a gallup survey 
this week giving dukakis 67 percent to 26 percent for jackson and 7 
percent undecided 
but if dukakis is the heavy favorite to win pollsters said in 
recent interviews jackson still may do better than his recent 
finishes perhaps well enough to boost his influence at the partys 
convention in atlanta 
i would be extremely surprised if jackson got over 40 
percent said ia lewis chief of polling for the los angeles 
times 
while that strong a showing is by no means assured pollsters 
say there are several reasons jackson could do well in california 
on june 7 one is demographics many of the voters fit the profile 
of jackson supporters another is history jackson who has found 
support from whites elusive did his best on that score in his 1984 
campaign with california whites 
yet another factor is a decreased expectation that jackson can 
win the nomination several analysts said dissatisfied democrats 
may be more likely to cast a protest vote for jackson when it 
appears he cannot actually win 
when you dont think jackson is a viable nominee he gets a 
better vote than when you do said lewis he noted that jacksons 
support from whites fell off after the wisconsin primary when he 
looked strong but after losing a series of landslides jackson got 
24 percent of the white vote in nebraska this week his secondbest 
showing among whites all year 
given the liberalism of many california democrats theres a 
number of people that would like to give him bargaining chips in 
atlanta by his showing well here people who may not want him to 
be president but want to give him some clout lewis said 
any added clout from second place would stem from vote totals 
rather than the delegate count the primary is a winnertakeall 
contest with delegates awarded only to the firstplace finisher in 
each congressional district 
pollsters stressed that a victory by jackson in california would 
be exceedingly difficult even with his plans to campaign heavily 
in the state blacks who have been giving him support in the 
90percent range made up only about 15 percent of the primary 
electorate in 1984 and jackson has not increased blacks share of 
the vote in most other states 
jackson in 1984 won four of the states 45 congressional 
districts and received 21 percent of the vote statewide 
conventional wisdom is that jackson should do better than four 
years ago but not dramatically said californiabased pollster 
mervin field he said jackson may be hurt by his recent losses 
while dukakis is fueled by his run of wins 
still lewis noted that california democrats have a history of 
backing the antiestablishment candidate california went for gary 
hart over frontrunner walter mondale in 1984 edward kennedy over 
president carter in 1980 favorite son gov jerry brown over carter 
in 1976 and george mcgovern over hubert humphrey in 1972 
added pollster gordon black the democratic party there is 
more liberal than the democratic party in the rest of the country 
john brennan a poll analyst for abc news noted that four years 
ago 45 percent of the democratic voters in california identified 
themselves as liberals 24 percent were under 30 and 40 percent 
were college graduates all groups in which jackson has done his 
best among white voters 
its got good demographics for jackson brennan said he 
said a 1984 abc news exit poll found that jackson got 13 percent of 
the white vote in california the only state that year in which he 
reached double digits 
that poll said 7 percent of the vote in 1984 was jewish and 
jackson has fared poorly among jews because of concern about his 
position on israel 
but homosexuals could make up 5 percent of the vote and may 
favor jackson because of dukakis resistance to homosexual couples 
as adoptive parents 
hispanics made up 9 percent of the electorate in 1984 in the abc 
poll jackson lost hispanics badly to the spanishspeaking dukakis 
in texas this year with 60 percent for dukakis and 20 percent for 
jackson in an abc poll 
still brennan noted that the 1984 california electorate was 
only 25 percent catholic and onethird blue collar groups that 
dukakis has been winning and the primary is closed meaning 
independents who have backed dukakis cant vote 
if the black vote reaches 20 percent and goes entirely to 
jackson he still would need 31 percent of the remainder to beat 
dukakis a level of nonblack votes that he has achieved only in 
one state this year vermont

democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis traded kind 
words with anglican archbishop desmond tutu of south africa today 
at the capitol one day after george bush finally got president 
reagans public promise to campaign as hard as i can for bush 
against dukakis this summer and fall 
reagans statement of support wednesday night was brief and he 
mispronounced bushs name once but white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said today it would be inaccurate to call the endorsement 
lukewarm and he said reagan is mortified that it may have been 
seen that way 
he feels it was a very strong endorsement very appropriate 
sets the stage for him to talk about the vice president throughout 
the campaign fitzwater said 
dukakis only remaining democratic rival jesse jackson brushed 
aside this weeks losses in nebraska and west virginia with his 
stock line that his candidacy is winning every day 
all three candidates were to campaign today in western states 
as the race pointed toward june 7 with its big delegate payoff 
from races in california new jersey montana and new mexico 
dukakis who has been criticized by bush for lacking foreign 
policy experience met for 30 minutes with tutu who was in 
washington to lobby for new sanctions aimed at ending apartheid in 
south africa 
the massachusetts governor told reporters he very strongly 
supported legislation to apply such sanctions tutu said we 
didnt have a point at which we disagreed 
i dont think we need to give an endorsement but we know we 
would be amongst friends and we would have very very powerful 
friends in the white house if we had a democrat occupying the white 
house tutu said 
dukakis standing with tutu praised your courage and your 
leadership 
tutu said god bless you 
on another foreign policy issue dukakis in answer to 
questions voiced reservations about a deal reported to be being 
worked out by the administration to have panama strongman manuel 
noriega leave office in exchange for dropping us drug indictments 
against him 
i dont think you drop indictments against drug pushers and 
people suspected of murder dukakis said 
he also was meeting with latin american ambassadors and making 
the rounds on capitol hill meeting with leaders including house 
speaker jim wright house majority leader tom foley senate 
majority leader robert byrd and house budget committee chairman 
william gray 
rep dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means 
committee said after meeting with dukakis that he was the 
candidate best able to lead our nation 
bush was formally given reagans endorsement at a pricey 
republican fundraiser in washington on wednesday night 
reagan had remained neutral during the fight for the republican 
nomination but the vice president has had a mathematical lock on 
the nomination since the pennsylvania primary last month the 
president said the time had come to break his silence 
i intend to campaign as hard as i can reagan said im 
going to work as hard as i can to make vice president george bush 
the next president of the united states 
the brief endorsement came at the end of a lengthy speech in 
which the president cited his administrations accomplishments 
reagan referred to bush by name three times at one point calling 
him george bosh 
bush who preceded the president at the podium praised reagan 
for your simple humanity your decency and your strength 
adding what an inspiration you have been to all of us 
after reagan spoke bush joined him and the two clasped hands 
and held them high while hundreds of red white and blue balloons 
were released 
bushs former rival bob dole drew laughter from the crowd at the 
republican event when acknowledging applause as he rose to speak 
said i would accept the nomination but i think its already 
been spoken for 
hours before reagans endorsement bush got the blessing of 
former television evangelist pat robertson who technically remains 
a candidate although he has long ceased active campaigning and has 
only 46 delegates to bushs 1344 according to the latest ap count 
robertson who came to washington to formally bestow his support 
on bush told reporters at the white house afterward he would 
withdraw from the race on monday and would be releasing his 
delegates 
but later robertson aide richard pinsky said robertson was 
suspending his campaign rather than quitting outright and would 
release his delegates but not right away 
still later the robertson campaign weighed in with a press 
release asserting that the former television evangelist had told 
reporters he was not withdrawing and was not releasing his 
delegates it promised robertson would discuss his campaign status 
on monday however 
on wednesday jackson led a march against drugs through a 
crimeridden neighborhood in portland and talked to indian leaders 
near a reservation in central oregon 
i earn my votes every day jackson told a cheering crowd in 
salem when i win you win 
in other developments 
former president nixon has notified republican party officials 
that he does not want to be invited to address the partys national 
convention in august a party source says the source who insisted 
on anonymity said there was sentiment among party officials to 
invite nixon to address the new orleans convention but nixon who 
was driven from office by the watergate scandal was aware that his 
appearance would be controversial the source said 
supporters of jesse jackson have filed a formal challenge to 
the delegate selection process in kansas where state party 
officials were preparing for a state committee meeting over the 
weekend to choose the last of kansas delegates to the democratic 
national convention in july in atlanta backers say jackson should 
have been allocated 12 national delegates instead of the seven he 
received based on the results of county caucuses march 19

a potholed street has cost dallas almost 1 
million in a settlement that nearly wiped out its litigation 
reserve fund officials said 
city council approved by a 52 vote wednesday a 969000 
settlement with a man whose wife was killed three years ago by a 
motorist who swerved after hitting a pothole 
in a suit in state district court the family of a glennie 
mayer of rowlett had sought 24 million from the city for failing 
to fill the pothole which was about 8 inches deep and 3 feet 
across 
the suit contended the city had been negligent because it failed 
to properly maintain the street despite a complaint filed with the 
streets and sanitation department 
city attorney analeslie muncy said the citys litigation fund 
has just a little more than 1 million which must last until 
sept 30 the end of the fiscal year 
in 1985 there was no state limit on death claims resulting from 
faulty street maintenance the states 1987 tort reform law set a 
250000 limit 
the lawsuit filed by robert e mayer stems from a nov 18 
1985 accident that killed mrs mayer 48 
under texas law a city may be held liable for an accident 
caused by a pothole only if a complaint has been filed and there 
was time for crews to fill it

the defense ended its closing 
arguments today in the cocainesmuggling trial of carlos lehder 
rivas ridiculing prosecutors for trying to make the colombian 
appear responsible for the nations drug problem 
if that is true you could lock up the doors to this 
courthouse and tear down all the just say no signs defense 
attorney edward shohat said referring to a national antidrug week 
campaign 
shohat urged the jury to make an independent judgment about the 
charges against lehder saying the government does not own the 
jury noboby owns the jury 
counsel for lenders codefendant jack carlton reed also was 
expected to finish his closing arguments today followed by a 
rebuttal from us attorney robert merkle the case was scheduled 
to go to the jury friday 
lehder 38 and reed 57 of san pedro calif are charged with 
conspiring to smuggle about 33 tons of cocaine into the united 
states from colombia via lehders private bahamian island normans 
cay from 1978 to 1980 
a separate miami indictment accuses lehder of being one of the 
leaders of the socalled medellin cartel a violent colombian 
smuggling ring believed to be responsible for a major portion of 
the cocaine entering the united states 
shohat spent this morning hammering again at what he said were 
inconsistencies in the testimony of government witnesses many of 
whom were admitted smugglers given immunity for their testimony 
on wednesday shohat said chief prosecution witness convicted 
smuggler ed ward was given the break of a lifetime for his 
testimony against lehder 
by agreeing to cooperate with the government ward was able to 
reduce a possible 215year sentence and 59 million fine to less 
than six years in prison shohat said 
shohat reviewed what he termed the litany of lies testified 
to by several members of wards group of american smugglers 
these people planned to dump on mr lehder these people knew 
how to get an american express card to freedom he said 
you cant believe any of these people without hesitation 
the defense attorney said 
shohat urged the panel to focus on the actual charges listed 
against lehder in the indictment and not what he called the 
governments attacks on his character 
the issue is not whether mr lehder was good or bad the issue 
in this case is the 11 counts in the indictment said shohat 
he said the actual charges were discussed in only five weeks of 
the 22week case 
mr lehder has no burden of proof it is the obligation of the 
prosecutors to prove lehder guilty beyond a reasonable doubt he 
said 
winding up his prosecution arguments wednesday merkle referred 
to testimony that lehder used bribes charm and threats to run a 
smuggling empire for once merkle said lehder couldnt use such 
tools 
he cannot buy his way out of a just verdict he cannot charm 
his way out of a just verdict and he cannot force his way out of a 
just verdict merkle said 
the prosecutor said lehder was responsible for smuggling 19 tons 
of cocaine into the united states earning him 20 million 
lehder was captured in february 1987 at a mansion near the town 
of medellin after a shootout between colombian army troops and his 
bodyguards he was whisked onto a us air force plane for the 
united states 
the prosecution called 115 witnesses in the trial which began 
in october last week defense attorneys surprised the courtroom by 
announcing they would call no witnesses 
lehder is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise reed is charged with conspiracy

federal drug agents say the state department 
for 18 years stood in the way of efforts to smash drug smuggling by 
panamanian strongman manuel noriega according to a story by the 
scrippshoward news service 
we found out about noriega shortly after the bureau of 
narcotics and dangerous drugs was established in 1968 jerry 
strickler former chief of central american investigations for the 
bureau was quoted as saying in a scrippshoward story published 
today 
it was organized crime controlled by government said john 
parker former director of foreign operations for the bureau 
noriega was a rising power in panama in 1968 he had just helped 
gen omar torrijos become panamas president in a coup and was 
rewarded with the job of military intelligence chief 
the nowretired agents were quoted as saying they obtained their 
first hard evidence linking noriega to drug smuggling in 1970 when 
a group of panamanians was arrested trying to bring a boatload of 
marijuana into miami the captain had an address book listing 
noriegas name and telephone number along with those of wellknown 
latin american drug traffickers 
john bacon then chief of the bureaus latin american 
intelligence division said the captain told agents he had picked 
up the drug cargo in panama and paid noriega a cut of the profits 
less than a year later the agents learned that noriega had 
arranged through joaquim him gonzales chief air traffic controller 
at the panama city airport to smuggle heroin onto planes from 
panama city to south florida 
noriegas cut they said was 100000 a shipment with 90 to 
150pound shipments leaving panama city daily 
agents arrested gonzales in february 1971 and said they were 
ready to pounce next on noriega until the state department became 
involved 
the agents were quoted as saying that gonzales arrest had 
angered us ambassador robert sayre 
we were open about what we were doing in panama strickler 
said but the agents say they didnt want to tell sayre in advance 
that they intended to arrest gonzales they said they feared he 
might not keep quiet because he was more concerned about 
maintaining friendly relations with torrijos and noriega during 
negotiations to seal a new canal treaty and solve the issue of 
canal zone sovereignty 
they lured gonzales into the canal zone with an invitation to 
play in a softball game 
after gonzales arrest sayre wanted to know everything we 
were doing all the time strickler said 
he also ordered the agents that he felt were most responsible 
for the gonzales arrest to leave panama the agents said 
state department officials in panama began reviewing all 
bureau confidential cables on noriega and torrijos and refused to 
send some of them on because they felt it would upset the 
government strickler said 
gonzales arrest had outraged and unnerved torrijos so much that 
the state department had to beg for the generals forgiveness the 
agents say 
as noriega became more known nothing we said made an 
impression on the state department strickler said 
some current and former administration and state department 
officials deny ignoring noriegas drug smuggling or interfering 
with agents who tried to stop him they say they were never shown 
hard evidence of noriegas involvement in drugs others however 
back up the agents 
the bureau become the drug enforcement administration in 1973

the tass news agency eulogized harold kim 
philby on thursday as a master spy who carried out heroic and 
seemingly impossible feats to protect the soviet union from western 
agents 
philby died wednesday in moscow where he had lived since 
defecting to the soviet union in 1963 as a rising star in british 
intelligence the upper crust englishman spied for the soviets for 
26 years he eventually became a decorated kgb officer 
on may 11 1988 in the 77th year of his life the remarkable 
soviet intelligence officer kim philby died the official news 
agency reported in a brief dispatch 
tass did not elaborate on the circumstances of philbys death or 
say where it occurred the british foreign office said wednesday 
that philby had died in moscow 
with three colleagues donald maclean guy burgess and anthony 
blunt the cambridgeeducated philby turned britains most precious 
secrets over to the kremlin 
for a long time kim philby was engaged in exceptionally 
delicate work or better said a struggle directly within the 
special services of the capitalist countries whose thrust was 
spearheaded against the soviet union and the worlds progressive 
movement tass said 
these were years of truly titanic nervous stress which 
required the whole of his spiritual and physical forces tass 
said not infrequently philby was able to accomplish things which 
seemed wellnigh impossible to achieve 
tass called philbys activities heroic and multifaceted 
and vast in their geographic sweep 
in 1963 having successfully accomplished a regular 
assignment kim philby came to moscow where he continued the work 
that had become the reason and content of his entire life tass 
said 
being an internationalist kim philby loved his own english 
people valued their spiritual richnesses and believed in their 
happy future tass said 
while spying for moscow philby sent many western agents to 
their deaths he was even able to head off the defection of a 
soviet diplomat who threatened to expose him 
for his services to soviet intelligence philby was awarded the 
nations highest decoration the order of lenin and other awards 
including the red banner and the order of the patriotic war first 
class tass said 
after an initial heros welcome in moscow philby sank into 
obscurity and confessed in an interview with a british newspaper 
earlier this year that he went through depression and began 
drinking heavily when he believed that the soviet kgb had no 
further use for him 
but philby told phillip knightley of the sunday times in his 
first and only interview with a western publication since his 
defection that he had no regrets except for personal friends he 
had lost 
asked would you do it all again philby replied 
absolutely 
philby said then that he had found peace was happy in his 
fourth marriage to a soviet woman and that he felt at home in the 
soviet union 
he told radio moscow last november he wanted to be buried in the 
soviet union which i considered to be my country since the 
1930s 
the tass announcement of his death gave no details of funeral 
arrangements

a man accused of the christmas holiday 
slayings of 14 relatives and two other people was convicted today 
of capital murder and five counts of attempted capital murder 
r gene simmons defense had rested this morning without 
presenting any evidence the jury deliberated for 84 minutes 
simmons was on trial for a dec 28 rampage that left two people 
dead and four injured he is to be tried in the other 14 killings 
in july 
capital murder applies to crimes involving multiple killings 
under arkansas law and the jury was to consider the sentence this 
afternoon there are only two sentences for a person convicted of 
capital murder life imprisonment without parole or death 
the circuit court jury also reduced a kidnapping charge to 
firstdegree false imprisonment and convicted simmons on that 
charge the attempted murder charges referred to the four people 
simmons wounded plus another person who was fired at but was not 
hit 
circuit court judge john s patterson read the jurys verdicts 
to a standing room only crowd of about 100 
viola oshields and her husband roger relatives of some of 
the simmons family victims were pleased tears welling in her 
eyes mrs oshields displayed a photograph of simmons late 
17yearold loretta and said isnt it a shame 
simmons 47 had no immediate reaction to the verdict 
the evidence in this case is strong its stout said 
prosecutor john bynum during a 32minute closing statement this 
morning 
the defenses closing argument lasted 34 minutes most of it by 
robert e doc irwin who contended that there was a lack of 
evidence to support a contention of premeditation and deliberation 
irwin also said there were no tests to link simmons to the 
murder weapons and other evidence bynum said such tests were 
unnecessary when witnesses testified about details and the police 
chief had testified that simmons handed him the murder weapon 
the state rested late wednesday and patterson denied defense 
motions for directed verdicts and dismissal of the charges the 
defense rested this morning 
a route salesman who chatted with simmons testified wednesday 
that a month before the christmastime killings began simmons was 
talking about settling some scores 
simmons said he had a few people in town he would like to get 
even with paul epperson 49 told the jury rusty taylor was 
the only name he called 
the state contends that on dec 28 1987 simmons shot six 
people including taylor two of the six died after simmons 
surrendered police searched his home and found the bodies of 14 
family members all shot to death or strangled 
epperson was the last of 30 state witnesses who testified in 
franklin county circuit court in the trial of simmons on a charge 
of capital murder for the slaying of two people plus five counts of 
attempted capital murder and one count of kidnapping simmons could 
face the death penalty if convicted 
epperson said his talk with simmons 47 took place in a small 
russellville market where simmons was a cashier and to which 
epperson delivered bread and cake on a daily route 
a state ballistics expert paul mcdonald testified that 
markings on bullets taken from the two murder victims showed they 
had been fired by the same nineshot revolver that simmons handed 
to police when he surrendered 
killed were kathy kendrick 24 at a russellville law firm where 
she worked and james chaffin 33 at a russellville oil company a 
man also was wounded and a woman shot at but not hit at the oil 
company 
police said ms kendrick once refused simmons amorous 
attentions 
bullets recovered from the market where simmons had quit his 
job 10 days before the shooting came from the same pistol 
mcdonald said two people were wounded at the market 
simmons also allegedly shot a former coworker at a freight 
company joyce butts 
mrs butts whose husband assisted her to and from the witness 
box said she and simmons once had a bad encounter while they 
worked together later after she told him to do a better job with 
some of the accounts he was handling he got angry she said 
he screamed he shouted acrss the office that he didnt get paid 
enough which led to a discussion about how he had treated her on 
that previous occasion 
mrs butts was shot in the back of the head and the bullet went 
into her heart for which she underwent open heart surgery the 
shooting let her unable to bend her left leg and with poor vision 
vicki jackson who the state says was taken hostage at the 
freight company after mrs butts was shot testified earlier 
wednesday 
vicki im not going to hurt you ms jackson said simmons 
told her as he held a gun to her temple i came to kill joyce i 
got everybody that hurt me im not going to hurt you

thursday for hot pursuit authority against marijuana growers in 
national forests whose illicit crops are protected by powerful 
weapons and snarling guard dogs that respond to commands sent 
through radioequipped collars 
william l rice deputy chief of the agriculture department 
agency that oversees 191 million acres of national forests and 
grasslands said his law enforcement agents are severely hampered 
by a legal prohibition against pursuing marijuana growers beyond 
the boundaries of federal lands 
frank g packwood a forest service special agent assigned to 
shastatrinity national forest in northern california blamed the 
lack of hot pursuit for the poor success rate in prosecuting 
growers who cultivate the potent variety of marijuana known as 
california gold in his region 
the request for statutory authority to pursue those engaged in 
what rice called a major billiondollar criminal industry in 
national forests was endorsed by sens tom harkins diowa and 
wyche fowler dga at a senate agriculture subcommittee hearing 
these marijuana gardens are protected by a marquis de sade 
torture chamber of devices intended to main cripple or kill 
intruders fowler said hunters and hikers have been injured in 
these booby traps 
rice said heavily armed marijuana growers forced the forest 
service to close 886000 acres of national forest lands last year 
as unsafe for visitors commercial interests and federal employees 
the witness table at the hearing was littered with samples of 
weapons used by marijuana growers to keep intruders away 
among them were a uzi submachine gun hand grenades makeshift 
shotguns attached to rat traps and trip wires boards studded with 
heavy nails and triple fish hooks designed to be strung at eye 
level from tree branches 
rep ron wyden dore testified that during one raid on a 
methamphetamine laboratory near a national forest in southern 
oregon the county sheriff seized a cache of weapons that could 
outfit a small army 
he said they included 51 machine guns semiautomatic rifles 
antiaircraft guns and other automatic weapons 100000 rounds of 
ammunition and 150 pounds of gunpowder 
forest service officials said the growers also set out poisoned 
feed to kill wildlife that eat marijuana plants and sabotage the 
equipment of timber workers and other commercial operators 
the growers train guard dogs to respond to commands to attack 
intruders when an electrical shock is activated in their collars by 
a remote radio signal the hearing was told 
these people mean business wyden said 
these are modernday moonshiners harkin said but they 
are a lot more sophisticated than the old moonshiners 
rice said the forest service eradicated more than 250000 
marijuana plants from 220 cultivation sites last year about 40 
percent of all the marijuana being produced in national forests 
but agent packwood said eradication efforts are not enough 
the solution lies in increased arrests thorough investigations 
aggressive prosecutions and sentences that clearly establish a 
deterrent to the temptation to spend six months and earn half a 
million dollars taxfree he said 
wyden declaring that the 14 billion domestic marijuana 
industry is threatening the quality of life all over the west 
urged support for his bill to grant forest service agents to 
conduct investigations searches seizures and arrests outside 
national forests where drug crimes occur 
he also proposed to strengthen federal penalties for 
unauthorized use of fertilizers and chemical herbicides in national 
forests and to stiffen the maximum penalties for marijuana 
cultivation on those lands 
forest service officials said the maximum federal penalty for 
using booby traps or other weapons at illicit marijuana farms now 
is 10 years in prison and a 10000 fine additional penalties for 
marijuana cultivation depend on the amounts involved they said

harold kim philby is dead but the bitter 
aftertaste of his colossal betrayal still lingers in britain 
even 25 years after the privileged english gentleman was 
unmasked as moscows highestplaced mole in western intelligence 
central questions remain unanswered 
were there others of higher rank were the operations of western 
intelligence agencies compromised more seriously than they realize 
when philby gave his only interview to a western journalist four 
months before he died was it part of a new plot by his kgb masters 
to discredit the british and undermine their relationship with 
washington 
a tribute to philby came thursday the day after he died at age 
76 from peter wright a former british intelligence officer 
wright has done much to keep the scandal alive with his 
allegation that an even higher mole existed the late sir roger 
hollis who directed the mi5 security service from 1956 to 1965 
wrights claim is in his volume of memoirs called spycatcher 
which is banned in britain 
in a statement from australia where he now lives wright called 
philby an outstanding man in the intelligence world 
philby became a soviet agent while at cambridge university in 
the 1930s joined the secret service and rose to high rank he was 
believed to be in line to head mi6 the sister service of mi5 
his network unraveled in 1951 with the defection of guy burgess 
and donald maclean to moscow but philby escaped exposure for 12 
more years in 1963 he too defected 
in 1964 the fourth man anthony blunt confessed he had 
worked for the soviets while in mi5 and received immunity in 
exchange for information about the other three his treason was 
kept secret and he eventually became art adviser to queen elizabeth 
ii receiving a knighthood 
blunts past was made public in 1979 and he was stripped of his 
honors he died in london in 1983 
the damage to british security which shared secrets with 
washington is incalculable now that all four of stalins 
englishmen finally are dead the suspicion persists that there 
were five 
wrights claim about hollis whether true or not illustrates 
the doubt that still eats at the british security services because 
of philbys treachery 
its bad for morale and its actually bad for operations 
said rupert allason a conservative member of parliament and who 
writes histories and analyses of espionage under the name nigel 
west 
he said the suspicions mean intelligence analysts must ask 
themselves constantly whether the files they use contain tainted 
information left by the traitors 
philby still was a kgb officer when he died and intelligence 
experts here believe the lengthy interview he gave in january to 
phillip knightley of the sunday times was a kgb operation 
the soviets had things in mind that they wanted to 
accomplish said miles copeland a retired cia officer living in 
england 
copeland and allason in separate interviews said the purpose 
was to revive us suspicions of british intelligence generated by 
the philby affair 
they pointed to remarks by philby to knightley in which he 
hinted that other traitors remained in british intelligence and 
that the british could not be trusted to keep secrets 
allason said philby had clearly hinted to knightley that there 
were other moles still undiscovered 
he also saw hidden purpose in letting knightley see how 
comfortable and privileged philby was in his adopted homeland it 
was a carrot to other people who might want to defect allason 
said 
copeland noted philbys recollection of a british intelligence 
official taking classified files with him when he retired the 
traitors aim copeland thinks was to show once again that secret 
british files are not leakproof 
apart from all this is the question of what possessed this 
epitome of the english gentry to devote himself to communism and 
treachery 
author malcolm muggeridge once a close friend blamed the 
double agents father harry st john philby the celebrated 
explorer and expert in arabic 
kim could never be the towering figure his father was so he 
compensated for it by defying him and all he stood for in the most 
appalling manner muggeridge told the times of london 
he called philby a cads cad allason called him a 
grotesquely unpleasant man who betrayed everyone he came in contact 
with including his close friends and family 
philby born in india and raised in the middle east wrote that 
he felt little conventional english patriotism he said he embraced 
communism at cambridge because britain was not challenging german 
militarism and communism alone seemed to offer resistance 
an editorial in the conservative daily telegraph said he 
deserved only contempt 
the convention whereby the dead should be judged charitably 
demands suspension in the case of kim philby it said he has 
died impenitent glorying in his own treason

soldiers closed arab schools 
months ago but children are back in class reciting lessons in 
unfinished buildings mosques and churches with the added spice of 
defying the israeli occupiers 
about 60 youngsters aged 6 to 12 study math english arabic 
history and geography in bedrooms of an incomplete villa on a rocky 
hillside peering out during the multiplication tables as 
children do at yellow flowers in the valley 
secret schools are different and to many students an adventure 
the children do not have to wear uniforms classes are 
coeducational and some children from private moslem and christian 
schools are studying together 
the army closed all 820 west bank schools feb 2 sending home 
300000 elementary and secondary students schools in the gaza 
strip have been closed for days at a time but the army has not 
shut down the entire system 
israeli officials said schools had become assembly points for 
the antiisraeli rebellion that began dec 8 among the 15 million 
palestinians of the west bank and gaza strip 
leaflets issued this week by the uprisings clandestine 
leadership urge more secret schools to get started those already 
operating include half a dozen in bir zeit 12 miles north of 
jerusalem 
the underground schools symbolize the transformation of the 
5monthold revolt which has claimed the lives of 186 arabs and 
two israelis there is far less street violence now but the air of 
defiance is little diminished 
teachers and students interviewed at the peoples schools 
agreed that challenging israels authority was a significant reason 
for organizing the classes 
because the israelis closed the schools we come here to show 
that we can break their rules said amjad shibli 16 his school 
uniform was brown jeans and yellow and black running shoes 
amjad was among about 75 teenagers attending high school 
classes in an unfinished building behind the city hall he said he 
had spent the past three months working in his fathers cafe and 
sometimes joined other youths in throwing stones at israeli 
soldiers 
rocks intended to slow israeli vehicles are scattered in streets 
leading to the makeshift high school the pavement near another 
school had been blackened by bonfires of tires burned as protest 
barricades 
the military government known as the civil administration 
closed four universities as well as the lower schools because many 
protests began on the campuses 
schools were closed because the children didnt want to study 
they had become a place for disturbances and violence said 
olivier rabovitch a spokesman for army administration 
he said protests had decreased dramatically in recent weeks and 
the schools might be allowed to reopen if the situation remained 
calm 
an arab teacher who identified himself only as professor m 
said the israelis have kept the schools closed as a general 
punishment of the population he is a lecturer at the shuttered 
bir zeit university and organized most of the underground schools 
that opened here two weeks ago 
thirtyseven parents university graduates and laidoff 
university teachers were recruited to conduct classes for several 
hundred volunteer students in bir zeit professor m said 
he said regular teachers who are civil administration 
employees refused to help because israeli authorities threatened 
to dismiss them 
professor m acknowledged an element of challenge to the 
army in organizing the schools but he and other teachers said 
their main concern was seeing that the children did not fall too 
far behind in their studies 
although many classes are coeducational some moslem families 
send their children to study in mosques where boys attend in the 
morning and girls in the afternoon 
at the unfinished villa on the hill assad sayegh a 26yearold 
economics graduate of bir zeit university was teaching math to 14 
pupils aged aged 8 and 9 who sat in small chairs against the 
unpainted concrete walls his blackboard and textbooks were 
spirited from the government school 
sayegh said the youngsters were taught the politics of the 
intefadeh or uprising but a reporter saw no evidence of 
indoctrination in the classes visited 
the government wants to keep the palestinian people 
emptyheaded sayegh said that way palestinians cant make 
bombs or fly airplanes they want all the knowledge for themselves 
so palestinians cant destroy the jewish government

the first decline in an annual index of 
american health practices illustrates there is a big difference 
between people knowing they should eat right and exercise and 
actually doing it authorities said thursday 
dr james michael mcginnis a federal health official said the 
drop underscores the need for leaders to redouble our efforts to 
convince americans that health promotion ideas are not a fad 
despite extensive publicity in recent years about the value of 
proper diet and exercise the 1988 survey by prevention magazine 
showed few gains in those areas mcginnis director of the office 
of disease prevention and health promotion noted 
in particular he told reporters it is an issue of some 
concern that we havent seen improvement in the number of people 
who told pollsters they try a lot to avoid eating too much fat 
only 54 percent answered yes to that question down from 56 
percent in the 1987 report the latest result also is down from the 
55 percent who gave a yes response in polling done for the 
initial index in 1984 
the overall 1988 prevention index stood at 648 out of a 
possible 100 down from 652 last year but 33 points above the 
first index in 1984 
however the overall gain from 1984 is due largely to sharp 
jumps in the number of people who have smoke detectors in their 
homes a 15 percent jump and the number who report wearing auto 
seatbelts a 38 percent climb 
mcginnis complimented the commercial magazine for compiling the 
index noting that is the only survey that has tracked trends in 21 
specific areas over a fiveyear period 
one clear message from this years survey is that the spread 
of good health habits is not automatic said thomas dybdahl 
director of the prevention index 
people may know more than ever about good health but they may 
not be acting on what they know in key areas such as diet 
exercise and weight control there is still much room for 
improvement 
for example the number saying they are making efforts to limit 
highcholesterol foods fell from 46 percent in the 1987 report to 
42 percent this year the same as it was in 1984 
compared with 1984 there was a twopercentagepoint drop in the 
number who said they try to avoid too many sweets and threepoint 
decline in the number who said they get seven or eight hours sleep 
most nights 
although up two points from the 1984 report only 35 percent of 
americans say they exercise strenuously three or more days a week 
and only 24 percent say they are at their proper weight up one 
point from 1984 
seventytwo percent say they do not smoke the same as last year 
and up two points from 1984 
humphrey taylor president of louis harris and associates which 
conducts the poll that forms the basis for the index described the 
figures on diet and nutrition as amazingly flat from a 
statistical viewpoint 
taylor said the lack of significant improvement in the diet and 
exercise portions of the fiveyear survey show a gap between lip 
service and good intentions and actual practice 
weight control is a truly dismal story he said noting that 
76 percent of americans think they are overweight we remain the 
most obese country in the world he said 
harris pollsters ask the same questions each year to give an 
accurate yeartoyear comparison 
the current years report was based on telephone interviews 
conducted with 1250 randomly selected adults nov 1125 and has a 
3 percent margin of error 
taylor acknowledged that the typically small yeartoyear 
changes registered in the survey often fall within the margin of 
error 
however he said the theoretical chance for error is largely 
overriden because consistent trends tracked over the fiveyear 
sampling period give added credence to the figures reported in any 
one year 
the singlenumber prevention index itself is derived by 
assigning weights to each of the 21 survey questions and applying 
poll results to that relative value scale 
for example not smoking is assigned the highest ranking 978 
on a scale of one to 10

people who can make their hands go numb through 
hypnosis show a marked change in brain waves suggesting that a 
trance blocks pain by altering the brains processing of 
information a new study says 
hypnotized people who create a painblocking hallucination may 
essentially be reducing the signal on normal sensory circuits and 
turning instead to imaginationlinked circuits said researcher 
david spiegel 
these findings provide evidence for the objective as well as 
subjective reality of hypnotic hallucinations that affect the 
sense of feel spiegel said wednesday at the annual meeting of the 
american psychiatric association 
hypnosis is a state of aroused and concentrated attention 
similar to getting lost in a good book scientists have known for a 
century that hypnotism can reduce pain but they do not know how 
spiegel said the new findings provide a starting point for 
further exploration of the cause 
he and two stanford university colleagues studied 10 highly 
hypnotizable people and 10 with little ability to enter a trance 
the brain waves were studied while a series of electrical impulses 
not quite strong enough to cause discomfort was applied to their 
left wrists 
each person went through the experience four times without 
hypnosis they were told at one time to simply pay attention to 
what they felt and at another time to press a button when they 
felt slightly longer pulses 
another time after a procedure to induce a trance they were 
told again to push a button when they felt the longer pulses 
the fourth time they were put into a trance and told to imagine 
that a local anesthetic was spreading from the fingers of their 
left hand up through the forearm they were told to make the arm 
cold tingling and numb then they were told to press the button if 
they felt any long electrical pulses 
the hallucination was more effective in the highly hypnotizable 
subjects who pushed the button after only 38 percent of the long 
pulses than in the low hypnotizables who felt 80 percent of the 
long pulses 
without the hallucination both groups responded to 86 percent 
or more of the long pulses either with or without hypnosis 
the brain waves studied are called cortical eventrelated 
potentials which reflect the brains reponse to a stimulus 
when researchers looked at the behavior of brain waves about a 
tenth of a second after each electrical impulse they found that in 
highly hypnotizable people the hallucination reduced brain wave 
strength by about 45 percent from the level seen without hypnosis 
in contrast when the highly hypnotizable people were asked 
under hypnosis to pay attention to the impulses but not create the 
numbness in their arm the wave strength at the onetenth second 
mark rose 35 percent over the level without hypnosis 
brain waves in the low hypnotizables showed no such changes 
the flexibility that the highly hypnotizable people showed in 
adjusting the sensory input in the brain fits in well with the 
ability of such people to reduce or eliminate pain with hypnosis 
spiegel said 
the results are a very interesting finding said fred 
frankel psychiatrist in chief at beth israel hospital in boston 
and psychiatry professor at harvard medical school 
previous work has shown brain wave differences in visual 
hallucinations he said thursday in a telephone interview

the reagan administration is discussing a deal 
that could result in the dropping of drug trafficking charges 
against panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega in exchange for 
his agreement to relinquish power a white house spokesman said 
today 
were still talking about such a deal said chief 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater what this amounts to is 
a plea bargain he said however the spokesman said no direct 
negotiations have taken place with noriega on the matter 
pressed at a briefing later to spell out the legal and other 
ramifications of such a deal in this country fitzwater said i 
offer no definition of plea bargaining 
im not going to speculate on possibilities that we dont know 
are going to happen he said fitzwater did say however that 
president reagan has not talked to noriega 
the president obviously has directed the negotiations that 
have gone on there but i wont go further the spokesman said 
negotiations are continuing with no agreements reached 
meanwhile us attorney leon kellner of miami whose office is 
prosecuting noriega met with attorney general edwin meese iii at 
the justice department in washington kellner left the building 
without talking to reporters and meese declined comment a 
department source said before the meeting that the two men were 
expected to discuss the noriega case 
earlier white house chief of staff howard baker without 
actually confirming an offer told cbstv that if such an 
arrangement got noriega out of power that would be the most 
fruitful and productive plea bargain that we have seen in a long 
time 
reports of an offer brought sharp criticism today from several 
senators and panamas antinoriega ambassador to the united states 
administration sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
wednesday that florida drugtrafficking indictments against the de 
facto panamanian ruler would be dropped if he stepped down and left 
the country for a year the sources said the justice department 
objected to the offer which was approved at a white house meeting 
sen john kerry dmass said if descriptions of the offer were 
accurate it would appear to be a victory for noriega allowing his 
loyalists to retain control while he spent a years vacation on 
the riviera 
if i was a cop in boston or miami or somewhere id sit there 
and say this administration has sent a signal that crime does 
pay kerry said on the cbs show 
kerry such such a deal would be a mistake and even an insult 
to the efforts of this country to fight a war on drugs 
sen alphonse damato rny said i think itd be a 
terrible mistake to take the word of a drugdealing killer dictator 
that hes going to get out and allow free elections sometime next 
year and hed be allowed to stay in until august and the only 
thing youre going to have is a transferance of power to his 
cronies 
for us to be saying that we can trust this man to keep his 
word is naive damato said we can only consider dropping the 
indictment after noriega leaves panama with his henchmen and with 
the proviso that president del valle take over and provide for free 
elections 
ambassador juan sosa appearing on the cbs program said noriega 
opponents cannot accept the dropping of charges without any 
arrangements made for next years election the restructuring of 
the defense forces noriega controls or the setting up of a 
government of reconciliation 
sosa also said the obvious differences among us officials on 
how to handle noriega have only helped him 
he said if noriega is to leave he should leave now and not wait 
until august which reportedly would be part of the arrangement 
between us officials and noriega 
the reported offer is the latest in a series of administration 
efforts since february including us economic sanctions that 
have paralyzed the panamanian economy but have so far not succeeded 
in ousting noriega the administration had offered previously not 
to extradite noriega on the drug trafficking charges if he went 
into political exile 
a panamanian government spokesman said in response to word of 
the new offer wednesday night there has been no agreement about 
anything 
panamas official news agency panapress reported wednesday 
night that president reagan had entered in direct contact with 
general noriega but gave no details 
the reagan administration has sent a state department envoy in 
recent weeks to talk with noriega but a us embassy spokesman 
would not comment when asked whether the envoy met with noriega or 
his representatives wednesday 
the news agency said general noriega has said there can be no 
deal if the us aggression and the violation of panamanian 
sovereignty continue 
an administration source said wednesday that if noriega accepts 
the deal he would step down probably in august and would stay out 
of panama until after the next presidential elections there in 1990 
the deal was approved tuesday at a white house meeting over the 
objections of the justice department including meese the source 
said 
kellner said he was aware of the proposed deal but did not know 
any details 
i was informed that an offer was being made said kellner 
reached by telephone at his miami office i have no knowledge of 
anything else 
in panama city the government said noriega had not agreed to 
step down 
there has been no agreement about anything said boris 
moreno director of the governments national information system 
such reports only come from sources interested in sidetracking 
the conversations and in aggravating the existing situation 
deputy assistant secretary of state michael g kozak went to 
panama early last week and has been conferring there with noriega 
and his representatives ever since sources said 
the situation in panama has many aspects and no agreement has 
yet been reached state department spokeswoman nancy beck said 
wednesday night 
noriega was charged in a 12count indictment unsealed in miami 
last feb 5 with taking at least 46 million in payoffs from 
colombias violent medellin cartel to protect cocaine shipments 
launder money supply drug laboratories and shelter the gangs 
leaders from law enforcement 
a separate threecount indictment unsealed the same day in tampa 
accused noriega of conspiracy to import distribute and attempt to 
import more than 1 million pounds of marijuana 
neal sonnett one of noriegas miami attorneys said he knew 
nothing about the proposal to drop the indictments as part of a 
deal to end panamas crisis but said he was not surprised by the 
reports 
the dismissal of the indictment is something that i have 
always insisted would be a prerequisite to any negotiation he 
said 
nbc news quoting an unidentified american official said 
president reagan decided to support the proposal after national 
security council advisers warned that further delay in getting 
noriega out could lead to a political alliance between noriega and 
cuban leader fidel castro

a holdout juror at the center of a controversy 
over the verdict in the nations first deathbytampering trial has 
admitted that she herself was involved in an earlier tampering 
case according to a report published today 
juror laurel holliday told the seattle times that she sued after 
she bit into a cracker that contained an aspirin substitute and 
settled the case out of court only two months before she became a 
juror in the cyanide case 
she said she never told court officers of her own case before 
she became involved in the trial of stella nickell who was 
convicted monday of killing her husband and another person with 
tainted extrastrength excedrin 
ms holliday the focus of a jury tampering investigation being 
pushed by mrs nickells attorney has admitted to being the 
holdout juror who broke an 111 deadlock on monday when she changed 
her vote 
mrs nickell 44 of auburn was convicted on five counts of 
product tampering and faces a june 17 sentencing in the deaths of 
her husband bruce nickell 52 and susan katherine snow 40 of 
auburn she faces life imprisonment 
us district judge william dwyer has already ordered the panel 
to come back to court friday at the request of the defense to 
determine whether the verdict was tainted by outside influece 
ms holliday had told dwyer that she got a telephone call last 
friday while the jury was deliberating from an anonymous caller 
who told her that mrs nickell had failed an fbi lie detector test 
she told dwyer the call would not affect her vote and dwyer 
allowed her to remain on the jury until it reached a verdict 
mrs nickell poisoned her husband to collect his insurance then 
put tainted painkillers on a store shelf to divert suspicion from 
herself according to the prosecution she faces a maximum penalty 
of life in prison 
in an interview in todays seattle postintelligencer ms 
holliday confirmed that she was the holdout in a series of 111 
votes during five days of deliberations as indicated earlier by 
lawyers and other jurors 
the times said that in her own tampering incident ms holliday 
told police her mouth started burning after eating a cracker on 
july 31 1986 she found half of an ibuprofen pill in the uneaten 
portion of the cracker called poison control and vomited she said 
ibuprofen is an aspirin substitute commonly used in 
overthecounter pain relievers a year later ms holliday sued 
the manufacturer of goldfish crackers pepperidge farm inc the 
case was assigned to arbitration and settled out of court for 500 
there were no witnesses and pepperidge farm attorneys questioned 
whether the event ever took place 
ms holliday said she didnt tell the judge or attorneys about 
the incident during juror screening because she didnt think it was 
important 
in her interview with the postintelligencer ms holliday 
denied defense attorney thomas hillier iis suggestions that she 
might have fabricated the report to be excused from deliberations 
or that another juror might have made the call 
he is playing his last cards in a desperate attempt to save 
his client ms holliday said 
ms holliday a real estate agent told dwyer before the verdict 
monday that a female voice she did not recognize told her friday 
night that mrs nickell had failed an fbi liedetector test a 
fact that had not been admitted as evidence in court 
dwyer let her stay on the jury after she said the call wouldnt 
influence her deliberations and hillier concurred at the time 
but on tuesday after the verdict and learning about the 111 
votes hillier filed a motion asking for permission to question the 
12 jurors individually 
and on wednesday dwyer said the court is required by law to 
investigate one way or the other whether there was jury 
tampering it cannot let the matter sit 
however he emphasized that he was not suggesting in the 
slightest any misconduct by any juror 
he told hillier and assistant us attorney joanne maida to 
submit questions to him dwyer said he would question the jurors 
under oath 
in the newspaper interview ms holliday expressed skepticism 
that the anonymous caller could have been another juror 
i really resent the implication about the truth of the other 
jurors she said hundreds of people knew who the jurors were 
and my name happens to be in the telephone book 
names of the jurors were broadcast and published only after the 
trial but were given in court during jury selection and were 
available from the court clerk during the trial 
ms holliday said she had no need to fabricate the report 
because had she wanted to be excused from the panel she said i 
could have called in sick

soviet media once branded andrei d sakharov a 
traitor but a moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic 
portrait of the human rights activist and his wife 
this weeks issue of the newspaper moscow news said that 
sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the soviet 
union 
the article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past 
charges leveled at sakharov and his wife fellow dissident yelena 
bonner by soviet officials and the statecontrolled media 
moscow news also pointedly notes that the 1975 nobel peace prize 
winner has praised mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for social and 
economic reform 
the 66yearold sakharov and his wife lead a frugal existence in 
their seventhfloor moscow apartment eating cabbage beet soup 
potatoes and other simple fare and sakharov insists on washing the 
dishes afterward himself the paper said 
it said their tworoom home was always filled with people 
seeking sakharovs aid and that the words most often heard there 
are help me but moscow news asked can he really do 
everything 
although the fullpage article was the longest on sakharov to 
date in the soviet press it made only indirect reference to the 
nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the 
kremlins intervention in afghanistan 
sakharov a brilliant physicist was allowed to return to moscow 
in december 1986 from his forced residence in the closed city of 
gorky where he was banished without trial in january 1980 
in effect sometimes sakharov bitterly jokes that hed like to 
return to gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on 
scientific work moscow news said of course concerning gorky 
thats a bitter joke 
since his return to moscow sakharov has been a vocal supporter 
of gorbachevs program for nationwide reforms that includes the 
policy of glasnost or greater openness on selected topics 
he simply believes that something helped change the thoughts 
of the majority into state policy moscow news saidhe calls 
perestroika restructuring an enormous event for our country and 
for the entire world 
however sakharov has insisted on speedier progress in improving 
the soviet record on human rights and during a jan 15 meeting in 
the kremlin he handed gorbachev a list of 200 people he said were 
imprisoned for their views 
moscow news noted that in 1975 in a tract titled knowledge 
and the world sakharov set forth his views on soviet affairs 
those writings have not been published in the soviet union 
now we can definitely see parallels between what he said then 
and those ideas that we are putting forward today moscow news 
said 
sakharov called for a ban on nuclear testing long before the 
kremlin the human rights activist one of the most prominent 
members of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the 
1970s sought openness in soviet society years before glasnost 
became communist party policy 
much of the moscow news article seemed designed to undo harm 
caused to the sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them 
it said one soviet book accused the sakharovs of living in 
oriental luxury and engaging in scandals between spouses 
moscow news said sakharov was stubborn unassuming an 
undisputed member of his countrys intelligentsia and a man with 
his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and 
the demands of this life 
his strong convictions even extend to his insistence that he do 
the dishes after meals wrote the reporter who visited sakharov at 
his apartment 
what is that andrei dmitrievich your hobby asked moscow 
news correspondent gennady zhavoronkov 
not all guests are able to wash the dishes conscientiously 
sakharov replied

look at this girl look what she has done it brought the highest 
and the lowest people together for just a minute 
tabatha 3 of madisonville ky died wednesday afternoon in 
the intensive care unit of childrens hospital of pittsburgh after 
an infection in her bloodstream caused her heart kidneys and liver 
to fail 
the 36pound pigtailed child was the worlds longest survivor 
of a fiveorgan transplant she received a new liver small 
intestines pancreas and parts of a stomach and colon during a 
15hour experimental operation that ended nov 1 
similar procedures had been performed only twice before and 
both patients died within a few days 
you couldnt help but love that little girl so many of us 
learned so much from her and not just medically said hospital 
spokeswoman sue cardillo 
tabatha was never down she said when people ask if the 
operation was a success its hard to measure success it was a 
success because tabatha lived six additional months and there were 
good times 
because of an intestinal deformity doctors had been forced to 
remove 95 percent of tabathas small bowel three days after she was 
born she was placed on a highly concentrated liquid diet which 
damaged her own liver 
doctors had said tabatha would soon die without the transplant 
she was hospitalized for all but seven weeks of her life and 
though she said she craved pizza the only solid food she ever ate 
was rice cereal ms cardillo said 
tabatha won the affection of hospital staff with goodnatured 
teasing playing peekaboo and singing the itsybitsy spider 
she walked through hospital halls with an intravenous pole in tow 
wearing her cherished tennis shoes and chatting with anyone 
tabathas hospital room was empty thursday the countless 
stuffed animals tons and tons of cards and a photo of a puppy 
recently given to tabatha have been packed in boxes ms cardillo 
said 
i think its affected everybody in the hospital from 
housekeeping on up at every level heartstrings are being pulled 
ms cardillo said 
tabathas parents roy and sandra foster quickly checked out of 
pittsburghs ronald mcdonald house where they had stayed for 
months ms cardillo said they did not want their whereabouts known 
thursday as they prepared to leave for home 
other family members gathered in madisonville waiting for the 
parents to join them and remembering tabatha 
she had those fat jaws and was always smiling foster 33 
said in a telephone interview she was a survivor she was a 
fighter 
tabathas aunt doris east 41 of huntsville ala said the 
child taught her to have faith 
she taught me to endure because she did she said 
ms east said the family was grateful the transplant kept 
tabatha alive for a time 
they gave her another day she said it just gave us more 
time with her 
foster said it was amazing tabatha won the affection of people 
like president reagan who had mentioned tabathas plight in a 
national radio address in january and contributed 1000 toward her 
medical expenses 
wellwishers from around the country including frank sinatra 
donated more than 350000 to help cover medical expenses for 
tabatha much of the money came from black churches tabatha was 
black 
tabatha foster showed us that courage and strength come in all 
sizes kentucky gov wallace g wilkinson said

democrat michael dukakis under republican 
attack for lacking foreign policy experience exchanged warm words 
with archbishop desmond tutu of south africa on thursday and 
criticized reported white house dealing to drop drug charges 
against panamas gen manuel noriega 
dukakis before heading west to campaign for primaries in oregon 
and california also made the rounds among democrats on capitol 
hill winning the endorsement of senate majority leader robert byrd 
and praise from other leaders 
on noriega he said i think before we start talking about 
dropping indictments and making deals the american people deserve 
a full explanation of what kind of relationship this administration 
has had with noriega just exactly what has been going on for 
the past 7 years 
i dont believe you drop indictments against suspected drug 
runners and murderers he said at the capitol 
dukakis began his day by meeting with tutu in private focusing 
news media coverage on foreign policy an area that vice president 
george bush has portrayed as a dukakis weakness 
a spokesman for the massachusetts governor said dukakis and tutu 
discussed house legislation that would toughen trade sanctions 
against south africa including a requirement that us companies 
get rid of investments in south africa dukakis later told 
reporters he supports the legislation very strongly 
tutu told reporters he and dukakis had no points of disagreement 
i dont think we need to give an endorsement but we know we 
would be amongst friends and we would have very very powerful 
friends in the white house if we had a democrat occupying the white 
house tutu said i know that our people back home would be 
very delighted to have a change in the white house 
dukakis praised tutu for showing courage and leadership and 
said its time to change our policy and i assure you if all goes 
well there will be a fundamental change in policy this country 
has got to lead in human rights 
tutu said god bless you 
dukakis with a big lead in delegates talked with congressional 
democrats in meetings that were in keeping with his role as the 
partys expected presidential nominee 
while he won warm words from those who appeared with him after 
their meetings the getacquainted sessions underscored that 
dukakis as a threeterm governor of massachusetts is something of 
a stranger on capitol hill 
besides byrd he won the endorsement of rep dan rostenkowski 
dill the house ways and means chairman who called dukakis the 
candidate best able to lead our nation 
house majority leader tom foley dwash who had backed richard 
gephardt before he dropped out of the presidential race praised 
dukakis for signaling he values cooperation with congress but 
foley said he wasnt endorsing dukakis over jesse jackson citing 
his role as parliamentarian of the democratic national convention 
and saying he wished to remain neutral 
byrd emerged from a private meeting with dukakis and offered his 
endorsement to the candidate who just two days earlier won 
overwhelmingly in the primary in byrds home state west virginia 
i do it without any reservations because im confident based 
on our conversation were going to have a president who will work 
with the congress byrd said 
i feel in the interest of party unity and with the progress 
gov dukakis has shown we need now to begin to close ranks and 
thats what were doing today byrd said

took to the roads and to the airwaves thursday pushing a 1 billion 
bond to unclog the nations most congested roads 
today the governor is a los angeles commuter and a traffic 
tipster said anchorman bill zorn of knxam one of three radio 
stations to broadcast deukmejians live traffic reports 
during his hourlong 32mile commute from a hotel near his long 
beach home to beverly hills the governor crept through the west 
los angeles junction of the san diego and santa monica freeways 
which traffic officials have labeled the nations busiest 
interchange some 513000 vehicles use it daily 
the republican governor wanted to demonstrate how californias 
freeways once the idyllic image of wideopen roadways ideal for 
cruising are now the nations busiest 
transportation officials confirmed this week that nine of the 
nations 10 busiest freeway interchanges are in california 
just traveling along now on the san diego freeway im taking 
note of the fact theres only one person in each car if we can 
just increase that to 14 persons we can relieve congestion during 
the peak traffic hours deukmejian said 
deukmejian traveled in a telephoneequipped van provided by the 
state office of emergency services to a transportation hearing to 
dramatize his support for a 1 billion bond issue on the june 7 
ballot 
proposition 74 is the first phase of a 23 billion package of 
supplemental financing for california highway improvements which 
deukmejian first proposed two years ago 
he averaged 35 mph during the commute but slowed to 5 mph at 
one point where the century freeway is being constructed near los 
angeles international airport 
we are approaching the el segundo boulevard exit were almost 
at a standstill moving 5 mph he said 
knxam traffic reporter bill keene gave deukmejian the handle 
delta duke for his traffic reporting stint which was also 
heard on kabcam and kgilam 
deukmejian laughed saying well ive been called a lot 
worse 
hundreds of thousands of people move to the nations 
secondlargest city each year roadway congestion became so bad 
last summer that flareups among commuters resulted in a rash of 
freeway shootings killing five and wounding 11 
im aware of the frustration people have in the peak hours 
deukmejian said 
california transportation officials who worked with the federal 
highway administration in washington dc said this week that six 
of the countrys 10 busiest interchanges are in los angeles county 
two of the other top 10 spots were claimed by neighboring orange 
county 
i looked at the numbers and said holy mackerel said 
transportation engineer chuck pivetti ten years ago all the top 
spots would have been in new york new jersey and chicago now we 
have nearly all the spots were talking about some tremendous 
volumes of traffic 
behind the santa monicasan diego freeway junction is the east 
los angeles interchange of the santa monica golden state pomona 
and hollywood freeways with 509000 vehicles per day and the 
santa monica junction with the harbor freeway in central los 
angeles with 502500 vehicles per day

a truce ordered by syria and iran ended a 
sixday battle between rival militias thursday in which the radical 
hezbollah captured most of south beiruts shiite moslem slums 
sniper fire was heard in the ramshackle 16 square miles adjacent 
to the beirut airport but the howitzers and tank cannons were 
silent police reported a woman killed and two other civilians 
wounded in the ghobeiri neighborhood 
police said 188 people were killed and 534 wounded in the battle 
that began last friday between the mainstream amal militia backed 
by syria and hezbollah or party of god which is loyal to iran 
south of the capital the israeli air force blasted palestinian 
bases in its eighth raid into lebanon this year police said six 
fighterbombers made three passes to rocket targets near barja 16 
miles from beirut there were no reports of deaths or serious 
injuries 
the truce was ordered for 11 pm wednesday after telephone 
conversations between president hafez assad of syria and president 
ali khamenei of iran 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah spiritual leader of hezbollah 
said he had no information about the 18 foreign hostages in 
lebanon most of whom are believed held in the slums by groups 
linked to hezbollah there has been no word of the foreigners who 
include nine americans since the fighting began 
although its fighting force was outnumbered 21 hezbollah 
appeared to have won the contest for supremacy police said it 
controlled 70 percent of the slums when the fighting ended 
compared with about onethird when it began 
police estimated hezbollahs fighting force at 3000 men they 
said amal put about 6500 men into the field about 2000 brought 
in from the syriancontrolled bekaa valley in east lebanon 
syria has 25000 soldiers in lebanon and sent 7500 of them to 
moslem west beirut in february 1987 to stop factional war although 
they patrol west beirut the syrians have not entered the southern 
shiite slums 
after 13 years of civil war assad was the undisputed power 
broker in lebanon until iran began challenging syrian influence 
among the 12 million shiites the countrys largest sect 
hezbollah denied police reports that 500 iranian revolutionary 
guards joined them in the slum war 
a police spokesman said amal lost most of its positions in 
south beirut he said amal moved its fighters to the edges of the 
disputed area and hezbollah took over the inner neighborhoods 
most of the 250000 people who normally live in the southern 
slums fled during the battle and more were planning to go despite 
the truce 
we dont trust ceasefires a man who identified himself 
only as hussein told a reporter i have five children and ive 
already lost my home i dont know where to go now i dont think 
the fighting will ever stop unless one side exterminates the 
other 
fadlallah spoke with journalists at his home which was damaged 
by artillery fire in the haret hreik neighborhood i think its 
over now because of the highlevel solutions that are being worked 
out by the presidents of syria and iran he said 
asked about the foreigners he replied i have no information 
about the hostages and i dont know anything about them i dont 
know where they are and therefore i cant answer your question 
he called amal a local force that represents american 
interests in the area 
posters stuck on walls in districts hezbollah had conquered 
depicted nabih berri lebanons justice minister and the amal 
leader with vampire teeth over the slogan the war criminal who 
sold himself to the great satan irans standard term for the 
united states 
iranian flags were hoisted on positions formerly held by amal 
a fourman committee was formed to supervise the ceasefire 
under which the combatants were to withdraw from the streets and 
free prisoners by friday 
its members are deputy foreign minister hussein sheikoleslam of 
iran brig gen ali hammoud syrias intelligence chief in west 
beiut and one representative each of amal and hezbollah ayoub

depressed teenagers intent on killing 
themselves show chemical abnormalities in their brains that appear 
to predispose them to suicide according to a study released 
thursday 
it clearly demonstrates some brain differences in suicidal 
adolescents its not purely a mind phenomenon said dr neal d 
ryan assistant professor of psychiatry at the university of 
pittsburgh 
earlier studies have found similar abnormalities in the brains 
of suicidal adults although experts are divided as to what 
conclusions can be drawn ryans research is believed to be the 
first that demonstrates neurochemical abnormalities in suicidal 
adolescents 
what this suggests is that there is a biochemical basis to at 
least depressive people with chronic suicidal plans ryan said 
theres something that goes on with the brain and there are 
environmental phenomena that impinge on that 
ryan said his findings reported at the american psychiatric 
associations annual conference in montreal could help doctors 
identify and treat certain patients before they try to commit 
suicide 
irma lann a science administrator in child and adolescent 
disorders research for the national institute of mental health 
said ryans work is preliminary and further study is needed 
its premature to even think that we could be able to identify 
groups of suicidal adolescents she said 
of the 29453 suicides in the united states in 1985 the last 
year for which figures are available 2127 were committed by 
youngsters 19 and under according to the national center for 
health statistics about 80 percent of them were boys 
boys and girls are afflicted about equally by depression but 
while more girls attempt suicide more boys succeed at it 
according to ryan 
ryan and dr joaquim puigantich professor of psychiatry at 
pitt began their study in 1980 at the new york state psychiatric 
institute in new york city they continued their work funded by 
the national institute of mental health after moving in 1984 to 
western psychiatric institute and clinic in pittsburgh 
from 1980 to 1987 the psychiatrists monitored the growth 
hormone secretion of 140 boys and girls ranging in age from 12 to 
just under 18 the tests were conducted while the subjects slept 
most growth hormone secretion occurs during sleep especially 
during the first several hours according to ryan at least three 
neurotransmitter systems in the brain are involved in controlling 
sleep growth hormone secretion which also affects moods 
the 34 youngsters who suffered from major depression and had 
attempted suicide or devised a suicide plan secreted less growth 
hormone than the 40 depressed but nonsuicidal students and 66 
healthy children whose levels were about the same ryan said the 
subjects sex was not a factor and their ages were taken into 
account 
later 43 of the students received a onetime shot of 
desipramine an antidepressant known to stimulate the release of 
growth hormone 
among the eight depressed suicidal youths who received the 
shot less growth hormone was released than among the 12 depressed 
but nonsuicidal and 23 healthy adolescents ryan said

the federal government should direct its efforts 
to providing health care for the chronically ill says the new 
president of the american association of retired persons 
we contend that national legislation based on a social 
insurance approach is required so that the risk can be spread over 
millions of working and retired persons said louise crooks 76 
who ascended to the presidency wednesday during the biannual 
meeting of the 28 millionmember association 
we must find a way to assure adequate health care for the 
estimated 37 million americans who have no health care insurer 
whatsoever and expand and improve private pension plans so that 
future generations of older americans will have more adequate 
retirement income the west lafayette ind woman said 
among the health issues discussed at the convention was 
alzheimers disease a form of dementia that afflicts about 2 
million elderly americans the diseases cure and cause remains 
unknown 
dr gene cohen director of the program on aging at the national 
institute of mental health in bethesda md said the federal 
government is spending 90 million a year to research the disease 
up from 4 million in 1974 
alzheimers has emerged as one of the great mysteries of 
medical science cohen said 
the conference also looked at the needs of those who care for 
the elderly those people mostly women often are burdened by 
unrelenting demands and develop health problems of their own said 
rhonda montgomery director of the institute of gerontology at 
wayne state university she said twice as many senior citizens are 
being cared for in private homes as in nursing homes

a federal judge has declared 
unconstitutional a commission that sets federal sentencing 
guidelines saying the presidents authority to remove commission 
members violates the separation of powers between the executive and 
judiciary branches of government 
chief us district judge w brevard hand also threw out the 
sentencing guidelines themselves 
hands ruling wednesday on a motion in a cocaine case was 
similar to one issued by us district judge marvin shoob in 
atlanta challenges to the guidelines also have been filed in other 
jurisdictions and many federal judges have criticized them 
under the commissions guidelines federal judges must impose 
sentences within prescribed ranges unless special circumstances 
exist that are not adequately considered by the commissions rules 
the guidelines hand said substantially restrict the 
traditional discretion allowed judges in sentencing 
hand said the commission created by congress in 1984 
improperly includes three federal judges members of the commission 
are appointed by the president and may be removed by him for 
neglect of duty malfeasance in office or for other causes 
federal courts must carefully abstain from exercising any 
power that is not strictly judicial in its character and which is 
not clearly confided by the constitution hand ruled 
he said the job of setting guidelines is essentially an 
administrative rulemaking task legislative in nature and not a 
proper function of the judiciary

the house unanimously approved a resolution 
thursday that asserts the right of its members to be immune from 
civil lawsuits when they issue news releases hold news conferences 
or communicate with government officials 
the 4130 vote was triggered by a federal appeals court decision 
that limited lawmakers immunity to activities such as speaking and 
voting on the house or senate floor 
the resolution requested that the supreme court hear an appeal 
of the case in which the need for a broader interpretation of 
immunity would be argued 
the house expressed deep concern with the ruling because 
of its impact on the necessary and proper functioning of the house 
of representatives 
the dispute began in 1985 when rep don sundquist rtenn 
wrote to the attorney general and the president of the legal 
services corp about a controversy over expenditure of federal 
money by memphis area legal services 
sundquist who released the letters to the news media made a 
reference to a staff attorney for the memphis group who sued the 
lawmaker for defamation of character 
in april 1986 a us district judge in washington dismissed the 
suit on grounds that members of congress are entitled to immunity 
while acting in good faith within the scope of their official 
duties 
last november a panel of the us court of appeals in

conrail crew members in a fatal train accident 
suffered from a lack of sleep and could have dozed off while still 
instinctively performing basic duties an industrial psychologist 
testified thursday 
donald i tepas professor of psychology and director of the 
industrial and organizational psychology program at the university 
of connecticut said the three crew members on each of the two 
trains suffered from chronic sleep deprivation 
tepas testified during the second day of a national 
transportation safety board hearing on the jan 14 train accident 
in thompsontown which killed four people 
the two conrail trains one hauling coal and the other carrying 
trailervans smashed headon at about 8 am killing the engineer 
and the brakeman on both trains and derailing all five locomotives 
damage was estimated at 5 million 
tepas said the rail employees erratic work schedules harsh 
monotonous work environment and a lack of programs to help 
employees deal with job stress promote sleeping on the job 
work systems which result in night work shifts of unusual 
length and unpredictable work hours result in conditions which 
place workers and the general public at risk he said in prepared 
testmony 
spokesmen for conrail a private freight rail organization set 
up by congress to operate six bankrupt railroads have said they 
wouldnt comment on any of the testimony 
during his testimony tepas said workers on erratic schedules do 
not make up for lost sleep nor do they adapt to those schedules 
the same workers are not usually able to judge how their work has 
been affected while suffering from chronic sleep deprivation he 
added 
though asleep people can still react automatically in different 
situations he said adding that dozing rail workers could respond 
to danger signals as part of a natural reflex 
in all stages of sleep it is possible for people to perform 
simple responses to simple stimuli tepas said 
people can sleep for a few seconds or minutes and can perform 
quite well when they wake up he added 
us railroad companies must pay more attention to the 
consequences of sleep deprivation tepas said 
training employees who work unpredictable work schedules how to 
handle odd sleeping hours would help as well as adding some kind 
of change to routine duties he said 
the accident apparently occurred when the westbound trailer 
train had been shifted to an eastbound track on the conrail main 
line between harrisburg and pittsburgh the eastbound coal train 
apparently ran a stop signal and smashed headon into the trailer 
train 
the two survivors of the accident both said wednesday they had 
had only a few hours of sleep before they reported to duty the day 
of the wreck 
inquiry board chairman james l kolstad said the inquiry board 
would not issue its report for several months the hearings are 
scheduled to last through friday

two congressmen accused the reagan 
administration thursday of ruining childrens lives and wasting 
taxpayers money by failing to enforce a 1980 law meant to improve 
the foster care system 
children are being abused beyond our wildest expectations 
millions of dollars are being misspent rep george miller 
dcalif told three federal officials responsible for childrens 
programs 
the children dont have permanency they dont have services 
they cant get back to their families what youre really 
engaged in is state child abuse miller said 
miller chairman of the house select committee on children 
youth and families and rep tom downey dny chairman of the 
ways and means public assistance subcommittee led the attack on 
the trio at the last of three hearings on the foster care system 
it appears to me that were doing a reasonably adequate job 
its not an exceptional job said sydney olson assistant 
secretary for human development services at the department of 
health and human services were trying to improve 
earlier witnesses had charged that neither the federal 
government or the states were enforcing the 1980 law which 
stresses preserving and reuniting families and finding permanent 
homes for children who cannot be with their parents case plans and 
case reviews for children in foster care are required at specific 
intervals 
the american public welfare association said many positive 
changes had occurred as a result of the law the childrens 
defense fund said that without the changes the crises facing the 
child welfare system today would be even more overwhelming 
those and other groups said there remain serious problems 
ranging from patchwork services and inadequate federal funds to the 
increasingly disturbed children entering the foster care system as 
a result of unemployment poverty drug abuse homelessness and 
family violence 
downey and miller aimed their fire at the administration 
contending officials are failing to penalize states no matter how 
bad their records are 
as one of our witnesses told us youd have to work overtime 
to flunk your audit miller said he said the department is 
relying on a checklist filled out by states themselves plus sample 
cases that dont reflect the serious problems pinpointed by 
lawsuits and studies across the country 
those problems have included child abuse by foster parents 
slipshod monitoring by authorities responsible for the childs 
future and failure to refer children for adoption or return them 
to their families where that is appropriate 
downey said a lawsuit in new york city revealed that child 
welfare offices were being used as shelters and 1000 children had 
been subjected to multiple onenight placements he said a suicidal 
12yearold was sent to 17 placements in 28 working days despite 
this information he said new york is one of seven states that has 
not been audited since the law was enacted 
olson said she was not aware of the lawsuit probably because 
the federal government is not a party to it 
you are a party to it miller rejoined youre paying the 
bill for the care of these children when states are out of 
compliance theyre not supposed to get the money somehow that 
doesnt happen 
miller and downey also scored the administrators for failing to 
help states cope with soaring rates of homelessness drug abuse and 
child abuse they said thousands of children are in foster care 
because their parents are homeless or the social services their 
families need are unavailable

prime minister yitzhak shamir 
urged palestinians in this arab city thursday to stop their 
uprising against israeli occupation and said if they did the 
bloodshed would cease 
in the west bank city of nablus israeli troops opened fire on 
palestinian protesters wounding five arab reports and hospital 
officials said the army reported three wounded 
about 3000 police were deployed in jerusalem as the moslem fast 
of ramadan drew to a close 
the israeli air force made its eighth raid into lebanon this 
year blasting palestinian targets south of beirut police said six 
fighterbombers took part in the attack at barja 16 miles outside 
beirut there were no reports of deaths or serious injuries 
israels police commissioner david kraus said all necessary 
measures would be taken to prevent disturbances at the close of 
ramadan the moslem holy month due to end monday or tuesday with 
the sighting of the new moon 
thursday marked laylat al kadr arabic for night of fate 
which falls on the 27th day of ramadan and marks the giving of the 
koran to the prophet mohammed police were on patrol to prevent 
rioting by moslems gathering at jerusalems sacred temple mount for 
allnight prayers 
officials also are concerned about possible violence on sunday 
when israelis mark the 40th anniversary of their state as well as 
the 21st anniversary of the seizure of arab east jerusalem 
shamir visited hebron the second largest west bank city for 
the first time since unrest broke out in the occupied territories 
dec 8 he toured the narrow stonepaved streets of the qasbah or 
openair market passing surprised vendors selling meat vegetables 
and donkey saddles 
speaking through a translator shamir urged palestinian 
residents of the city to stop violence one arab told him the 
government should start treating the palestinians as human beings 
especially now during religious celebrations 
shamir responded that the population should start to behave 
and not only during holidays 
if there would be quiet and order nothing would be done 
against the population shamir said

dozens of troops who banged on shop doors and used megaphones to 
order striking shopkeepers to open

neighboring beit hagay jewish settlement where about 90 jewish 
settlers live in the barren hills south of hebron 
shamir said the land was thirsty for jewish settlement and 
promised settlers that israel would march forward with the 
settlement drive 
throughout the west bank many shops remained shuttered all day 
due to conflicting plo and army orders plo leaders have ordered 
shops to open in the morning and close in the afternoon and the 
army has tried to thwart the organizations control by issuing the 
opposite orders 
the clash in the openair market of nablus started after troops 
ordered shops in the city closed and youths began throwing stones

including one 13yearold were brought in with gunshot wounds 
four were wounded in the legs and one was wounded in the stomach

israelis an israeli soldier and a jewish teenager also have been 
killed

the reagan administration is backing kuwaits 
request to buy sophisticated f18 fighterbombers for defense in 
the persian gulf and has begun consulting congress to help the 
plan get off the ground us officials said thursday 
it would be the first sale of twoengine 500mile range f18s 
to an arab country but state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
said kuwait obviously faces a threat in the gulf 
weve said over and over again that views of congress will 
play a large part in our consideration of this question but we 
stress again the threat in the gulf region is clear and we think 
the kuwaiti request is consistent with our policy she said 
the administration notified congress several months ago that it 
expected kuwait to make a request for advanced aircraft to replace 
aging a4 attack planes vulnerable to equipment being used by both 
iran and iraq in their sevenyearold war 
of the possible replacements kuwait picked the mcdonnell 
douglas cos f18 the newest of the choices and a plane sold only 
to treaty allies spain australia and canada 
kuwait apparently picked the plane because it was built for the 
us navy for operations over water and can be converted within 
minutes from an airtoair fighter to a wellstocked bomber 
of the other possibilities mcdonnell douglass f15 is 
considered purely an airtoair combat plane and general dynamics 
f16 has less versatility than the f18 in performing bombing and 
fighter missions with equal effectiveness 
us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
administration is consulting with congress to determine if approval 
would be granted for the sale of all 40 f18s kuwait wants in 
addition the administration wants to see if congress would resist 
selling f18s to kuwait but would accept the transfer of f16s 
congress has already permitted f16 sales to egypt and bahrain 
another small oilproducing state 
arms sales to the middle east are closely scrutinized on capitol 
hill where there is concern about giving sophisticated weapons to 
arab nations still technically in a state of war with israel sen 
john kerry dmass a member of the foreign relations committee 
raised another concern the level of weaponry in the wartorn gulf 
region 
the administration keeps trying to escalate the level of 
sophistication when there is already an escalation of modern 
weapons in the region kerry said he cited the sale of 
longrange chinese missiles to saudi arabia as an example 
the f18 thats our most sophisticated latest technology 
kerry said im concerned about it i just dont see a need for 
it at first blush 
kuwaiti interest in the f18s was disclosed during congressional 
testimony earlier this week by richard w murphy assistant 
secretary of state for near eastern affairs 
the united states and kuwait have created an increasingly close 
security relationship since last year when the united states 
committed naval forces to protect usflagged ships traveling 
through the persian gulf 
individual f18s as supplied to the us navy by mcdonnell 
douglas co cost 17 million making the kuwaiti sale a potential 
680 million deal 
with a range of 500 nautical miles kuwaitibased f18 jets 
could hit targets throughout most of the persian gulf and deep in 
iranian territory 
mrs oakley the state department spokeswoman said meanwhile 
a request by another gulf state oman for us shoulderfired 
stinger antiaircraft missiles reflects legitimate defense 
requirements 
she noted congress has prohibited such sales to all persian gulf 
countries during the fiscal year that runs through sept 30 but 
she added no decisions on future actions have been taken 
the us ambassador to oman g cranwell montgomery said he is 
trying to get congress to change its mind but sen dennis 
deconcini dariz sponsor of the stinger sale ban said he would 
oppose the effort 
deconcini has expressed concern that the light portable 
stingers could be diverted from middle eastern nations to terrorist 
groups and used against civilian aircraft

democrats michael dukakis and jesse jackson joined the chorus of 
criticism thursday against reported us plans to drop drug charges 
against panamanian dictator manuel noriega while president reagan 
was mortified that his endorsement of george bush was viewed as 
less than enthusiastic 
dukakis made his first visit to the capitol as the presumed 
democratic nominee and won backing from several congressional 
leaders before heading to the west where bush and jackson were 
campaigning 
the white house acknowledged us officials were trying to coax 
noriega to surrender power but refused to say whether dropping the 
drug charges might be part of the deal 
in new mexico bush refused to discuss the matter except to say 
i favor getting noriega out when negotiations are going on 
that are sensitive you dont discuss them 
the republican vice president called the fuss over the terseness 
of reagans endorsement much ado about nothing 
i couldnt have been more pleased he said 
reagan devoted three brief sentences at the end of a speech to a 
gop fundraising dinner wednesday night to declare his backing for 
bush who clinched the republican presidential nomination more than 
two weeks ago 
dukakis still is short of the majority he needs at the 
democratic convention but the string of primary victories put 
together in recent weeks by the massachusetts governor has ended 
any doubt that he will be the partys candidate against bush in the 
general election 
with his new status dukakis met privately in washington with 
south african bishop desmond tutu and then with democratic 
congressional leaders he picked up endorsements from senate 
majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia and rep dan 
rostenkowski of illinois chairman of the house ways and means 
committee 
dukakis won nearly 80 percent of the vote in the west virginia 
primary earlier this week and byrd the states senior senator 
said he was endorsing the governor without any reservations 
because im confident based on our conversation were going to 
have a president who will work with the congress 
byrd also said its time now that we unite we need now to 
begin to close ranks and thats what were doing today 
rostenkowski called dukakis the candidate best able to lead 
our nation 
after meeting with tutu dukakis said he very strongly 
supported tougher sanctions against the white supremacist regime in 
south africa 
its time to change our policy and i assure you if all goes 
well there will be a fundamental change in policy dukakis 
said this country has got to lead in human rights 
in recent days the massachusetts governor has hammered away at 
bush on the question of what the vice president knew about 
noriegas involvement in drug trafficking 
at the capitol he focused on the reports the administration 
might drop the drug charges 
i think before we start talking about dropping indictments and 
making deals the american people deserve a full explanation of 
what kind of relationship this administration has had with noriega 
just exactly what has been going on for the past 7 years he 
said 
i dont believe you drop indictments against suspected drug 
runners and murderers 
jackson sounded a similar theme during a portland ore news 
conference 
they want to exonerate him altogether jackson said its 
not just noriega others are dealing in drugs we cant indict them 
one day and exonerate them the next day that is no policy at all 
marlin fitzwater reagans press secretary told reporters the 
president was mortified about the endorsement flap he 
thought the speech was terrific he wrote it himself fitzwater 
said 
reagan issued a statement later that said i was surprised by 
the news reports that have said my endorsement last evening of the 
vice president was lukewarm i am enthusiastic fully committed 
and as i have said will go all out to make vice president bush 
the next president of the united states 
bush said he and reagan talked about the endorsement in advance 
he showed me those remarks he had handwritten said the vice 
president i still have them 
in other political developments 
the three major television reaffirmed their support of 
legislation to set a uniform poll closing time during presidential 
election years the legislation which has passed the house and is 
pending in the senate would order a 9 pm est poll simultaneous 
poll closing time 
gov mario cuomo of new york embarked on a political trip to 
the west coast and said he planned to have some fun attacking 
bush cuomo who resisted entreaties he get into the democratic 
race said he thought the contest for his partys nomination had 
strengthened dukakis 
dukakis is already a favorite in the polls and im not 
surprised said cuomo

nearly six months after congress tabbed yucca 
mountain nev as the permanent burial site for highlevel nuclear 
wastes a house panel began deliberations thursday on how to get 
the stuff there without risking a catastrophe 
house interior chairman morris k udall dariz noted that the 
yearslong struggle to pick a repository site for spent reactor 
fuel and other highly radioative junk may have been only half the 
battle 
no one wants a repository in his backyard but no one wants 
nuclear waste trucks driving down his street either he said 
major shipments of nuclear wastes principally from storage 
pools near the 110 nuclear power plants around the nation will not 
begin until the repository is completed early next century but 
nearly every state is on proposed transit routes 
industry officials told udalls energy subcommittee that past 
albiet limited experience in shipping highlevel wastes 
demonstrates no cause for alarm 
there has never been an accident in over 20 years of spent 
fuel shipment that has resulted in a release of radiation said 
da brodnick a nuclear specialist at the florida power amp light co 
but melinda kassen of the environmental defense fund said that 
although the people of the united states have been spared the 
consequences of an accident involving a release of radioactivity 
it is not because the government runs a technically unimpeachable 
program but rather because so far we have been lucky 
she pointed to a nuclear regulatory commission study which said 
an extreme accident involving a truck carrying one type of 
container used in the past called an lld1 could result in the 
release of a kilogram or 22 pounds of plutonium if that 
happened in a major urban area she said it could result in 
thousands of latent cancer deaths and billions of dollars in 
contamination damage 
udalls panel is considering a variety of bills designed to 
upgrade shipping standards including new requirements for the 
crashworthiness of shipping casks selection of routes and 
prenotification to communities along the way 
ron lurie the nuclear waste project manager for las vegas 
nev complained that his city was at the end of the 
transportation funnel to yucca mountain and that without a 
beltway bypass and alternative railroad spurs we will become 
exposed to the hazards and risks of thousands of road and rail 
shipments 
robert m jefferson an industry consultant said a study by the 
lawrence livermore laboratories indicated that using trucks there 
was a probability of one accident involving a measurable release of 
radiation for every 15 billion miles traveled 
jefferson said that assuming all shipments of spent fuel were 
made by truck there might be an accident which results in a 
minor release about every 1300 years with minimal public health 
consequences 
but rep james bilbray dnev said the energy department had 
told him its own calculations indicated an accident would be likely 
every 40 million truck miles and that he noted would be the 
mileage required to transport the waste already stored at reactor 
sites to say nothing of the amount that will be generated in the 
years ahead

george bush said thursday he couldnt 
be more pleased with president reagans endorsement of his 
republican presidential bid brushing aside as absolutely 
absurd suggestions that reagans support was unenthusiastic 
the gop nomineetobe refused to answer questions about a 
reported us deal with panamanian strongman manuel noriega that 
would involve dropping drug trafficking charges in exchange for his 
stepping down from power 
i favor getting noriega out bush told reporters at the 
honeywell defense avionics plant in albuquerque ive learned 
something from some experience in this when negotiations are 
going on that are sensitive you dont discuss them 
bush kicked off a sevenday western campaign swing with a slap 
at democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
we cannot afford a radical swing we cannot afford a president 
who opposes every step we are taking to keep our defense at the 
technological edge bush told the albuquerque rotary club after 
the defense plant tour he portrayed dukakis as someone who 
opposes the mx who opposes the midgetman who opposes testing of 
nuclear weapons who flirts with the withdrawal of our troops 
from south korea 
new mexico holds a primary on june 7 along with california new 
jersey and montana after the albuquerque stop bush flew to san 
diego he also planned to visit oregon before that states primary 
next tuesday 
the republican heirapparent to reagan was quick to reject 
suggestions that reagans endorsement wednesday night was less than 
he wanted 
i thought it was just great bush told reporters i 
couldnt have been more pleased 
he said he couldnt understand the commentary that the 
presidents endorsement was flat and uninspiring from the man he 
has loyally served for the past seven years 
where all this flak is coming from i heard about on the news 
its totally absurd he told reporters its much ado about 
nothing 
reagans endorsement was just three sentences in a speech that 
he delivered to a party dinner in washington 
on thursday the president issued a statement about the flap 
i was surprised by the news reports that have said my 
endorsement of last evening of the vice president was lukewarm i 
am enthusiastic fully committed and as i have said will go all 
out to make vice president bush the next president of the united 
states george has been a partner in all we have accomplished and 
he should be elected he has my full confidence and my total 
support i will campaign actively on his behalf 
bush said he and reagan had talked about the endorsement in 
advance 
he showed me those remarks he had handwritten i still 
have them bush said 
bush referred to reagans endorsement at the rotary club speech 
you may have seen that the president endorsed me last night that 
was a relief he said as the audience laughed 
bush aides were hesitant to comment on the reagan endorsement 
all bush campaign manager lee atwater would say was thats 
behind us now 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan was 
mystified that his endorsement was viewed as anything less than 
wholehearted 
he is mortified fitzwater said he thought the speech was 
terrific he wrote it himself he thought it was strong a full 
endorsement of his vice president who he thinks incredibly highly

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan on 
thursday urged the house to follow the senates lead and pass major 
legislation to give banks new securities underwriting powers 
greenspan said the federal reserve favored the approach taken by 
the senate which in late march approved legislation that would 
repeal most restrictions of the depressionera glasssteagall act 
that statute barred a mingling of the banking and securities 
industries 
the 1933 law was one of the reforms passed following the 1929 
stock market crash it was aimed at curbing the types of 
speculation which were blamed for the crash 
greenspan said that one of the attractive features of the senate 
legislation is that its nearcomplete repeal of the 
glasssteagall act allows for a market driven evolution of 
financial services and products 
i would urge the house in its deliberations in the months 
ahead to adopt an approach similar to that of the senate 
greenspan said 
however the senate proposal sponsored by sen william 
proxmire dwis faces an uncertain future opponents of the 
measure in the securities industry have an ally in rep fernand st 
germain dri chairman of the house banking committee 
once before in 1984 the senate passed a bill to give banks 
broader powers but the house has never done so 
greenspan made his comments in a speech to banking officials in 
chicago his remarks were also released in washington 
greenspan said the legislation did not represent a bailout for 
banks but was instead a reorganization of the financial services 
industry which would better serve the public 
the public benefits of expanded powers include not only a 
stronger and safer banking system but also the more efficient and 
convenient delivery of a wider array of lowercost financial 
services he said 
the senate bill would permit a company that owns a bank to also 
own a securities company as long as the two subsidiaries were 
operated separately the securities affiliate would be allowed to 
underwrite municipalrevenue bonds mortgagebacked securities and 
commercial paper within six months of the bill becoming law the 
legislation would allow the securities affiliates to begin 
underwriting mutual funds and corporate bonds 
in 1991 the legislation requires that congress vote on whether 
to allow the securities affiliates to take the next step of being 
able to underwrite corporate stock

the three major television networks renewed 
their support for a national uniformpollclosing time on thursday 
and promised in the meantime not to project a winner in any state 
in novembers presidential election before polls are closed in that 
state 
representatives of abc cbs and nbc told the senate rules 
committee they will make permanent their commitment to avoid early 
calling of state races if legislation is approved to have all polls 
in the continental united states close at 9 pm est 
sen brock adams dwash who conducted the hearing and is a 
strong supporter of the senate legislation drew the commitment 
from thomas ross senior vice president for news at nbc george 
watson vice president and washington bureau chief of capital 
cityabc news and warren mitofsky vice president election and 
survey unit cbs news 
adams and rep al swift dwash said however that the 
networks had made the commitment previously but that nbc had 
violated it during the new york democratic presidential primary 
swift who helped push a uniformclosingtime bill through the 
house in november showed the committee a videotape of the three 
networks during the new york primary in it nbc said exit polls 
indicated michael dukakis could be a big winner over jesse jackson 
even though many of the states polling places were still open 
i can assure you that it was an inadvertent aberration and it 
will not occur again said ross 
in 1984 adams said all three networks had declared president 
reagans reelection by 530 pm pst 
at that point only 3 percent of the vote had been tallied and 
polls in 26 states were still open said adams there is 
something wrong when voters in walla walla or boise do not feel

eastern time zone 8 pm in the central time zone and 7 pm in 
the mountain time zone 
in the pacific time zone daylight saving time would be extended 
until the sunday after election day this provision affecting 
california nevada oregon washington and the idaho panhandle

the house approved 208109 on nov 10 
sen ted stevens ralaska ranking committee republican 
expressed concern that the two states not in the continental united 
states would be exempt 
im not going to upset the agreement said stevens who has 
sought uniformpollclosing legislation since 1971 but i will 
look into this to see if we can get the offshore states involved 
when stevens asked if the networks would withhold declaring a 
presidential winner until the polls close in alaska and hawaii 
each of the representatives shook his head in the negative 
we have believed for a long time that when the polls close in 
a given state we should report what we know about what happened in 
that state said watson 
i dont think were prepared to withhold any information after 
the polls close in the continental united states 
james e landry senior vice president and general counsel of 
the air transport association of america which represents most of 
the scheduled airlines and james c benfield executive director 
of the daylight saving time coalition testified that they oppose

coast for two weeks every four years would disrupt airline 
schedules affect overnight service standards and result in the 
deterioration of quick deliveries

the deal the reagan administration is trying 
to make to remove panamanian military ruler manuel antonio noriega 
from power is prompting renewed concern over using plea bargains in 
criminal cases 
but even critics acknowledge that such negotiations while 
stirring public outrage at times are essential to prosecutors and 
the courts 
this takes the air out of the guts of agents who are busting 
their chops fighting drug smuggling joseph digenova a former 
us attorney in washington said of the noriega negotiations 
theyre going to ask why the hell was he indicted in the first 
place 
but digenova quickly added plea bargaining is perfectly 
proper it depends on the what the bargain is what does the us 
government get out of it 
the reagan administration said thursday it was discussing a deal 
that could result in the dropping of drugtrafficking charges 
against noriega in exchange for his agreement to relinquish power 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater refused to say if the 
drug charges were involved in the plea bargain 
white house chief of staff howard baker said if the arrangement 
works it would be the most fruitful and productive plea bargain 
that we have seen in a long time 
plea bargains resulting in reduced prison terms probation or 
dropped indictments sometimes may resemble distasteful deals with 
the devil but they are an entrenched part of the criminal justice 
system a vital tool for easing crowded court dockets or persuading 
a defendant to testify against a higherup in a criminal conspiracy 
prosecutors also bargain with defendants because they fear 
weaknesses in their cases settling for a reduced sentence rather 
than risking acquittal 
there are always plea bargains you would rather not make 
said lawrence barcella a former us attorney do i regret them 
yeah i regret a lot from the emotional standpoint from the 
intellectual standpoint i agree with all of them 
barcella said it may well be that the reagan administration 
views the presence of noriega as such a cancer on the people of 
panama that it is willing to let him off the hook to get him out 
of power 
but barcella also noted that there was a slim chance noriega 
ever would be brought to trial in the united states even if the 
charges against him were not dropped the difficulties in 
extraditing a foreign leader or forcing his expulsion from his 
homeland could be insurmountable he said 
one of the most publicized plea bargains in the nations history 
led to the resignation of thenvice president spiro t agnew on 
oct 10 1973 
agnew pleaded no contest to federal income tax evasion and was 
fined 10000 and sentenced to probation for three years 
agnew had been under investigation in a probe of alleged 
political graft and bribetaking dating back to his days as a 
county executive and then governor of maryland before richard nixon 
picked him as his running mate 
the plea agreement prompted outrage in some quarters but 
thenattorney general elliot l richardson said it was an honorable 
end to the justice departments investigation 
richardson said the evidence establishes a pattern of 
substantial cash payments to agnew while he was governor of 
maryland in return for state engineering contracts but the former 
attorney general said agnews resignation and the stain on his 
reputation were punishment enough 
in 1985 ef hutton amp co a leading wall street brokerage 
firm pleaded guilty to 2000 felony counts of mail and wire fraud 
in a 435 billion scheme to write checks exceeding funds on 
deposits at more than 400 banks 
no individuals were named in the charges and no one went to 
jail but hutton paid a 2 million fine plus 750000 to help pay 
for the governments investigation the company also agreed to set 
up an 8 million fund to make restitution to the banks 
attorney general edwin meese iii said the agreement sent a 
message to the business world that socalled whitecollar crime 
will not be tolerated 
but critics said the company and its officials escaped with 
barely a slap on the wrist 
the carter administration was criticized by some when in 1977 
former cia director richard c helms pleaded no contest to two 
misdemeanor charges of failing to testify fully about the agencys 
attempts to prevent the election of marxist salvador allende as 
president of chile in 1970 
the government said it accepted the plea to avoid accidental 
disclosure of government secrets if helms went to trial 
helms was fined 2000 placed on probation for a year and 
declared in disgrace and shame by us district judge 
barrington d parker 
in contrast a plea agreement in march this year involving 
former presidential aide robert c mcfarlane caused hardly a ripple 
mcfarlane pleaded guilty to misleading congress by assuring 
lawyers the reagan administration was not helping arm nicaraguan 
rebels during a ban on us military aid 
mcfarlane has not yet been sentenced

jewish leaders said thursday that president 
reagan had assured them he will press soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev at the moscow summit to make good on promised human 
rights gains 
morris b abram chairman of the national conference on soviet 
jewry quoted reagan as saying in no way are the soviets going 
to get us to retreat from these principals and from the insistence 
to their obedience to their obligations 
abram accompanied by simcha dinitz former israeli ambassador 
to the united states told reporters outside the white house that 
the meeting went extremely well 
reagan will travel to helsinki finland on may 25 and make a 
presummit speech en route to his may 29june 2 summit with 
gorbachev 
abram credited the president with having absolutely 
institutionalized the use of summitry to advance the cause of human 
rights and soviet jewry in a way that it can never be ignored by 
any subsequent administration 
and the proof of that is that on oct 10 1987 prior to the 
washington summit last year chairman gorbachev for the first time 
joined the president of the united states in a statement that human 
rights and humanitarian affairs would be on the agenda something 
they had never admitted before as a matter that was rightfully on 
the agenda 
dinitz was asked whether he thought gorbachev would be willing 
to make major headway in improving jewish emigration rights given 
the kremlin leaders boast during the washington summit that im 
not on trial here 
i might say he might not be on trial said dinitz chairman 
of the world zionist organization and the jewish agency israel 
but the action and behavior with regard to human rights are on 
trial and the prosecutor so to speak is not the president of the 
united states but the conscience of mankind 
we are all aware of the fact that at the last summit meeting 
mr gorbachev said to the president by what right do you have to 
challenge us on those questions abram said the right is 
derived from documents they themselves signed 
and to be fair about it there has been an improvement of the 
emigration figures in the last few months under mr gorbachev 
abram said he said there had been about 1100 emigrations in the 
first four months of 1988 compared with about 1000 in an entire 
year before gorbachevs ascension to power 
but abram said the figures were even higher under leonid i 
brezhnev before the advent of gorbachev and his glasnost 
society 
we welcome improvement and with every improvement we will 
say on behalf of the national conference on soviet jewry things 
are improving but they are a long way from fulfilling their 
obligations under international undertakings he said

new york gov mario cuomo headed for the 
west coast on thursday to have some fun attacking vice 
president george bush the likely republican presidential nominee 
and help raise money for democrats 
since im never going to leave the bullpen i may as well get 
out there for some scrimmaging said the former minor league 
baseball player who was once considered a potential 1988 democratic 
presidential nominee i may as well have some fun 
cuomo said he would use a friday night appearance in san 
francisco on behalf of rep nancy pelosi and one in seattle on 
saturday night for washington gov booth gardner to go after bush 
in between cuomo was to stop in portland ore to deliver a 
foreign policy speech 
cuomo said the battle for the democratic nomination now 
expected to go to massachusetts gov michael dukakis had been good 
for the party 
they had virtually no contest said cuomo of the 
republicans offering a preview of his attacks on bush they 
would have us believe that it was because they were all eager to 
speak with just one voice the voice of george bush i think its 
because they have nothing to say 
we will ask him bush to use his voice to tell us why he 
hasnt used his voice for eight years said cuomo 
the new york governors west coast trip planned months ago was 
once viewed as possible evidence that cuomo had hopes of a 
deadlocked national convention turning to him with its presidential 
nomination 
cuomos portland speech on saturday comes just three days before 
the oregon presidential primary the california primary is june 7 
however that was all before the april 19 new york presidential 
primary when dukakis stormed ahead of jesse jackson in the delegate 
count and buried tennessee sen albert gore jrs faltering 
campaign with no help from cuomo 
cuomo said thursday that his address saturday to the oregon 
world affairs council would focus on ussoviet relations the 
governor spent a week in the soviet union in september 
one need not be a candidate to have an opinion said cuomo 
and what if hes asked about a possible 1992 presidential 
campaign 
please forget 92 i have the state to deal with said 
cuomo

the soviet union is turning increasingly to 
barter arrangements with other countries in an effort to stretch 
its declining reserves of foreign currency an agriculture 
department analyst said thursday 
foreign currency is tight for the soviet government which in 
turn has decreased the soviet unions buying power significantly 
said thomas hamby of the departments foreign agricultural service 
hamby now the agencys deputy director of marketing for dairy 
livestock and poultry recently returned from moscow after 2 years 
as us agricultural attache his remarks were in a new issue of 
the agencys foreign agriculture magazine 
the soviets make it plain they are in a better position to 
exchange products for foreign goods than to pay in foreign currency 
this is a difficult constraint on trade from the us 
standpoint hamby said the soviet union simply does not have the 
ability to supply the quantity or quality of either agricultural or 
nonagricultural products which would make a barter arrangement 
feasible 
hamby said the united states imports only about 25 million 
worth of soviet agricultural products each year while the soviet 
unions imports of us farm products averages around 2 billion 
annually 
this situation has led to continuing soviet pressure to lift 
us import restrictions on soviet furskins and other commodities 
and pressure for mostfavorednation mfn trade status which 
would give the soviet union preferential access to the us 
market he said 
under mfn the united states would grant the soviet union the 
same trading privileges that it offers most other foreign trading 
partners the mfn designation for the soviet union has been held up 
for years because of moscows restrictive emigration policies 
these issues are likely to persist in any trade negotiation 
between the soviet union and the united states hamby said 
currently negotiators are working on a successor to the fiveyear 
grain agreement between the soviet union and the united states

a shipment of girl scout cookies 
winged out of texas on thursday on its second trip to us sailors 
in japan after a brownie troop got a taste of the power of politics 
sailors aboard the uss midway stationed in atsugi bought the 
402 boxes from brownie troop 807 in beeville but the plan crumbled 
when the the girls were told that the cookies faced a stiff customs 
tariff in japan 
the cookies were sent back and sat in an american airlines 
office at the corpus christi international airport for more than a 
week 
the sweets finally left thursday morning on a flight to dallas 
where the thin mints golden yangles scot ts savannahs jubilees 
classic cremes and hoedowns caught a connecting nonstop flight to 
tokyo said officials for the airline which provided free 
transportation 
theyre on the way and the red tape should be turning to 
green by now marchetta white the troops leader said thursday 
the shipment was to arrive friday afternoon in japan 
mrs white said us navy personnel originally told her the 
japanese demanded a tariff of more than 2000 before releasing the 
cookies from customs 
but the consulategeneral of japan in houston last week 
attributed the cookie misfortune to insufficient communications 
among those who are involved with customs clearance 
a spokesman for the consulate said the import fees amounted to 
about 20000 yen or about 150 according to a statement issued by 
the consulate there would have been no customs fee if the us 
armed forces had taken necessary procedures 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas worked through diplomatic channels 
to get the cookies to the sailors without a customs fee and sent a 
telegram to the brownies on wednesday 
this all happened because you wanted to do something nice for 
some sailors serving our country on the other side of the the world 
the telegram said now everyone has seen how helpful 
brownies in texas are 
he added that he was sure the cookie monster is pleased 
too 
the 18member brownie troop first started corresponding with the 
sailors at christmas then sent a valentines day package and 
finally the april 26 shipment of cookies mrs white said 
they could not send the cookies by mail because it would have 
been too expensive mrs white said and the airline offered free 
shipment 
everybody who was supposed to be getting the cookies was 
really upset when they didnt get them said petty officer 3rd 
class sid woolford mrs whites soninlaw who is stationed on 
the midway and on leave in beeville 
the girls prepared another gift for the sailors wednesday by 
posing on the steps of the bee county courthouse for a color photo 
they will send the sailors said mrs white 
meanwhile she added the troop will wait to hear how the 
sailors liked the cookies theyre waiting for the letters that 
will be coming to them again

the army unveiled a massive study thursday 
designed to support its biological warfare research program 
portraying the work as safe to the environment essential to 
national security and a boon to science 
in recognition of the potentially hazardous nature of this 
type of research the defense department as well as the 
scientific community has developed and implemented elaborate 
controls to assure adequate protection for the work force and 
virtually total protection for the external environment the army 
concluded in a draft environmental impact statement 
the history of the biological defense research program 
illustrates the effectiveness of these controls additional 
mitigation was not found to be justified 
the report which runs several hundred pages was condemned 
quickly by the environmental group that forced its preparation as 
shoddy and incomplete 
they have not complied with the spirit or the letter of the 
court order against them said jeremy rifkin the president of 
the foundation on economic trends 
we are putting the defense department on notice that unless 
they completely revise the method and content of the environmental 
impact study we will file suit again rifkin said 
the environmental study was prompted by a lawsuit rifkins group 
filed in september 1986 the foundation is a washingtonbased 
environmental activist group that has long focused its attention on 
the dangers of biological research and genetic engineering 
within the biological field the united states has committed 
itself by international treaty not to develop offensive biological 
weapons however the army maintains a large defensive program 
aimed at developing vaccines and antidotes detection systems and 
battlefield gear that could be used to protect american soldiers if 
attacked with natural or manmade poisons 
in order to develop such defenses laboratories must work with a 
variety of deadly toxins 
according to the pentagon roughly 60 million is now being 
spent yearly on such research at more than 100 military university 
and private laboratories in 27 states and eight foreign countries 
the foundations suit sought to stop the research on grounds the 
program had grown so large that an impact study had become a legal 
necessity the pentagon agreed to submit the environmental study as 
long as it could continue the work in the interim 
in essence the army concluded thursday its operating procedures 
and lab safety features had evolved to the point that even severe 
accidents would not create significant risk or impact upon the 
quality of the human environment 
it is recognized that controversy exists concerning the need 
and appropriateness of the biological defense research program 
the study continued but defense against biological weapons is 
considered a vital component of the overall defense posture of the 
united states and its allies 
and certain aspects of the program should be recognized as 
beneficial a large portion of the bdrp effort is for basic 
research and development 
offering us conclusory statements that everything is ok is 
simply immaterial andy kimbrell a foundation attorney said 
the legal standard here is a hard look analysis of possible 
hazards and this isnt a hard look for example they list 129 
laboratories across the country and dont tell us exactly whats 
going on at those labs what organisms are being researched and 
what security and precautions have been taken thats 
unacceptable 
ironically the army released its impact study just one day 
after a senate subcommittee blasted the pentagon for serious 
deficiencies in the safety management of both the biological and 
chemical warfare research programs 
the majority staff of the senate governmental affairs oversight 
subcommittee reported it had found inadequate regulations lax 
safety enforcement and documented safety lapses 
in the biological weapons area the review found that there is 
no comprehensive set of safety regulations for research with 
biological warfare agents and toxins no emphasis on safety in 
the contractor program and no office that monitors contractor 
safety

democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
goes into next weeks colorado state convention with a slight lead 
over jesse jackson according to the latest count of convention 
delegates 
wednesdays count of delegates to the may 21 convention in 
boulder showed 52 percent supporting dukakis 38 percent backing 
jackson and 10 percent uncommited or supporting another candidate 
but unless dukakis can pick up nearly all of those uncommitted 
delegates at the state convention he will split the 16 colorado 
national delegates with jackson 
i am committed to making that 60 percent threshold said tom 
glass dukakis state campaign coordinator it is very clear that 
dukakis will have a clear majority of the delegates to the state 
convention but it would be very tough to get a 106 split

harold washington would not have been amused 
by a painting showing him in womens lingerie but the late mayor 
wouldnt have gone along with aldermen who stormed the exhibit and 
had the work removed a longtime friend said thursday 
he would have been the first one to say the artist has a right 
to do whatever the artist does former mayoral press secretary 
alton miller said a day after the outraged aldermen had police 
confiscate the painting from the school of the art institute 
officer patrick camden said police removed the painting for 
safekeeping because of the possibility of inciting civil unrest 
he said it would be returned thursday 
the painting by student david k nelson depicts washington 
wearing a frilly white bra panties and stockings holding a pencil 
and frowning out at viewers it had been displayed in a school hall 
with dozens of others in a student competition 
the school offers a fouryear bachelor of arts program and a 
twoyear masters degree said kevin frech a spokesman for the 
private school whose sister institution is the adjacent art musuem 
the exhibit is closed to the public but the aldermen say they 
got involved after receiving numerous complaints from angry 
constituents who had seen the painting 
they contend the work titled mirth and girth is an insult to 
washington 
but a group of students argue the painting is artistic 
selfexpression and protected by the first amendment 
washington would have agreed with both assessments miller said 
he would not have been amused and would have seen the 
painting as aiding and abetting a campaign waged by his 
detractors to raise questions about his character miller said in a 
telephone interview 
but miller added washington would have strongly felt that in 
terms of either ordinance statute or constitutional law theres 
absolutely no way that it can be suppressed 
i dont think its the most tasteful portrait but i dont 
think that matters nelson told radio station wlup 
nobody said when i went to the art institute that i had to 
produce tasteful artwork in fact that goes against everything 
the institution is about he said its like saying you have to 
produce artwork in a certain way 
at the school a group of about 15 people marched peacefully 
outside thursday to protest the painting as the board of directors 
met inside to discuss the matter 
frech said he did not know what options the board was 
considering 
civil liberties experts and legal scholars took the students 
side 
were against censorship and this seems to be a form of 
censorship said jay miller executive director of the american 
civil liberties union of illinois 
daniel polsby a northwestern university law professor called 
the aldermens behavior constitutionally indefensible 
they behaved like a lynch mob and very seriously violated the 
civil rights of the artist as well as the art institute 
alderman allan streeter who was among those who stormed the 
school and helped draft a resolution demanding that the painting be 
removed said hes aware of the constitutional issues involved 
theres a moral question that outweighs the constitutional 
question he said thursday 
the city of chicago gives the art institute which oversees the 
school subsidies of 5 million a year as well as other public 
and private funds and we dont feel that any institution private 
or public has a right to portray a leader of any community in 
such a derogatory fashion he said 
alderman robert shaw who sponsored the resolution said police 
removed the painting because it posed a threat to the safety to 
the school and the general community 
people particularly from the black community are highly 
perturbed using it mildly about this particular portrait 
shaw said washington who died in november was the citys first 
black mayor 
miller said the aclu was looking for the student and would 
represent him if he chose to protest the case in court

house speaker jim wright is keeping on 
indefinitely a press aide who was the focus of controversy due to 
angry letters he wrote to newspapers and revelations he was the 
author of a sex book 
wright and george mair 59 originally had agreed to a sixmonth 
contract that was due to expire at the end of may 
but wright decided tuesday after talking to mair that he would 
keep the press aide on his staff as another hand at the oar 
mair said thursday 
mair and wright are working together on a book on the 200year 
history of congress which celebrates its bicentennial in april 
1989 mair said he will concentrate on media liaison work helping 
the speaker research material for newspaper opinion columns and 
revive the democratic congressmans newsletter to the constituents 
in his texas district 
rumors circulated in january a month after mair was hired that 
he would be resigning following revelations he was the author of a 
book of reviews of 113 books on sex love and romance 
were two honorable men who stick by our word mair said 
we both told everyone i would have a sixmonth trial period and 
everyone became astonished when we kept our word and i was 
astonished that everyone was astonished 
wright in january had distanced himself from a series of 
intemperate letters written by mair to 19 newspapers including one 
to the los angeles times suggesting two reporters had engaged in 
plagiarism in their profile of the speaker 
the los angeles times angrily protested mairs letter 
other recipients of angry letters included the wall street 
journal newsweek and us news amp world report 
wright apologized for the letters saying at the time while i 
am as concerned as george over lack of balance in some of this 
coverage angry letters obviously do little to correct it 
i wrote 19 letters but only five were reported on mair 
said of criticism of him then i wrote a book on love and 
intimacy and relations between men and women i just wrote 113 book 
reviews it was originally titled a guide to books on love and 
intimacy but it was changed to the sex book digest 
mair an author of numerous books a former columnist for the 
los angeles times syndicate and a former editor and publisher of 
the alexandria va gazette said his letters did not reflect that 
he is against my fellow journalists he said his letter 
outlined patent outright lies 
i talked to almost all of those people i wrote letters to and 
several said they checked back the story and found the reporter did 
not have the facts straight and thats all i asked he said

the federal aviation administration on 
thursday proposed that existing airline seats be modified to better 
protect passengers during hard or crash landings and that seats on 
new aircraft offer similar protection 
the upgraded seats would increase passengers chances of 
escaping survivable accidents without serious injury and would be 
less likely to reak loose and block aisles allowing easier 
emergency evacuation the faa said 
faa administrator allan mcartor said the seats would meet new 
dynamic test standards that simulate actual crash loads and are 
consistent with current floor strength levels the new seats would 
also be required to absorb some of the impact of a crash landing 
without passing it on to the passengers 
under the faas proposed rules airlines would have seven years 
to retrofit their fleets with better seats starting from the time 
that new aircraft were required to carry upgraded seats 
the proposal is based on a fiveyear research and development 
program by the faa and the national aeronautics and space 
administration the program used dummies to monitor human tolerance 
for crash impact forces

a man charged with drunken driving 
was allowed to plead guilty to speeding in exchange for a 20000 
donation to a drug task force a plea bargain that has angered some 
residents 
district attorney general david crockett said the benefit to the 
public outweighed the mandatory 48hour jail term 250 fine and 
yearlong drivers license suspension for firsttime drunken driving 
convictions 
tom donihe of kingsport pleaded guilty friday to the reduced 
charge 
donihe was arrested in april 1986 after he was clocked driving 
at 78 mph and had a blood alcohol level of 015 percent police 
said legal intoxication in tennessee is 010 percent 
the leaders of two area chapters of mothers against drunk 
driving criticized crockett for accepting the offer by donihes 
lawyer 
elizabeth price head of the johnson city madd chapter is 
calling for crocketts resignation 
if i wasnt a christian i could tell you what i really 
think she said i feel that the people who let him off are the 
real criminals 
lynda fortner president of the madd chapter in kingsport said 
the decision to accept a plea bargain in the case almost sounds 
like a bribe 
ive weighed the criticism and im willing to take it 
crockett said we have successfully prosecuted several thousand 
drunk drivers if we made a mistake in the case then my batting 
average is still 99999 of doing the right thing 
criminal court judge arden hill who approved the plea bargain 
expressed some reservation before accepting the plea saying it 
bothers my conscience 
crockett whose teenage son was killed in a 1986 traffic 
accident has been a vocal opponent of drunken driving 
he said the contribution to the first judicial drug task force 
which he helped found was a proper disposition of the case 
the unit made up of officers from various agencies 
investigates drug cases in four counties it is funded with court 
fines private donations and tax dollars from local governments

a sworn statement said the broadway performer was held for eight 
hours before he was killed may 4 and attempts were made to make the 
death look like an accident 
the death of the britishborn rose 68 winner of tony awards 
for the mystery of edwin drood and a revival of my fair 
lady had originally been blamed on a singlecar accident 
police and doctors said thursday that cocaine was found on rose 
and that laboratory tests performed in miami showed traces of a 
cocaine derivative in his body at the time of his death 
a statement read by police spokesman col aquiles cruz gomez at 
a news conference said three men were arrested and a fourth suspect 
was at large 
the statement said the three confessed to police that they 
planned the crime when they noticed mr george rose felt certain 
amorous weaknesses for another 14year old minor 
the three roses adopted son domingo antonio ralfe vazquez 
nicknamed juan the young mans natural father juan antonio 
vazquez padilla and the youths uncle maximo padilla vazquez 
appeared at the news conference and told reporters they took part 
in the actors death 
what i really wanted was to take revenge on the american rose 
because of his homosexual activities since he was hurting a lot of 
boys in this sector in addition to mine whom he had already 
prostituted since the age of 13 said a sworn statement from juan 
antonio vazquez padilla distributed to reporters by police 
the statement said the youth the youths uncle and another man 
he paid 200 agreed to take rose to an isolated location and kill 
him 
on may 4 when rose was driving his car to the city of santiago 
with his adopted son the three other men waited by the side of the 
road near the north coast town of sosua and forced the car to stop 
they got in leaving the adopted son behind and drove to a 
nearby farm where they held rose for eight hours before killing 
him it said 
around 8 pm we clubbed him to death beating him on the 
head the statement said 
the fathers statement said the men took the money from roses 
pockets and divided it but left his documents intact they then 
put roses body in the car and drove to a small ditch where we 
flipped the car over to make it look like a traffic accident 
results of an autopsy released monday described the death as 
accidental but pathologist sergio sarita told reporters thursday 
the final report indicated the death was not an accident but a 
homicide 
he said investigations indicated the car was impacted at a 
very slow speed that would not have exceeded 15 kilometers per hour 
just over 9 mph so roses injuries could not have been from 
that impact 
sarita said tests in miami showed traces of a cocaine derivative 
in roses urine but none in his brain 
while examining roses documents at the site where the body 
was found police found he was carrying an amount of cocaine in 
his purse said the police statement 
rose had owned a beach home outside sosua about 15 miles east 
of puerto plata for the past nine years 
his adopted son who lived in the house said in a sworn 
statement released by police that he met rose six years ago when he 
was a student and that rose suggested adopting him in 1985 
he said his real father agreed and the adoption was legal 
the youth said in the statement that on april 30 he told his 
father rose was returning to the island in a few days and that i 
felt bad because he had shown he felt a certain weakness for a 
minor who lived in our house 
rose who had lived in new york city since 1961 was a versatile 
actor who was as much at home playing shakespeare as he was in a 
comedy or a musical he preferred the stage but also appeared in 
scores of motion pictures and television productions 
a memorial service is planned for may 25 at the shubert theater

state prison inmates with aids sometimes get 
improper medical care and are being unnecessarily denied freedom 
for the final days of their lives a prison watchdog group charged 
thursday 
the correctional association of new york said an 18month 
investigation demonstrated that the prison system and state 
government have not responded adequately to aids in the prisons 
aids and prison is proving to be a devastating combination 
said cathy potler author of the report 
among other things the association urged mandatory education 
about aids for prisoners and staff expanded and bettersupervised 
medical care and new provisions to allow the release of terminally 
ill prisoners 
new york which has more aids cases than any other state also 
has more prisoners with aids 
as of the end of last year 597 aids cases had been confirmed 
among new yorks prison inmates said state prison system spokesman 
james flateau of those 346 inmates died while in prison 152 had 
been released and 99 remained in custody he said about 100 aids 
cases and 120 cases of aidsrelated complex are in the 
42000inmate system 
there is no known cure for acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
which is fatal 
the association had medical consultants and nonmedical 
investigators visit several prisons to prepare its report 
the group said it also found that inmates suffering from aids 
are often shunned by other inmates who are afraid of even casual 
contact inmate barbers at one prison refused to give haircuts to 
men with aids said the report 
and while prison officials told the association that the 
hysteria initially expressed by the security staff has subsided 
considerably over the last three years the watchdog group still 
found evidence of fear 
state corrections commissioner thomas coughlin said the 
associations medical team should have spent more time in the 
prisons 
much of the report consists of the opinions of nonmedical 
researchers supported by unattributed comments by staff and 
inmates the content of which may or may not be accurate 
coughlin said

a federal judge questioned thursday whether the 
government alone can drop the drug indictment against panamas gen 
manuel antonio noriega and local prosecutors inisted they want to 
try the case 
my understanding and knowledge of the law is that the 
presiding judge is not required to dismiss an indictment on the 
motion of the government said us district judge william 
hoeveler who is handling the case however i am having the law 
researched further 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday that the 
reagan administration is discussing a deal that could result in the 
dropping of drug trafficking charges against noriega in exchange 
for his agreement to relinquish power 
the lead prosecutor in the case chief assistant us attorney 
richard gregorie said thursday he strongly opposes any deal 
i am against the dismissal and right now i am ready to try 
this case said gregorie gregories boss us attorney leon 
kellner released a statement through his executive assistant ana 
barnett following his meeting with attorney general edwin meese iii 
in washington 
he would not discuss the details of his talk with mr meese 
but he said i presented my views ms barnett said i am 
authorized to say his views havent changed and he wants to 
proceed with the case and hes ready to proceed with the trial 
kellner has previously vowed not to dismiss the indictment but 
noriegas attorneys said the government has little choice 
general noriega believes and always has believed that the 
indictment against him was a political indictment his attorney 
neal sonnett said thursday so a dismissal of the indictment 
would have to be a precondition to any discussions 
sonnetts associate attorney raymond takiff was called back to 
panama on thursday following the revelations about a possible deal 
us attorney robert merkle who brought a separate indictment 
in tampa against noriega refused comment thursday on reports he 
has threatened to quit if the charges are dropped 
merkle was in jacksonville prosecuting carlos lehder rivas 
alleged to be a member of the same medellin cartel that prosecutors 
say paid noriega to protect its interest 
noriega is charged in a 12count miami indictment with accepting 
46 million in bribes from the cartel in tampa he faces three 
marijuana importation counts 
the possibility of a deal was good news for noriegas 
codefendants 
brian davidow the only defendant arrested in the miami case 
also should have his case dismissed said his attorney richard 
sharpstein 
gregorie agreed 
if they made me dismiss this case i would dismiss against mr 
davidow and all the other defendants the prosecutor said it 
would be a travesty of justice to proceed against any of the 
defendants if the case against the chief defendant was dismissed

a panel of federal officials thursday 
recommended legislative and other changes to encourage adoption 
which it said was too often forgotten ignored or misunderstood 
as an alternative to abortion 
the interagency task force on adoption also said the pool of 
adoptive parents should expand and martial status age or physical 
disabilities should not preclude individuals from consideration as 
prospective parents 
however it curtly dismissed the demands of some gay rights 
organizations for expanded rights for gay men and lesbians to adopt 
children saying only the task force does not support adoption 
by homosexuals 
the panel said it was preferable that a child be placed in a 
family of his or her own racial background but adoption across 
racial lines should be permissible to provide a child with a 
loving permanent home 
the report of the 13member task force appointed by president 
reagan last august was made public after the president himself an 
adoptive parent presented it to representatives of private 
agencies in an oval office meeting 
the task force said about 40 percent of the 1 million american 
teenagers who become pregnant each year have abortions of the 
teenagers who have their babies it said at least 90 percent end 
up parenting them 
a prevailing view appears to be that if a woman does not get 
an abortion she must want to have a baby and take care of him 
herself the panel said the option which gives life to a baby 
while offering hope to the biological parents and joy to adoptive 
parents is too often forgotten ignored or misunderstood 
the task force recommended that states consider a law adopted in 
california that reimburses licensed nonprofit maternity homes for 
the costs of materinty home care and services necessary for a woman 
under 21 to carry her baby to full term 
it also recommended that states consider legislation which it 
said at least 20 have already adopted exempting directors and 
officers on nonprofit orgqanizations from liability suits unless 
willful or wanton misconduct is involved it said such legislation 
is needed because adoption agencies have been hit hard by rising 
liability insurance costs 
the task force recommended support for pending federal 
legislation concering social security benefits for adopted children 
and health insurance coverage for disabled adopted children 
children often remain in foster care programs for too long a 
period of time before a plan for adoption is developed the panel 
said it recommended procedures for more timely termination of 
parental rights establishment of foster care review boards 
accountability and supervision of agency caseworkers and related 
steps 
the chairman of the task force was mary sheila gall counselor 
to the director of the office of personnel management and the 
single adoptive parent of two children 
other members included representatives from the white house 
justice department treasury deparrtment department of health and 
human services department of education department of defense 
department of agriculture department of labor and commodity 
futures trading commission

the interior department may again drastically 
lower its estimates of undiscovered oil and gas that can be 
recovered from federal waters according to preliminary figures 
released thursday 
if the estimates are not revised during public review the 
department would show 37 percent less undiscovered oil and gas both 
onshore and offshore compared with currently used figures 
part of the lowered estimates result from the decline in crude 
oil prices which means small highcost reservoirs are dropped 
from the list of prospects because it doesnt pay to recover the 
oil and gas there 
oil today costs about 18 a barrel and the new estimates are 
based on that price in 1981 the price was almost double that 
part of the decline however represents dry holes notably in 
alaska 
by coincidence the new offshore estimates came the same day the 
energy department released what it meant to be a cheery estimate of 
the nations total natural gas reserves discovered and 
undiscovered 
the energy department said these amount to a 35year supply 583 
trillion cubic feet at current usage rates and a wellhead price of 
3 per thousand cubic feet the current price is 183 
in asking for industry and scientific comment on the new 
offshore oil and gas estimates the interior department declined to 
make comparisons with existing figures officials said they wanted 
to emphasize by their reticence the tentative subjecttorevision 
nature of the estimates 
but simple arithmetic showed the offshore oil estimate off 27 
percent from the figure in current use and the gas estimate down 18 
percent 89 billion barrels of oil compaired with 122 billion 
barrels and 74 trillion cubic feet of gas compared with 905 
trillion cubic feet 
in march preliminary new onshore estimates showed unrecovered 
oil down 39 percent and gas down 41 percent oil 334 billion 
barrels compared with 546 billion gas 254 trillion cubic feet 
compared with 427 trillion cubic feet 
combined that means estimated oil remaining to be found dropped 
from 668 billion barrels to 423 billion and gas fell from 518 
trillion cubic feet to 328 trillion 
the current onshore figures were compiled in 1984 and themselves 
represented reductions from 1981 estimates of 55 percent for oil 
and 44 percent for gas current onshore estimates were made in 1981 
some offshore areas showed little change but alaskas federal 
waters were almost wiped out as a promising place to look the new 
estimates showed no gas at all there compared with almost 14 
trillion cubic feet in 1984 and 900 million barrels of oil 
compared with 33 billion 
gas estimates for the gulf of mexico were raised largely 
because of the extension of drilling to deeper water in recent 
years 643 trillion cubic feet compared with 596 trillion cubic 
feet the oil estimate was down slightly to 56 billion barrels 
from 60 billion 
pacific coast oil estimates were about the same as before at 21 
billion barrels gas of 47 trillion cubic feet was down from 52 
trillion the atlantic coast oil estimate was lowered from 680 
million barrels to 250 million and the gas estimate slashed from 
123 trillion cubic feet to 45 trillion 
a gas price of 5 would draw into the market only an additional 
10year supply 174 trillion cubic feet the study said this fiure 
and other estimates would be substantially larger if the 
analysts had incorporated forseeable new technologies but they 
stuck strictly with known technologies in the interest of being 
conservative said the study director william l fisher 
the study made no price forecasts the departments energy 
information administration projects that gas will rise to only 
285 in 1995 and 402 in 2000 
nicholas bush president of the natural gas supply association 
a producer group said the energy departments findings were very 
positive ones for producers and consumers alike 
i think the study is deceptive said ed rothschild 
assistant director of the citizenlabor energy coalition a 
consumer advocacy group 
it doesnt look at gas at 2 which is a much more realistic 
price and when you do there isnt as much gas there

new procedures have been designed to regulate 
the inspection of imported meat and poultry including the 
permanent marking of shipments that fail to meet us standards 
the agriculture department announced thursday 
each consignment that fails to pass us inspection would be 
stamped us refused entry on each carcass or packing 
container said lester m crawford administrator of the 
departments food safety and inspection service 
this will help ensure that rejected meat and poultry does not 
get into the human food supply in the united states he said 
it will also warn other countries where the products might be 
subsequently shipped that the us has rejected the items 
products that are refused entry must be removed from the united 
states converted to animal food or destroyed previously such 
products were identified with temporary placards and had to be 
closely monitored by usda employees 
the new regulation which takes effect june 12 also will 
eliminate a requirement that products refused entry be sealed 
before being transported in the united states since the permanent 
markings will serve to identify it 
crawford said the new rule also reinstates the practice of 
controlled prestamping in which import inspectors can put 
their passed mark on containers of imported products before the 
inspection has been fully carried out 
this procedure is especially useful at cold storage facilities 
so that meat and poultry can be stamped and samples taken for 
testing and inspection if there are no problems the products 
dont have to be handled again he said if the products fail 
inspection inspectors can remove the marks and stamp the products 
indelibly as refused 
in a related action the agency announced a proposal to allow 
imported meat and poultry to be inspected only at the port where 
the products are unloaded currently the products can be shipped 
across the country to another port for checking by usda inspectors 
crawford said the proposal which will be open for public 
comment until july 12 would give federal inspectors much better 
control of imported products entering food channels in the united 
states

a house appropriations panel cut more than 
780 million out of the nasa budget thursday and agency officials 
said the reduction could seriously affect the civil space program 
in the markup of appropriations for the national aeronautics and 
space administration the appropriations committees subcommittee 
on housing and urban development and independent agencies approved 
a total budget for fiscal year 1989 of 10706 billion nasa had 
asked for 11488 billion 
while that subcommittee was cutting the budget the full house 
committee on science space and technology authorized the total 
dollars that nasa had requested making only minor changes in 
distribution of the funding but this action will have little 
effect if the funds are not appropriated 
the budget reduction by the appropriations subcommittee is 
really going to hurt the program there is no more slack left in 
nasa said shuttle astronaut jon mcbride on assignment in nasas 
congressional relations office something will have to be cut 
theres nothing left if they do make these cuts some serious 
things will happen to the civil space program 
in one of the largest reductions the appropriations 
subcommittee cut nasas request for the struggling space shuttle 
program by more than 200 million the language of the bill would 
let nasa decide what shuttle program activities will be eliminated 
nasa had asked for 3610 billion to improve and start flying 
the shuttle again but the subcommittee agreed to appropriate only 
34 billion 
this will be one of the toughest cuts to accommodate said 
terry dawson a staff member of the house subcommittee on space 
science and applications 
dawson said some of the shuttle program items that could be 
affected include manufacture of spare parts an effort to enhance 
the performance of the rocket engines and fuel pumps on the orbiter 
and the scheduling of missions it would not however affect the 
resumption of shuttle flights 
its going to hurt them no matter what they do said mcbride 
the space shuttle has been grounded since january 1986 when the 
explosion of the challenger shuttle killed seven crew members the 
winged spacecraft fleet is scheduled to resume flights in august 
appropriations subcommittee members also cut 65 million from 
the 967 million nasa had requested for development of the space 
station dawson said the 902 million allocation would allow the 
space station program to continue will little effect 
other cuts with the original nasa request in parenthesis 
include 
advanced xray astrophysics facility an astronomy satellite 
16 million 27 million 
commercial development space facility a privately built 
orbiting factory that nasa was to lease zero a 25 million 
appropriation from last year was rescinded 
titan 4 launch rocket 23 million 43 million 
the subcommittee also cut nasa plans to buy a delta ii and a 
titan 3 launch rocket 
the markedup bill is expected to go to the full appropriations 
committee where it could be changed later this month it then 
must go to the full house for a vote before it can be considered by 
the senate

the house intelligence committee said thursday 
it has approved and sent to the full house legislation that would 
require the president to notify congress within 48 hours when he 
authorizes covert intelligence missions 
the bill which grew out of the recommendations of the 
congressional panels that investigated the irancontra affair was 
approved wednesday on an 11to6 partyline vote and announced 
thursday by the committee 
it is similar to a covertaction measure passed march 15 by the 
senate on a vote of 71 to 19 
a central dispute in the irancontra affair was the approval by 
president reagan of a secret armsforhostages swap which was not 
discovered for 10 months after it was authorized even though the 
law requires notification of congress in a timely fashion 
the congressional irancontra committees recommended that the 
law be changed to eliminate all ambiguity 
the house and senate bills would require the president to make a 
written finding that any covert action is required on national 
security grounds and to provide copies to the congressional 
intelligence oversight committees 
the committees would have to be given prior notice of such 
actions unless an emergency prevented notification in such cases 
the president would have up to 48 hours to get word to congress 
the president also would have to tell congress which agencies 
are to be involved in the covert action and disclose whether 
private third parties are to be involved as they were in the 
irancontra affair 
under the bill a covert action is any us activity other than 
traditional military diplomatic and law enforcement actions 
designed to influence political economic or military conditions 
abroad so that the role of the united states government is not 
intended to be apparent or acknowledged publicly 
as it considered amendments to the measure the 
democratcontrolled panel rejected an effort by rep dick cheney 
rwyo to leave an exemption from the 48hour notice requirement 
the committee also rejected an effort by rep bob livingston 
rla to provide for fines up to 20000 and up to five years in 
prison for unauthorized disclosure of classified information

a singleengine plane that ran out of gas 
barely missed a football field full of students before making an 
crash landing on the grounds of a high school thursday 
the two men in the plane suffered minor injuries but none of 
the students at bishop denis j oconnell high school was hurt 
said steven hynson a spokesman for the arlington fire department 
the pilot did his very best and did an excellent job of 
getting around them said hynson he was extremely low when he

students as it descended 
the aircraft knocked down a 40foot flagpole touched down on 
the surface of the track surrounding the field leapfrogged at an 
awkward angle down the length of the field and slammed to a stop 
in an embankment it was prevented from going any further by an 
eightfoot chainlink fence at the top of the small hill that faced 
a residential road and a house across the street 
the crash landing broke the planes landing gear and smashed the 
aircrafts nose

field and a class of boys playing softball 
they were fortunate in three things said hynson one is 
that he the pilot could maneuver the plane two is that he didnt

she also gave a representative of president francois mitterrand 
a letter from a group of journalists working for andersons 
release urging the french to use their contacts to seek freedom 
for 18 other foreign hostages including nine americans still held 
by proiranian groups in lebanon 
they told terry he was going home she said describing 
diplomat marcel fontaines last moments with her brother after they 
had shared a room for several months anderson packed and was led 
away she said but it was fontaine 45 who was released along 
with diplomat marcel carton 64 and journalist jeanpaul 
kauffmann 44 
the frenchmen gave her other details about the us hostages 
mrs say said but she said they did not want them made public 
unless hostage relatives agree theres always a danger the 
families have to decide if talking about it is worth the risk 
she said 
meeting with the frenchmen however gave her the feeling that 
hes okay hes going to survive she said 
mrs say said the french hostages were released because france 
was willing to deal with iran and because the french government 
journalists and people apparently place a higher value on human 
life than the americans the french deny that any ransom was paid 
the french hostages had a feeling that the americans had been 
abandoned said mrs say 
the french people wanted the hostages released they gave 
their government room to maneuver she said adding that the 
scandal over us arms shipments to iran in exchange for hostages 
has doused us popular concern for their release 
mrs say said state department claims that her government puts 
the highest priority on human life are inconsistent with the 
governments refusal to negotiate or give any concessions for the 
release of hostages

a federal judge thursday refused to halt the 
shipment from china of two giant pandas to help celebrate the 150th 
anniversary of toledo ohio 
us district judge norma holloway johnson refused to grant a 
temporary restraining order sought by the world wildlife fund to 
prevent the two giant pandas from being shipped by air from 
shanghai to this country on friday 
the fund and the american association of zoological parks and 
aquariums charged that the exhibition of the pandas would violate 
an international convention that prohibits trafficking in 
endangered species for commercial purposes 
but the judge ruled that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate 
a substantial likelihood of success on the merits to warrant 
issuance of a temporary restraining order 
the denial of a temporary restraining order cannot be appealed 
so the judges ruling cleared the way for the shipment of the 
pandas 
the pandas which are set to arrive in seattle on friday 
afternoon will spend 100 days to 200 days at the toledo zoo 
the plaintiffs claimed toledo zoo officials were interested in 
the pandas only for their fundraising potential 
the toledo zoo does not plan to and indeed would not be 
authorized by the peoples republic of china to breed the pandas or 
to study them scientifically the filing said 
instead it wants to use the estimated 19 million to be earned 
from the exhibition to improve a building parking lots and other 
facilities they added in a memorandum to the court 
this is precisely the kind of commercial activity condemned by 
international law and us law the memorandum said 
zoo attorney randal c teague sr said his client had spent 19 
million to build a panda house plus another 11 million for ramps 
and other improvements at the zoo 
the plaintiffs called the giant panda one of the earths most 
critically endangered animals with fewer than 1000 surviving in 
the wild 
the suit named as defendants interior secretary donald p hodel 
and frank h dunkle director of the us fish and wildlife 
service because they issued an import permit 
the memorandum called the decision to grant the permit 
arbitrary capricious an abuse of discretion and not in 
accordance with the law 
earlier the fund asked that permits be denied for exhibitions 
of pandas in atlanta cincinnati and detroit as well as toledo 
one potential exhibitor denied that the purpose was commercial 
certainly we are not a circus or a carnival or even a zoo 
for that matter said tom washington executive director of the 
michigan united conservation clubs there is a whole string of 
hypocrisy involved here

afghan rebels shot down a soviet 
helicopter gunship thursday as red army troops evacuated their 
biggest garrison in eastern afghanistan prior to the start of a 
soviet troop withdrawal guerrillas said 
if they want an honorable return from afghanistan the soviets 
should have talked to us gulbaddin hekmatyar told a news 
conference hours after rebels reportedly shot down an mi24 
gunship in jalalabad 
hekmatyar heads the sevenparty afghan resistance alliance 
we consider the soviet presence in afghanistan an aggression 
that will continue until the last soviet soldier is in our 
homeland therefore fighting cannot stop he added 
people coming from jalalabad say the russians are sending 
their heavy equipment to kabul said a rebel official identified 
only as kabir a member of the military committee of the yunis 
khalis faction of hezbiislami guerrilla group kabir said an 
airlift was under way 
a western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity quoted 
rebel sources as saying the gunship had been shot down no details 
were available 
according to the sources up to 60 soviet trucks headed west 
thursday toward kabul 110 miles from the jalalabad garrison 
the diplomat said about the reported attack on the helicopter 
it would indicate the soviets have resorted to using close air 
support again during their withdrawal 
both the soviets and the afghans virtually stopped using their 
air force in 1986 because the islamic antimarxist guerrillas 
started shooting down aircraft with ussupplied stinger missiles 
in moscow the soviet military charged thursday that foreign 
sponsors have stepped up arms shipments to the rebels and sent in 
more military advisers endangering soviet troops who are scheduled 
to start withdrawing may 15 under an agreement reached in geneva 
last month 
a civil war has raged in afghanistan since april 1978 when a 
sovietinspired revolution brought a marxist government to power 
about 115000 soviet soldiers intervened in december 1979 to help 
the kabul government and stayed on to help fight the insurrection 
reports reaching pakistan said the soviets 66th brigade 
estimated at 4000 men will be deployed in the kabul area after 
leaving jalalabad 30 miles from pakistan an afghan division will 
replace them 
jalalabad is the second major garrison evacuated by the soviets 
following the april 22 withdrawal from barikot 
hekmatyar said 12 administrative districts and many military 
posts fell to the rebels in recent weeks he said the government is 
vacating the areas since it fears that otherwise the afghan 
troops and militia will surrender to mujahedeen moslem 
fighters 
he said garrisons in the south and north were vacated and not 
just those in the east as afghan leader najib claimed two weeks 
ago najib said this was to facilitate the return of afghan 
refugees from pakistan 
about 3 million afghan refugees live in pakistan and an 
additional 2 million in iran 
a pushtu language newscast by stateowned radio kabul monitored 
in islamabad on thursday confirmed hekmatyars assertion that 
evacuation of garrisons is taking place in a large part of 
afghanistan not just the east 
hekmatyar claimed that except for the kandahar air base and the 
military outpost of spinboldak all of southeastern kandahar 
province is under rebel control 
he balked at un mediator diego cordovezs proposal for 
convening a meeting of all parties to the afghan dispute so a 
government acceptable to the rebels the refugees and najibs 
government can be formed cordovez made the proposal in an article 
published monday by the washington post 
there is no place for such a conference hekmatyar said 
thursday we will ourselves elect the parliament which will form 
the government 
cordovez brokered the geneva accord signed by pakistan 
afghanistan the united states and the soviet union which provided 
for soviet troop withdrawal

a 450pound siberian tiger smashed through a 
reinforced window thursday dragged a veteran houston zoo worker 
into its outdoor area and mauled him to death officials said 
ricardo tovar 59 apparently was peering through a 
quarterinchthick glassandwiremesh window when the tiger broke 
through and pulled him outside zoo director john werler said the 
window was in a door leading from a hallway to the tigers natural 
habitat area outside 
at this time and until there is more information we cannot be 
sure just how the accident happened werler said during a news 
conference no one saw or heard the attack 
the 11yearold male tiger named miguel was isolated after the 
attack but was not going to be destroyed because it is a member of 
an endangered species werler said 
tovar a 10year zoo employee was the first worker to die at 
the zoo 
john gilbert senior zookeeper of cats said he realized that 
something was wrong was about 745 am when he called to his 
coworker and the tiger reared up and put his face into the 
door it was unclear how long the attack had gone undiscovered 
tovars shift began at 6 am 
it cut him up and ate him up pretty good houston fire 
department paramedic howard shaw said adding thats much of 
tovars left arm was torn away he had numerous bites about him 
and possibly a broken neck 
tom dieckow curator of exhibits and leader of the zoos 
response team fired a rifle into the ground three times to try and 
scare the 11yearold cat away from tovars body 
workers were finally able to force the animal back into its cage 
with a fire extinguisher dieckow said 
zoo officials praised tovar as a good employee 
ive known him for 18 years i worked with him at the san 
antonio zoo he was very competent he knew his job said nelson 
herwig a friend of tovars and curator of the zoos aquarium for 
10 years 
the tiger was aggressive wehler said it snarls and growls 
and we have some cats that have neither of those dispositions he 
said 
but he said the tiger poses no threat to the public because 
there are three doors between the publics area and the tigers 
area 
because the siberian tiger is an endangered species the zoo 
would have to get federal permission to kill it herwig said 
the siberian tiger is the largest of eight kinds of tigers and 
can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds

a man accused of slaying 16 people was 
convicted thursday and sentenced to death in the holiday season 
shooting rampage that left a man and a woman dead he immediately 
asked that the sentence be carried out as soon as possible so that 
the torture and suffering within me would end 
a franklin county circuit court jury deliberated less than 1 
hours before convicting r gene simmons of capital murder and five 
counts of attempted capital murder they then heard arguments on 
whether to sentence him to death or to life in prison without 
parole and later returned the death penalty 
this trial which started monday stemmed from a 45minute 
shooting spree in russellville on dec 28 
simmons 47 is scheduled to stand trial again in july in the 
deaths of his wife seven children four grandchildren and two 
inlaws whose bodies were found in and around his house after the 
rampage ended they had all been shot or strangled 
after circuit judge john s patterson ratified the death penalty 
verdict simmons put on his glasses and in a calm voice read a 
brief statement asking that the sentence be carried out as soon as 
possible 
it is my wish and my desire that absolutely no action by 
anybody be taken to appeal or in any way change this sentence 
simmons said 
it is further respectfully requested that this sentence be 
carried out expeditiously i want no action that will delay deny 
defer or denounce this very correct and proper death sentence 
i only ask for what i deserve he said let the torture 
and suffering in me end please allow me the right to be at peace 
afterward the judge said it was not clear whether simmons had 
the legal right to cancel the automatic appeal provided for death 
sentences in state law 
under arkansas law the death penalty would be carried out by 
lethal injection 
earlier prosecutor john bynum arguing for death for the 
retired air force master sergeant had said there is nothing in 
the record that says this man is entitled to a break nothing 
defense attorney robert e irwin who had rested his case 
without calling any witnesses asked the jury for mercy 
one thing is certain ronald gene simmons is going to die in 
prison irwin said the only question is whether it is by our 
hand or by some act of providence or by a merciful god 
later another defense attorney john harris said they had 
urged simmons not to ask for the death penalty but now felt duty 
bound not to oppose him 
he wanted the death sentence he felt like he deserved it 
harris said and he wanted us as his attorneys to do everything 
within our power to see that he could get the death sentence if 
you can imagine that 
simmons was found guilty of capital murder the deaths of two 
people made it a capital crime and of five counts of attempted 
capital murder for the four people who were wounded and a fifth 
person who was fired at but not hit 
jurors reduced a kidnapping charge to firstdegree false 
imprisonment and also convicted simmons of that charge 
in addition to the death penalty on the murder charge the 
jurors sentenced simmons to 30 years for each of four attempted 
capital murder counts 20 years for the fifth attempted murder 
count and seven years for firstdegree false imprisonment 
patterson ordered that those sentences be served consecutively 
in his closing statement irwin argued that the state did not 
support its contention the murders were premeditated and that there 
were no tests to link simmons to the murder weapons and other 
evidence 
but bynum said such tests were unnecessary because of the number 
of witnesses and the testimony from russellville police chief herb 
johnston that simmons handed him the murder weapon 
the evidence in this case is strong its stout bynum said 
among the spectators in the standingroomonly courtroom were 
viola oshields and her husband roger relatives of some of the 
simmons family victims 
tears welling in her eyes mrs oshields displayed a photograph 
of one of the victims simmons 17yearold daughter loretta 
isnt it a shame she said 
killed were kathy kendrick 24 who reportedly had spurned 
simmons advances a year before the shooting and james chaffin 
33 described by police as a chance victim she was shot at the law 
office where she worked while he was shot at an oil company 
a state ballistics expert paul mcdonald testified that bullets 
that killed kendrick and chaffin and bullets found at a market 
where two people were wounded had been fired by the same nineshot 
revolver that simmons handed to police when he surrendered 
the trial was moved to ozark because of extensive pretrial 
publicity

was carlos lehder rivas responsible 
for smuggling tons of cocaine into this country from his native 
colombia or was he victimized by a group of deceitful american 
smugglers who are cooperating with prosecutors to reduce their own 
legal problems 
those are the contrasting points of view advanced by attorneys 
for the government and defense in closing arguments in lehders 
trial on cocainesmuggling charges 
us attorney robert merkle in his rebuttal arguments thursday 
said lehder wore masks that have been stripped away by the 
evidence 
merkle was scheduled to finish his arguments friday morning and 
the jury was expected to get the case later in the day 
he blasted closing arguments by defense attorney edward r 
shohat saying it was an attempt to plant a seed of doubt in your 
mind that is not there 
all he wants to do is to create doubt in one persons mind 
because your verdict has to be unanimous merkle told jurors 
lehder 38 and codefendant jack carlton reed 57 are on trial 
on charges they conspired to smuggle some 33 tons of cocaine into 
the united states from colombia via lehders private bahamian 
island normans cay from 1978 to 1980 
the prosecutor contends the colombian was responsible for 
smuggling 18000 kilograms into the united states and had earned 
20 million 
merkle challenged arguments by defense attorneys that lehder was 
victimized by convicted drug smuggler ed ward and members of his 
american organization 
ward was just another pilot merkle said 
shohat ended his arguments for lehder on thursday by telling the 
jury to do what you feel is right 
the jury must not condemn lehder based on the prosecutions 
attacks on his character said shohat but must stick to the 
specific charges contained in the 11count indictment 
shohat spent the morning again hammering away at what he said 
were inconsistencies in the testimony of government witnesses many 
of whom were admitted smugglers given immunity for their testimony 
later merkle said the attack on the credibility of the 
witnesses is this case is so much sound and fury 
shohat had said the chief prosecution witness convicted 
smuggler ed ward was given the break of a lifetime for his 
testimony against lehder getting a possible 215year sentence and 
59 million fine cut to less than six years in prison 
shohat went through what he termed the litany of lies 
testified to by several members of wards group of american 
smugglers 
these people planned to dump on mr lehder these people knew 
how to get an american express card to freedom he said 
lehder who officials have said was a key member of colombias 
violent medellin cartel is charged with conspiracy possession of 
cocaine with intent to distribute importation of cocaine and 
operating a continuing criminal enterprise he was arrested near 
the colombian town of medellin in february 1987 after a shootout 
and was immediately flown to florida for trial

five people were arrested thursday on 
charges of running a treasurehunting scam that fleeced 700 
investors of 17 million 
this was a treasure salvage company but the only treasure 
found was the money that was taken from the pockets of investors 
state comptroller gerald lewis said 
the three companies accused of wrongdoing traded on the success 
of the treasurehunter mel fisher who found spanish treasure ships 
off the florida keys and retrieved gold and jewels worth millions 
of dollars lewis said 
the people bought a ship from mel fisher and they bought 
apparently a small amount of treasure so they could show this and 
use it and use mel fishers name lewis said 
lewis said the operators falsely claimed they found three 
wrecks no treasurehunting was ever done and no treasure was 
found he said 
instead the defendants pocketed investors money and it is 
unlikely they will get any of it back the comptroller said 
fisher is not involved in any of the operations and is not 
accused of any wrongdoing lewis said 
the five people arrested were indicted by a grand jury may 5 on 
charges of fraud sale of unregistered securities and racketeering 
the three agencies that announced the arrests also are 
investigating as many as 15 other treasurehunting operations 
seeking investors with treasure fever lewis said most of the 
bogus operations are in florida but a few are out of state 
most of those under investigation also have been trading on 
fishers success

the white house said thursday the united 
states was immersed in diplomatic plea bargaining aimed at 
coaxing panamas gen antonio manuel noriega from power while a 
us attorney urged that the drug indictments against the 
panamanian ruler be prosecuted rather than dropped 
were still talking chief presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said what this amounts to is a plea bargain 
maybe something will come of it and maybe something will 
not he said 
at the justice department us attorney leon kellner of miami 
whose office obtained an indictment against noriega met with 
attorney general edwin meese iii and later issued a statement 
saying he wants to carry out the noriega prosecution 
i am authorized to say his views havent changed and he wants 
to proceed with the case and hes ready to proceed with the 
trial said ana barnett kellners executive assistant meese 
declined to comment on the noriega situation kellner said through 
barnett i presented my views but he refused to discuss 
details 
administration sources said wednesday the indictments against 
the de facto panamanian ruler would be dropped if he stepped down 
and left the country for a year the sources declining to be 
identified publicly said the justice department objected to the 
offer which was approved at a white house meeting 
when reporters pressed fitzwater on thursday on the legal and 
other ramifications of such a deal he said i offer no 
definition of plea bargaining 
he said no direct negotiations have taken place with noriega on 
the matter 
the administration move reflected increasing frustration with 
the failure to dislodge noriega after weeks of diplomatic economic 
and political pressure but it was criticized immediately 
i dont think you drop indictments against drug pushers and 
people suspected of murder democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis said 
fitzwater appeared in the white house briefing room not long 
after chief of staff howard baker talked sympathatically of 
arranging a deal to win noriegas removal baker told cbstv such a 
legal arrangement would be the most fruitful and productive plea 
bargain 
fitzwater said reagan obviously has directed the negotiations 
that have gone on there but i wont go further he stressed that 
there have been no direct talks between reagan and noriega 
an administration source said wednesday that if noriega accepts 
the deal he would step down probably in august and would stay out 
of panama until after the next presidential elections there in 1989 
the deal was approved tuesday at a white house meeting over the 
objections of meese the source said 
in panama noriega was quoted as saying in the army newspaper 
critica one of his propaganda organs there cannot be and will 
not be a deal while aggression against panama and plans for 
dismantling the popular forces continue to form part of the 
administrations plan 
deputy assistant secretary of state michael g kozak went to 
panama early last week and has been conferring with noriega and his 
representatives ever since according to administration sources who 
spoke on condition they not be named 
fitzwater refused either to name the us contacts in the 
negotiations with noriega or say what sorts of incentives were 
being offered by this country 
you may characterize it as plea bargaining but im not saying 
whats on the table he said we wont discuss whos directly 
involved 
in miami the federal judge handling the noriega case questioned 
whether the government alone can drop the drug indictment 
my understanding and knowledge of the law is that the 
presiding judge is not required to dismiss an indictment on the 
motion of the government us district judge william hoeveler 
said however i am having the law researched further 
noriegas attorney neal sonnett said the panamanian ruler 
always has believed that the indictment against him was a 
political indictment so a dismissal of the indictment would have 
to be a precondition to any discussions 
noriega a onetime close associate of the late panamanian leader 
omar torrijos has headed the panamanian defense forces for nearly 
five years in february he refused an order from president eric 
arturo delvalle to resign and then fired delvalle who has been in 
hiding since 
there were earlier reports of a us willingness to allow 
noriega to go into exile without pursuing his extradition and in 
early april there were reports that the state department was 
advocating kidnaping 
baker acknowledged april 9 that an array of economic sanctions 
including the freezing of panamanian assets in this country and the 
withholding of us payments to the panama treaty commission have 
hurt the people more than they have hurt noriega 
nbc news quoting an american official it did not identify said 
wednesday night that reagan had decided to support dismissing the 
indictments after national security council advisers warned that 
further delay in getting noriega out could lead to a political 
alliance between noriega and cuban leader fidel cstro fitzwater 
would not comment on that 
dukakis wasnt alone thursday in reacting to the possibility of 
dropping the indictments 
sen john kerry dmass said if descriptions of the offer were 
accurate it would appear to be a victory for noriega allowing his 
loyalists to retain control while he spent a years vacation on 
the riviera 
if i was a cop in boston or miami or somewhere id sit there 
and say this administration has sent a signal that crime does 
pay kerry said in a cbs interview 
sen alfonse damato rny said i think itd be a terrible 
mistake to take the word of a drugdealing killer dictator that 
hes going to get out and allow free elections sometime next year 
and hed be allowed to stay in until august and the only thing 
youre going to have is a transferance of power to his cronies 
damato said of the administrations dealings with panama 
what we have here is an administration thats set its hair on 
fire and is trying to put it out with a hammer 
ambassador juan sosa said noriegas opponents cannot accept the 
dropping of charges without any arrangements made for next years 
election the restructuring of the defense forces noriega controls 
or the setting up of a government of reconciliation

israeli soldiers prohibited residents from 
leaving the occupied gaza strip on thursday trying to reduce the 
violence expected in jerusalem at the close of the moslem holy 
month of ramadan 
in the west bank prime minister yitzhak shamir told the people 
of hebron bloodshed would end if they stopped the 5monthold 
rebellion against israeli occupation the violence has taken the 
lives of 186 palestinians and two israelis 
the israeli air force made its eighth raid into lebanon this 
year attacking palestinian targets south of beirut lebanese 
police said six fighterbombers took part in the attack at barja 
16 miles outside beirut 
an israeli army spokesman said the ban on leaving the coastal 
gaza strip where 600000 palestinians live began at 10 pm and 
would last until further notice 
he said the closure did not apply to the west bank home to 
about 900000 palestinians but police spokesman alex lapidoth said 
extra soldiers were at roadblocks between the west bank and holy 
city and they were being more strict 
closing off gaza was intended to to lessen the potential for 
violence during the period beginning with the moslem night of 
fate thursday and continuing through friday the last moslem 
sabbath of ramadan 
israeli officials have expressed fear that mass prayer services 
thursday and friday on sacred haram al sharif would lead to riots 
in arab east jerusalem haram al sharif means noble enclosure and 
is the arab name for temple mount 
the ban also might run through the last day of ramadan early 
next week the holy month ends monday or tuesday depending on when 
the new moon is sighted 
tens of thousands of moslem worshipers traditionally come to 
jerusalem for the night of fate marking the revelation of the 
holy koran to the prophet mohammed more come for sabbath prayers 
on the final friday of ramadan 
israel radio said about 10000 worshipers prayed thursday night 
at temple mount site of the dome of the rock and al aqsa mosques 
it said several hundred raised the outlawed palestinian flag 
chanted slogans and threw stones at military police who responded 
with rubber bullets 
reports by the state and army radios said a policeman was hit in 
the head by a stone and 38 palestinians were arrested there were 
no reports of arab wounded 
israel television said police and troops would turn back groups 
of palestinians trying to enter the city thursday and friday in an 
effort to reduce the crowds on temple mount which also is sacred 
to jews 
about 3000 police began patrolling the hill and surrounding 
areas residents reported a huge police presence in east jerusalem 
israels police commissioner david kraus said all necessary 
measures would be taken to prevent disturbances 
officials also are worried about violence sunday israelis will 
honor both the nations 40th anniversary and the 21st anniversary 
of the seizure of arab east jerusalem in the 1967 middle east war 
when the west bank and gaza were captured 
israel radio said the army had decided to begin reopening west 
bank schools early next week it said elementary schools would open 
first followed by the higher levels if no disturbances occurred 
an army spokesman said he could not comment on the report the 
schools were closed feb 2 because they had become rallying points 
for protesters 
israel radio said about 200 prisoners in the occupied 
territories would be freed friday as a goodwill gesture for the 
close of ramadan the army spokesman confirmed prisoners would be 
released but said he did not know how many 
soldiers fired on palestinian protesters in nablus wounding 
five arab reports and hospital officials said the army reported 
three wounded 
shamir visited hebron the second largest city in the west bank 
for the first time since violence began in the occupied territories 
dec 8 and toured the openair market 
he appealed through an interpreter for an end to the violence 
and an arab rejoined the government should start treating the 
palestinians as human beings especially now during religious 
celebrations 
the prime ministers reply the population should start to 
behave and not only during holidays if there would be quiet and 
order nothing would be done against the population

the senate on thursday was trying to find a 
way to increase us military involvement in the war against 
illegal drugs but bogged down in a dispute over whether to give 
the navy new powers to arrest drug traffickers in international 
waters 
the dispute centered around a pentagon budget bill which the 
senate is trying to finish the argument over the antidrug 
provision is the major remaining hurdle and senate leaders said 
they dont expect to pass the bill before friday 
defense secretary frank c carlucci attended a closeddoor 
series of meetings at the capitol to discuss the antidrug plans 
which have been proposed in response to what legislators say is 
public demand to do more to halt drugtrafficking 
were all looking for a way to have the military more involved 
in a meaningful way in the war against drugs said sen sam nunn 
dga chairman of the armed services committee and the chief 
author of one antidrug proposal 
the bill authorizes defense spending in the fiscal year starting 
oct 1 of 2995 billion the same total contained in a separate 
pentagon budget bill passed wednesday by the house differences 
between the measures will be worked out later by a housesenate 
conference committee 
the house bill contains a provision ordering president reagan to 
have the military substantially halt the penetration of us 
borders by ships and planes carrying illegal drugs 
the plan proposed by nunn is not as far reaching but it would 
make the pentagon the chief federal agency in halting illegal 
drugtrafficking and also would have the pentagon provide more 
coordination and communications to other drugfighting agencies 
such as the drug enforcement administration and the coast guard 
making the defense department the chief federal agency for 
antidrug efforts would mean it would have to approve actions by 
all other federal agencies 
another proposal authored by sens pete wilson rcalif and 
alfonse damato rny would allow us military personnel to 
make antidrug arrests outside us borders such as beyond the 
threemile limit recognized by the united states 
nunn damato and wilson said they were trying to craft their 
separate proposals into a single bill but the main sticking point 
was over whether to give the military arrest powers in 
international waters 
the plan will not be approved before friday nunn said 
asked about the reaction of pentagon officials damato said 
theyre not happy theyre not doing cartwheels 
the military is now barred from enforcing civilian laws by the 
posse comitatus act an 1878 law enacted to halt the practice of 
having the army enforce laws in the postcivil war southern states 
that law was amended in 1981 to permit the military to provide 
some aid and us military surveillance information is now passed 
along to some civilian agencies in addition coast guard officials 
now travel aboard navy ships patrolling the caribbean sea 
carlucci has offered to have the pentagon do more in the 
antidrug effort although he opposes having the military make 
arrests 
pentagon spokesman dan howard said thursday that the military 
can slow but not halt the flow of drugs 
if the effort here is to reduce the amount of drugs coming 
into this country it can be done howard said if the effort 
is expected to stop drugs coming into this country it cannot be 
done unless you do it on the demand side ways will be found 
the military can track planes howard noted but its 
difficult to tell the difference between a civilian flight and one 
that is engaged in drug smuggling 
we have ample military resources to be able to stop every 
aircraft at our border but in fact thats a much more complex 
problem than i think most people realize he said 
as it worked through the bill thursday the senate 
voted 5739 to kill an effort to ban most us underground 
nuclear testing the house in its version of the bill approved an 
underground test ban meaning the issue will have to be resolved by 
the conference committee 
voted 6432 to restore a buy america requirement which 
requires the petnagon to buy us products including anthracite 
coal the pentagon says it already has a fouryear supply of the 
coal and doesnt need any more 
killed on a 6037 vote a proposal that would have halted the 
sending of any us combat troops to leftistruled nicaragua or its 
neighbor honduras the troop ban was approved last week by the 
house meaning the issue will have to be decided by the conference 
reagan has said repeatedly the united states has no intention of 
sending combat troops to nicaragua 
killed on a 6136 vote a plan to reduce spending for the 
railroad version of the mx nucleartipped missile from 700 million 
to 200 using the extra 500 million to buy more nonnuclear 
weapons the house proposes to spend only 100 million for the rail 
version of the mx 
rejected 8213 the latest proposal to have the senate express 
a formal opinion on reagans persian gulf policy the amendment 
would have required a detailed report from reagan outlining his 
plans for navy involvement in the wartorn region and would have 
given congress 15 days after that to formally vote on the policy

phone service to chicagos western suburbs will 
not be fully restored until late in june following a fire at a 
switching station that caused the worst service disruption in the 
companys history illinois bell said thursday 
james eibel illinois bells vice president of operations said 
significant progress has been made in restoring telephone 
circuits passing through its west suburban hinsdale switching 
center which was heavily damaged by fire sunday 
but he told a news conference it would take at least until the 
third week in june before all 35000 customers affected by the 
outage have full service phones in all or parts of six western 
suburbs have been dead since the fire 
this was the most severe service disruption illinois bell has 
had in its history eibel said of the 107yearold company the 
scope and complexity of the repair work far exceeds anything weve 
had in the past and that includes any natural disasters 
illinois bell investigators have still not determined the cause 
of the fire 
by overhauling damaged local switching equipment as a stopgap 
measure the phone company hoped to restore 21000 service lines by 
sunday eibel said but he cautioned that this was the most 
optimistic projection 
eibel said he could not guarantee the old equipment would hold 
up against corrosion caused by the chemical reaction from smoke and 
water sprayed by firefighters 
emergency service to hospitals police and fire departments the 
companys first priority may be back in service in the next couple 
of days eibel said 
illinois bell employees were working roundtheclock thursday to 
install new equipment which should be in place by june 1 although 
it will take another three weeks to restore service to all local 
residents eibel said it normally takes 50 weeks to install a 
completely new system 
the telephone company was having more success in repairing 
damage to 13000 special lines used by businesses and the 
trunking service knocked out by the fire at the hinsdale 
station 
about half of the trunking service had been restored by 
thursday and all 118000 circuits connecting the western and 
southwestern suburbs with the rest of the chicago metropolitan area 
and long distance providers should be back in service by late 
sunday eibel said 
he expected that the business service lines would be fully back 
in operation by the end of next week special service lines are 
used by business customers for a variety of purposes including 
data transmission 
eibel acknowledged a considerable delay in the time between when 
the fire was first reported at the unmanned switching station and 
the arrival of firefighters to fight the blaze 
bell received an alarm at 350 pm at a monitoring station in 
springfield more than 150 miles away but it was not until 420 
pm that a full fire alarm sounded eibel said 
after another 30 minutes an employee arrived to check out the 
alarm but he had to hail down a passing motorist to alert 
firefighters because the phones were already out of service 
firefighters did not arrive at the scene until after 5 pm 
the phone company was reviewing its fire prevention measures in 
light of the fire eibel said 
meanwhile residents were trying to cope as best as possible 
with the lack of phone service people lined up at mobile trailers 
with public coin phone stations at six locations in the western 
suburbs 
its been very inconvenient said sandy barthick assistant 
editor of a telecommunications trade paper in hinsdale ive been 
doing all my phone work from my home in chicago

chinese herbs and antiseptics are the 
newest weapons in the war against cavities and gum disease 
researchers said thursday 
theyre as common as the common cold university of maryland 
dental school microbiologist barbara margaret said of gum problems 
and tooth decay 
speaking at the 88th annual convention of the american society 
for microbiology she said her study involved having patients with 
gum disease dip special toothbrushes in a mild prescription 
antibiotic called chlordexidine and then brush 
within one to three weeks plaquecausing bacteria decreased 
she said 
this is an attempt to combine treatments a mechanical cleaning 
with the use of a mild antiseptic she said the upanddown 
scraping dislodge the bacteria 
the seven patients in the test group used tiny 
christmastreeshaped brushes designed to get the antibiotic 
solution in pockets of infection near tooth roots they use the 
technique in conjunction with regular brushing said margaret who 
hopes to soon launch a larger study 
extracts of plants used in chinese folk medicine also appear 
promising in the fight against tooth decay and gum disease said 
university of colorado microbiologist christine wuyuan 
she started her research after a 1984 trip to taiwan where 
dentists prescribe herbs for patients 
they know it works but they dont know why it works she 
said chinese folk medicine is rich with plantderived products 
used to treat gum disease and maintain oral health we looked at 
herbs that can affect cavities and gum disease 
she pulverized 40 kinds of plants that she found in chinese 
markets in chicago and san francisco and mixed the extracts with 
bacteria commonly found in mouths 
fortytwo percent of the extracts inhibited bacterial growth 
including 10 percent that outright killed the germs she said 
she refused to name the plants used saying corporations are 
pressing her for that information 
ms wuyuan said the next step is further research on the 
promising extracts using patients instead of bacteria and 
finetuning the amounts that could be used in a toothpaste or 
mouthwash 
a lot of the time with gum disease there are no symptoms so 
people dont take it seriously until their teeth are in danger of 
falling out she said

nicaraguan vice president sergio ramirez said 
thursday his government is willing to allow immediate delivery of 
humanitarian supplies to rebels in nicaragua and he denied his 
government is trying to starve the contras into submission 
we are in full disposition to accept that the contra forces 
could receive humanitarian aid inside nicaragua tomorrow if 
possible ramirez told reporters after a 1hour meeting with 
house speaker jim wright dtexas and other democratic 
congressional leaders 
we are not trying to gain this war through starvation 
ramirez said 
the visit appeared to be in part an effort to counter reagan 
administration accusations that nicaraguas leftist sandinista 
government is dragging its feet in peace talks to delay food and 
medical supplies destined for the rebels under a 48 million aid 
package passed by congress earlier this year 
there were some things necessary to clarify here about the 
serious attitude of the government of nicaragua toward permitting 
the rebels to receive nonmilitary supplies ramirez said 
a temporary ceasefire agreement in nicaraguas sevenyear war 
reached march 23 called for aid to the contras to be delivered by a 
neutral agency but there has been no agreement on who that 
delivery agent should be 
the sandinistas have proposed the red cross the very symbol 
of neutrality in the world according to ramirez but the rebels 
have rejected that idea 
ramirez said he was meeting later in the day with secretary 
general joao baena soares of the organization of american states to 
hear his proposals for delivering the aid and said he would take 
that information back to managua 
im sure we can agree without problems on some way to 
deliver the aid he said if they dont want to accept the red 
cross we are willing to discuss other proposals 
ramirez also said he was confident talks aimed at reaching a 
longterm peace accord would resume soon the rebels have proposed 
resumption of formal talks on may 19 but the sandinistas want to 
schedule one or two preliminary private rounds of talks first 
the 60day temporary ceasefire runs out at the end of the 
month and ramirez reiterated his governments belief that some 
extension of the temporary truce will be necessary perhaps for 
another 30 to 60 days

the senate on thursday easily rejected the 
latest attempt to have the chamber express a formal opinion on 
president reagans expanded policy of protecting shipping in the 
wartorn persian gulf 
the senate voted 8213 to table and thus kill an amendment to 
a pentagon budget bill that would have required a report from 
reagan outlining his policy 
the proposal would have required specifics about the us goals 
anticipated length of deployment and the rules under which us 
weapons would be fired 
the plan was offered by sen brock adams dwash who again 
criticized his colleagues for refusing to vote on whether the 
senate approves of reagans yearold policy 
adams a critic of the administration policy told his fellow 
senators that for over a year we have danced around the issues 
reagans policy involves having the navy protect 11 reflagged 
kuwaiti tankers in the gulf which has been the scene of fighting 
in the long iraniraq war kuwait is an iraqi ally 
the us policy recently was expanded to provide american 
protection to neutral merchant ships who are attacked and who seek 
us help from navy warships 
that expanded policy came in the wake of an april 18 clash 
between the navy and iran in which the navy sank or damaged six 
iranian vessels it was the latest in a series of military fights 
between the navy and iran 
congress has yet to vote formal approval or disapproval of 
reagans policy the senate also has rejected adams repeated 
efforts to invoke the war powers act that is the 1973 law that 
would under some circumstances require the withdrawal of us 
forces from situations of imminent danger 
reagan has refused to invoke the war powers law arguing that it 
is an unconstitutional restriction on his authority adams and 110 
other legislators have sued to invoke the law but a federal judge 
rejected the suit and they are appealing that rejection 
sen john warner rva a former secretary of the navy led the 
opposition to adams proposal 
i think it would be illadvised for the congress to single out 
any particular military operation and say on an annual basis that 
were going to appropriate money for that operation 
adams proposal rejected by the senate would have required the 
report from reagan and then would have provided 15 days for 
congress to disapprove the policy if no disapproval vote were 
taken the policy would have been considered approved 
sen john glenn dohio criticized reagans policy as foolish 
stupid but he opposed adams plan he said it might mean that 
us forces would be pulled out of the region 
i dont want to see us take an action in the persian gulf that 
would really mean we are willing to pull out said glenn 
sen john mccain rariz opposed the plan because this would 
require the president to be a prophet im not sure the 
president can provide a plan given the fluid nature of events in 
that part of the world 
adams said his proposal isnt a withdrawal from the persian 
gulf i do not want to withdraw our forces 
sen strom thurmond rsc said the plan is another example 
of what congress is criticized for you cant have 535 
secretaries of state referring to the total number of house and 
senate members

a group of senators introduced legislation 
thursday to impose a virtual ban on economic dealings between the 
united states and south africa 
the united states has indulged the apartheid regime for 40 
years said sen edward m kennedy dmass the primary senate 
sponsor of the bill it is time to chart another course 
the bill similar to one pending on the house calendar would 
force us businesses to divest their holdings in south africa 
within a year and would ban most trade with and lending to that 
country 
other supporters included sens lowell weicker rconn alan 
cranston dcalif paul simon dill carl levin and donald 
riegle both dmich bill bradley and frank lautenberg both 
dnj and barbara mikulski dmd 
this will end once and for all time american complicity in 
and support for apartheid kennedy said in announcing the bill 
at a news conference 
while supporters of the sanctions are optimistic about house 
passage the bills fate in the senate is unclear in part because 
moderate republicans who were key to the passage of limited 
sanctions in 1986 are reluctant to go along with harsher measures 
the reagan administration opposes the sanctions and a 
presidential veto is likely if congress should pass the bill 
efforts are under way in the house to enlist the twothirds support 
that would be needed to override a veto but that effort would be 
more difficult in the senate

police arrested four of sikhisms five 
high priests and 26 followers as they prepared to march thursday to 
the golden temple officials said security forces killed at least 
three people at the besieged shrine 
indian commandos backed by paramilitary troops captured a 
strategic water tank on the temple complex grounds where an 
estimated 100 sikh militants have been holed up since monday 
officials said 
about 2500 police and paramilitary troops surrounded the 
militants at the temple sikhisms holiest shrine they have been 
fighting intermittently since monday 
the punjab government ruled out new negotiations with the 
militants and demanded they surrender 
if they do not do so the state government will continue its 
pressure on them punjab governor ss ray said in a statement 
issued in the state capital chandigargh 
talks wednesday on ending the temple standoff were inconclusive 
and a ceasefire that took effect that day ended thursday morning 
the militants have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1983 
for more autonomy or an independent homeland for the sikhs in 
punjab 
sikhs whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam claim they are discriminated 
against by indias majority hindus sikhs make up less than 2 
percent of indias 800 million people but are a majority in punjab 
three more people two sikh militants and an unidentified man 
were shot and killed by security forces on thursday raising the 
death toll in the fighting to at least 15 said aa siddiqui 
state police deputy chief 
united news of india said as many as seven sikhs died inside the 
shrine thursday 
indian commandos captured the water tank in the living area of 
the temple complex said witnesses who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the priests were arrested as they attempted to march on the 
golden temple from another sikh shrine about a halfmile to the 
north siddiqui said the priests were placed in custody for 15 
days on charges of violating curfew orders siddiqui said 
among those arrested was jasbir singh rode the temples head 
priest who held talks wednesday with government officials to try 
to end the confrontation rode has called for the militants to 
dismantle their bunkers and for the security forces to withdraw 
deputy police commissioner sarbjeet singh had asked them to call 
off their march because two bursts of gunfire were reported inside 
the temple thursday after an overnight lull 
we take responsibility for any firing from inside the 
temple rode told sarbjeet singh insisting that the march should 
be allowed to proceed you take responsibility for firing from 
outside 
firing from the temple increased as the morning wore on 
police lifted a curfew in most parts of amritsar on thursday 
but it remained in force within 200 yards of the golden temple 
indian television said 
most of the shops and businesses in the old sector of amritsar 
which surrounds the temple remained shuttered even after curfew was 
withdrawn in the area 
security forces for the first time thursday began blocking 
reporters from approaching the temple they said sikh militants 
might shoot the journalists 
more than 940 people have been killed this year in punjab in 
attacks blamed on the extremists most have been hindus or moderate 
sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign 
the confrontation at the golden temple began monday when 
militants inside the shrine opened fire on security forces who had 
gone to a nearby rooftop to look at fortifications the sikhs were

prince sadruddin aga khan head of un 
relief for afghanistan said thursday an international appeal will 
be launched in three weeks for hundreds of millions of dollars for 
refugee aid and reconstruction 
we must see to equitable distribution and certainly relief 
would be without strings attached and should not be used for 
political manipulation he told a news conference 
the important thing is that the aid gets to the people who 
need it 
the amount has not been set 
the prince a un high commissioner for refugees from 196577 
said he hopes to meet all parties concerned rebels included the 
rebels control much of the afghan countryside and he indicated they 
could play an important part in relief distribution 
i am concerned about the afghan people as a whole and we need 
to find ways to get help where it is needed he said 
the 55yearold prince was named wednesday as 
undersecretarygeneral to coordinate all international relief 
efforts in afghanistan and resettlement of 5 million refugees 
facing him is the task of insuring that a vast amount of aid 
will be distributed fairly by un and other agencies he must see 
aid is not exploited or manipulated by the prosoviet government in 
kabul or by the antimarxist rebels who reject the political 
accord on withdrawing soviet troops 
the united nations mediated the geneva agreement between 
afghanistan and pakistan providing for the 115000 soviet troops in 
afghanistan to withdraw over a ninemonth period 
the prince emphasized that un relief efforts are separate from 
the political agreement 
answering a question he said he could not give the amount of 
aid needed for relief reconstruction and rehabilitation but it 
would amount to hundreds of millions of dollars 
he said secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar probably will 
launch the appeal to donor countries in three weeks 
sadruddin aga khan said he will shuttle between kabul and 
islamabad from his base in geneva and that he will go to the area 
next week 
he said his work will involve coordinating the work of many un 
agencies including the world health organization the united 
nations development program the food and agriculture organization 
and others as well as the international red cross the red 
crescent its islamic counterpart and other groups 
he said many governments already have indicated their 
willingness to make generous contributions and have been awaiting a 
un mechanism for distribution he said his immediate task is to 
formulate an appeal and assure donors how their money will be spent 
he said repatriation of refugees will be a major task and 
reception centers must be set up for displaced people wanting to 
return

a rocket fuel manufacturer thursday 
blamed a natural gas leak for a series of earthquakeforce 
explosions may 4 that demolished a plant killing two people and 
injuring 326 
fred gibson chairman of the pacific engineering and production 
co said the highpressure gas line passing through the plant had 
been leaking for at least 30 minutes before a fire broke out may 4 
at the plant 
all of the subsequent destructive events were caused by the 
gas leak the gas fire and the gas explosion he said 
gibson said the leak is believed to have saturated the earth 
below the paved surfaces of the plant and ignited as a result of 
circumstances unrelated to pepcon operations 
earlier thursday kerrmcgee corp bowed to pressure from the 
state and halted production at the only other us plant making the 
fuel component ammonium perchlorate until an independent inspection 
determines its plant is safe 
southwest gas corp vehemently denied the allegation saying gas 
mains under the plant ruptured only after the initial explosions 
as far as were concerned our facilities are a victim of the 
explosion and not the cause said spokesman dennis hetherington 
fire chief roy parrish said wednesday that the fire department 
would withhold judgment until it completes an investigation of the 
blast which caused an estimated 73 million in damage 
a kerrmcgee official said he hoped the companys own plant 
could resume manufacture within a few days of ammonium perchlorate 
an oxidizer used in the space shuttle and in missiles 
a prolonged shutdown is not helpful to any of us said paul 
gaines kerrmcgee director of governmental relations 
i think kerrmcgee has done the responsible thing in agreeing 
to suspend production said gov richard bryan who had met with 
company executives two hours wednesday 
bryan said legal work was being prepared to force the plant 
to suspend production at mckerrmcgee before it agreed to the 
shutdown 
gaines said the company which will continue to manufacture 
other chemicals at the henderson plant has contracted with an 
unidentified safety consultant to study the plant he said the 
inspection could begin by monday 
local and state officials had expressed outrage when the plant 
resumed production tuesday of ammonium perchlorate plant officials 
had said last week they would not reopen until authorities 
determined the cause of the pacific blast 
gaines said the kerrmcgee plant is completely safe we are 
blameless here he said it is not our plant that exploded 
meanwhile bryan announced the appointment of seven people to a 
panel charged with reviewing health safety zoning and insurance 
standards for industries with highly combustible materials 
lt gov bob miller will be chairman of the the panel which 
bryan said will complete its work within 90 days

the general assembly on thursday endorsed 
a plan calling for 43 billion in economic development programs in 
central america aimed at fostering peace and democracy 
the 159nation body approved the resolution by consensus only a 
day after a military rebellion was put down in guatemala that 
country represented the region during the un debate 
nealy half the money 2 billion would be debt relief 
the resolution puts the assemblys stamp of approval on an 
ambitious and wideranging program for regional reconstruction 
emergency relief and longterm development that depends on the 
generosity of the international community 
un officials have not indicated exactly how they plan to raise 
the money for the program however its coordinator augusto 
ramirez ocampo has been trying to line up donors particularly in 
western europe 
more than 45 nations including most of the european community 
signed on as sponsors of the resolution britain concerned about 
the plans call for debt relief was an exception 
we take the view that the matter of bilateral commercial debt 
is a matter between creditor governments and creditor banks said 
stephen smith a spokesman for the british mission 
the united states which did not commit itself to contributing 
any money to the un plan shared britains reservations about 
debt relief 
ambassador lester b korn reminded the assembly that the united 
states has given 4 billion in direct aid to el salvador 
guatemala honduras and costa rica since 1985 and contributed an 
additional 1 billion to international organizations active in the 
region 
the united states is pleased that the general assembly is on 
record as supporting what the united states has been doing for the 
past decade in this troubled area of the world korn said 
korn criticized the plan for being vague about sources of 
funding 
work on the development plan began shortly after five central 
american presidents signed a regional peace accord last summer 
the un development plans calls for 392 million to resettle 
the estimated 830000 people displaced by the civil wars in

the united states and soviet union settled their 
differences thursday on a historic treaty to scrap mediumrange 
missiles and sent the agreement to the us senate in an effort to 
speed ratification of the pact before the moscow summit 
secretary of state george p shultz winding up two days of 
talks with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told 
reporters we have reached a completely satisfactory agreement on 
all of these issues 
the senate postponed debate on the treaty monday while some 
members accused moscow of backsliding and leaving loopholes for 
cheating but shultz said the differences over verifying compliance 
with the pact were a result of implementing an unprecedented system 
of onsite inspection 
occasionally theyll have an argument shultz said of the 
technicians who will carry out the agreement to destroy 683 soviet 
missiles and 364 us missiles with a range of 315 to 3125 miles 
thats life 
he called the settlement he reached with shevardnadze 
absolutely satisfactory it was initialed by maynard glitman 
who negotiated the treaty and col gen nikolai chervov the 
senior arms control adviser to the soviet military 
shultz said glitman and lt gen colin powell the us national 
security adviser would fly to washington on thursday night to 
report to the senate on friday 
i think it will be wellreceived shultz said 
the moscow meeting between president reagan and mikhail s 
gorbachev is scheduled to begin may 29 
chief us negotiator max kampelman and soviet negotiator viktor 
p karpov signed another document at the soviet mission that 
guarantees any futuristic weapons developed in the 
intermediaterange also would be banned under the treaty 
two of the principal stumbling blocks to verification of the 
treaty dealt with us demands to inspect soviet missile containers 
big enough to hold only a stage of a rocket and the issue of how 
much access us inspectors will have to soviet missile plants and 
bases 
other issues dealt with photographing equipment updating data 
exchanged between the two sides and the size and weight of vehicles 
that can be inspected leaving votkinsk where soviet ss20 missiles 
are assembled 
the pact on intermediaterange missiles is unprecedented in its 
provisions for onsite inspection to guard against infractions it 
also is the first ussoviet agreement to eliminate an entire 
category of nuclear weapons 
the document on futuristic weapons was aimed at convincing sen 
sam nunn dga the chairman of the senate armed services 
committee and other critics that the ban would apply to 
intermediaterange weapons that have not been developed yet 
glitman and powell were taking the second document to the senate 
as well while shultz obviously was satisified with the results he 
said what the senate does is up to the senate 
with evident relief however he told reporters i hope ive 
heard the last of inf intermediaterange nuclear forces at these 
ministerials 
shevardnadze at a separate news conference said the soviets 
did not view the differences as technical but as very serious 
problems that required political decisions he added and such 
solutions were found 
shultz and shevardnadze declined to provide specific details of 
how the dispute was resolved 
senior us officials however speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the soviets wanted the united states to destroy 
west german pershing 1a missiles but were satisfied the bonn 
government itself would scrap them 
after a telephone call to bonn the us side told the soviets 
where the missiles are stored and how many there are 21 
we got back to everything we wanted an official said 
referring to the range of disputes on inf 
another official while not criticizing the senate said all the 
issues could have been resolved quietly with the soviets if they 
had not been made public in newspaper accounts 
regarding missile canisters the official said american 
inspectors will be able to look inside but not take the parts out 
they gave in enough he said 
shultz said i think when the senators see it the agreement 
i think they will see that it was worked out satisfactorily 
on a related subject shultz ruled out quick completion of 
another treaty to reduce us and soviet longrange nuclear weapons 
arsenals by 30 to 50 percent 
reagan had hoped to make the accord the centerpiece of his four 
days of talks with gorbachev 
negotiations are moving slowly on how to verify the scrapping of 
mobile missiles as well as cruise missiles carried on warships and 
fighter planes 
there is also a nagging dispute over the us program to develop 
a spacebased defense against soviet ballistic missiles the 
soviets are trying to constrict the program known as star wars 
its now clear shultz said there is no way these 
questions can be shaped up and ready in time for the summit

taiwan the two air pirates carried two bombs and handguns 
some foreigners but no americans were aboard 
the boeing 737 left chingchuankang military airport in central 
taiwan at 255 am 255 pm thursday edt after refueling a 
litle under six hours after it landed there said wang paohua

chinas official xinhua news agency later confirmed that the 
plane landed just over an hour later at about 5 am 4 pm

co a subsidiary of the national carrier 
xinhua said the mayor and other officials met those returning on 
the plane and extended sympathy to them from premier li peng

plane was allowed to fly to hong kong apparently trying to 
avoid any impression of cooperating with the communist government 
the plane actually flew to xiamen

at 727 pm thursday for canton capital of neighboring guangdong 
province wang said they carried two bombs and handguns although

crossed the penghu islands held by taiwan and two air force f104 
jets went aloft as escorts

taiwan but several military pilots have defected to the island 
since chiang kaisheks nationalists retreated to taiwan 1949 after 
losing a civil war to the communists

fighter to taiwan in november becoming the sixth pilot defector 
since 1960

apparently touched off a blaze that destroyed a roomful of antique 
furniture in the building where the louisiana purchase was signed 
investigators said thursday 
the fire wednesday raced through the third floor of the 
woodandstucco french quarter landmark that has served as a museum 
since 1911 destroying a painting and causing water damage to 
artworks and other items 
napoleons death mask and the bulk of other historic artifacts 
survived said museum director james f sefcik 
offficials refused to give a damage estimate for the 
193yearold threestory building which was undergoing 
renovation and the contents 
fire superintendent william mccrossen said that workers 
repairing the roof and waterproofing the walls apparently touched 
off the fire 
an investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity said a spark 
from a welding torch being used on a gutter on the front of the 
spanish baroque building could have started the blaze in the 
buildings old timbers 
mccrossen said he expected to have a report on the cause of the 
fire friday 
gov buddy roemer said the building the seat of government in 
louisiana under three nations would be restored as soon as 
humanly possible 
its like somebody said louisiana was burning last night

and two years 
lost to the blaze was an 1802 portrait of luis penalver y 
cardenas first roman catholic bishop of louisiana on loan from 
the archdiocese of new orleans furniture from the 18thcentury 
french colonial period was stored on the gutted third floor 
roemer said officials were trying to determine how to preserve 
historic state records kept there and were considering shortterm 
measures such as erecting a temporary roof 
the cabildo was built in 1795 and served as the seat of 
louisiana government under france spain the confederacy and the 
united states 
it was there that america and france signed in 1803 the 
louisiana purchase that doubled the size of the united states only 
a copy of the document is at the cabildo sefcik said originals 
are in france and washington dc 
the cabildo was the third such building on the site to bear the

the elysee palace on thursday announced new premier 
michel rocards cabinet dominated by members of a previous 
socialist government but containing nonsocialists nonpoliticians 
and a former union leader 
jeanlouis bianco secretarygeneral for the elysee read a list 
of 26 ministers to replace the conservative government of premier 
jacques chirac 
chirac was defeated in may 8 presidential elections which 
returned socialist president francois mitterrand to a second 
sevenyear term 
among the top new ministers is lionel jospin who has just 
resigned as head of the socialist party he was appointed minister 
for national education and research mitterrand had called 
education and training a top priority for the new administration 
pierre beregovoy a finance minister under the socialist 
government of 19811986 was returned to the post 
similarly roland dumas returned to his post as foreign minister 
replacing jeanbernard raimond and pierre joxe to his old post as 
interior minister replacing charles pasqua who had been known for 
his lawandorder command of the ministry 
the socialist government was defeated in march 1986 legislative 
elections which brought chirac to power 
jeanpierre chevenement education minister in the earlier 
socialist government was named minister of defense replacing 
andre giraud 
the government expected to reflect the spirit of 
enlargement on which mitterrand campaigned contained at least 
nine nonsocialists but only two figures who could be called 
centrists 
mitterrand whose socialist party has moved toward the right 
had made a point of appealing to centrists 
but chirac spokesman alain juppe said mitterrands talk of 
reaching beyond the ranks of the socialists was but a 
preelectoral trap for fools 
jacques toubon secretary general of chiracs conservative rally 
for the republic party said the cabinet was a hardcore 
socialist government 
the announcement of the cabinet originally expected wednesday 
was reportedly delayed because of lastminute hesitation on the 
part of centrists wary of joining a socialist government 
sen jacques pelletier was named minister for aid and 
cooperation and sen michel durafour was appointed minister of 
public works both were ministers under former president valery 
giscard destaing who is from the centrist union for french 
democracy they are both part of the centerright parliamentary 
majority 
among the nonpoliticians is judge pierre arpaillange named 
justice minister replacing albin chalendon 
roger fauroux who had been director of the prestigious ecole 
nationale dadministration where most french politicans study was 
named minister of industry and foreign trade 
jacques chereque a former union leader was named minister for 
territorial management 
bianco said the rest of the cabinet members would be announced 
friday 
the announcement of the new government came two days after 
rocards appointment by mitterrand 
rocard said earlier thursday that he would not rush the process 
i intend to do my work in a spirit of calm and serenity 
listening to everyone concerned he told reporters 
he met twice thursday with the president who must approve his 
cabinet proposals 
most prominent centrists who supported chiracs conservative 
government have said they would decline cabinet ministries in a 
socialistled government 
rocard would be assured of only the votes of the 211 socialists 
in the 577member national assembly but the centerright 
opposition parties have said they would not necessarily vote to 
bring down the new government 
mitterrand has the power to dissolve the assembly and public 
opinion polls show an early election would likely produce a 
socialist majority officials of chiracs party as well as leaders 
of most of the centrist parties are saying they think legislative 
elections should wait at least until autumn 
pressure is mounting within the socialist party however for an 
election next month 
jean poperen a member of the party executive committee said in 
a radio interview wednesday that logic and coherence argue for 
an immediate election he was named minister for parliamentary 
relations

the operator of the 53 billion shoreham 
nuclear plant was reported close to an agreement with the state 
thursday on a plan to abandon the power station without ever 
operating it commercially 
gov mario cuomo with the legislatures backing has been 
trying to scrap the plant because of arguments that long island 
could not be evacuated in a nuclear accident 
if the agreement is concluded shoreham will become the first 
completed nuclear power plant ever shut down without operating 
commercially the plant commissioned in 1973 took a decade to 
build and ran more than 10 times over budget 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed a report in 
the new york times on thursday that the plan would have the state 
take over the long island plant from its builder the long island 
lighting co then scrap it 
the utility would pay the estimated 500 million cost of the 
shutdown in return it would be guaranteed rate increases of 4 
percent to 5 percent a year for 10 years and would remain an 
independent investorowned utility

senate majority leader robert c byrd 
dwva insisted thursday he will schedule debate on the ussoviet 
mediumrange missile treaty only after three senate committees 
examine and approve a new anticheating agreement 
but some senators of both parties objected declaring it is 
imperative the senate begin work on the pact immediately so that 
president reagan can take a ratified treaty to moscow on may 29 for 
his summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas reported to the 
senate that secretary of state george p shultz believes he struck 
a completely satisfactory bargain with soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze in geneva on the outstanding disagreements 
involving the intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf treaty 
dole said white house national security adviser colin powell 
will fly back from the meeting friday to brief senate leaders on 
what has been accomplished 
if powell can report that shevardnadze has confirmed moscow will 
live up to the letter of the treaty dole said debate on 
ratification should begin on monday with the aim of taking a final 
vote before the moscow summit 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign relations 
committee said shultz will testify before his panel monday 
afternoon and that senates bipartisan leadership and the chairmen 
and the ranking republican members of the armed services and 
intelligence committees have been invited to attend 
pell suggested that if no further snags are uncovered senate 
debate could open on tuesday 
but byrd insisted he will not be driven by a calendar date 
and will not permit floor debate to begin until the onsite 
inspection plan is reviewed and approved by the foreign relations 
armed services and intelligence committees 
we were told all the is were dotted and all the ts were 
crossed byrd said it was through the examination of these 
committees that it was found that this was not the case 
if we make a mistake in this treaty and we find we have been 
hoodwinked or outsmarted then you can kiss the next arms treaty 
goodbye he declared lets do this thing right 
but byrd said i want our committees which have the 
responsibility for taking the microscopic look at the fine print to 
have the opportunity to go carefully into this and advise the joint 
leadership if these agreements adequately resolve the problems 
briefings are fine but the final word will be what these 
committees have to say he declared 
but sen ted stevens ralaska said the senate must do nothing 
to cause further delay and prevent this american president from 
being able to present before the soviet people this historic 
agreement 
if he goes to moscow and faces the question of why he cant 
get ratification i think we place the presidency in jeopardy so 
far as the success of future negotiations is concerned stevens 
said 
time is the commodity thats scarce now he said 
byrd on monday shelved debate on the new treaty to give shultz 
and shevardnadze time to resolve a serious dispute over the 
implementation of anticheating provisions 
the dispute centers on what us inspectors will be permitted to 
see and what they will be permitted to do as they seek to learn 
whether the soviets are living up to the requirements of the treaty 
to eliminate all mediumrange missiles 
earlier byrd told reporters a goahead for debate depends on 
whos giving the answers and what they look like byrd said 
im going to depend on the committees with jurisdiction to 
determine whether these matters have been resolved in the proper 
way whether these things that need to be fixed are really 
fixed byrd said 
we need to stand firm on these things byrd told the senate 
the soviets cannot realistically expect us to now compromise away 
decisions which already have been negotiated and closed between the 
two parties 
calling the onsite inspection provisions of the new treaty the 
single most important aspect of the pact byrd said that what 
happens in the next few days could be the beginning or the end of 
arms control 
if the verification system is sound and stands the test of 
time then the negotiations for future treaties will be given added 
chance of support and success byrd said 
but if now when we are just on the verge of approval of the 
inf treaty we allow its verification provisions to be unraveled by 
the soviets then the prospects of sound future arms control 
agreements will be dismal very dismal indeed 
byrd said the lastminute snag justifies the searching 
examination to which the senate put the new treaty since it was 
signed last december by reagan and gorbachev 
the process he said uncovered a number of flaws and unanswered 
questions including whether or not the pact covered futuristic 
weapons such as those using laser or particle beams 
if we had rushed in and approved the treaty say a month ago 
and then discovered these ambiguities and contradictions the level 
of confidence of the country in our ability to reach good solid 
agreements with the soviets would have plummeted byrd said

members of the board of education say theyll 
risk the loss of thousands of dollars in aid and take the state to 
court if necessary to keep the taxpayerpaid chauffeurs who drive 
two of its members to meetings 
on wednesday the state senate voted 361 to prohibit schools 
from spending money for chauffeurdriven cars for board members 
the measure was sent to the house 
board president gloria c cobbin who does not use a chauffeur 
called the legislation racist another example of 
detroitbashing at its worst 
we challenge the states authority to impose these 
restrictions on how we run our school system she said detroit 
with an 11member school board is the only michigan district known 
to use drivers 
wednesdays action reinforced steps taken by the senate last 
year when it told the district that unless it stopped issuing cars 
to its members or paying for their drivers it would withhold money 
used for that purpose 
the action reduced the amount of state money the district is 
scheduled to receive in june by 270000 
in addition state treasurer robert bowman said that until the 
drivers are dropped he will not sign 30 million in notes for the 
district a move that could mean teachers in the 181000student 
district will not get paid may 31 
the district has a 25 million payroll 
the notion that the state will send money to local governments 
no strings attached is an outdated notion bowman said wednesday 
board member rose mary osborne said that without a chauffeur 
she would be unable to attend evening functions because she cannot 
to drive at night 
im not backing down osborne said i dont think he 
bowman has the authority to do this this is a legitimate 
expense i only use the board driver for boardrelated activities 
according to a study by the detroit news in 1987 the drivers 
for the district earned an average of 35060 the average salary 
for a teacher in the district is 32930 
nine of the board members stopped using drivers after the 
states action last year

a member of the jury that convicted a woman in 
the nations first deathbyproducttampering case has admitted 
settling a productcontamination suit of her own less than two 
months before she was selected as a juror 
laurel holliday told the seattle times she did not think her 
suit was relevant and did not reveal it during jury selection for 
the trial of stella nickell on charges of killing two people with 
cyanidelaced excedrin capsules 
mrs nickell 44 of auburn was found guilty monday in the 
death of her husband bruce nickell 52 and susan katherine snow 
40 of auburn she could receive up to life in prison at sentencing 
june 17 
court records show that ms holliday had settled a lawsuit 
against a company she alleged made a cracker containing the aspirin 
substitute ibuprofen 
ms holliday said that she did not raise the matter during jury 
selection because she believed the suit involved a manufacturing 
mishap not product tampering 
mrs nickells attorney thomas hillier ii did not return calls 
for comment thursday 
on monday before the verdict in the nickell case ms holliday 
reported receiving an anonymous call during deliberations last week 
telling her that mrs nickell had failed a polygraph test that 
information was not admitted as evidence 
us district judge william dwyer with hilliers concurrence 
allowed ms holliday to remain on the jury after she said could put 
the information out of her mind 
three days earlier the jury had reported it was hopelessly 
deadlocked at 111 soon after the verdict was announced several 
jurors identified ms holliday as the holdout 
hillier after the verdict suggested that another juror may 
have influenced ms holliday or that she contrived the 
anonymous call to end the pressure of being the holdout vote 
hoping to be excused 
at hilliers request dwyer ordered the jury back to court 
friday to ask members if they were improperly influenced 
ms holliday has said she reached the verdict of her own accord 
repeated calls to ms hollidays home went unanswered or were 
not returned thursday 
in her own tampering incident ms holliday a real estate 
agent told police her mouth started burning after she ate a 
cracker in 1986 she said she found half of a pill in the uneaten 
portion of the cracker and vomited 
a year later ms holliday sued the manufacturer pepperidge 
farm inc the case was settled for 500 there were no witnesses 
and pepperidge farm attorneys questioned whether the event ever 
took place

the state health department closed all 
but two units of a large philadelphia hospital thursday saying 
inadequate care might have caused 12 deaths in the past year 
the state stopped short of the most severe punishment revoking 
the license of the james g giuffre medical center the hospital 
serves a predominantly poor area of north philadelphia 
an investigation focusing on 66 cases since may 1987 found 124 
deficiencies including 29 instances of unnecessary surgery and 55 
cases of postoperative complications said department spokesman 
gary froseth in 12 cases the patients died 
in one instance a doctors untrained son assisted in an 
operation froseth said 
scrutiny in many cases fell on the hospitals namesake dr 
james g giuffre until recently the hospitals executive director 
and the board of directors 
the hospital will remain closed until they submit a plan of 
corrections and we determine those areas cited as deficient have 
been corrected froseth said he said no deadline was set 
in a statement hospital officials said that many problems 
already had been addressed and that they hoped to receive 
permission to reopen all units soon 
the order allows the hospitals clinic and its drug and alcohol 
inpatient services to continue operating 
it closes all inpatient acute care including surgical 
services the emergency room and the podiatric clinic patients 
already at the hospital will continue receiving treatment froseth 
said 
under an agreement giuffre and state officials signed thursday 
the hospitals board will be replaced by may 25 froseth said 
part of the state investigation conducted for the us health 
care financing administration determined that the hospital was 
ineligible for particiation in the medicare program froseth said 
however the federal agency has not made a final determination 
he said 
the investigation began in february the month the state closed 
the surgical and primary care units for three days saying 
assistants and podiatric residents had conducted examinations 
diagnosis and treatment and had written prescriptions for clinic 
patients without supervision from doctors 
a federal grand jury also is investigating the hospital 
focusing on financial affairs from 1981 through 1985

police wednesday announced 
their biggest arms seizure including a groundtoair missile and 
arrested four whites who purportedly planned to carry out attacks 
for the african national congress 
law and order minister adriaan vlok described the three men and 
one woman as a highly specialized terror unit he said they 
were captured sunday at a farmhouse near pretoria where they had 
been staying since early this year 
police said the four had an assassination list of top police 
officials and planned to use the missile to shoot down a police 
helicopter at a recent fair 
they said that besides one sovietmade sam7 groundtoair 
missile the weapons seized included limpet mines hand grenades 
assault rifles pistols machine guns mortars and explosives 
in his statement vlok alleged that the suspects were trained in 
moscow cuba and angola and had radio transmitters which they used 
to communicate with anc headquarters in lusaka zambia 
the predominantly black african national congress outlawed in 
south africa since 1960 began a sabotageandbombing campaign the 
next year aimed at toppling whiteminority rule 
vlok did not release the names of the four he did say the men 
were south african citizens and the woman was from another country 
he did not specify

former south african journalist they had university degrees and 
were in their 20s and 30s he added

brought into south africa 
the south african press association citing unidentified police 
sources said a disenchanted anc member apparently tipped off 
authorities 
police said the four apparently had no connection with heinrich 
grosskopf a white south african and an alleged anc member who is 
the leading suspect in a march 17 car bombing that killed three 
people grosskopf remains at large

the united states refused visa 
applications from six leading vietnamese economists as part of a 
policy to pressure the hanoi government to end its occupation of 
cambodia us officials said wednesday 
the group included nguyen xuan oanh a harvardeducated 
government advisor who visited several asian capitals earlier this 
year to try to attract capital and technology officials said 
ross petzing spokesman for the us embassy in bangkok said 
the state department denied the visa requests on april 16 because 
the group was deeply involved in vietnamese economic policy 
planning and the us government policy is to isolate vietnam 
politically and economically to force its withdrawal from 
cambodia 
the christopher reynolds foundation invited the group to visit 
harvard the university of michigan and other institutions to talk 
about vietnams economy and efforts to attract western investment 
said a us source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the united states does not have diplomatic relations with 
vietnam 
david lyon consul general at the embassy said washington was 
acting under section 212a27 of the immigration and nationality act 
which says the government can bar aliens whom it knows or has 
reason to believe seek to enter the united states solely 
principally or incidentally to engage in activities which would be 
prejudicial to the public interest or endanger the welfare safety 
or security of the united states 
communist vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 and maintains 
125000 troops there according to us estimates 
petzing said oanh submitted a second application on april 19 
this time for him to travel alone and that application is being 
reviewed 
the spokesman said that since oct 1 the united states has 
approved applications for a halfdozen vietnamese government 
officials to visit the united nations and other international 
organizations 
a larger number of private vietnamese citizens have gone to the 
united states to attend medical conferences and the like lyons 
said he said he did not know of any other vietnamese visa 
applications denied in the past 10 months 
in the past few years vietnam has played host to many us 
congressmen relief agency officials journalists and others in an 
effort to break its isolation

bank customers with loans pegged to the prime 
rate are about to feel the impact of the rising cost of money but 
economists say a big increase in interest rates is unlikely this 
year 
the first spike in the prime rate since the october stock market 
crash was announced wednesday by major banks the rise from 85 
percent to 9 percent heralded a period of more expensive loans for 
purchases ranging from plant machinery to homes and cars 
the prime rate reflects the banks costs of borrowing money and 
trails more subtle increases in other interest rates but the rate 
is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for 
calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types of 
fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans including popular 
homeequity loans

we have some real problems we have drugs we have housing 
problems we have a multitude of severe crises we have to face 
acknowledged mary schmidt campbell the citys cultural affairs 
commissioner 
why should we spend our time and our energy on culture 
what claim do we have on the citys resources she asked the 
flock of the abyssinian baptist church the citys oldest black 
house of worship the church made famous by the late adam clayton 
powell jr 
and then she answered her own question 
our culture she said has been our salvation 
in the six months since campbell succeeded bess myerson in one 
of the nations most powerful arts posts overseeing a cultural 
budget that is second only to the national endowment for the arts 
she has repeatedly argued for more arts money in a city where 
bridges are falling down crime is ever escalating and level 
untroubled ground is hard to find 
she has also restored the morale of a department dispirited by 
the scandal that forced myerson out of office and rekindled 
enthusiasm in the arts community 
campbell recalled the black heritage she and the congregation 
share music and art dating back to the days of slavery in the 
americas and before that to the great kingdoms and societies of 
africa 
when she mentioned the success of the dance theater of harlem 
and noted that 98 percent of the young singers in the boys choir of 
harlem go on to college the audience applauded vigorously 
later in an interview the commissioner said im really 
trying to accomplish a mentality an attitude about the arts that 
recognizes that it is one of the most essential services that the 
city provides to its citizens 
the real challenge for government is not to let itself get 
overwhelmed by its problems that is begin to seek out and carve 
out real resources for opportunity 
campbell 40 does not underestimate the difficulty of what she 
is trying to do when she became commissioner last october she had 
hopes of doubling the departments budget 
however two weeks after her appointment the stock market 
crashed mayor edward i koch recently proposed that the agency cut 
6 million from its current budget of 133 million for fiscal 1989 
campbell remains undaunted 
culture she says helps educate people who are going to be 
our leaders who we have to think of as being the salvation for the 
city and it helps in the reclamations of communities 
moreover artsrelated tourism is among the citys most important 
sources of revenue 
during myersons tenure the importance of culture as something 
that was not just a leisure time activity had not been 
conveyed said campbell quickly adding not that i was 
critical of her personally 
myerson a former miss america was a glamorous presence at gala 
cultural events and the publics interest in her put the 
relatively new and small department of cultural affairs in the 
spotlight 
the department is 11 years old it had been lumped in with the 
parks department and has about 55 employees 
this year the department provided 66 million to 32 major 
cultural institutions ranging from the metropolitan museum of art 
to el museo del barrio for operating and energy costs it also 
distributed 13 million to arts groups in grant money for programs 
or projects such as the metropolitan operas free performances in 
city parks 
i think bess was very concerned about bringing some visibility 
to the agency said kathleen hughes assistant commissioner for 
program services 
john hayworth assistant commissioner for cultural institutions 
agreed she brought an immediacy an understanding of the citys 
political life 
but the controversy surrounding myersons romantic involvement 
with millionaire carl andy capasso took its toll on the 
department she was accused of improperly influencing a judge 
presiding over his divorce case 
it has been a difficult time for people here hughes said 
i dont think theres any denying that going through something 
like what weve been through in terms of publicity has an effect 
campbell the daughter of a philadelphia family court judge 
received a doctorate in humanities at syracuse university where 
she wrote a study of the late american artist romare bearden 
as director of the studio museum of harlem for 10 years she 
transformed it from a struggling community arts project occupying 
two floors over a liquor store and fried chicken outlet into a 
premier fine arts museum focusing on black artists it has a 2 
million annual budget and is the only museum of its kind accredited 
by the american association of museums 
campbell also taught english literature for two years at nkumbi 
international college a school in zambia for refugees from south 
africa 
those in the arts mainstream are eager to praise her 
shes intelligent energetic and a compatible person said 
martin segal chairman emeritus of lincoln center for the 
performing arts and chairman of the board of the upcoming new york 
festival of the arts 
william h luers president of the metropolitan museum of art 
said hes dazzled by her intelligence 
one of the things that is difficult in government is to 
understand how museums work she has come from a museum environment 
and she knows the issues she knows the concerns the weaknesses 
the strengths he said 
campbell knows also that new york is the nations cultural 
capital and she is eager to exert new yorks influence on the 
national scene

mary deng once lived with her husband and 
five children in the relative comfort of a village in southern 
sudan today she lives in her nations capital in a shack without 
water or sanitation a refugee in her own country 
a 5yearold civil war in southern sudan chased the family away 
from their home along with an estimated 820000 other people 
forced from their homes into lives of poverty hunger and social 
ostracism 
mrs dengs story is similar to those of many of the others 
the army came into our village and took our cattle and killed 
many people she said 
my husband fled before me to get away from recruiters for both 
the army and the rebels i joined him with our five children 
later 
the dengs are among the estimated 400000 to 600000 southerners 
who have crowded into eight camps around khartoum 
they run in all directions mainly toward khartoum and sudans 
other cities to become wards of an impoverished state 
more than a quarter million have fled even into neighboring 
starving wartorn ethiopia several thousand of those died because 
they arrived after long treks too weak to be saved 
the refugees blame their plight on both sides in the war rebels 
and soldiers and the tribal and ethnic conflicts that are at the 
root of the fighting 
about 6 million people remain in the south where the population 
is mainly christian and animist of african extraction sixteen 
million arabdescended moslems live in the dominant north 
because of the great religious and ethnic divisions between 
north and south sudan has been torn by hostilities in the south 
for most of the 32 years since it asserted its independence from 
britain and egypt on jan 1 1956 
but for hundreds of years before that southern and northern 
tribes have fought over pastureland and water northerners 
traditionally dominating as they do now 
the current round of warfare began in the spring of 1983 
the rebel leader john garang is fighting for a greater share 
for the south of development money and of sudans potential wealth 
from petroleum and mineral reserves mostly in the south 
southern tribes like garangs dinka form the backbone of his 
sudan peoples liberation army spla 
the sudanese army recruited arab tribes and gave them modern 
weapons 
in 1985 the government started a policy of arming arab tribes 
to help in fighting the spla said sulaiman baldo a southerner 
who is a professor at the university of khartoum he told an 
interviewer the new automatic weapons enable arab tribes to 
dominate in intertribal clashes 
baldo recently coauthored a book on an alleged massacre a year 
ago by an arab tribe he wrote that more than 1000 dinkas were 
burned to death as police and soldiers watched without intervening 
the government denies the atrocity charges maintaining that the 
victims died in cross fires it also denies that it shirks its duty 
to displaced southerners 
we give them help but not just to anyone so that they dont 
become encouraged and come to stay and be fed for free and not 
work said elhag eltayeb sudans acting commissioner for 
relief and rehabilitation 
the southerners in the khartoum camps he added are people 
who used to be producers and are now just consumers they affect 
the citys already taxed infrastructure 
in the civil war itself the spla now controls most of the 
southern countryside with government troops in control of a 
handful of large towns diplomatic sources said 
the fighting nevertheless has forced southerners to flee their 
cultivated land and their cattle 
noncombatant southerners who have remained in the combat area 
also are in a bad way said a diplomatic source with access to 
military information 
the spla go on recruiting trips into villages and attack them 
if the villagers refuse to support them he said the army 
troops view most dinka youth as potential spla supporters

thousands of moroccan workers are 
laboring around the clock to complete king hassan iis monumental 
act of faith in time for his 60th birthday next year 
when completed the builders say it will be the worlds largest 
mosque 
growing at a frenzied pace on a concrete platform jutting out 
over waves breaking in from the atlantic the massive minaret is 
already moroccos tallest structure and is rising at a rate of 
eight feet a day toward its planned pinnacle at 576 feet 
it will soon dominate the skyline of this huge city and the 
nearby atlantic shore it will be visible for 30 miles in two 
directions 
by far the most ambitious civilian construction project ever 
undertaken in this north african arab nation of 26 million people 
the great hassan ii mosque is budgeted to cost at least 250 
million 
gifts from saudi arabia and kuwait and loans from several 
western nations are helping pay for it interior minister driss 
basri who is in overall charge of the project said moroccan 
businesses private individuals and local authorities around the 
country will be asked to contribute toward it 
the ornate building was designed in a modernistic moorish style 
by the french architect michel pinseau 62 who has lived and 
worked in morocco for the past 14 years 
more than 2500 workers are busy 24 hours a day seven days a 
week so hassan can consecrate the mosque july 9 1989 his birthday 
the site faces the atlantic ocean because the koran the moslem 
holy book refers to gods throne over the water hassan wanted 
the mosque built partly over the atlantic 
the tremendous pressure of the incoming waves created our 
greatest technical problem pinseau said in an interview 
last year we measured one record wave that was more than 30 
feet high we had to build two enormous concrete combs to break 
such waves and had to take other extraordinary measures to make 
sure the ocean could never rock the building 
pinseau whose past designs include the former pan american 
world airways building on the champs elysees in paris and the 
spectacular governors palace in casablanca said the 430000 
squarefoot platform would contain bathing facilities for men and 
women a koranic school a library and parking space for 900 
vehicles 
the main hall of the mosque will be big enough he said to 
accommodate more than 20000 worshippers kneeling 
the whole of st peters in rome could fit inside the main 
building pinseau said the minaret will be higher than the 
great pyramid of cheops casablancas main highway the avenue of 
the armed forces will be lengthened to run in an unbroken 
perspective to the minaret it will be a magnificent focal point 
for moroccos largest city 
casablanca once a sleazy harbor town now has high rise hotels 
and office blocks that line the avenue of the armed forces the 
city has more than 4 million inhabitants 
king hassan said to be a direct descendant of the prophet 
mohammed in the 38th generation is moroccos political and 
religious leader 
the mosques main entrance door to the west will be reserved for 
his exclusive use at the east end of the nave hassan will have a 
personal place to pray 
the exterior of the building is to be covered with white 
moroccan marble as soon as the concrete outer structure is 
completed more than 6000 craftsmen will go to work on the 
intricately sculptured interior and exterior decoration in 
geometric moorish patterns 
at night a laser beam will shine from the minaret toward mecca 
the islamic holy city in saudi arabia engineers at the site said 
the beam will be visible at night across much of northern morocco 
in hot weather sliding panels will allow a large section of the 
roof to be opened with hydraulic pulleys 
hassan laid the foundation stone last year it bears a citation 
from the koran the prophet said whosoever builds a mosque in 
gods name god will build a house for him in paradise

after six months in office prime minister noboru 
takeshita still faces trade disputes with the united states and 
western europe and has been unable to break the prous mold set 
by his predecessor yasuhiro nakasone 
his critics call his devotion to nakasones policies his one big 
failure while at least one admirer seizaburo sato an adviser to 
the ruling liberal democratic party said it is only natural for 
takeshita to remain committed to them 
takeshita occupied many important positions in the cabinet and 
the party and he is committed to the policies of nakasone sato 
said 
but others see signs that takeshita finally is beginning to head 
off on his own course 
i think he has not yet found his own way of solving problems 
but he is on his way said rei shiratori professor of political 
science at tokai university 
but he added that one of takeshitas biggest problems is the 
heavy burden left by former prime minister nakasone especially 
with the united states 
many japanese feel nakasone was too closely allied with the 
united states 
takeshita himself has said the time had come for a change in 
japanus relations 
the international economic framework so long sustained by the 
overwhelming economic might of the united states is being 
transformed and there is a need for japan and western europe to 
join forces with the united states in supporting the international 
economy he said in a policy speech 
an editorial in the asahi shimbun in late april called on 
takeshita to assert japans independence from us policies 
we want the prime minister to be aware that japan has become 
an important pillar for the west the independent liberal 
newspaper said it is now time for japan to assert its own 
diplomacy independent of the united states 
on resolving major policy issues takeshita has a slim record so 
far he achieved limited success in resolving a trade dispute with 
the united states over lack of access to japans construction 
market primarily because of the major influence of one of his 
cabinet officials on japans construction industry 
however talks with us officials on liberalizing japans beef 
and orange imports broke down and the united states is seeking a 
resolution through the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
takeshitas administration was also unsuccessful in persuading 
president reagan to lift sanctions imposed last year on some 
japanese products because of alleged violations of an agreement on 
us access to japans computer chip market 
takeshita also was unable to prevent the us congress from 
passing a sweeping trade bill that includes sanctions against 
japanese companies he is relying heavily on reagan to veto the 
bill 
the prime ministers major test at home will come later this 
year when the diet japans national legislature considers a tax 
reform package that nakasone desperately wanted but was unable to 
get 
many japanese say the current tax system is unfair new 
proposals call for taxes on capital gains from the sale of 
securities the elimination of tax privileges for doctors the 
cutting of provisions that allow some people to estimate their 
income and taxation of farmland

a government accustomed to getting 
its way has met its match in this ramshackle black township which 
officially doesnt exist 
for years white authorities have been trying to coax or coerce 
the people of oukasie into moving to a newer township 12 miles away 
officials legally abolished oukasie in 1986 but about 8000 
residents remain and are determined to stay 
in april the government declared the 55yearold township an 
emergency camp subject to severe new regulations rents were 
raised by 50 percent unauthorized visitors will be barred as of 
june 1 and permits are required to renovate homes keep pets or 
take in lodgers 
members of the community believe the government seeks to 
demoralize them so they will give up and move that would enable 
the authorities to eliminate oukasie without resorting to forced 
removal a policy the government claims to have abandoned 
oukasie residents say they wont give in to the pressure 
sometimes in life you get tired of being harassed and moved 
about said sello ramakobye a spokesman for oukasies civic 
association you decide its time to resist 
the official reason for oukasies intended demise is that the 
government considers it an unhealthy slum beyond rehabilitation 
because of astronomic costs 
residents commissioned a study of their own that found upgrading 
would cost 3 million rands 14 million they say this would be 
cheaper than relocating all of them at the new township 
lethlabile and they believe the governments real reason for 
wanting oukasie shut down is that it is just a few hundreds yards 
from brits a white suburb 30 miles west of pretoria south 
africas capital 
brits is a stronghold of the farright conservative party its 
white residents have displayed little sympathy for their black 
neighbors who are able to walk to their jobs in brits but would 
have to pay for transport if they moved to lethlabile 
because of government funding lethlabile has advantages over 
oukasie and some of the 5000 former oukasie residents who have 
moved there are pleased with their choice the new townships 
streets are smooth its homes have electricity and plumbing a few 
houses are relatively lavish with patios and twocar garages 
oukasie is overcrowded and dilapidated many homes are in ruins 
demolished by former owners as a prerequisite for getting state 
compensation to move to lethlabile the only services provided are 
water from communal taps and removal of waste from bucket toilets 
but oukasie has certain charms trees a rare sight in many 
townships are abundant and welltended gardens adjoin even some 
of the sorriestlooking metal shacks two soccer fields are 
maintained diligently by local youths 
everything we want to do we do it ourselves said elias 
sithole a 39yearold former carpenter he is one of an estimated 
50 percent of the adult population that is unemployed and says 
jobseeking from lethlabile would be costly and difficult 
other jobless residents dont want to move because they have 
improved their homes in oukasie over the years and cant afford 
houses in lethlabile except for the small metal huts allocated to 
newcomers 
the social structure in oukasie is so coherent said 
ramakobye its wrong to destroy it in lethlabile everybody is 
for himself 
oukasie residents also are wary of lethlabiles proximity to the 
nominally independent black homeland of bophuthatswana they fear 
the new township will be incorporated into the homeland thus 
depriving residents of south african citizenship 
no one is going to volunteer to go to lethlabile said 
sithole the government thinks everybody is going to be scared 
into going but it will take force you should see the unity of 
these people 
sithole guided visitors to the edge of the nearby white suburb 
where a concrete moat filled with dark green muck separates 
handsome new hillside homes from a dirt road leading to oukasie 
how can they say its too expensive to upgrade oukasie when 
they upgrade their mountain he said 
raw sewage from whites homes runs into a gully next to the 
township 
sithole said oukasie residents are somewhat cynical about white 
complaints that the black community smells

in the months of israelipalestinian violence 
various church organizations have criticized israel as moving too 
harshly to curb disorder last week such criticism got tougher 
in one of the severest condemnations yet of israeli conduct the 
united methodist church said israels current ironfist policy 
is totally unacceptable as civilized behavior 
the blast from this church of nearly 10 million americans 
secondlargest in us protestantism next to southern baptists 
came in a latenight finale of its governing conference and got 
scant news attention 
yet it marked a heightened level of church reproach against 
israel putting added strains on jewishchristian relationships in 
this country 
rabbi james rudin interreligious affairs director of the 
american jewish committee called the statement a onesided 
expression of selective outrage against israel without also 
criticizing arab fomenters of violence 
overall its an unbalanced statement he said and the 
harshest emanated from the church world toward israel 
however it was approved by an overwhelming 81676 vote urging 
the united states to stop all military and security aid to israel 
until israel ceases the repression of palestinians in the 
occupied territory 
castigating israels use of force to put down rockheaving 
palestinian upheavals the resolution said of israels actions 
this violent behavior brutalizes human beings both oppressed 
and oppressors and leads to a deepening cycle of hatred and 
violence 
the statement called on israel to stop beatings to end the 
killings to cease destroying palestinian homes to stop deporting 
palestinians to enter into negotiations with palestinian civilians 
and the palestine liberation organization over legitimate demands 
including fair and just distribution of disputed lands 
oddly a few days before the churchs bishops had issued an 
evenhanded statement on the israelpalestinian crisis seeing in 
it impetus for fresh approaches urging arab recognition of israel 
and a plebiscite among palestinians on their desires 
however the church delegates half laity and half clergy from 
around the country asked the us government to press 
international efforts and open negotiations with the plo to settle 
the regions problems 
rudin a familiar figure in christianjewish discussions said 
the demand that the us cut off aid to israel until it shifts 
policies was a carrot and stick technique that good friends dont 
use and that wont work 
there was no similar call for us to stop miliitary and 
security aid to arab countries that harbor and train terrorists it 
calls on israel to do various things but doesnt call on arab 
countries to recognize israel 
in various ways rudin said the statement applied a selective 
double standard of blaming only israel 
he said the statement does not mention what the palestinians 
are doing to read it you would come to the conclusion that they 
are mahatma gandhilike nonviolent people when we all know they 
are not 
however the statement does ask palestinians and the plo to 
recognize israel and to cease the support or initiation of all 
terrorist activities 
ronald young of new york executive of a newly organized us 
interreligious committee for peace in the middle east told the 
conference earlier it is a conflict that is not reducible to all 
the right on one side and all the wrong on the other 
however he said christian leaders usually are reluctant to talk 
about it for fear of being labeled antijewish that inhibition 
didnt prevail among the methodist representatives

joseph campbell made his career teaching about 
life as comprehended in the myths or stories people tell about 
themselves and the universe 
half a year after his death public television offers a 
stimulating seminar with the great teacher starting may 16 with 
the heros journey a onehour documentary about campbell 
a week later pbs begins a sixweek series of bill moyers 
conversations with campbell in joseph campbell and the power of 
myth 
the heros journey is a useful introduction to campbells 
ideas about mythology and his core conviction there is one 
mythology in the world with variations called christianity 
islam buddhism and so on 
a myth in this sense is not a lie but a metaphor for the 
experience of life 
so to campbell the idea of god is not true or false god is 
a metaphor for a mystery that absolutely transcends all human 
categories of thought even the categories of being and nonbeing 
the metaphor is valid he says if it is putting you in touch 
with the mystery that is the ground of your own being if it isnt 
its a lie 
though joseph campbell and the power of myth is simply the 
two men talking it may be the most compelling television series 
this year 
the conversation is strewn with ideas that will be enlightening 
provocative and at times maddening the success of the series may 
be measured by the number of times a viewer will want to argue and 
by the conversations that begin after the tv is switched off 
campbell who taught at sarah lawrence college for 38 years 
died oct 30 in honolulu at age 83 he left an extensive record of 
his work in books including the hero with a thousand faces and 
the masks of god 
he is a writer of important scholarship but you dont find 
the person in the writing moyers said in a recent interview 
you find the mind there but not the personality not the 
power of the individual that comes through any great teacher 
thats why i wanted to do so much with him we would have his 
works but we wouldnt have his teaching teachers have to be 
experienced they cant be read 
moyers didnt know much about campbell when they met in 1979 for 
an interview that appeared two years later on bill moyers 
journal on pbs 
we had over 14000 requests for a transcript so i knew i had 
touched a chord moyers said even without the requests i knew 
he had touched a chord because he moved me he opened my eyes he 
connected what had been unrelated phenomena in my own experience in 
life 
for this series moyers taped 23 hours of interviews and spent 
many more hours in informal conversations 
we became pretty good friends more so than i usually do with 
somebody i put on the air because i dont have that much time with 
them moyers said i was his perpetual student his graduate 
student for life 
campbell was raised as a roman catholic and fondly recalled that 
experience as powerful lifesupporting and beautiful but 
like many another believer his faith was derailed by charles 
darwin 
the thing that saved me he says was the upanishads 
hinduism 
in those texts he says in the heros journey he found the 
same mythology as in christianity without the insistence that the 
stories were historically true 
campbell is the most spiritual man i ever met moyers said 
but he knows that this series will not be welcomed by 
fundamentalists 
what i took him as saying is that all religion is true and if 
it works for you fine said moyers 
if it does in fact lead you to love the lord thy god with all 
thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and thy neighbor as 
thyself fine you dont have to move on to this other angle of 
seeing 
faith moyers added is an excruciatingly personal choice 
or rejection your idea of god may be terribly dissatisfying to me 
which is why i love the democratic way which is that you cant 
impose it on me 
moyers interviews with campbell are also the basis for a book 
the power of myth compiled by betty sue flowers a professor 
at the university of texas it will be published this month by 
doubleday 
moyers said the book was initiated by jacqueline kennedy 
onassis an editor at doubleday 
moyers said mrs onassis had been impressed by the earlier 
interviews in which campbell talked about the mythic significance 
of john f kennedys funeral and of the ancient mythological 
symbol the widow who helps us all come to terms with our grief 
when the ruler is killed

a month after the 60th academy awards evidence 
persists that the oscars golden touch doesnt always live up to 
its reputation 
columbia pictures had hoped that the sweep of nine oscars by 
the last emperor would result in a boxoffice bonanza but 
despite doubling the number of theaters to more than 800 after the 
awards the chinese epic has added only 10 million to theater 
grosses 
after 164 days in release the last emperor had sold 366 
million worth of tickets in the united states and canada by 
comparison the ghostly comedy beetlejuice grossed 467 
million in just 33 days 
still james r spitz president of columbias domestic 
distribution maintains the last emperor has had a very good 
performance since the awards 
comparing the last emperor to beetlejuice is like 
comparing apples to oranges he said the last emperor will 
never have the teenage audience that beetlejuice has 
spitz predicted the bernardo bertolucci film will continue doing 
good business through memorial day and will remain in distribution 
for a long time 
moonstruck which collected acting awards for cher and 
olympia dukakis has added 10 million since the oscars bringing 
its total to 69 million the figure is impressive since the film 
had been in wide release for more than two months 
much has been written about how winning oscars can inflate 
actors salaries with one exception this years winners seem 
unlikely to boost their paychecks 
since romancing the stone and fatal attraction michael 
douglas has become one of the most indemand stars in hollywood 
his win for wall street will have little effect on douglas who 
sometimes produces his own films the china syndrome jewel 
of the nile 
douglas next film is for sherry lansing and stanley jaffe who 
produced fatal attraction in black rain he will play an 
american police officer trying to solve a murder by the yakusa the 
japanese mafia 
having appeared in the witches of eastwick suspect and 
moonstruck in 1987 cher can afford a rest no new films have 
been announced for her in the wake of the oscar but the scripts 
must be piling up at her door meanwhile she will collect a 
fortune with her las vegas act 
sean connery winner as supporting actor in the 
untouchables needs no help from oscar or anyone else in his 
career he has been a top wage earner since his james bond days 
hell appear this summer in presidio with mark harmon and 
works next as harrison fords father in the third indiana jones 
movie 
olympia dukakis seems to be the major recipient of oscars 
beneficence although a distinguished stage actress she was little 
known before moonstruck since her nomination she has been 
able to decline two offers for television series she has accepted 
a small role in mike nichols working girls which stars 
melanie griffith harrison ford and sigourney weaver but her 
agents predict big things for her 
the april 11 oscar show drew generally poor notices but also the 
best television rating in years 
the ratings show that we didnt lose our audience even during 
a sweep by the last emperor said samuel goldwyn jr who 
produced the show for the academy i tried to prevent that by 
putting a heavy load of comedy robin williams eddie murphy 
toward the end the audience stayed with us 
goldwyn recognized the problems in moving to the shrine 
auditorium with its poor acoustics and the horendous traffic jam 
but those problems can be solved i think we benefited from 
having 6000 in the theater it was a much warmer audience the 
music center where the awards show previously was staged held 
only 2000 people 
most critics lambasted the 3hour broadcast time and goldwyn 
commented that the academy will have to address that problem 
there are certain things in the show that the academy is 
interested in but the public isnt he said 
efforts to eliminate such awards as short subjects 
documentaries and animation from the show have so far failed to 
achieve board of governors approval 
will goldwyn be around next year to help deal with such problems 
not on your life he said two years is enough

astrology and other strategies presumed to 
predict the future are sharply denounced in the bible but the 
ancient stargazing system has evolved somewhat over the centuries 
in its modern popular form which reportedly has been used by 
nancy reagan it has little to do with religion but scholars say 
it still has ramifications that can turn it at odds with biblical 
faith 
a lot of people today regard it as kind of an innocent 
pastime says the rev page kelley an old testament scholar of 
southern baptist theological seminary in louisville ky 
they dont put much store in it i put it in the same category 
as reading fortune cookies in a chinese restaurant but if people 
really take it seriously as a scheme for ordering their lives the 
old objections become valid again 
to rely on it seriously he added borders more on stupidity 
than sin 
in olden times astrology was closely connected with idolatry 
used along with other devices both to determine courses of action 
and ascertain the will of the gods 
an abomination scripture calls it in deutertonomy 189 
decreeing death by stoning for any israelite man or woman who 
practices divination or uses soothsaying augury sorcery a 
charmer medium wizard or necromancer 
divination linked to early astrology used various clues to 
determine the will of the gods such as positions of celestial 
bodies tossed arrows to see how they fell examining 
configurations of oil on water or in a sheeps liver 
the prophet isaiah assailing the evils of babylon says 
scornfully 
let your astrologers come forward those stargazers who make 
predictions month by month let them save you from what is coming 
upon you surely they are like stubble the fire will burn them 
up 
similar reproaches are scattered through scripture with 
astrologers described as those who divide the heavens into 12 
signs of the zodiac who gaze at the stars who at the new moons 
predict what shall befall 
they wander about each in his own direction 
rabbi david sperling of hebrew union collegejewish institute of 
religion said the strong condemnations of divination early 
astrology were because of its ties to idolatry contrary to 
judaism 
we had the prophets and got the word of the lord directly from 
them he said we didnt have to rely on looking up at the 
stars or inside animals to see what the gods had in store for us 
the prophets were much more reliable 
what the bible condemns is considering the stars as kind of 
heavenly writing telling you what god has in store for you 
he said astrology had evolved since ancient bible times 
modified in later ancient greek and egyptian civilizations to be 
seen not as revealing the gods but charting planetary effects on 
earthly behavior and moods 
thats not quite what the bible was dealing with sperling 
said 
added rabbi eugene borowitz also of hebrew union collegejewish 
institute of religion theres not a simple straight line from 
the bible to the kind of astrology mrs reagan is involved in 
however religious scholars said astrology claiming the planets 
partly control human affairs tends to run counter to biblical 
teaching of humanitys free will to choose good or evil 
however religious institutions rarely speak of astrology these 
days although it was often attacked in the early centuries of 
christianity and also in islam 
fundamentalist theology very clearly condemns astrology 
kelley said but he noted that contemporary churches generally have 
shown little if any concern with it he said the assumption seems 
to be that few people take it seriously 
if they do thats another matter and something to be 
concerned about he said 
sperling said that jewish scritpures the old testament 
strongly condemn early tendencies of astrology as a conduit of 
gods but rabbinical thought since then has varied on the subject 
were not of one mind he said some are opposed to it 
while others think its not such a terrible thing 
the prophet daniel who served in the court of the babylonian 
king nebuchadnezzar bewildered by his fortunetellers and 
astrologers told him 
no wise men enchanters magicians or astrologers can show to 
the king the mystery which the king has asked but there is a god 
in heaven who reveals mysteries 
daniel proceeded to tell nebuchadnezzar his reign was ended 
you have been weighed in the balances and found wanting 
legend has it that the wise men who visited the christ child 
were persian astrologers alerted to the event by planetary 
conjunctions 
called variously a prescience or pseudoscience astrology 
became scientifically untenable with the rise of modern 
physics says the encyclopedia britannica but it still holds wide 
attention in newspaper columns other publications and commercial 
establishments 
the encyclopedia says in short modern western astrology 
though of great interest sociologically and popularly generally is 
regarded as devoid of intellectual value

the results 
it is no more than an interesting investigation says the

even if proof could be offered that the shroud of turin was the 
shroud of christ that would be no more than an additional artifact 
in the historical evidences of christs resurrection already so 
well attested 
the vatican is allowing the carbon14 tests on bits of the 
shroud preserved in turin italy and bearing the image of a 
crucified man to determine its age and whether it dates to the 
time of christ

iraqs economy lost its footing in the 1986 
oil price collapse but is regaining its balance partly because of 
the 7yearold war with iran 
the conflict which is costing 10 billion a year has forced 
president saddam hussein to streamline a bloated prewar 
bureaucracy increase efficiency in government sectors and scrap 
some of his socialist programs 
oil prices are firmer and oil exports are climbing saddam has 
sold off inefficient stateowned enterprises in a program aimed at 
revitalizing the private sector long suppressed by socialist 
policies 
all this has helped ease the worries of iraqs many creditors 
who last year had to reschedule the countrys debt repayments 
because the iraqis did not have enough cash 
even so iraq is only just managing to keep pace with a 
warincurred foreign debt of at least 35 billion diplomats say 
the governments decision last year to loosen its grip on 
subsidized prices and foreign exchange has helped reduce 
oncechronic shortages but at a painful cost for many of iraqs 15 
million people 
the long lines of shoppers outside stores are fewer now than in 
1986 because goods are more plentiful 
some iraqis grumble about prices however 
local meat which used to cost the equivalent of 750 to 9 a 
pound now sells for 9 to 1050 a pound at the dollars official 
rate of exchange against the dinar of 330 to one exchange houses 
outside iraq however trade the dinar at 50 cents for one 
bread rice and cooking oil remain subsidized but a package of 
30 eggs that once cost 430 now sells for at least 830 
even the cost of candy bars has risen from 25 cents to nearly 
1 
these are stiff prices for many workers civil servants for 
example earn 90 to 150 dinars a month 
many iraqis have found their incomes squeezed further this year 
by increased working hours in essential industries and offices 
making the oncecommon practice of moonlighting nearly impossible 
its still difficult to find many goods at subsidized prices 
forcing iraqis into the costly black market for such things as car 
parts or cigarettes 
the variety on the vegetable stands is the most visible sign of 
iraqs move away from 20 years of strict socialist controls on the 
economy 
the government told businessmen last year they could import 
goods with foreign currency with few questions asked about how 
they got the money 
planning minister samal majeed faraj said recently iraq will 
allow arabs from other countries to invest in iraq with guarantees 
against government seizure of their assets 
in the last year the government has sold off bus companies 
poultry farms dairies gas stations and supermarkets and other 
businesses and is trying to get outside investors to buy a stake in 
iraqi airways the national flag carrier 
saddam also abolished labor laws that had guaranteed employment 
other countries are looking at iraq with more confidence 
it has won promises of new loans or credit guarantees from the 
united states france and west germany 
until the war it didnt matter if the economy was well run or 
not because they had so much money said a european diplomat 
this is a country with more than 100 billion barrels of proven 
oil reserves the diplomat noted they plainly have a way to 
repay

fourteenyearold noorieh mazloumpoor 
has had two educations in her young life one moslem the other 
marxist 
she got her marxist education in her homeland afghanistan 
as a refugee with her family in pakistan for the past two years 
her education has been based on islam her religion 
she is typical of afghan children who have been taught two 
conflicting ideologies over the past decade of war in their country 
now with the soviet military withdrawal from afghanistan the 
children who have had an islamic education in pakistan will be 
returning home to join those whose education was wholly marxist 
the gap may be wide but students interviewed here were 
confident it wont deter them from reuniting their country in the 
long run 
noorieh went to school in kabul afghanistans capital until 
she was 12 
in pakistan she enrolled in a moslem school run by the 
guerrillas fighting the sovietbacked afghan government 
like many of her classmates she has had to switch from courses 
that taught communist doctrine to interpretations of the koran the 
moslem holy book 
in kabul she said she was taught that it was her duty to 
serve the country the masses the revolution and the fruits of 
history 
at her refugee school in peshawar the blue cover of her persian 
language text book has a map identifying her country as moslem 
afghanistan another map in the book carries the koranic verse 
there is no god but allah mohammed is his prophet 
refugee books published by the guerrillas afghan education 
council also teach the future of afghanistan should be 
reconstructed on the principles of islamic culture 
eventually we will have to reconcile the two said 
ehsanollah poopal 17yearold 10th grader 
its going to take a lot of effort patience they have their 
reasons and we have ours 
poopal however said he will not accept the communist teachings 
and will try to explain to his classmates back home why his beliefs 
are different 
another refugee student 15yearold mehrafsa said he thinks it 
is going to be difficult in the beginning 
we are going to suffer first especially to see our friends 
are led toward a corrupt path taught bad values but i dont think 
it will be too long before we understand each other i dont think 
the gap will affect the country in the long run 
wassimeh 24 a teacher at one of the refugee schools believes 
moslem education will continue when the children among the 3 
million refugees in pakistan return home 
maliheh malekzad 28 an mathematics teacher said she taught at 
a kabul school until two years ago she added that unless a teacher 
was a member of the communist party there was no hope of promotion 
it is very difficult for a moslem not to be able to express 
her religious viewpoint and to be taunted for her belief she 
said 
schools in afghanistan according to the teachers and students 
here have their own party recruitment bodies the scouts the 
first stage of communist indoctrination and the youth 
organization where russian culture and language are taught and 
where some are given schoolarships to study in the soviet union 
the third stage is the older youth organization where advanced 
communist books are read outside the school curriculum 
ms malekzad said the refugee schools here are good at teaching 
theories but poor in practical education 
the walls and classrooms are adorned with guerrilla posters and 
during class the students sing i cry for my motherland i cry 
for its martyr wherever i turn i see broken limbs 
but 9yearold godsiyeh amir mohammad said she likes studying 
islam because it will make me go to heaven

rambo crocodile dundee and a dwarf named 
willow begin the summer movie season this month with a blast that 
industry analysts expect to help propel the nations theaters to a 
record year 
it looks like another record said art murphy financial 
writer for the entertainment trade paper daily variety the first 
four months are already 100 million more than last years record 
if the pace is continued at the same rate the year will easily 
exceed 1987s 4 billion 
the 15 weeks of summer which amount to 40 percent of the 
years total look very promising first sequels of big hits are 
always strong and youve got crocodile dundee ii plus rambo 
iii which is really a first sequel since the original film was 
first blood plus you have a george lucas film which is not in 
the same star wars mold 
crocodile dundee ii and rambo iii open on may 27 while 
the lucas epic willow was moved ahead to may 20 in an 
apparent attempt by mgmua to beat the crowd the company is 
understandably nervous about the 35 million film plus 20 
million for advertising and promotion which has no stars and the 
hero is a dwarf who protects a baby from an evil queen 
rambo iii also seems a perilous investment in view of its 
reported 63 million cost including 20 million to sylvester 
stallone also stallones last two releases failed to ignite the 
box ofice 
other repeats of past hits will be offered for the summer trade

dundee said todd zsmania booker for the 75screen mescop chain

i saw a rough cut of willow that was a little slow getting 
started then picked up speed i assume they made some cuts and i 
think it will be a winner i also saw a rough cut of crocodile 
and the ending was confused but i think theyll take care of that 
rambo i think will be big for a couple of weeks then drop

egypt built the aswan high dam two decades 
ago as a safeguard against the whims of the nile river but the 
worst drought in 70 years has dangerously lowered water levels and 
threatens to shut down the dams electricpower generators 
the government is using television jingles and newspaper 
campaigns to urge egyptians to conserve water and electricity 
president hosni mubarak warned on television that thousands of 
villages could go dark this summer unless the eightyearlong 
drought upriver eases 
he said the water of lake nasser the aswan dams 
1335squaremile reservoir is perilously close to a level 
impossible to sustain electricity generation 
the dam built during the 1960s with soviet help and inaugurated 
in 1971 was intended mainly to end annual killer floods it also 
was to provide adequate nile water to irrigate egypts agricultural 
heartland along its banks 
in addition it supplies 30 percent of egypts electricity 
experts say agricultural production has escaped serious harm so 
far but could be affected by another year of drought agriculture 
was the main casualty from the nile valleys last serious drought 
which began in 1913 and continued for seven years 
in the current drought the high dam has been credited with 
sparing egypt the famine that has spread across sudan and ethiopia 
upriver but the prolonged lack of rainfall at the ugandan and 
ethiopian headwaters of the white nile and blue nile has lowered 
the rivers level in egypt by more than 69 feet at the high dam 
the water surface is now 508 feet above sea level 
summer rains in ethiopia normally provide the nile with 84 
percent of its water 
this past january the month when the river is always at its 
shallowest houseboats were high and dry in cairo 600 miles 
downstream from aswan for the first time in anyones memory nile 
cruises from luxor 450 miles south of cairo to abu simbel were 
abandoned or started upstream from luxor 
transnile ferry service was halted at luxor for a while last 
year and longtime residents reported more land outcroppings in 
the niles dark murky water than ever before 
maher abaza the minister of electricity and energy sounded the 
alarm almost a year ago cautioning against increased consumption 
and waste of electricity and water 
consumption continued to climb however and official figures 
indicate that at least 45 percent of cairos share of the nile 
waters is wasted by negligence and the citys outmoded water system 
current predictions hold that the water level at the dam will 
decrease to 495 feet above sea level by july abaza said in a 
recent interview 
that will mean that the dam will be able to work only at half 
capacity producing 900 megawatts abaza said if the level 
goes under 147 meters 485 feet production of the high dam 
will be zero 
he added that generating plants are producing electricity as 
fast as they can now just to keep up with an everincreasing demand 
much of the increase in demand has been in the countryside 
where peasants returning from wellpaying jobs in saudi arabian oil 
regions have come home with electric fans ovens and television 
sets 
mubarak said in his tv address that if highdam generation 
stops the government will have to keep factories working by 
cutting off power to some of the countrys 5000 villages 
egypts 54 million people use 45 billion kilowatthours of 
electricity increasing by up to 20 percent a year figures 
indicate that the steady increase is due to what egyptians regard 
as luxury items such as air conditioners and color television sets 
egyptians open their taps and find water and switch on the 
light and everything lights up and they think that it is easy and 
will remain that way said abaza 
but they have to start cooperating and curbing their 
consumption or there are going to be serious consequences

with a little financial help from abroad 
and a lot of enthusiasm from 200000 volunteers opponents of 
chiles military government have launched a campaign they say will 
keep fraud out of this years presidential election 
ten opposition parties from left to right have united in the 
campaign of doortodoor voter education pollwatching on election 
day and independent vote counting afterward 
leaders of the national election command for democracy maintain 
that the system is necessary because they believe fraud tipped a 
1980 plebiscite to approve a governmentdrafted constitution 
genaro arriagada secretary general of the command said the 
1980 plebiscite in which the government received 67 percent of the 
vote lacked the minimal conditions necessary to guarantee any 
honest election 
that vote took place without voter registries because the old 
ones had been destroyed by the military shortly after they seized 
power in 1973 polling stations were manned only by 
governmentappointed officials without any opposition or 
independent supervision 
arriagada said a national census taken two years after the vote 
showed that in several cities the number of people who voted in the 
plebiscite was higher than the number of residents in the cities 
the government has denied accusations of fraud 
the upcoming presidential plebiscite will be very different 
arriagada said he said voter registries now have reopened and 
this time we have the capacity to guarantee a clean vote 
in the plebiscite scheduled for an unspecified date later this 
year chileans will be able to vote yes or no on a single 
militaryappointed candidate for the 198997 presidential term if 
the candidate is rejected by voters a competitive election will 
take place a year later 
president augusto pinochet the 73yearold army commander who 
has ruled since 1973 is considered the most likely candidate 
ricardo lagos leader of the socialist party and a key member of 
the national election command said 700 specialists are training 
the 200000 volunteers throughout the country to work as 
pollwatchers on election day 
he added in an interview that the opposition will be able to 
have three to five monitors at each of the 20000 or so voting 
places 
we can guarantee to every citizen that his vote will be 
properly accounted for and that it will remain secret lagos 
said 
some volunteers have already visited hundreds of thousands of 
voters in the doortodoor campaign to explain to them that this 
time the vote will be totally clean he said 
lagos added that part of the financing for the campaign has come 
from groups abroad interested in the restoration of democracy in 
chile 
he said the cost is relatively low however he estimated his 
socialist party will spend the equivalent of around 100000 
lagos did no identify the foreign groups sending money but the 
national endowment for democracy of the united states and several 
west european foundations especially in west germany italy and 
sweden have been officially reported in the past as granting 
financial aid to chilean democratic dissident groups 
the national election command also has organized a nationwide 
computerized votecounting system to operate independently of the 
government system 
eduardo arriagada an engineer in charge of the vote counting 
center said we will be able to quickly deliver a projection of 
the vote and complete returns 
eric campana a leading electoral expert of the christian 
democratic party the largest in the opposition said the system 
we are implementing fully guarantees a clean vote there will be no 
fraud this time chileans can rest assured of that 
campana said volunteers trained as pollmonitors show an 
enormous enthusiasm 
many of them are paying for their travel and other expenses 
connected with the campaign out of their own pockets 
juan gabriel valdes who works at the vote counting center 
said however old legislation granting the government emergency 
powers could still be invoked 
that legislation for example would allow the government to 
prevent us from announcing the returns we will be gathering 
valdes said 
that said lagos is the only fraud possibility that remains 
open

thirtyfive years after security officers 
first noticed that the soviets were bombarding the us embassy in 
moscow with microwave radiation the us government still has not 
determined conclusively or is unwilling to reveal the purpose 
behind the beams 
among the possible reasons put forward by experts attempts by 
the soviets to trigger eavesdropping devices to interfere with 
us intelligencegathering operations or to affect the health 
minds or behavior of americans working in the embassy 
lowpower microwave signals continue to be detected at the 
embassy according to the state departments bureau of diplomatic 
security 
however the department has ceased special efforts to monitor 
the health of us personnel exposed to the mysterious soviet beams 
over the years several studies to investigate potential effects 
of the moscow radiation led to controversial results in some 
cases the projects were terminated over the objections of 
researchers 
the united states has made a series of diplomatic protests to 
the kremlin over the microwave situation beginning at least as 
early as the glassboro summit in june 1967 
the associated press examined 5000 pages of declassified 
documents from the state department the central intelligence 
agency and the pentagon under the freedom of information act and 
interviewed dozens of current and former us officials scientific 
researchers medical specialists and attorneys 
many questions remain about the microwave bombardment which has 
involved a variety of transmitter sites frequency ranges 
modulations and power levels over a time span stretching from just 
after soviet dictator josef stalins death in 1953 to mikhail s 
gorbachevs current reform drive 
nonetheless these key facts emerge 
the moscow microwaves affair has had broader implications in 
several areas including ussoviet political relations research 
into the biological effects of nonionizing radiation electronic 
intelligencegathering operations and employeemanagement relations 
at the state department 
the us government apparently has succeeded in fighting back 
lawsuits and administrative claims totalling about 250 million 
brought by employees who were exposed to the moscow radiation or 
their dependents 
some american scientists and medical specialists investigating 
the problem have been seriously concerned about a possible soviet 
bloc lead in research on the use of radiofrequency and microwave 
radiation for mind control and other weapons applications 
significant questions remain over the validity of an 
epidemiological study of moscow embassy personnel carried out in 
197678 by johns hopkins university under contract to the state 
department the study found no adverse health effects among embassy 
workers 
shielding of the embassy against the soviet beams was first 
recommended 11 years before protective screening was finally 
installed 
certain us personnel in moscow apparently were exposed to 
significant amounts of electromagnetic radiation from sources 
within the embassy posing the risk of possible synergistic 
effects from combined exposure to such radiation and the soviet 
microwaves 
microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with a 
frequency range from 300 megahertz 300 million cycles per second 
up to 300 gigahertz 300 billion cycles per second the main uses 
of microwaves are in radar uhf ultrahigh frequency television 
longdistance telephone links satellite communications cooking 
medical treatment and a variety of industrial processes 
the state departments bureau of diplomatic security said in a 
recent statement that microwave signals continue to be 
detected at the moscow embassy chancery it said the soviet 
signals cover a broad frequency range from 5 to 11 gigahertz are 
usually on for a couple of hours a day and typically have a 
power level of 01 microwatt per square centimeter outside the 
building 
department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said we are of course 
concerned about this situation in the past weve protested when 
microwave power levels have exceeded those we consider safe 
were prepared to do so again should we determine that they pose 
any threat whatsoever to our staff however remote 
the declassified documents disclose that the bombardment of the 
moscow embassy drew expressions of serious concern in the mid1970s 
from two cia directors william e colby and george bush 
they also reveal that this concern came years after experts had 
initially recommended installing shielding to protect americans 
working inside the embassy from the radiation being beamed by the 
soviets 
eleven years passed between when scientific advisers proposed 
shielding of the embassy and when the protective screening actually 
was installed 
in an april 3 1965 memorandum a cia scientific consultant 
whose name was deleted from the document called for selection of 
suitable copper screening and mandatory coverage of all window 
openings at the 10story embassy 
installation of aluminum screening was finally started on feb 
6 1976 at the same time that special briefings were held to 
inform embassy personnel about the microwave radiation which until 
then had been kept secret from all except a handful of senior 
officials 
ten days later the cias concern over the moscow problem was 
reflected in a dear larry letter from bush to lawrence s 
eagleburger deputy undersecretary of state for management 
bush wrote that while he had been told by a cia expert that data 
from biomedical research were insufficient to prove that the soviet 
beams posed a health hazard the clinical evidence pertaining to 
several embassy staff members recently obtained by the state 
department medical services makes it prudent in our judgment to 
consider muts signal emanations as potentially hazardous 
muts was the code name for the soviet beams 
colbys expression of concern in a nov 26 1975 letter to 
eagleburger came five weeks after the soviets put into operation a 
second microwave transmitter codenamed muts2 atop a building 
just south of the embassy this was in addition to a microwave beam 
known as muts or muts1 aimed at the chancery from the roof of 
an apartment building east of the embassy across tchaikovsky 
street 
colby wrote that the increased probability of health injuries 
to personnel at the us embassy in moscow cia deletion 
warrant our immediate attention 
i have been briefed on the implication that the muts and 
muts2 signals are a possible cause of recent serious health 
problems of the embassy the cia chief said 
colby told eagleburger that donald a myers a cia specialist on 
biological and health effects of nonionizing radiation would be 
available to assist the state department in evaluating microwave 
radiation levels in moscow 
myers already had spent a week in moscow in july 1975 working 
with state department security officers he returned to the soviet 
capital for a 16day visit in december 1975 to reanalyze the 
situation in the wake of muts2 going into operation 
three days after myers arrived in moscow a cia memorandum 
summmarized myers initial observations the cw continuous wave 
signals which were active during october and then again since 30 
november are a cause for increased concern because the power 
density of the emanations is often concentrated within one or 
several narrow bandwidths at frequencies that can produce 
undesirable biological effects 
perhaps the most distressing observation is that the signal 
composition and orientation continue to change and that the 
general trend of such change since july would appear to be in the 
direction of an increased health risk it said

<TEXT>
the memorandum added since some recent health problems among 
embassy staff appear similar to emp electromagnetic pulse 
researchers at boeing at mit massachusetts institute of 
technology and possibly at the naval special weapons center 
comparison of details of exposure and lateroccurring pathologies 
appears warranted 
health problems which have been reported among personnel working 
with electromagnetic pulse equipment include an unusually high 
incidence of brain tumors and liver diseases 
a memorandum prepared by myers following his 1975 visit to 
moscow said dr herbert pollack a state department consulting 
physician has found that several members of the embassy display 
symptoms that are nonspecific but have been reported frequently in 
patients chronically exposed to nonionizing radiation 
such symptoms include headaches inability to concentrate and 
fatigue as well as physiological effects including shifts in the 
ratios of various blood cells 
soviet intentions remain the foremost unanswered question 
surrounding irradiation of the embassy 
attempts to figure out the purposes behind the microwave beams 
have involved specialists at the state department cia defense 
intelligence agency defense advanced research projects agency and 
national security agency 
the difficulties posed by this task were reflected in a june 6 
1975 letter in which the cias colby told eagleburger at state 
we hope that by working together state and cia technical officers 
can come up with satisfactory answers to this perennial enigma 
three theories have been put forward as possible explanations 
the soviets were trying to interfere with us electronic 
intelligencegathering operations 
the microwaves were used to interact with soviet eavesdropping 
devices planted within the embassy 
or the soviets were trying to induce psychological behavioral 
or physiological effects among american personnel 
mark garrison who served as head of the state departments 
soviet desk and then as the moscow embassys no 2 official before 
retiring in 1980 said in an interview we never did really 
figure out to my satisfaction what the purpose of the microwaves 
was ive got hunches about it but there was no final formal 
finding that was passed down from the technicians 
its extremely difficult for people running the political side 
of the ussoviet relationship and the management side to get a 
good handle on hightech electronic stuff said garrison now 
director of brown universitys center for foreign policy 
garrison leans toward the electronic jamming theory 
however that explanation has been challenged by moscow veterans 
familiar with the militaryrun electronic intelligencegathering 
operations 
retired army brig gen re barber said he absolutely cannot 
accept the jamming hypothesis because when he was in moscow 
during the mid1960s the microwaves had no effect whatsoever on 
our activities 
samuel koslov a nonionizing radiation specialist who has 
helped investigate the radiation believes the beams probably were 
been intended to interact with soviet listening devices 
they us debugging specialists still havent satisfied 
themselves that theyve found all the devices that may have been 
interacting with that signal they may have found some of them but 
they certainly havent found all of them said koslov a 
biophysicist at johns hopkins universitys applied physics 
laboratory in laurel md 
he added however that there could have been different 
purposes at different times over the 35year history of the 
microwaves problem 
regarding possible antipersonnel uses of microwave radiation 
koslov said i wouldnt say that it is impossible to produce 
psychological effects but you would have to do it with very 
different kinds of signals much higher power than what you have 
there 
other american specialists involved in the investigations have 
raised the mind control and weaponry possibilities 
among them was richard s cesaro who in the mid1960s was 
serving as deputy director for advanced sensors at the pentagons 
advanced research projects agency cesaro helped run the classified 
pandora project in which monkeys were exposed to a synthetic 
moscow signal in a laboratory at walter reed army institute of 
research 
initially pandora researchers believed that the irradiation had 
caused subtle behavioral effects in the test animals by mid1969 
consideration was being given to expanding the project to include 
human subjects later however reanalysis of the experimental 
data raised doubts about its validity a scientific review panel 
decided in 1970 that the project should be disbanded 
nevertheless cesaro in an interview prior to his death two 
years ago contended that in our experiments we did some 
remarkable things and there was no question in my mind that you 
can get into the brain with microwaves 
arguing that the soviet blocs investment of funds personnel 
and laboratory facilities in research on nonionizing radiation 
bioeffects has far outstripped the wests he said i look at it 
as still a major serious unsettled threat to the security of the 
united states 
if you really make the breakthrough youve got something 
better than any bomb ever built because when you finally come down 
the line youre talking about controlling peoples minds cesaro 
said 
another research effort whose results proved highly 
controversial was the state departments secret genetic testing 
program carried out from 1966 to 1969 under the cover name of the 
moscow viral study 
this project involved taking blood samples from embassy 
personnel exposed to the soviet microwaves and from a control group 
and analyzing the white blood cells for possible chromosomal damage 
those who were tested were not told the actual purpose but 
instead were given the cover story about checking for a viral 
condition 
by late 1968 concern about results of the cytogenetic testing 
had mounted among senior officials privy to the findings and the 
university contractor dr cecil jacobson urged that the study be 
continued and expanded in mid1969 however the state department 
abruptly decided to terminate the study after having test slides 
reexamined by four outside consultants 
nicholas h steneck a university of michigan history professor 
and author of a book the microwave debate said the 
cytogenetic testing program was set aside on the shoddiest and 
shakiest of grounds 
at the very least there was scientific ambiguity because 
there were some researchers who said the techniques were very good 
and that they did see effects steneck said if nothing else 
on the basis of that you do a followup study you dont just 
crank it down 
asked about stenecks remarks dr charles e brodine state 
department assistant medical director for environmental health and 
preventive medicine said he had not been with the department at 
the time of the genetic testing program and would prefer not to 
comment 
government officials and outside experts say one of the biggest 
lessons learned from the microwave problem was that it was a 
mistake to keep the radiation secret from most employees until 
february 1976 when the state department began briefing current 
former and prospective moscow personnel 
the main lesson is to be upfront with employees about things 
that they might consider to affect their health and wellbeing 
said garrison the former state department official

koslov was stronger in his criticism of the secrecy i think 
it was handled very badly there was no reason why they couldnt 
have informed the embassy personnel early on the lesson 
learned is to treat your people as though they have some 
intelligence 
after the radiation problem became publicly known in 1976 the 
state department denied press reports including a story in the 
soviet government newspaper izvestia that the problem was 
exacerbated by radiofrequency and microwave emissions from us 
equipment 
but a dec 5 1975 cia memorandum dealing with the soviet beams 
said some embassy staff members probably have received much 
larger exposures of electromagnetic radiation due to leakage in 
coaxial cable shields for cables running through the embassy 
interior from transmitters to antennas this problem may not be 
limited to the embassy in moscow 
in other documents the cias donald myers also expressed 
concern over highfrequency radio radiation induced in telephone 
and other wiring leading into the ambassadors ninthfloor office 
due to spillover from a miniloop antenna mounted outside 
the antenna was subsequently moved to a different location on 
the embassy roof 
paul brodeur author of the zapping of america a book 
dealing with the moscow embassy affair and other cases of microwave 
exposure said he had been told by intelligence sources whom he 
declined to identify that there was always a question whether 
our own electronic countermeasures within the embassy were 
responsible for some of the irradiation of the employees 
a good many of the biologicalmedical problems at the embassy 
may well have been caused by our own efforts to jam the lowlevel 
incoming russian signals brodeur said 
the belated disclosure of the microwave bombardment prompted a 
series of administrative claims and lawsuits against the us 
government by employees and dependents who alleged that they had 
suffered health injuries because of exposure to the moscow beams 
to help defend itself against such legal actions the state 
department in 197678 funded a 1 million epidemiological study of 
moscow embassy personnel carried out under contract by the johns 
hopkins university school of hygiene and public health 
dr pollack the state department medical consultant said that 
without that hopkins study state would be sitting in the soup 
because there were about 250 million in tort actions on the books 
and every one of those has been withdrawn without a penny being 
paid 
there were about 100 someodd actions pollack said 
a virginia woman whose son was born with spina bifida a serious 
birth defect declined to comment in detail on the status of an 
administrative claim she brought against the state department in 
1977 
the woman who asked that her name not be used said regarding 
the possibility that her sons birth defect may have been linked to 
microwave exposure in moscow the only thing i can say is that 
its impossible to know theres no way well ever ever know 
thats the one thing i have learned 
another case involved a 175 million suit brought against the 
government on behalf of a boy born in 1973 with severe 
hydrocephalus a birth defect of the brain and central nervous 
system the boys father had served in moscow as a marine security 
guard 
peter a danelo a seattle attorney said the suit brought in 
federal court in los angeles alleged injury due to microwave 
radiation as well as medical malpractice at navy hospitals 
the microwave part of the suit was dismissed by the trial court 
the court cited what is known as the feres doctrine under which 
the federal government cannot be held liable for injuries suffered 
by activeduty military personnel or in this case for a childs 
physical injuries derived from his fathers activeduty injury 
danelo said the malpractice part of the case also proved 
unsuccessful 
h rowan gaither an official at the state departments office 
of the legal adviser said we had a group of moscow microwave 
files and they were all retired because they were not being 
actively pursued 
he said he was unable to confirm pollacks figures on the total 
number and dollar amount of the claims because the files have been 
sent to a federal records storage center in st louis 
the johns hopkins epidemiological study released in november 
1978 concluded that no convincing evidence was discovered that 
would directly implicate the exposure to microwave radiation by the 
employees at the moscow embassy in the causation of any adverse 
health effects as of the time of this analysis 
critics of the study however have voiced concern over the use 
of employees and dependents from us embassies and consulates in 
eastern europe as a control group for comparison to the health 
experience of moscow embassy personnel 
a confidential draft version of the study report itself noted 
that some of the members of the control group could have been 
exposed to microwave surveillance 
this was of concern especially since several participants in 
the study informed us that there indeed was surveillance using 
microwave technology at some of the comparison posts the draft 
document said 
this section was deleted in the final version of the report 
according to the minutes of an oct 17 1978 meeting of dr pollack 
with members of the study staff it was deleted because it was 
really heresay 
at the recommendation of the health study team the state 
department contracted with the johns hopkins applied physics 
laboratory for preparation of a retrospective technical analysis of 
the complex microwave radiation fields monitored within the moscow 
embassy 
the findings of this technical analysis were evaluated by the 
electromagnetic radiation management advisory council known as 
ermac a nowdefunct scientific panel that operated under the aegis 
of the commerce departments national telecommunications and 
information administration 
in june 1981 a report issued by ntia said the 14member 
advisory panel agreed that there is no scientific evidence nor 
are there any theoretical grounds to suggest that biological 
effects would be expected to occur from the type and low levels of 
exposure presented consequently ermac concluded that no 
deleterious biological effects to personnel would be anticipated 
from the microwave exposures at the us embassy in moscow 
however several experts on nonionizing radiation say they 
believe the state department and ermac may well have jumped to 
scientifically unwarranted conclusions in seeking to rule out 
possible health effects on personnel exposed to the moscow 
radiation 
among them is the university of michigans steneck who cited a 
variety of studies that have been done over the past few years 
since the 197678 johns hopkins epidemiological survey finding 
significant effects at very low radiation power levels 
i can see no reason why i would rest easier today than i would 
have 10 years ago he said as we learn more and more 
about the ways in which this radiation can interact with the body 
we find that there are more subtle ways than we initially 
suspected

here is a chronology from public records 
declassified documents and interviews of major developments 
concerning the soviet microwave bombardment of the us embassy in 
moscow 
october 1953 embassy security officers initially detect 
intermittent sovietsource microwave transmissions 
late 1962early 1963 electronic measurements confirm that the 
signal codenamed tums technically unidentified moscow signal 
is a directional microwave beam aimed at the back of the embassy 
from a fifthfloor window of an apartment building 100 yards to the 
west tums is a mix of frequencies ranging from 25 to 41 ghz 
gigahertz and operates at typical maximum power levels of 1 to 3 
microwatts per square centimeter 
april 4 1965 the state department asks doctors at the naval 
medical center bethesda md to conduct special eye examinations 
and electroencephalogram tests on personnel departing for and 
returning from moscow 
april 16 1965 the us intelligence board technical 
surveillance countermeasures committee meets to discuss the 
microwave problem it requests all member agencies to review 
medical records of personnel assigned to moscow since 1953 for 
possible clinical changes that may be linked with exposure to 
the radiation 
march 29 1966 the state department signs a contract with 
george washington university for cytogenetic testing of blood 
samples from moscow and control group personnel the program is 
conducted under the cover story of a moscow viral study 
june 2325 1967 secretary of state dean rusk lodges a protest 
over the moscow radiation with soviet foreign minister andrei 
gromyko during a summit meeting in glassboro nj 
dec 20 1968 a scientific review panel begins to evaluate 
results from the pandora project a secret research effort 
involving irradiation of monkeys with a synthetic moscow signal 
april 21 1969 the pandora review panel recommends that the 
experimental program be expanded to include testing of human 
volunteers exposed to lowlevel microwaves for six to eight months 
june 27 1969 the state department decides to terminate the 
cytogenetic testing program on the grounds that the test results 
were not confirmed by outside medical specialists 
jan 12 1970 the pandora review panel recommends that the 
research project conducted primarily at walter reed army institute 
of research be phased out because reevaluation of the 
experimental data showed no clear and strong effects 
march 1972 another signal codenamed smut goes on the air at 
power levels of less than 1 microwatt and operates intermittently 
until june 1975 with frequencies of 32 to 37 ghz it is beamed 
from a transmitter about onehalf mile northeast of the embassy 
may 26 1975 tums ceases operation 
may 28 1975 a soviet signal codenamed muts1 begins daily 
operation from a transmitter on the roof of an apartment building 
80 yards east of the embassy it is a complex broadband signal 
with frequencies in the range of 06 to 96 ghz and typical maximum 
power levels of 10 to 12 microwatts 
oct 16 1975 another microwave beam dubbed muts2 is 
detected coming from the top of a building 80 yards south of the 
embassy with a frequency range comparable to muts1 but lower 
power levels of 1 to 2 microwatts while tums had operated for 
about five to eight hours a day muts1 and muts2 are in operation 
for up to 14 hours daily with one or both the signals irradiating 
the embassy for a total of 18 to 20 hours a day 
jan 2630 1976 a team of us experts meets with soviet 
officials in moscow in an effort to persuade the russians to cease 
irradiating the embassy the talks prove fruitless with the 
soviets contending that the microwaves detected at the embassy are 
simply background radiation from broadcast and industrial sources 
feb 6 1976 ambassador walter j stoessel begins a series of 
classified briefings on the microwave problem for moscow embassy 
employees and dependents word of the briefings leaks to american 
correspondents security officers and military personnel start 
installing window screening to reduce penetration of the microwave 
beams into the building 
feb 12 1976 secretary of state henry a kissinger tells a 
news conference that this issue is a matter of great delicacy 
which has many ramifications he declines to go into detail 
feb 19 1976 members of the american foreign service 
association afsa a union representing foreign service officers 
express concern over the problem and the state departments failure 
to brief personnel earlier 
july 7 1976 the state department announces that the intensity 
of the microwave radiation beamed at the embassy has been greatly 
reduced down to 2 microwatts per square centimeter outside the 
building and a fraction of a microwatt inside also announced is 
the signing of a contract with johns hopkins university for an 
epidemiological study of personnel assigned to moscow and other 
posts in eastern europe 
jan 4 1977 a notice posted at the moscow embassy discloses 
that about onethird of individuals tested have shown abnormally 
high white blood cell counts it says the cause for this 
lymphocytosis condition is unknown 
nov 20 1978 results of the johns hopkins epidemiological 
study are released and come under criticism by afsa in a report 
with numerous caveats and limitations the study team says no 
convincing evidence was found that would directly link exposure 
to microwave radiation in moscow with adverse health effects 
april 1979 the senate committee on commerce science and 
transportation issues a report criticizing the state departments 
handling of the microwaves affair particularly its failure to 
inform employees from 1953 to 1976 
june 1981 a 14member panel the electromagnetic radiation 
management advisory council concludes there is no scientific 
evidence nor are there any theoretical grounds to suggest that 
biological effects would be expected to occur from the type and low 
levels of exposure presented in moscow 
nov 10 1983 ambassador arthur hartman tells reporters in 
moscow that he made a protest to the soviet foreign ministry over a 
microwave beam aimed at the embassy between july 14 and oct 19 
with a power level of 2 microwatts 
march 3 1988 a statement released by the state departments 
bureau of diplomatic security says that microwave signals in the 
511 ghz range continue to be detected at the moscow embassy 
chancery typical power levels it says are 01 microwatt per 
square centimeter outside the building and 001 microwatt inside

public disclosure of the moscow embassy 
problem in the mid1970s spurred a substantial increase of interest 
among us scientists in the controversial area of lowlevel 
microwave biological effects 
it had an enormous impact on the microwave research field 
said nicholas h steneck a university of michigan history 
professor who spent six years studying the field for his book 
the microwave debate 
for years most american researchers had assumed that any 
significant biological effects were thermal caused by heating of 
body tissues this viewpoint is reflected in the safety limit of 
5000 microwatts per square centimeter set in the current us 
voluntary guideline adopted by the american national standards 
institute 
the soviet union however has a much lower safety limit of only 
10 microwatts stemming from concern with subtle behavioral and 
physiological changes as well as subjective symptoms which soviet 
researchers have reported with chronic exposure at low power levels 
over the past decade more us scientists have started paying 
serious attention to athermal effects particularly effects on 
brain tissue of lowintensity microwaves modulated at extremely low 
frequencies 
since the early 1980s however federal government support for 
nonionizing radiation bioeffects research has declined markedly 
w ross adey a leading researcher based at the veterans 
administration medical center in loma linda calif told a house 
subcommittee last oct 6 that current levels of government funding 
now about 7 million a year are disastrously low 
there is reason to believe that this situation has arisen in 
part through a wellorganized activity on the part of major 
corporate entities from the consumer and military electronic 
industries to discredit all research into athermal biological and 
biomedical effects adey said 
also expressing strong concern over the funding cutback was 
janet healer a nonionizing radiation specialist at the national 
telecommunications and information administration a unit of the 
commerce department 
unfortunately this well has dried up at a time when there 
are some directions to follow that are very very interesting 
she said adding were quitting at the wrong time 
meanwhile the soviets continue to devote substantial and 
expanding resources to their own research program 
louis slesin editor of microwave news a newsletter covering 
the nonionizing radiation research field said that what is 
clear is that soviet researchers are extremely interested in the 
effects of this kind of radiation 
everybody whos come back after looking at soviet 
laboratories has been virtually green with jealousy on seeing what 
the russians have in terms of equipment in terms of their budgets 
and staff working in this area slesin said

the national milk producers federation says 
dairy farmers have been squeezed enough by the administrations 
price strategy to trim surplus production 
its time to try an alternative shortterm remedy such as 
another dairy termination program dtp or a diversion program at 
least until some basic changes in the dairy program can be worked 
out with congress the federation says 
a dtp could be designed to offer dairy farmers another chance of 
selling all or part of their herds thereby reducing us milk 
production or a diversion program could provide payments for 
reductions in milk sold on the market 
both programs have been tried in recent years but neither has 
provided permanent solutions to the surplus problem indeed 
according to the agriculture department milk production probably 
will rise to another record level in 1988 after declining slightly 
last year 
tom camerlo a canon city colo dairy farmer is president of 
the 72yearold federation which represents virtually all of the 
nations dairy farmer cooperatives and their members 
enough is enough camerlo said here last week dairy 
farmers are tired of suffering continual price reductions after 
having done more to address federal policy concerns than any 
segment of us agriculture 
camerlo referred to a string of reductions in the national price 
support level of milk since it rose to a peak of 1310 per 100 
pounds in 1983 in january under a formula provided by the 1985 
farm law the support was reduced again by 50 cents to the current 
level of 1060 per hundredweight 
the law also provides for an additional 50cent cut to 1010 
next jan 1 if usda again projects that it will have to buy the 
equivalent of more than 5 billion pounds of surplus milk in 1989 to 
prop up prices 
if the surplus continues beyond next year the law provides for 
another 50cent reduction to 960 on jan 1 1990 
last year when milk output was 1425 billion pounds the 
departments commodity credit corp bought butter cheese and 
nonfat dry milk equivalent to more than 67 billion pounds of 
milk that was down dramatically from ccc purchases or 
removals from the market in 1986 of 106 billion pounds out of 
the years production of 1434 billion pounds 
milk production in 1988 is expected to rise 2 percent to 3 
percent this year according to usdas revised estimates and net 
removals by ccc are expected to be in the range of 7 billion to 9 
billion pounds milk equivalent 
camerlo and other federation officials want to head off the 
further reduction in milk supports on jan 1 1989 by pressuring 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng to design an alternative 
which is also authorized by the 1985 farm law and that could be 
another dtp also called a wholeherd buyout or a diversion 
program 
in the past programs dairy farmers were helped finance their 
own payments through assessments on milk marketed in the case of 
the 18 billion in wholeherd buyout payments for example about 
38 percent was provided by assessments 
but lyng has been steadfast in opposing another buyout or 
diversion program federation leaders say therefore dairy farmers 
are being asked to put pressure on members of congress as well as 
on lyng to avoid the next 50cent cut in supports 
one of the arguments used by the federation is that part of the 
recent slide in dairy supports has been accompanied by an easing of 
production costs mainly lower feed prices but now with grain 
exports and the economy rebounding costs are going up again 
thus the federation says it makes sense to put brakes on the 
slide in milk supports or else see thousands of dairy farmers hurt 
economically 
according to usda economists the price of manufacturing 
milk used to make butter cheese and other products averaged 1227 
per hundredweight in the first three months of 1988 down 63 cents 
from a year ago 
the departments economic research service said in a new outlook 
report that milk prices paid to farmers probably will remain 
below a year earlier and average 5 percent to 7 percent lower for 
all of 1988 
but the report also noted that the average value of dairy feed 
or concentrate was 709 per 100 pounds as of april 1 up about 40 
cents from a year earlier 
for all of 1988 the cow ration value may average 25 to 45 cents 
higher than last years 675 per hundredweight the report said 
alfalfa hay prices also are higher averaging 69 per ton at the 
farm in the first quarter compared with 61 a year ago 
meanwhile consumer prices of dairy products continue to show 
smaller yeartoyear increases than the governments allfood or 
allitem index of retail prices the report said dairy prices will 
probably decline through midyear followed by some seasonal 
increase in the second half

the chief executive of cbs inc says the company 
is trying to come up with programming that will regain the cbs 
television networks leadership of the prime time audience ratings 
but laurence a tisch was criticized wednesday by some 
shareholders one of whom said tisch had destroyed a company that 
was the class of the industry by selling off several of its 
major businesses 
tisch responded by telling the companys stockholders at their 
annual meeting that the recent sales of the cbs magazine and music 
businesses had produced excellent returns and allowed the 
company to focus on its core broadcasting business 
tisch also said he was looking for opportunities to use some of 
cbs 3 billion cash hoard to buy television or radio stations 
cbs has four tv stations that cover about 20 percent of the 
country and under federal rules can buy additional stations 
extending that coverage up to 25 percent 
tisch also repeated earlier assertions that neither the cbs 
television network nor loews corps 249 percent stake in the 
company were for sale in addition to heading cbs tisch is 
chairman of loews which has interests in insurance tobacco and 
hotels 
he said cbs had no plans to sell its new york headquarters 
building nicknamed black rock a move that had been rumored for 
weeks 
since the last shareholders meeting cbs sold its magazine group 
for 650 million and its cbs records operation for 2 billion the 
cbs television network finished in third place in prime time 
ratings for the first time during the season that just ended 
tisch noted that asset sales had boosted the companys capital 
and that net interest income reached 517 million in the first 
quarter in contrast to net interest expense of 93 million in the 
same period of 1987 
but ralph colin jr a longtime cbs shareholder and an executive 
with the columbia house division that was sold as part of the cbs 
records group sale told tisch he seemed more interested in 
running a closedend mutual fund with the revenues derived from 
cbs assets than in broadcasting 
he said the asset sales might have pleased wall street but had 
demoralized remaining cbs employees and effectively destroyed 
something that was very near and dear to many of us a once great 
company a company that many considered to be the gem the class of 
the industry 
colin is among a group of cbs records executives who have sued 
cbs claiming they were wrongfully denied more than 1 million in 
bonuses for 1987 
while tisch did not comment directly on colins statement he 
said later in the 2hour meeting that the network had some 
exciting new programs for the next tv season and that employee 
morale was very high 
we are ready to take on the world in the battle to regain the 
no 1 position he said 
william s paley cbs chairman didnt attend the meeting but 
sent remarks in which he said he had reviewed the pilots for next 
season and found them imaginative and exciting i believe that 
they represent the first step in our recovery of our premier 
position in the industry 
assessing the outlook for broadcast advertising tisch said the 
first half of 1988 has not proved to be as strong as originally 
estimated and the industry outlook for the third quarter is less 
optimistic than anticipated 
he said this and the delay in the start of the fall television 
season due to the writers guild strike made it impossible to 
estimate cbs earnings for the year but he added the company did 
not anticipate a severe drop in profit

computers and robotics that slash the 
time it takes to make a sailboat mast have helped a charlotte 
company become the worlds largest automated maker of aluminum 
masts 
isomat us inc has reduced mast production time for the 
average 35foot slooprigged sailboat by nearly 90 percent from 
75 hours to about eight says mike vaught general manager of 
isomats charlotte plant 
the company is a subsidiary of international marine industries 
inc which through its sparcraft unit supplied the masts for the 
12meter contenders in the last americas cup yacht challenge 
including the stars and stripes and australias kookaburra ii 
since opening three years ago the charlotte plant which 
employs about 50 people has captured about 70 percent of the us 
market and 85 percent of the canadian market company officials 
said 
isomat us manufactures 15 to 20 aluminum masts per day with 
its unique automated system 
were set up to run 30 a day said vaught most shops 
cant do that many in a month 
isomat us had about 3 million in sales last year its masts 
range in price from about 600 to 4000 depending on the size and 
options 
ninetynine percent of our business is with boat builders who 
are as priceconscious as anybody vaught said during a recent 
tour of the facility 
isomat officials dont anticipate a time when all sailboat masts 
will be manufactured by an automated system some sailboat builders 
manufacture their own masts and other mom and pop companies 
will continue to sell enough masts to stay in business 
another imi subsidiary kenyon marine sells between 80 and 
100 masts a month although its masts take five times as long to 
manufacture and therefore are more expensive vaught said 
imi recently moved its kenyon operations from connecticut to 
charlotte to take advantage of some of isomats automated processes 
they kenyon are after a different market vaught said 
there are people who spend 40000 on a 40foot sailboat and 
people who spend 140000 
isomat engineers designs finishes and assembles sailing 
systems with extrusions produced in new york and aluminum castings 
shipped in by its sister facility in france using its automated 
system the company can handle custom orders from about 40 
different boat builders vaught said 
isomat uses computerassisted machines to taper the masts and to 
cut them for attachment of the various fittings and other hardware 
sailboat masts are tapered at the top to reduce weight and minimize 
air turbulence 
after tapering the mast is coated with a special anodizing film 
to prevent abrasion and corrosion in the marine environment 
the biggest advantage aluminum has over wood is that it 
doesnt rot vaught said this process adds 10 years to the 
life of an aluminum mast 
to treat the long masts isomat designed its own tanks the 11 
tanks are 70 feet long and capable of coating masts up to 69 feet 
long vaught said the company also can finish items such as light 
and flag poles stadium seating and other architectural components 
the system was designed with production and flexibilty in mind 
because the market for sailboats is widely varied 
theres a lot of customordering and we have to be able to 
supply it vaught said

still trying to rebound from octobers world 
stock market crash the toronto stock exchange has set its sights 
on grabbing business from us markets 
exchange officials hope their advanced automated trading system 
which has been licensed to several foreign exchanges proves a key 
advantage in luring canadian companies that now trade primarily in 
the united states 
the exchange which lists 1600 stocks and accounts for 77 
percent of canadian trading got a jolt on wednesday when share 
prices tumbled in the biggest oneday decline in four months 
raising fears of an impending economic recession 
the exchanges 300 stock composite index closed down 6382 
points at 322868 on wednesday the largest drop since a 118point 
tumble on jan 8 
the drop which mirrored a sharp decline on wall street caused 
by rising interest rates and recessionary jitters was the latest 
setback for a market where activity has slackened significantly 
since the oct 19 crash since then the number of investors has 
declined by 10 percent and the dollar value of trading has dropped 
41 percent 
in light of that trend and the increasingly global nature of 
securities trading the agenda for exchange president pearce 
bunting and other officials is to use their markets technological 
assets to drum up business 
the toronto exchange almost exclusively lists canadian 
companies but about 55 major players trade the bulk of their 
shares on the new york stock exchange or american stock exchange 
bunting plans to promote his exchange via the computer assisted 
trading system known as cats that it pioneered and now licenses 
to the paris brussels and madrid stock exchanges 
we will set up an electronic central order book system he 
said all bids and offers will meet electronically in the middle 
in the end you can envisage thousands of terminals around the 
world that would be connected with our system 
it will give us the opportunity to be one step up on new 
york 
the push for more business comes with the the october crash 
still fresh on the minds of local traders especially during 
wednesdays decline 
theres a lot of nervousness out there and investors will jump 
on any bit of information said analyst laird grantham of the 
firm davidson partners theyre worried about a recession 
canada led major developed countries last year with real growth 
of 39 percent the strong economy and the bank of canadas policy 
of maintaining a 25 to 3 percentage point interest rate spread 
over rates in the united states helped boost the canadian dollar 
to an exchange rate of 81 us cents from 69 cents since 1986 
but government figures for january and february showed growth 
and job creation at a standstill 
in six weeks the leaders of the group of seven countries and 
the european economic community will gather in toronto for an 
economic summit to discuss how to avert another market crash and 
recession 
but with president ronald reagan in his final months in office 
local traders were not confident the summit would tackle what they 
see as the epicenter of economic unrest the huge us budget and 
trade deficits 
don bainbridge an equity trader for gordon capital corp one 
of 75 members on the exchange also said historically after 
every american presidential election the market goes down for two 
years

the usg slate that included three members of the current management 
were going to continue to pursue our acquisition said joel 
l reed desert partners chief financial officer maintaining it 
was too early to predict the elections outcome 
day said the vote reflects stockholder confidence in 
managements ability adding that usg would not pay out any 
greenmail to the midland texasbased investment group 
greenmail is a premium price paid by a company for the stock of 
a wouldbe acquirer that is not offered to other shareholders 
some investment analysts have predicted desert partners might 
start selling off its nearly 10 percent stake in usg if it 
decisively lost the proxy battle but reed said well cross that 
bridge when we come to it 
in the takeover battle marked by lawsuits on both sides usg 
executives have contended desert partners launched its bid only to 
recoup losses in their usg holdings following octobers stock 
market crash 
weve thought all along that desert partners wanted to recover 
the investment they made at a bad time day said 
desert partners has accused usg executives of trying to entrench 
themselves with a poisonpill defense designed to hinder the 
takeover bid 
earlier this month usg announced a defensive recapitalization 
plan and business restructuring plan to counter the texans offer 
the usg plan to be submitted to a shareholders vote june 24 
will pay stock owners 37 in cash debentures with a face value of 
5 and a share of stock in the recapitalized corporation for each 
of the 515 million common shares the company would sell off two 
subsidiaries to finance the deal 
in march desert partners offered 42 per share in a hostile 
tender offer for 39 million usg shares or a 76 percent stake in 
the company that bid has a value of about 22 billion and remains 
in effect 
desert partners subsequently indicated it was willing to pay 45 
per share and reed told the shareholders meeting the texans might 
be willing to pay up to 50 a share 
usg stock which dropped below 30 per share after the market 
crash is currently selling in the 4446 pershare range

first republicbank chairman albert v casey said 
he does not plan to remain at the troubled holding company after 
its restructuring begins and said a search for his replacement has 
already begun 
casey said wednesday one of the candidates for the chairmanship 
is republicbank president joseph r musolino who is not seeking 
reelection to the board of directors at the companys annual 
meeting next month 
the companys restructuring is not likely to be completed before 
a review of first republics loan portfolio is finished in late 
june 
he also said the dallasbased bank holding company texas 
largest hopes to present a restructuring plan by midjuly that 
will include creation of a workout bank containing troubled 
loans 
in a meeting with reporters casey said officials believe the 
15 billion loss the bank holding company suffered in the first 
quarter of this year should prevent any further huge writedowns 
the big body blow is over casey said while adding that the 
company will continue with some loan losses 
first republic is working with drexel burnham lambert inc to 
establish the workout bank that bank would be secured by junk 
bonds sold to investors 
the workout bank would repay notes from the disposition of its 
holdings and could include a mechanism that would allow investors 
to share in an appreciation of real estate holdings from their 
current market value 
caseys comments came a month after he took over from gerald w 
fronterhouse and almost two months after the company received a 1 
billion cash infusion from the federal deposit insurance corp 
the chairman said the institution has heard two expressions of 
interest from investors the fdic which is handling other 
inquiries said it also has heard from several possible investors 
first republicbanks asset base shrunk from 332 billion at the 
end of 1987 to 284 billion as of march 31 
holders of first republics 13 billion in longterm debt will 
likely settle for a fraction of face value in the form of new debt 
that will be issued by the restructured company casey said 
if you look at the balance sheet small holders have been 
wiped out casey said 
first republic whose nonperforming assets totaled 45 billion 
as of march 31 has stopped making real estate loans even with 
the biggest and the best in the real estate business casey said

share prices were broadly higher at the days 
best levels at midday thursday in what dealers called a technical 
reaction to the previous days abrupt drop 
but trading volumes remained low other than a little dribbly 
buying most of the gains came from price markups a dealer 
said an absence of selling also underpinned prices he said 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index was up 153 
points or 09 percent at 17721 at about 1230 pm 1130 gmt 
the index fell 358 points on wednesday 
volume was light at 1911 million shares compared with 3557 
million at the same time wednesday 
the market also was helped by belated response to some some 
favorable corporate earnings reports shares in some companies that 
reported their results on wednesday were initially unmoved amid 
general market preoccupation with the nearterm course of 
international interest rates but the results were reflected in 
share prices on thursday 
elsewhere shares in rowntree plc fell 19 pence or 36 cents to 
885 pence or 1664 below the effective price of 9015 pence or 
1695 being offered by nestle sa in a hostile takeover bid it 
was the first time the british confectioners shares have fallen 
below nestles offer price since the swiss company launched its bid 
last month 
dealers said the price decline reflected increased market 
speculation that the bid could be investigated by the monopolies 
and mergers commission amid mounting political pressure for such 
an inquiry

nearly 11 years after its illfated sale of 
wisconsin steel navistar international corp is being sued in a 
case that could answer the farreaching question of how much a 
company can be obligated to pay retired and laidoff workers 
navistar is accused of selling the moneylosing steel unit in 
1977 to envirodyne inc a los angelesbased engineering company 
with no steelmaking experience in a bid free itself of 
multimilliondollar pension payouts and other employeebenefit 
obligations 
in a trial scheduled to begin today before us district judge 
james moran the pension benefit guaranty corp the federal 
insurer of pensions is seeking 145 million 63 million in 
unpaid benefits for the laidoff or retired steelworkers plus 
interest 
in the second lawsuit wisconsin steel creditors including an 
envirodyne unit the edc holding co are seeking 177 million 
from navistar charging fraud and racketeering in the 1977 sale of 
the steel company 
navistar known as international harvester co in 1977 lent 
envirodyne 50 million to finance the 65 million acquisition of 
wisconsin steel harvesters own investment bankers and lawyers had 
cautioned against the sale 
the trials outcome could well determine whether and to what 
extent the government and others can force corporations to honor 
pensionplan obligations to workers 
navistar already has reached a 148 million outofcourt 
settlement with 2700 former employees of the steel company the 
workers had sought 86 million in claims for benefits lost when the 
south side chicago steel mill was shuttered 
the government and the workers filed lawsuits against navistar 
in 1981 little more than a year after envirodyne operating as edc 
holding co filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court and 
closed the plant 
the filing came after edcs key lenders navistar and the chase 
manhattan bank called in collateral for past loans 
edc sued navistar in 1982 
the issue took on added significance last year when dallasbased 
ltv corp tried to unload 21 billion in pension obligations on 
the federal government 
the pension benefit guaranty corp already is stuck with 2 
billion in underfunded pension liabilities from other companies 
and its responsibility could climb to 4 billion if it loses its 
court battle with ltv 
in its annual report the federal pension insurer said a 
company cannot escape financial responsibility for its pension 
plans by transferring them to a weak third party that cannot 
successfully continue the business or fund the pension plans

millionaire investors merv griffin and donald 
trump resumed their battle over resorts international inc after 
the collapse of an agreement for griffin to buy the hotelcasino 
company trump controls 
the handshake deal less than a month old foundered wednesday 
amid a welter of accusations from griffin and trump each blaming 
the other 
in a move recalling the bitter monthlong feud that preceded 
the april 14 sale agreement griffin vowed to renew a 36ashare 
offer with the outside directors of the atlantic city njbased 
company 
trump responded that the onetime talk show host would never own 
resorts as long as he trump retained control of 88 percent of the 
voting shares 
its like going back to the day before merv and don shook 
hands griffin spokesman mark gill said of the falling out 
the failed agreement which capped months of maneuvering by the 
two highprofile businessmen called for griffin co to pay 207 
million or 36 a share for publicly held resorts stock that 
included all 57 million class a shares and the 53 percent of 
class b shares that arent held by trump 
it also called for griffin to acquire trumps class b shares 
which give him 88 percent voting control of resorts and to sell 
the massive unfinished taj mahal casino back to trump 
trump has refused to disclose the price offered for his stake in 
resorts acquired last year from heirs of company founder james 
crosby for an amount estimated by analysts at 101 million 
trumps chief spokesman harvey i freeman vice president of 
trump organization said griffin had sought lastminute changes in 
the agreement and had failed to prove he could obtain financing 
freeman predicted failure for griffins new overtures to resorts 
mr griffin can approach anyone that he wants to but it is mr 
trumps position that mr griffin will be unable to purchase the 
company in that way freeman said mr trump will resist any 
action by mr griffin in this regard 
in los angeles michael nigris president of griffin co 
described his boss as surprised and disappointed that donald 
trump was unwilling to proceed with the transaction 
financing was never an issue in the negotiations nigris 
said indeed the impasse arose from mr trumps refusal to abide 
by the original terms of the deal and to accept the fact that the 
existing resorts hotelcasino would remain a viable competitor to 
the taj mahal 
the battle pits two of the nations wealthiest entrepreneurs 
against each other 
trump who recently turned heads by offering to take over 
repairs of a closed new york bridge from the city is listed by 
forbes magazine as worth at least 850 million 
griffin 23year host of the television talk show that bore his 
name and creator of the hit game shows jeopardy and wheel of 
fortune is listed as being worth 300 million

several agreements in principle that 
would bring about the abandonment of the shoreham nuclear plant 
have been reached by the state and the long island lighting co a 
published report says 
under the agreements which must be approved by gov mario cuomo 
and lilco the state would gain control of shoreham for 1 and shut 
it down marking the first time a completed nuclear plant would be 
shut down before it began operating the new york times reported in 
thursday editions 
lilco has agreed to pay the estimated 400 million to 500 
million costs of the shutdown the newspaper said quoting state 
officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the times said the agreements included guarantees to lilco of 
annual rate increases of 4 percent to 5 percent for the next decade 
and the restoration of dividends to the companys shareholders 
beginning in 1989 
also lilco would take a 25 billion tax writeoff for the 
plant meaning it would pay no federal taxes for at least a decade 
the newspaper said 
and the state would let the utility float 100 million in 
taxexempt industrial development bonds that could be used to 
refinance more expensive debt the times reported 
the 53 billion plant has been a rallying cry for opponents of 
nuclear energy politicians campaigning for office and the utility 
which contends the plants energy was essential if the island was 
to have enough energy into the next century 
although the plant was supported by state and local officials 
when construction first began in the 1970s opposition grew as 
nuclear energy became less popular and more expensive and as the 
completion of the plant fell behind 10 years and 10 times over 
budget 
state and local officials argued that long island could never be 
quickly evacuated in an emergency and they refused to participate 
in any emergency plans for the plant located 55 miles east of new 
york city 
meanwhile the long island power authority created to consider 
a lilco takeover is continuing its proxy battle to elect three of 
its nominees to lilcos board of directors

although swedens ab electrolux says it 
wants good relations with murray ohio manufacturing corp 
employees the workers plan to tell the king and queen of sweden 
they want no relations at all with electrolux 
murray ohios directors have rejected a 182 million 
48ashare offer from electrolux a giant appliance manufacturer 
murray ohio which makes lawn mowers and bicycles at lawrenceburg 
tenn and is headquartered in brentwood tenn 
on wednesday murray ohio employees said they plan to send a 
petition to the king and queen of sweden opposing the takeover the 
petition will be signed by 5000 residents of lawrenceburg and will 
accompany a letter to the president of electrolux anders sharp 
protesting the takeover effort a spokesman said 
the employees news conference came a day after us district 
judge thomas a wiseman of nashville refused to lift a temporary 
restraining order suspending further action by electrolux 
concerning murray 
meanwhile scharp issued a statement which said in part 
electrolux has no plans whatever to close the lawrenceburg 
plant 
scharp said electrolux wants to own and operate the plant 
we need a good relationship at murray we regret that the 
understandable fears and concerns of murray employees in this 
situation appear to have been exploited he said 
however chuck brewer head of the employees just say nej 
committee said committee members believe the takeover is a threat 
to the murray ohios 3000 employees nej pronounced nay 
is swedish for no 
a copy of the letter to scharp in stockholm was released at a 
news conference along with a copy of an advertisement that is to 
appear in major us newspapers and a stockholm newspaper on may 13 
the letter said in part we do not dislike you your company 
or the people of sweden our relationship with murray is that 
of a family theyve been exceptional as an employer and 
community leader and friend 
among other things the ads say weve seen too many workers 
lose their jobs their identity and their selfrespect as 
independent firms fall prey to hostile outside interests when 
pushed we can be hostile too 
brewer said wisemans ruling was viewed as a victory allowing 
murray more time to fight the takeover among other things wiseman 
ordered the case moved from the state chancery court in 
lawrenceburg to his court in nashville 
scharp says electrolux is committed to purchasing murray stock 
even though it has run against initial roadblocks 
brewer released a list showing layoffs by electrolux after 
takeovers of plants in grand rapids greenville and belding mich 
columbus ohio spain italy britain and ireland 
as to whether there would be layoffs in lawrenceburg brewer 
said its an unknown it scares everybody 
bobbie clark who helped gather the signatures on the petition 
said we like things like they are

sasser dtenn in washington who will accompany employee leaders 
to the swedish embassy brewer said they will ask the ambassador to 
deliver the petition to the king and queen of sweden 
the proposed newspaper ad signed the working men and women of

buy our companys stock but not our loyalty

electrolux to withdraw their bid immediately or we will never be

the texas department of agriculture 
will appeal a federal judges ruling that blocks efforts to keep 
fresh florida citrus out of the lone star state an official said 
us district judge filemon vela ruled wednesday that the us 
department of agriculture did nothing wrong when it lifted a 
3year ban on shipments of the florida fruit to other 
citrusproducing areas 
we told the attorney general today that wed like him to start 
putting the paperwork together for an appeal said tda spokesman 
max woodfin 
the florida fruit was quarantined after an outbreak of citrus 
canker in parts of florida in august 1984 
the usda on feb 11 lifted the ban on shipments of fresh florida 
citrus into texas and other citrusproducing areas 
texas officials had sought to have the quarantine reinstated and 
claimed the usda did not allow adequate time for comment when it 
lifted the ban 
velas ruling wednesday was in response to a suit filed march 9 
by the state of texas which was trying to stop shipments of the 
florida fruit to the state the suit contends that the usda 
violated its own rules by failing to allow a comment period before 
lifting the ban 
with all the information put before me i am satisfied that 
the usda followed the law in promulgating the rule vela said 
wednesday 
the judge said the new protocol is so similar to one the usda 
proposed last fall but withdrew in january that there had been 
plenty of time for comment 
canker which comes in different strains can damage the plants 
and cause lesions on the fruit or make it drop prematurely from 
trees 
texas citrus producers say an outbreak of canker would devastate 
the states 65 million citrus industry concentrated on 30000 
acres in hidalgo cameron and willacy counties in the lower rio 
grande valley 
weve maintained all along that the risk of our getting canker 
is relatively small but its a risk we dont believe we ought to 
take said ray prewett director of texas citrus mutual a 
mcallenbased industry group 
florida officials have maintained that the canker is under 
control

a drain on us stockpiles and drought 
problems in brazil are raising prospects for american soybean 
farmers 
soybean futures on the chicago board of trade jumped wednesday 
in response to agriculture department figures showing tighter 
supplies of soybeans in the year ahead 
the harvest forecast in brazil the main us competitor in the 
world soybean market was reduced by more than 2 percent from 
prospects a month ago according to the latest department figures 
in a supplyanddemand report issued on tuesday the usda 
projected that the nations stockpile could decline to 145 million 
bushels at the close of the next marketing year on aug 31 1989 
from around 275 million bushels on sept 1 1988 
according to department records the us soybean inventory 
carried over into the new marketing year on sept 1 1989 would be 
the smallest in at least five years and possibly longer 
the sept 1 inventory was 436 million bushels in 1987 a record 
536 million in 1986 and 316 million in 1985 the carryover had 
dropped to 176 million bushels on sept 1 1984 reflecting drought 
losses in the 1983 harvest 
in the 198384 marketing year as a result of the tight supply 
soybean prices at the farm averaged an annual record of 783 per 
bushel up from 565 the previous year but the upward spike was 
temporary and prices tumbled sharply as production increased 
thereafter 
the new projections which usda officials caution are highly 
tentative show that farmers can expect soybean prices to average 
in the range of 575 to 775 per bushel in the 198889 marketing 
year compared with a reported 575 this season and 478 in 
198687 
according to the projections this years soybean harvest the 
crop is only about 14 percent planted could be around 188 
billion bushels slightly less than the 1987 harvest 
counting a sept 1 carryover of 275 million bushels that would 
mean a soybean supply of around 2155 billion bushels for the 
198889 marketing year of that some 1155 billion bushels are 
expected to be crushed into highprotein meal and oil exports will 
take an additional 760 million bushels and seed feed and other 
uses will account for more 
in all 198889 soybean use is projected at 201 billion 
bushels meaning some of the sept 1 carryover will have to be used 
to meet next seasons demand thus the soybean stockpile could be 
a relatively skimpy 145 million bushels by sept 1 1989 
historically the us soybean stockpile a times has been even 
smaller and prices higher 
in the early 1970s for example the sept 1 soybean carryover 
dropped below 100 million bushels for three consecutive years from 
a sept 1 1970 inventory of 230 million bushels prices which 
averaged 285 per bushel in 1970 rose to an annual average of 
664 per bushel in 1974 
after that soybean prices averaged in a range of less than 5 
per bushel to a peak of 681 in 1976 in 1980 however they 
averaged 757 per bushel a record until 1983 when the price went 
to 783

china the worlds leading hog producer has 
ended pork rationing according to an agriculture department report 
a chinese agriculture official privately stated that pork 
rationing in beijing had stopped being enforced the departments 
foreign agricultural service said wednesday other officials said 
that pork rationing had ended throughout the country though no 
official announcement has confirmed this 
china began rationing pork in most major cities last fall in 
response to shortages pork traditionally supplies about 80 percent 
of the total animal protein in the chinese diet 
the pork shortages that led to the rationing did not however 
affect chinas ability to supply hogs to its limited export markets 
primarily hong kong the report said in fact the country 
has had a surplus of hogs for export to hong kong but increases in 
hog trade between the two countries has been limited by a chinese 
export quota 
an end to rationing shows that chinese agricultural officials 
believe the tight pork supply situation is now being resolved as 
producers respond to lower feed prices higher pork prices and 
government incentives to promote larger production the report said 
it also is an indication that many urban consumers are willing 
to pay more for the higherquality free market pork instead of 
enduring the cheaper fattier meat that has been sold at lower 
prices in state markets the report said 
a usda study last year showed that china had a 1983 yearend 
inventory of 2985 million hogs compared with 558 million in the 
united states 
but with more than five times the number of hogs chinas pork 
production was less than double the us output 132 million 
metric tons to 76 million tons the usda study said a metric ton 
is about 2205 pounds 
the reason it took only six months for an american farmer to 
raise a 243pound hog ready for slaughter while a newborn chinese 
pig can take from eight to 18 months to reach a comparable

if panamas political crisis were 
resolved tomorrow it would take at least two years and a vigorous 
recovery program for the devastated economy to return to the levels 
of early 1987 according to five of the countrys top economists 
in the absence of a prompt solution to the crisis which stems 
from us and local efforts to topple strongman gen manuel 
noriega panama could be headed for collapse of its productive 
apparatus hunger and totalitariansim the five said wednesday 
economist ruben carles provided the associated press with a copy 
of the report entitled a proposal for economic reconstruction 
carles is a director of a local bank and adviser to several major 
multinational and panamanian enterprises 
the other authors bankers consultants and academics are 
carlos valencia marco fernandez guillermo chapman and jose galan 
ponce 
they are all in varying degrees opponents of the 
militarydominated government 
but the government also recognizes the dire economic 
consequences of the crisis treasury minister orvin goodin said 
tuesday the gross national product would decrease by up to 20 
percent this year 
the reagan administration has for the past 2 months imposed 
increasingly severe economic sanctions on panama washington hoped 
the measures would force noriega to resign and leave the country 
but he has resisted the pressure and appears firmly entrenched 
the general who is commander of the panamanian defense forces 
is the countrys de facto ruler 
in february he was indicted in federal courts in florida on 
drug smuggling and money laundering charges he denies the 
accusations contending they are part of an attempt to replace him 
with a leader amenable to a strong us presence in panama into the 
next century 
the 1977 panama canal treaties oblige washington to hand over 
complete control of the waterway and us military bases along it 
by dec 31 1999 
the authors of the report say the crisis and resulting sanctions 
have produced a more than 50 percent decrease in the amount of 
money circulating in panama 
that allows for maintenance of likewise less than half the 
production and transactions normally carried out in the country 
says the report 
banks which had been closed for nine weeks reopened monday 
but with severe restrictions 
economic activity is principally dedicated to liquidation of 
stocks given that imports are almost nil and it is extremely 
difficult if not impossible to finance production the report 
says 
the authors say that in recent months unemployment has risen 
from about 12 percent of the workforce to approximately 20 percent 
they say that even with a political solution in the coming weeks 
or months more than 40000 more people stand to lose their jobs 
because of the shrinking economy that would raise unemployment to 
26 percent of the workforce 
panama uses the us dollar as its currency 
the reports authors said one option open to the panamanian 
regime would be intervention or nationalization of the banking 
system and the emission of a local currency with attendant 
extremely grave economic consequences that would imply a transition 
toward totalitarianism 
they propose a series of steps contingent on solution of the 
political crisis which would include abandonment of power by 
noriega 
the report says extensive international relief will be needed to 
alleviate hunger among the poor who have been battered by the 
crisis it says international financial support totaling hundreds 
of millions of dollars will be necessary 
the us treasury would have to provide ample credit to 
panamanian banks and the foreign debt of 39 billion would have to 
be renegotiated according to the recovery plan 
our plan takes as a starting point the recognition that it 
will take a period of no less than 24 months to return to the 
levels of production and employment of the first semester of 
1987 the report says

day by day it becomes clearer that one of the 
big losers in the stock market is the market itself 
business is off and layoffs are rising the public is 
disaffected with the way the market operates especially its 
volatility and seemingly senseless changes of direction 
the publicity is negative various study groups complain in 
effect that the market has become an assembly of institutional 
sharpies who skim profits by means of technicalities and 
sophisticated computer programs 
the most devastating criticism comes from within the system 
itself 
some of the biggest brokers have agreed to shut down their 
inhouse program trading operations which seek almost automatic 
profits on technicalities because angry customers feel such 
operations work against their interests 
the head of a prominent smallinvestor brokerage house charles 
schwab has referred to program traders as manipulators and 
schwabs own operation has been criticized because investors 
couldnt reach brokers on oct 19 
george ball chairman of prudentialbache securities inc said 
a poll by his company showed individual investors who generally 
invest on the basis of a companys management and earnings feel 
cheated by market manipulators 
donald regan bluntspeaking former treasury secretary told the 
senate banking committee this week that the public has a right to 
believe the marketplace is rigged it is he snapped 
regans criticism is especially damaging because in his 
prewhite house years he was one of the most promiment of all wall 
streeters head of merrill lynch and a leader in bringing 
individual investors into the markeplace 
anger is also being directed at the securities and exchange 
commission and at the commodities futures trading commission whose 
jobs are to protect the public from shenanigans that inevitably 
arise and must be squashed 
the worst of these practices appears to be that of capitalizing 
on gaps in prices of stock traded on the new york stock exchange 
and stock index futures traded in chicago the players often are 
brokerage houses themselves 
when these gaps appear gaps that have nothing at all to do 
with basic values they can produce wild price swings as money 
jumps from one to the other in an attempt to skim off profits 
small investors cannot take such advantage they have too little 
capital they have too little time they have too little 
sophistication gaps are discovered by those with immediate access 
to data and instant communications 
these automatic trading practices mindlessly initiated by 
electronic programs that spot opportunities are believed to have 
triggered accelerated and reinforced the crash of last oct 19 
oddly little comment and criticism has been heard from the 
companies whose stocks are affected but that criticism is sure to 
come 
companies such as general motors for example know that gm 
investors are inclined to buy gm products and they seek to exploit 
that relationship with reminders in their quarterly reports to 
shareholders 
if these shareholders arent protected from marketplace 
shenanigans it is fair to expect that they will lose their 
enthusiasm for investing hurting the value of the corporations 
stock and quite likely its sales as well 
so pervasive are the negative comments about program trading 
that it has for the time being overwhelmed concern about the 
legal problems that had begun to unfold before the oct 19 crash 
and are about to make headlines again 
investigations already have led to jail sentences for several 
traders including ivan f boesky but those investigations 
continue they are expected to bring in other promiment parties 
perhaps on criminal charges 
criminality according to government investigators is rampant 
rather than existing on the periphery of the marketplace 
in a presentencing memo in the boesky case government 
officials said they found criminal conduct is at the heart of a 
substantial amount of market activity by established securities 
industry professionals 
in short the marketplace has an odor that drives away customers

retail sales depressed by bad weather and an 
early easter fell 06 percent in april the first decline in six 
months the government said today 
the commerce department said that sales totaled a seasonally 
adjusted 1316 billion last month as sales fell 815 million from 
march 
the 06 percent drop was the first decline since a 08 percent 
setback last october the march performance was revised upward 
however to show an increase of 17 percent the biggest advance 
since august and much stronger than the originally reported 08 
percent gain 
the swings in both months came from the fact that easter came 
early this year meaning that consumers did their spring shopping 
in march and siphoning off sales from april 
in addition unseasonably cool weather in the northeast and west 
dampened sales for spring apparel as well as for lawn and garden 
items 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater commenting on the 
report said fortunately the weakness in april may serve to 
dampen inflationary expectations 
given all the unusual influences analysts said the weak april 
sales report did not alter their general assessment that the 
economy has been performing well so far this year 
total economic activity as measured by the gross national 
product rose at an annual rate of 23 percent in the first three 
months of the year far better than the recession fears immediately 
following the stock market crash last october would have indicated 
the surprisingly strong growth has caused interest rates to rise 
in recent weeks as investors have begun worrying about inflationary 
pressures major banks boosted their prime lending rate on 
wednesday to 9 percent the first increase since last october 
the retail sales report showed widespread weakness in a number 
of areas 
car sales fell for the first time since november declining by 1 
percent to a seasonally adjusted 297 billion strong car sales 
propelled by sales incentive programs have provided much of the 
overall strength in consumer spending so far this year 
without the weakness in car sales total retail sales would have 
been a slightly lower 05 percent in april 
sales of all durable goods items expected to last at least 
three years dropped 06 percent sales of nondurable goods fell 
an identical 06 percent 
in the durable goods category sales at hardware and building 
supply stores were up 1 percent while sales at furniture stores 
fell by 02 percent 
in the nondurable goods cateogry sales at department stores 
dropped 05 percent erasing part of the 21 percent jump in march 
both months were influenced by the early easter 
sales at grocery stores fell 03 percent in april while sales at 
gasoline stations were off 13 percent and sales at restaurants 
dropped 16 percent

chrysler corp workers ratified a twoyear united 
auto workers contract by a 54 percent majority a slim margin uaw 
vice president marc stepp blamed on employee anger at the company 
i thought it would be a little higher but i understand the 
concerns of the workers stepp said wednesday night he said 
previous contracts have been ratified with majorities as small as 
51 percent 
the contract approved wednesday covers 66000 hourly and 
salaried workers in 15 states and mirrors jobprotecting pacts 
signed last fall at ford motor co and general motors corp no 
chrysler signing date had been set 
the big three contracts prevent layoffs except when production 
is cut because of slow sales forbid plant closings not announced 
before the talks began and make it harder for companies to transfer 
work to outside companies or foreign countries 
the chrysler contract also provides 3 percent lumpsum bonuses 
in 1989 and 1990 a 1000 signing bonus and for the first time 
profitsharing according to the formula that has generated 
thousands of dollars for ford workers 
chrysler union workers base wage is now 1443 an hour the 
contract does not provide for a raise in base pay but does provide 
for cost of living adjustments 
but unlike the ford and gm contracts the chrysler pact prevents 
executives from receiving bonuses in years when the profitsharing 
formula generates no payout for workers 
the contract replaces a threeyear agreement that would have 
have expired sept 14 
stepp said chrysler workers are more militant than workers at gm 
and ford and theyre angry with chrysler chairman lee iacocca 
and his high salary theyre really angry with chryslers attempt 
to transfer the kcar to mexico 
iacocca earned 179 million in 1987 most of it by exercising 
previously granted stock options the figure came out the day after 
the april 18 opening of early negotiations 
two days later chrysler confirmed it planned to halt us 
production of its venerable frontwheeldrive kcar and supply us 
buyers from a plant in toluca mexico 
both issues nearly derailed negotiations until iacocca announced 
chrysler would keep kcar production in detroit through the end of 
the year 
stepp said workers probably were disappointed with the 1000 
signing bonus because they received 2120 for signing a threeyear 
contract in 1985 
the contract was rejected at several large locals including the 
detroit kcar plant union officials said 
but at chryslers 3500worker warren truck plant it was 
approved by 65 percent of those voting said local 140 president 
gil wojcik 
two former american motors corp locals in wisconsin also 
approved separate pacts wednesday reached during the national 
contract talks chrysler bought amc in august the pacts include 
special payments to workers at former amc plants in milwaukee and 
kenosha that chrysler says it will close 
the chrysler contract also protects 2200 workers at four 
closing acustar inc plants from layoff acustar is chryslers 
parts subsidiary when the plants close workers will be paid their 
regular wages and placed in a job bank for future hire by chrysler

in dollars that worked out to 473 million as opposed to 705 
million in the 1987 first quarter the company said 
british companies accounting method cannot be directly compared

quarter of 1987

year ago bp said

estimates of the nations economically 
recoverable but sofarundiscovered offshore oil could be 27 
percent lower than previous estimates according to preliminary 
figures released today by the interior department 
the department released new estimates for offshore oil and gas 
supplies and backup material for onshore estimates released in 
march 
by coincidence the new material was released shortly after the 
energy department said it believed the nation had a 35year supply 
of natural gas at prices under 3 per thousand cubic feet and a 5 
price would bring forth only another 10 years supply 
estimates of undiscovered onshore oil released by the geological 
survey in march were down about 40 percent from previous figures 
in part because of drilling disappointments but also because lower 
prices keep explorers from even considering highcost pools 
todays numbers were broken down by area and department 
officials refused to supply totals citing their desire to avoid 
giving any impression the figures were unchangeable 
but simple addition showed that the mean estimate that 
estimate which there is a 50 percent chance of exceeding was 887 
billion barrels of oil down 27 percent and 74 trillion cubic feet 
of natural gas down 18 percent expressed in terms of equivalent 
energy content the new estimates would be 22 percent below the old 
ones 
the same estimates in 1984 were 122 billion barrels of oil and 
905 trillion cubic feet of gas 
the decline according to an interior department analyst who 
spoke on condition he not be identified can be attributed to 
drilling disappointments notably in alaska and lower prices 
the new estimates assume oil costs 18 a barrel about the 
current price the old estimates assumed oil costs of about 30 a 
barrel 
energy secretary john herrington said in announcing the new 
reserve estimates that natural gas has not taken its rightful 
place in the nations energy supplies and the department was 
trying to allay public fears of short supplies left over from 
pipeline curtailments in the severe northeastern winters of 197677 
and 197778 
if price were no object current technology could recover about 
1029 trillion cubic feet of natural gas the energy department 
study said at 3 per thousand cubic feet or less 583 trillion 
cubic feet could be produced an increase in price to 5 would 
bring only an additional 174 trillion cubic feet 
the nation uses about 17 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per 
year the average wellhead price last year was 183 which the 
departments semiindependent energy information administration 
predicts will reach 402 in the year 2000

investor marvin davis renewed his bid 
for ailing television producer lorimar telepictures inc thursday 
just two days after lorimar agreed to become part of warner 
communications inc 
davis who previously offered 17 per share for the maker of 
such hit tv series as dallas and knots landing notified 
the company he would pay 15 cash per share or 6795 million 
lorimar values the tentative agreement it made with warner 
tuesday at 118 billion that agreement includes assumption of 
550 million in lorimar debt and financial penalties if lorimar 
backs out and merges with a third party 
pending review of confidential financial information davis said 
in a letter released by lorimar we are prepared to consider 
increasing our price in a negotiated transaction 
a spokesman for davis an oil man and investor who formerly 
owned twentieth century fox film corp declined to comment 
lorimar officials declined immediate comment on the impact 
davis offer might have on the warner transaction that match was 
seen as a way to solve lorimars cash problems and make warner a 
leader in television production as well as its present strength in 
movies and music 
the deal was conditional but lorimar chairman merv adelson made 
it clear at the time he saw the taxfree stockswap deal with 
warner as the ideal marriage 
davis 15pershare figure for lorimar matches the minimum 
value placed on the stock swap that forms the basis of the warner 
deal 
that merger tentatively scheduled to close in september would 
trade 415 shares of warner stock for each of the 453 million

a team of evaluators will examine wheat 
fields in seven states next week to check on the condition of the 
crop as it approaches harvest 
the wheat is starting to head out said jim quinton a grain 
analyst for the agrivisor marketing service in bloomington it is 
in a very critical stage the reproductive stage 
quinton has organized the wheat evaluation tour which will 
focus on the nations key soft red winter wheat states of missouri 
illinois ohio indiana michigan kentucky and arkansas 
the us department of agriculture this week issued its first 
estimates of the season for wheat production across the country 
based on may 1 conditions it said the harvest is expected to be up 
4 percent for all winter varieties 
we do feel it would be worthwhile to go out and get a 
midcourse correction quinton said wednesday 
he said soft red wheat production is projected to be 426 million 
bushels from this summers harvest up from 348 million bushels in 
1987 
this very likely is not so much a yield increase as an acreage 
increase said quinton noting farmers planted 17 million more 
acres last fall than the previous year 
the states in which evaluators will examine fields have nearly 7 
million acres of soft red winter wheat out of a total of about 105 
million in the united states quinton said 
evaluators will begin the tour monday covering several routes 
and stopping about every 15 to 20 miles to check fields the team 
will include people from the grain trade the milling industry the 
government producer groups and the news media 
in each field participants will check the soil moisture 
condition the stage of development of the wheat the size of the 
stand and the potential number and size of grain heads they also 
will look for any evidence of disease 
quinton said most of the soft red winter wheat seems to be in 
good condition most was planted in a timely fashion last fall and 
cool dry spring conditions have favored the development of much of 
the crop 
soft red wheat is milled to make fine flours that are used in 
things like cake cookies and crackers it is the hard wheat grown 
farther west that is used for breads

inflation paranoia has gripped the financial 
markets which only a few months back were preoccupied with the 
threat of a recession but some economists say the specter of 
rising prices is highly exaggerated 
these economists argue that unlike the 1970s when price spirals 
became ingrained the economy of the 1980s has been reshaped by 
fundamental changes that have restrained costs and wages two key 
components of inflation 
moreover their reasoning goes the highly competitive global 
economy and higher us productivity provide compelling evidence 
that acute inflation will not revisit the united states in the 
forseeable future 
theres a very slow learning process in the markets said 
john hekman senior economist at the claremont economics institute 
a forecasting firm in claremont calif that rejects the prevalent 
thinking about inflation fear weve had inflation scares every 
year 
unfounded or not this anxiety has helped wrench down stock and 
bond prices and raise longterm treasury yields to the highest 
levels of 1988 the federal reserve has been maneuvering to tighten 
credit as a preemptive step to thwart inflation and on wednesday 
banks responded by raising their prime lending rates 
to some degree economists say inflation anxiety results from 
the stock market crash seven months ago after the collapse the fed 
used a mix of confidencebuilding public statements and big 
injections of money into the banking system to quell fears that a 
recession loomed 
since then the economy has shown surprising strength but the 
uncertainty raised by the crash has lingered many investors now 
say they fear a rapidly expanding economy because it would mean 
higher wages more demand for credit and too much money chasing too 
few goods that translates into inflation 
the economists who dispute that view argue that wages have not 
risen despite the lowest unemployment in 14 years on the 
contrary wages have fallen in some areas relative to inflation 
which last year totaled 44 percent and for the first three months 
of this year ran at an annual rate of 42 percent 
labor costs have remained meek and mild said richard 
belous a labor economist at the conference board a 
businessfinanced economic research group in new york if 
inflationary costs start getting imbedded in labor costs then the 
ballgames over but i dont think its happening 
the primary reason for this belous and others say is that the 
labor market is radically different now many companies have 
restructured into smaller leaner operations with nonunion 
workers moreover many americans are employed in temporary and 
parttime jobs that offer relatively low wages little job security 
and often no benefits 
management is now playing hardball with labor belous said 
it cant just pass costs on to the consumer markets are 
deregulated theres more competition were part of a global 
economy 
richard rahn economist at the us chamber of commerce in 
washington argues that inflation worriers are using outdated 
economic formulas for assuming that lower unemployment translates 
into rising prices 
on the contrary he said higher employment means higher 
production which equals lower prices 
this is logical when you think about it if you produce more 
of something each unit tends to cost less rapidly growing 
economies tend to have declining cost curves rahn said just 
because the unemployment rate is coming down doesnt translate into 
inflation so im arguing the analysis is dead wrong 
asked why inflation paranoia has afflicted the markets rahn 
said i think the experience of the late 1970s was very searing 
clearly we dont want to repeat that 
some economists argue that sharply higher factory utilization 
rates portend inflation because they imply supply will not keep up 
with demand thereby pressuring prices up but others say that is 
also outdated thinking 
the idea that a lot of industries are close to capacity is 
just a measure of their improved efficiency said hekman these 
people are not about to let inflation get away from them

finance and economics ministers from 
the european economic community meet friday and saturday to discuss 
an idea which some key observers say may be an impossible dream 
creation of a single eec currency 
i doubt that the governments are prepared to make such a 
farreaching decision karl otto poehl president of west 
germanys central bundesbank told reporters last week 
the communitys finance and economics ministers as well as 
central bank presidents from the 12 eec nations are to hold a 
closeddoor session in the baltic seas coastal resort town of 
travemuende near luebeck 
several key west european leaders including west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher have proposed creating a common 
eec currency as well as a central eec bank to manage it 
in february genscher urged the eec to appoint a team of experts 
to come up with a definite plan 
the proposals for a common currency are expected to be a major 
topic of discussion at the travemuende meeting according to 
finance ministry officials here 
other possible means of strengthening the eecs exchangerate 
system the european monetary system are also expected to be 
topics at the meeting 
genscher french finance minister edouard balladur and others 
say a common eec currency would strengthen west european unity and 
help smooth the way for the creation of a barrierfree internal 
market throughout western europe by 1992 
but skeptics of the plan including poehl say they dont think 
eec governments are ready to take steps that could lead to denting 
their currency autonomy 
poehl and others have pointed out that many eec nations 
including britain are not even full members of the european 
monetary system 
at a time that most of the eec countries are not even able to 
fulfill their obligations to this very limited system its a 
little premature to talk about something new poehl said 
only west germany france the netherlands denmark and ireland 
are full members of the monetary system which works to stabilize 
currency exchange rates within the eec 
poehl has also repeatedly warned that any steps towards creating 
a central european bank could infringe upon the constitutional 
independence of the bundesbank

irving bank corp said thursday it set up a 
committee of three independent directors to hold talks with its two 
suitors bank of new york co and banca commerciale italiana spa 
however bank of new york maintained it had no intention of 
sweetening its hostile 108 billion bid and was not holding any 
negotiations with irving 
we have always said any time irving will come to the table 
with substantive negotiations we would listen but were not 
prepared to talk to them in an auction environment said bank of 
new york spokesman owen brady 
irving disclosed the special committee in a filing with the 
securities and exchange commission on thursday the company said 
that while the directors were authorized to meet directly with the 
bank of new york and banca commerciale there can be no 
assurances that these discussions will result in any improvement in 
either 
irvings announcement came nearly a week after its annual 
meeting in which shareholders voted between a slate of 16 
incumbent directors that back a restructuring and friendly merger 
with banca commerciale and nominees from rival bank of new york 
the voting results are not expected to be released until a 
reconvened meeting may 24 although both sides are claiming victory 
banking analysts generally have given bank of new york an edge 
in the proxy battle mostly because it already has secured the 
necessary regulatory approvals banca commerciale italys second 
largest bank which is controlled by the government agency instituto 
per la recostruzione industriale has just begun the lengthy 
regulatory review process 
bank of new york which owns a nearly 5 percent stake in irving 
is offering 15 in cash and 1575 shares of its stock for each of 
irvings common shares the offer which is scheduled to expire may 
13 is valued at about 63 a share or 108 billion 
banca commerciale is offering 75 a share for 95 million irving 
shares or about 51 percent valued at 707 million in addition 
it said it would pay shareholders interest on the purchase price 
from may 31 until the deal closes

british aerospace plc acted thursday to protect 
itself from the pounds recent surge by contracting some of its 
airbus jetliner work to textron inc of the united states 
the 700 million agreement calls for textron to manufacture wing 
parts at its factory in nashville tenn 
british aerospace said the contract was denominated in dollars 
which would reduce its risks from further rises in the pound making 
its airbus work too costly most orders for civilian aircraft 
around the world are denominated in dollars and the leading 
aircraft builder boeing co is based in the united states 
textrons work on wing parts for 600 airbus industrie a330 and 
a340 airliners accounts for about 15 percent of the total airbus 
work for which british aerospace is responsible the company said 
british aerospace is a partner in the fournation airbus 
industrie consortium which also includes aircraft manufacturers 
from france west germany and spain 
textron will work as a risk sharing subcontractor to british 
aerospace receiving the total amount specified in the contract 
only if the full 600 aircraft are ordered from airbus and textron 
will meet all the startup costs itself for the manufacture of the 
wing parts british aerospace said 
it means that textron has to believe in the product as much as 
we do said british aerospace spokesman howard berry 
airbus industrie currently has commitments from customers to buy 
145 of the new aircraft with the a340 scheduled to enter service 
in may 1992 and the a330 in september 1992 
british aerospace said it was negotiating several other 
dollardenominated contracts to further reduce its currency 
exposure 
british aerospace announced in march that it had a pretax loss 
of 159 million pounds last year after making a 320 million pound 
provision for expected future losses on civilian aircraft 
production a pound is now worth about 184

retail sales fell 06 percent in april the 
first setback in six months with the decline blamed on an early 
easter bad weather and a bigger federal tax bite for some people 
the commerce department said consumers spent a seasonally 
adjusted 1316 billion at retail stores last month a drop of 815 
million from the revised march figure 
sales had not fallen since a 08 percent setback last october 
but economists said they were not particularly concerned by the 
weakness especially since sales in march were revised upward to 
show an increase of 17 percent that was the fastest sales advance 
since last august and almost twice the originally estiated 08 
percent gain for the month 
both the big jump in march sales and the april decline were 
blamed on the fact that easter occurred on april 3 this year 
meaning that consumers did their spring shopping in march 
siphoning off sales that would normally have occurred last month 
the april retail sales figure is very misleading because of 
easter consumer spending is still holding up well said allen 
sinai chief economist of the boston co 
analysts said other factors that played a role in the april 
decline were unseasonably cold weather in some parts of the country 
that discouraged sales of such items as garden equipment and higher 
tax bills some americans faced at filing time this year 
they noted in particular that sales at restaurants were down 16 
percent while sales at furniture stores were off 02 percent 
some people did get shocked by the new tax law they may have 
filled out their tax forms and decided they couldnt afford to eat 
out for the rest of the month said david wyss an economist with 
data resources inc 
tom megan an economist with evans economics a washington 
forecasting firm said he was not concerned by the april sales dip 
because with unemployment now at a 14year low of 54 percent 
consumers are confident about the future 
with employment and incomes still growing we expect consumers 
will keep spending he said 
total economic activity as measured by the gross national 
product rose at an annual rate of 23 percent in the first three 
months of the year far better than the recession some people were 
predicting immediately after the october stock market collapse 
however the surprisingly strong growth has raised inflation 
concerns many economists believe the federal reserve board has 
moved in recent days to tighten up on interest rates as a way to 
dampen demand and keep inflation under control 
major banks on wednesday boosted their prime lending rate 
onehalf percentage point to 9 percent reflecting the tighter 
credit conditions 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the weak 
report on retail sales may serve to dampen inflationary 
expectations 
the april retail sales report showed that car sales declined 1 
percent during the month the first drop since last november 
analysts said this reflected the phaseout of various sales 
incentive programs that had lured consumers into showrooms in 
earlier months 
without the weakness in car sales total retail sales would have 
been a slightly lower 05 percent in april 
sales at hardware and building supply stores were up 1 percent 
analysts attributing some of this strength to a boom in home 
remodeling as more homeowners choose to renovate rather than move 
to bigger houses 
sales of nondurable goods dropped 06 percent overall within 
the category sales at department stores dropped 05 percent 
erasing part of the 21 percent jump in march both months were 
influenced by the early easter 
sales at grocery stores fell 03 percent in april while sales 
at gasoline stations were off 13 percent and sales at restaurants 
dropped 16 percent 
sales of all durable goods items expected to last at least 
three years dropped 06 percent

the senate finance committee has tentatively 
agreed to authorize the president to negotiate a higher north 
american content for automobiles coming under the proposed 
uscanada freetrade agreement the staff of sen donald riegle 
dmich said thursday 
the proposed treaty requires that us or canadian parts 
components and labor account for half the content of cars moving 
dutyfree across the border critics of the treaty riegle among 
them have said that level is too low 
riegles proposal would authorize the president to negotiate a 
higher domesticcontent rule with canada in the hope of raising it 
to 60 percent 
if negotiations succeed the president would be able to begin 
the higher requirement through a proclamation rather than 
returning to congress for consent riegles staff said 
under the terms of the freetrade negotiations both houses of 
congress must accept or reject the treaty as is without amendment 
however congress has the power to tie its acceptance of the 
treaty to the fulfillment of certain conditions or to pass other 
legislation authorizing the president to try to renegotiate parts 
of the agreement 
my goal has been to improve the implementing language so that 
the agreement is better riegle said we are making some 
significant progress 
the finance committee has not completed its work on the bill 
the 50 percent north american content requirement has been 
criticized by the united auto workers and parts suppliers a level 
that low would allow manufacturers to import engines transmissions 
and other major components 
another heavily criticized provision would allow canada to 
retain until 1996 agreements giving preferential duty treatment to 
manufacturers outside north america who have canadian production 
extending the preferential treatment will allow canadian 
suppliers and japanese manufacturers to forge agreements that will 
shut out us suppliers from part of the market critics have said

major us banks are undercapitalized and 
underregulated and have failed to write down approximately 28 
billion in uncollectable foreign loans the general accounting 
office said in a report released thursday 
the gao an investigative arm of congress found fault with 
federal regulators such as the office of the comptroller of the 
currency the federal reserve board and the federal deposit 
insurance corp for creating a lenient classification system for 
developing country debt 
using todays secondary market as a guidepost the gao 
calculated that the average third world loan is worth 54 percent of 
its stated value under this criteria the report estimated that 
american banks have reserved 211 billion of foreign loans when a 
more realistic figure should be 49 billion 
in contrast the criteria regulators developed only required 
23 billion in us bank writedowns of uncollectable loans the 
gao said 
rep jim leach riowa who asked for the report said in 
this audit of the auditors it can be inferred that the record 
firstquarter profits recently announced for banks engaged in 
overseas lending are a shibboleth and that these institutions 
should write off this year loans of a greater magnitude than they 
did last year 
bank earnings are only as sound as their loan portfolios and 
those portfolios the gao finds are overvalued leach said 
us bank loans to developing countries decreased from 1397 
billion in june 1982 to 1076 billion in december 1987 while us 
bank capital increased from 662 billion in june 1982 to 1292 
billion in december 1987 
as a result from june 1982 to december 1987 bank loans owed by 
developing countries decreased from 211 percent of bank capital to 
83 percent during this time developing country loans owed to the 
nine largest money center banks decreased from 323 percent of these 
banks capital to 139 percent 
while these figures reflect a prudential improvement in 
circumstances for american banks developing country loans are 
still large compared with bank capital and are disproportionately 
concentrated in a small number of money center institutions said 
leach a ranking republican on the house banking finance and urban 
affairs committee and its international finance trade and monetary 
policy subcommittee

bullion at 45090 a troy ounce up from 44880 late wednesday 
it was another dull day in the currency market said graham 
broyd vice president of foreign exchange at manufacturers hanover 
corp in new york 
traders said the boost the dollar got wednesday from rising 
interest rates in the united states was partly eroded by an 
assumption that other nations also would raise their rates 
negating the us impact higher interest rates make a currency 
more attractive to foreign investors 
others said remarks by federal reserve board governor wayne 
angell who vaguely indicated the central bank may not necessarily 
tighten credit further had little impact on the dollar 
but some money market economists said they saw longterm 
weakness in the dollar because of the continually high trade and 
budget deficits and the feds apparent reluctance to nudge interest 
rates up too much 
from an interest rate point of view the foreign exchange 
market assumes the fed is constraied on how high interest rates can 
go said michael broder an economist at money market services a 
chicago forecasting firm you have the mere mention of higher 
interest rates and the bond and stock markets go into the tank 
pretty quick

a fiveday rally that pushed soybean futures prices to fouryear 
highs ended thursday as rainy weather forecasts persuaded traders 
to take profits 
grain futures also closed lower on the chicago board of trade 
on other markets pork futures continued to climb cattle 
futures were mostly higher precious metals posted slight gains 
energy futures slipped a bit and stockindex futures edged higher 
soybean futures prices had climbed more than 32 cents a bushel 
a gain of nearly 5 percent in the past week and set new contract 
highs on monday tuesday and wednesday but the rally stalled 
thursday as rain dampened parts of the corn belt improving the 
growing conditions for newly planted crops 
weather forecasters predicted precipitation all the way into 
next week prompting traders to offset their long positions and 
take profits analysts said 
after three straight days of new contract highs in the beans 
and meal any market needs a pause to catch its breath said 
victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter reynolds inc 
it was an orderly correction he said it wasnt anything 
unusual or out of the ordinary 
buying interest dried up in the soybean meal market on a lack of 
orders for europe where most businesses were closed for a fourday 
holiday said david bartholomew an assistant vice president at 
merrill lynch futures inc in chicago 
they were providing big support yesterday he said of the 
europeans essentially what we had wednesday was a condensing of 
three days of potential activity into one day 
analyst jerry gidel of gh miller amp co in chicago also noted 
fairly heavy notices of intent to deliver corn and soybeans against 
the may contracts an indication of adequate nearterm supplies 
wheat settled 1 cents to 4 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in may at 301 a bushel corn was 1 cent to 1 cents 
lower with may at 196 a bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents 
lower with may at 155 a bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 8 cents 
lower with may at 707 a bushel

day on the chicago mercantile exchange 
the cash market is phenomenal said tom ohare an analyst 
in new york with smith barney harris upham amp co the daily 
average price in omaha two weeks ago was 4093 cents a pound 
yesterday it was 4623 cents thats such a huge increase in a 
couple of weeks that youve got everyone convinced that its going 
to keep going 
a reduction in the number of hogs coming to market supported 
notions that the market has entered its seasonal downturn in 
supplies he said 
most cattle futures also advanced on strong cash markets and 
indications of strong retail demand for beef ohare said 
live cattle settled 20 cent lower to 13 cent higher with june 
at 7355 cents a pound feeder cattle were 40 cent to 88 cent 
higher with may at 8040 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent lower to

bellies were 92 cent to 165 cents higher with may at 5460 cents 
a pound 
gold and silver futures prices rose in reaction to the 
governments upward revision of its march retail sales figure 
analysts said 
the commerce department revised the march figure to show a 17 
percent increase the biggest advance since august and a much 
stronger gain than the originally reported 08 percent 
that showed the economy continues to do well which in turn 
suggests an increase in inflation said peter cardillo an analyst 
with josephthal amp co in new york

ounce silver was 19 cents to 28 cents higher with may at 6574

chrysler corp skilled trades workers have 
rejected a united auto workers contract ratified by other union 
members uaw officials said thursday 
the rejection does not change the overall ratification but 
could lead to new negotiations solely on skilled trades issues such 
as apprenticeships according to union officials 
the union scheduled a meeting friday in chicago to review the 
matter with its chrysler skilled trades officials who represent 
more than 10500 of the no 3 automakers uaw members 
the twoyear contract covering 66000 hourly and salaried 
workers in 15 states was ratified wednesday by 54 percent of those 
voting skilled trades such as machine tool makers and salaried 
workers have additional separate contracts covering issues unique 
to them 
the two groups vote as one on whether to ratify or reject both 
contracts which were approved by the salaried workers uaw 
spokesman frank joyce said he had no figures on the skilled trades 
rejection or the salaried approval of the contract 
there is at least one skilled trades delegate for each of 
chryslers nearly 50 uaw local unions 
if the skilled trades rejection was based on issues contained in 
the main contract such as economics neither new negotiations nor 
a new skilled trades vote would occur union sources said 
part of the purpose of fridays meeting is to determine whether 
or not the rejection was based on issues unique to the skilled 
trades 
union officials who asked not to be identified said they 
believed the rejection was economic if so the meeting will be the 
only action on the rejection and skilled trades workers will have 
to live with the contract ratified by everybody else 
the meeting was called by uaw president owen bieber and vice 
president marc stepp and will include those delegates on the uaws 
140member national chrysler council who represent skilled trades 
workers

navistar international corp sold off its 
moneylosing wisconsin steel subsidiary to avoid paying 
multimillion dollar pension benefits to workers the governments 
pension insurance agency contended thursday as trial began in its 
suit against navistar 
the pension benefit guaranty corp asked a federal judge to 
award it 140 million from navistar to cover the unpaid benefits 
plus interest 
the longawaited trial is considered an important test case to 
determine whether and to what extent a company can be forced to 
honor pensionplan obligations to workers 
navistar faces two lawsuits resulting from the illfated 1977 
sale of wisconsin steel to envirodyne inc a los angelesbased 
engineering company with no previous steelmaking experience 
the south side chicago steel mill went bankrupt eight years ago 
putting 3500 employees out of work and leaving the pbgc with the 
tab for unpaid benefits 
in an interview before presenting opening trial arguments 
thursday navistar attorney donald g kempf said the company 
welcomed its day in court 
navistar has wanted for a long time to vindicate itself in 
this case and with this trial it will do so kempf said 
in his twohour opening statement before us district judge 
james moran pbgc attorney william o bittman said company 
officials ignored recommendations from investment bankers that the 
sale was financially questionable because envirodyne lacked the 
experience and funds to turn the steel company around 
other steel companies showed no interest in buying wisconsin 
steel bittman said 
he said company officials were aware at the time the deal might 
lead to lawsuits if the steel company went bankrupt but went ahead 
with the sale to envirodyne in order to avoid 167 million in 
losses it faced by liquidating wisconsin steel 
i think navistar sold wisconsin steel to a buyer that they 
knew did not have the experience or the financial wherewithal to 
run the steel division in an economic way bittman said in an 
interview thursday 
the reason they did it was because the other alternative of 
liquidating the company would cost them too much money even though 
they recognized that bankruptcy would be inevitable bittman said 
navistar denies duping envirodyne into buying the steel company 
as part of a conspiracy to rid itself of the pension liabilities 
it maintains wisconsin steel went bankrupt due to a delay in 
promised governmentbacked financing for modernization a strike 
against navistar and deterioration in market and economic 
conditions 
also thursday the judge in the nonjury trial heard opening 
arguments from attorneys for wisconsin steel creditors including 
an envirodyne unit the edc holding co who have filed a separate 
second lawsuit seeking triple damages of nearly 475 million from 
navistar the lawsuit alleges fraud and racketeering in the 1977 
sale of the steel company 
navistar known as international harvester co in 1977 lent 
envirodyne 50 million to finance the 65 million acquisition of 
wisconsin steel 
navistar has already reached a 148 million outofcourt 
settlement with 2700 former employees of the steel company 
the government and workers filed lawsuits against navistar in 
1981 edc sued navistar in 1982 
navistar attorney kempf denied bittmans argument that the 
wisconsin steel transaction lacked a reasonable chance of success 
he said the reason it did not succeed was because of 
unforeseen factors that happened three years after the sale 
the case adjourned late thursday until monday

continental airlines has entered into an 
agreement with kansas officials under which the airline will credit 
millions of miles to members of its airlines frequent flier club 
attorney general robert t stephan said thursday 
stephan said that as recently as may 3 continental advertised 
minimum credits of at least 1000 miles per flight segment while it 
had been making minimum entries of only 750 miles since jan 1 
members of frequent flier clubs accumulate mileage credits that 
can be used for free or reduced fare airplane tickets 
besides the mileage credit discrepancy continental advertised 
that members of its onepass club could receive frequent flier 
award travel to tokyo but the airline did not make such trips 
available stephan charged 
stephan said the brochures and inflight magazine advertisements 
were deceptive he said the company attempted to save millions of 
dollars worth of award travel tickets nationwide 
in the agreement it signed with stephans office continental 
denied it violated kansas consumer protection laws although it 
agreed to pay 20000 in costs and investigation fees 
the houstonbased airline said that when it announced its triple 
mileage program in a jan 21 letter to onepass members it clearly 
stated the mileage minimum being tripled was 750 miles the company 
also said a march 1988 brochure used the 750mile figure 
continental said in the agreement it depicted tokyo as a 
frequent flier award destination because members wishing to go 
there could earn credits to make that trip by flying on sister 
airline air micronesia 
the airline agreed to credit onepass members at the 1000mile 
rate retroactively and keep the 1000mile rate in effect through 
july 
it also agreed to withdraw any remaining advertisements and 
brochures using the 1000mile figure the airline said it would 
add tokyo as an award travel destination through dec 31 
stephan estimated there are more than 2 million active onepass 
members during the first 16 weeks of 1988 continental enrolled an 
average of more than 45000 members a week he said

a substantial number of workers at a 
general electric co defense plant here will be laid off because of 
a drop in orders from the pentagon the company announced thursday 
arthur glenn vice president of ges defense systems division 
refused to say exactly how many workers would be laid off or when 
however ge officials informed the state it would lay off about 
900 workers over the next 18 months because of a decrease in 
defenserelated orders according to a state economic affairs 
official 
the first phase of the layoffs is scheduled for july according 
to the official who asked not to be identified 
the unexpected announcement by the company came only three 
months after ge promised stable employment at its pittsfield 
businesses this year the company had laid off 1000 workers last 
year when it closed its transformer plant 
the ordnance division which employs 4700 people makes 
guidance systems for trident submarinelaunched nuclear missiles 
components of the bradley fighting machine which carries 
infantrymen various highspeed guns and other military products 
the market we serve we thought up to a year ago to be at 
least in a sustaining basis and somewhat of a growth basis glenn 
said at a news conference 
he blamed the sudden turnaround on government cutbacks in 
ordnance contracts 
as pressure gets tough on defense budgets government 
customers have to make difficult decisions glenn said 
he said a government contract the company recently lost to 
northrup industries had little to do with the layoffs 
we had really planned our business based on not winning that 
contract because there was so much controvery over whether the air 
force wished to use our technology glenn said certainly if 
that contract had come i would not have had to take as severe an 
action as were going to have to take without it 
glenn also said a decrease in orders would mean a slowdown in 
bradley fighting machine production from 550 yearly to about 350 
he said he told the companys 500 management employees thursday 
morning about the impending layoffs neither managers nor union 
officials could be immediately reached for comment 
ge now employs about 6700 people in the ordnance and plastics 
plants in the city the number it had employeed in 1983 before the 
company began expanding the ordnance systems division with 1400 
new employees by late 1986 
workers at the company were dealt a major blow in the fall of 
1986 when ge announced it would close its transformer division in 
pittsfield 
ge announced in august 1987 it was reorganizing the ordnance 
division to eliminate the engineering and manufacturing department 
and replace it with a division effectiveness operation to improve 
efficiency 
the steps we are taking are usually taken by businesses in 
trouble and we are not in trouble division vice president 
nicholas boraski said at the time
