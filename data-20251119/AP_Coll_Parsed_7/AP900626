union leader paul hubbert who built 
alabamas school workforce into a political force became the 
democratic nominee for governor tuesday defeating state attorney 
general don siegelman in a runoff 
with 97 percent of the precincts reporting hubbert had 297843 
votes or 53 percent to siegelmans 259471 votes or 47 percent 
hubbert will challenge republican gov guy hunt a farmer 
preacher and ronald reagan loyalist who in 1986 became the states 
first gop governor in 112 years 
i intend to be the kind of new south progressive governor who 
will give the people of alabama the kind of leadership they 
deserve hubbert told cheering supporters tuesday night 
siegelman went to hubberts headquarters to congratulate him 
and hubbert supporters literally rolled out a red carpet for the 
runnerup hubbert and siegelman held clasped hands aloft 
for those misguided souls who think the democrats are not 
together theyve got another think coming in november said 
hubbert 
hunt had depicted both hubbert and siegelman as liberals who 
would have a hard time winning in alabama 
hubbert never ran for statewide public office before but he has 
directed the alabama education association for two decades molding 
it into an influential statehouse lobby for educators bus drivers 
janitors and other school personnel 
hubbert who led a sixcandidate field in the june 5 primary 
with 32 percent of the vote promised to build positive 
progressive programs that will raise alabama into the new south 
siegelman the runnerup received 25 percent to force the 
runoff as he presented himself as a youthful force free of 
financial ties to any interest group 
the threeweek runoff campaign turned sharply negative 
siegelman attacked hubbert as a special interest backroom 
operator who helped teachers at the expense of schoolchildren 
hubbert stressed his record as a coalitionbuilder and accused 
siegelman of running a racist radio commercial 
siegelman said the ad was about the power and the influence of 
black political organizer joe reed the teachers unions no 2 man 
not his race 
siegelman 44 a former executive director of the alabama 
democratic party who in 1972 managed george mcgoverns presidential 
campaign in alabama tried to overtake hubbert with an appeal to 
conservative and independent voters 
he accused hubbert of supporting teachers so blindly that the 
union gave legal representation to a convicted child molester 
trying to return to classroom teaching 
the attorney general also claimed hubberts campaign promises 
would require doubling alabamas 35 billion annual budget and 
raising 10 billion in new taxes over four years 
the centerpiece of siegelmans campaign was a call for a state 
lottery and an increase in taxes on large timber tracts to pay for 
school and health programs 
hubbert 54 who earned a doctorate in education took charge of 
the union when separate black and white teacher groups merged in 
1969 along with reed hubbert helped the union more than triple in 
size to 70000 members with a payroll checkoff system building 
substantial political funds 
hubbert traveled with a mop and bucket in hand as he urged 
siegelman to clean up the campaign hubbert also made joking 
indirect references to siegelmans admitted experimentation with 
marijuana during college

one evening during the sixth international 
aids conference dr anthony fauci found himself surrounded by aids 
activists 
it was by his own choosing the director of the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases the governments top 
aids researcher was appearing at a theater as a panel member with 
other experts and activists 
compared with the days of demonstrations outside the conference 
the dialogue in the theater was a love feast 
fauci talked about placing more women and minorities in aids 
drugs tests and about greater community representation on 
scientific committees 
activist martin delaney of san franciscos project inform 
confessed that the slow pace of his own drugtesting program made 
him more sympathetic to government projects he had criticized in 
the past 
it takes a lot longer to come up with research than i thought 
it did delaney said 
despite the weeks arrests and angry confrontations such as the 
one that greeted health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
on sunday much of the talk within the scientific and activist 
communities was of conciliation 
members of the aids community had a greater role at the 
conference appearing on panels and questioning researchers at 
various sessions 
many of them are very well informed they ask some of the most 
pointed penetrating questions thats good for all of us said 
dr john bartlett who tests aids drugs at duke university 
i dont always agree with them bartlett said but if you 
judge their contributions on balance they have been important 
even those who work for agencies that often are the targets of 
criticism and demonstrations lauded the activists lobbying for 
accelerated drug testing and clinical trials 
dr susan mertins a researcher at the national cancer 
institute said she was angered by activist charges that scientists 
are not trying hard enough to fight aids but she said the protests 
also have done some good 
in the big picture they have influenced our thinking they 
have helped get things faster to the people who need it she said 
fauci himself hammered away at the theme of harmony during the 
conference 
activists bring a special insight into the disease that can 
actually be helpful in the way that we design our scientific 
approaches he said at the closing session shortly before 
protesters shouted down sullivan 
even after the noisy demonstration fauci was talking peace i 
still see it going in the right direction he said there is 
momentum for better relationships for a better give and take 
many in the aids community also spoke of the importance of 
cooperation 
pierre ludington a member of the american association of 
physicians for human rights said there has been a snowballing of 
togetherness 
people are getting tired of bashing up against each other 
said ludington who is infected with the aids virus many of us 
have learned to compromise 
but not everyone is talking compromise many members of the aids 
coalition to unleash power or act up the nationwide group that 
organized the daily demonstrations remain angry and wary of the 
scientific establishment 
i dont think one week makes for a greater level of 
cooperation said saundra johnson a member of act ups chicago 
chapter were going to keep it up until we get what we want 
the hostility and suspicion were evident even on saturday when 
many officials with the conference took part in a march billed as 
a united call to action 
conference cochairmen dr john ziegler and dr paul volberding 
appeared at the rally to voice their support 
weve made a great breakthrough ziegler said were all 
in this together 
but scattered with the applause were shouts of tokenism and 
a swelling chant of stop the profiteering

nasa says it will borrow a fuel 
valve from the unfinished shuttle endeavour to eliminate the 
hydrogen leak that has kept columbia grounded 
the tiny leak has delayed columbias astronomy mission until at 
least midaugust the shuttle was supposed to lift off may 30 with 
the 150 million astro observatory 
a 17inchdiameter valve in a pipe that carries liquid hydrogen 
from the shuttles big external tank to the main engines will be 
replaced with one from endeavour nasa said monday 
endeavour is under construction and is not scheduled to fly 
until 1992 only one valve was built for each shuttle there are no 
spares 
columbias launch last month was scrubbed six hours before 
liftoff when the leak was detected during fueling the shuttle had 
to be moved back to the hangar for repair 
nasa plans to test atlantis at the launch pad on thursday 
partly filling the external tank with supercold liquid hydrogen to 
make sure there are no leaks leak tests normally are conducted 
with helium 
atlantis is scheduled for a secret military mission in midjuly 
the exact date will be set friday 
we have no reason to believe we have a generic problem nasa 
spokeswoman lisa malone said all leak tests with helium have 
passed but that was the same for columbia

it hurts but a growing number of the nations 
arts organizations are passing up national endowment for the arts 
grants because the money comes at too great a price the loss of 
artistic freedom 
there are a great many literary magazines that cant afford to 
act on principle but we had to make a statement said editor 
george plimpton of the paris review which last week declined its 
10000 in nea funds 
the gettysburg review last week also declined a 4550 grant 
joining an illustrious crowd of refuseniks that includes the new 
york and oregon shakespeare festivals and paul zimmer of the 
university of iowa press 
paul zimmer george plimpton these are people of great 
conscience intelligence wisdom and humor said liam rector 
executive director of associated writing programs of norfolk va 
it cant be taken lightly when people of this kind of 
accomplishment turn down these grants 
plimpton said the review couldnt accept the 1990 grant because 
in its present form it is very dangerous his opinion was 
shared by others among the 2000 artists nationwide who received 
grant packages this spring 
recipients were asked to sign letters promising not to depict 
sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual exploitation of children 
or individuals engaged in sex acts and which when taken as a 
whole do not have serious literary artistic political or 
scientific merit 
the clause suggested censorship to officials at the oregon 
shakespeare festival which on june 18 sent a letter rejecting its 
49500 grant 
were talking freedom of expression here freedom of speech 
spokeswoman deborah elliott said in a telephone interview monday 
we do not feel its the governments role to step in and make a 
decision as to what is acceptable and what is not acceptable in the 
arts 
the guidelines were adopted as part of the nea appropriations 
bill president bush signed into law last year amid protests over 
works such as robert mapplethorpes homoerotic photography and 
andres serranos crucifix submerged in urine both had received 
federal funds 
its becoming a cause celebre and were very much stuck 
in the middle nea spokesman josh dare said the legislative 
restrictions have been imposed on us by congress and now its 
affecting the artists 
peter stitt editor of the gettysburg review is among those who 
decided to take a stand and reject the money 
what you have is people of conscience who cannot sign a 
document that they find repugnant and for me thats what it is 
said stitt whose review is primarily funded by gettysburg college 
in pennsylvania 
dare said that of 2000 grants to individuals and groups about 
670 responses had come in including at least seven rejections 
they include joseph papps new york shakespeare festival the 
paris and gettysburg reviews choreographer ferne ackerman of 
venice calif the theater for the new city foundation of new 
york the university of iowa press and the oregon shakespeare 
festival 
he said about a dozen other recipients included protest letters 
along with their signed agreement to comply with the federal 
restrictions 
taking a stand against the congressional guidelines is hard on 
artists many of whom need federal funding to survive 
this years 11000 nea grant represents about a quarter of the 
operating budget at alice james books a cambridgebased 
independent press 
without it we probably wouldnt be publishing this year 
said spokeswoman jenney milner but our acceptance of the grant 
should not in any way imply support for the nea policy because 
were deadset against any censorship 
the situation is dispiriting for rep sidney yates dill who 
has been an arts advocate since 1970 and chairs the house 
subcommittee that oversees appropriations to the nea 
he would like to see the current antiobscenity restrictions 
lifted from the 1991 appropriations bill scheduled to go before 
the full house this summer 
when i first came to congress long about 1949 there was a 
major confrontation over an arts exhibition sponsored by the state 
department because some of the artists were alleged to be 
communists some of those artists were jackson pollock mark 
rothko and georgia okeeffe said yates 
its the same today except the boogey man isnt communism 
its obscenity

vasile would like to crack down on his 
workers who have slacked off since communist dictator nicolae 
ceausescu was overthrown but he doesnt dare 
if i punished them for not working hard tomorrow they would 
ask me to leave said vasile a chief engineer at the staterun 
republica pipe factory he gestured at an outdoor picnic table 
where several workers sat smoking 
vasiles problem illustrates those of the newly elected 
government it has inherited one of eastern europes least 
efficient economies but cannot change the system radically without 
risking a loss of support from workers 
how important workers are to the government was illustrated june 
14 when tens of thousands poured into bucharest to show support 
after a day of antigovernment riots 
bluecollar workers about 40 percent of romanias labor force 
have benefited greatly from the revolution that began with the 
overthrow and execution of ceausescu in december 
factory employees went on strike to force communist managers 
out then elected their own new bosses 
of course they are nicer to us because if they arent we 
might fire them said alexandru 25 a laminator like the others 
interviewed at the republica plant alexandru gave only his first 
name 
the national salvation front which took power after the 
revolution quickly solidified its position by reaching out to 
workers 
it increased pay and vacations cut the work week to five days 
from the six or seven common under ceausescu in the election 
campaign the front promised to move gradually toward a market 
economy and avoid the painful unemployment expected in other east 
european countries 
both the front and its presidential candidate ion iliescu were 
rewarded with big wins in the may 20 elections now they must 
figure out how to make industry more competitive without offending 
the workers 
it is a challenging job said eugen dijmarescu an economist 
expected to be a prominent planner in the new administration 
the communists converted romania from agriculture to industry 
and it has problems typical of eastern europe lowquality 
production overemphasis on unprofitable heavy industry and 
inefficiency caused by central planning 
its equipment is even more obsolete than that of its neighbors 
because ceausescu restricted imports for a decade in order to pay 
off the national debt 
romanias hardcurrency trade balance plunged from a surplus of 
25 billion in 1989 to a 400 million deficit in the first four 
months of 1990 mainly because of imports of consumer goods 
according to government figures 
official figures show industrial production down nearly 20 
percent for the first third of this year from the same period in 
1989 
among the causes are the closings of some unprofitable plants 
and diversion of electricity from factories to homes 
plant managers say the freedom that workers feel from the old 
requirement of hard work also is involved 
this is how they view democracy vasile said everyone 
does what he wants but still gets full pay 
stuart dunley of the british firm rindalbourne ltd which buys 
textiles from a dozen romanian factories said many had eliminated 
the unpopular overnight shift combined with the reduced work week 
he said the effect on production is rather dramatic 
dijmarescu the economic planner said the new government 
probably would end some of the recent pay benefits 
he said the government planned to form stockissuing companies 
in all industries except electricity gas production oil and 
railways the shares initially will belong to the government but 
gradually will be sold to private investors he said and romania 
probably will borrow money abroad 
factory management boards will be allowed to set wages and the 
level of private ownership and will be allowed to go bankrupt if 
they cannot make a profit dijmarescu said 
if you put the companies in such a position the workers 
will be interested in making changes he predicted 
some feel the front will not carry out the privatization plan 
because it is divided between young technocrats who favor broad 
economic changes and former communists who oppose them 
whether employees will go along with a market system also is a 
question 
unemployment will only be when there is professional 
competition but that will only happen if privatization comes 
said mihai a 28yearold worker in a group taking a break at the 
republica pipe plant 
the idea he and his coworkers declared was unthinkable

portauprince haiti ap last weeks bloody attack on the 
governing council of state has cast doubt on plans for democratic 
elections this year in haiti where memories of an election day 
massacre in 1987 are still fresh 
the shooting which left two men dead and a third wounded 
appeared intended to terrorize potential voters and show that the 
civilian caretaker government cannot ensure election security 
two of the four gunmen wore army uniforms it was unclear 
whether they were active soldiers but the effect was to suggest 
army complicity 
haitis last attempt to hold free and fair presidential 
elections collapsed in 1987 when thugs in collusion with the army 
massacred at least 34 voters at polling stations 
memories of that are etched on the national consciousness even 
before thursdays attack on the 19member council of state many 
haitians were fearful of elections because of a surge in urban 
crime and continued repression by rural police agents 
insecurity is spreading at high speed said the rev antoine 
adrien a roman catholic priest people are not going to vote in 
these conditions 
the attack thursday occurred in a hotel courtyard shortly before 
the council of state was to meet with political and union leaders 
to discuss the crime wave 
labor leader jeanmarie montes was killed instantly and council 
member serge villard died saturday while being airlifted to miami 
for treatment political activist emmanuel mani was hospitalized in 
satisfactory condition 
the government announced two days of national mourning monday 
and tuesday for villard an author of the 1987 constitution and an 
ardent opponent of the long dictatorship of francois duvalier and 
his son jeanclaude haitians observed a day of mourning and 
partial work stoppage for montes on saturday 
president ertha pascaltrouillot under pressure from the united 
states and other donor nations to hold elections quickly said over 
the weekend that she was determined to go through with the vote 
she said the army would double its efforts to improve security 
but the speech did little to satisfy growing demands for the 
president to take decisive action against diehard loyalists of the 
duvalier regime who are bent on blocking the transition to 
democracy 
some politicians have called for mrs pascaltrouillots 
resignation 
the independent electoral council has scheduled general 
elections for late september although many believe they cannot be 
organized that soon 
marc bazin a former world bank official and a leading 
presidential candidate said in an interview before the 
assassinations that he saw no reason to put off the elections 
the longer it takes to organize elections the higher the 
security risk will become he said 
the situation in haiti bazin said is no worse than that in 
colombia peru or nicaragua which all succeeded in holding 
democratic elections 
but others argue that haiti is different because elsewhere 
people expect the army to guarantee security 
our problem is not insecurity as such but lack of confidence 
in the armed forces to protect the voter against antidemocratic 
violence said louis dejoie jr a former presidential candidate 
lt gen herard abraham the army chief has pledged support for 
the elections but many haitians believe he does not have full 
control over the notoriously corrupt and illdisciplined force of 
6000 
mrs pascaltrouillot a supreme court judge was appointed 
president in march after the fall of the 18month military regime 
of lt gen prosper avril the council of state was set up as a 
check on presidential power in the transition to democracy 
it is haitis fifth government since jeanclaude baby doc 
duvalier fled into exile in 1986 ending the family dictatorship 
that began after his fathers election as president in 1957 
the us government cut off 70 million in direct aid to haiti 
one of the worlds poorest nations in disgust over the 1987 
election massacre it is leading international pressure for new 
elections 
weve made it clear said us ambassador alvin adams 
youre not going to see a resumption of comprehensive 
significantly increased aid to a government which is not 
democratically elected 
but there is concern that security fears will keep most voters 
home making it impossible to elect a government with broad support 
the haitian people do not want anymore to be driven to what 
somebody else wants said dr louis roy a physician and 
president of the council of state they want free elections 
elections that would be credible 
one obstacle to elections may have been resolved recently with 
the resignation of finance minister marie violene legagneur who is 
widely regarded as a duvalierist the council of state had refused 
to approve any electoral law signed by her

the sandinistas are suffering an 
identity crisis after their electoral defeat trying to figure out 
how to fight what they see as a rising tide of political 
conservatism backed by the us dollar 
it is a fight for their political lives and they know it 
we took power by the gun and lost it at the ballot box said 
a sandinista official who spoke on condition he not be named we 
do not know how to be a political opposition party 
victor tirado a member of the eightman sandinista national 
directorate said in a recent interview that international 
conditions have changed with the collapse of the socialist world 
and the world tendency to disarmament and solving all conflicts 
through negotiation 
as the sandinistas confront change leaders have proposed more 
grassroots participation in the partys decisions the party is now 
holding regional conventions as a prelude to a national convention 
next year at which leaders will be elected by secret ballot 
in their analysis of their defeat in the feb 25 general 
elections some sandinista leaders have admitted tactical and 
ideological mistakes and other failures such as corruption 
we need a moral renovation of sandinismo former interior 
minister tomas borge told a group of party leaders recently 
luis carrion another highranking party leader said the 
sandinistas had lost touch with peasants in some areas he also 
said the party had lost support because of its bitter quarrels with 
the roman catholic church 
a key issue is the attitude the party will assume toward the new 
government headed by president violeta barrios de chamorro 
some sandinistas like tirado say the time of confrontation has 
passed and the party should negotiate others argue for a 
continuation of the revolutionary hard line 
in the pages of the party newspaper barricada sandinista 
ideologues still cite irreconcilable class differences as 
justification for not cooperating with the new government 
what we have in power now is a bourgeoisie proyankee 
government wrote edgard orozco the idea of killing sandinismo 
is moving rapidly they are trying to kill politically and 
ideologically a series of concepts ideas and programs that surge 
as a true revolutionary identity 
the end of the military draft is seen as a major blow against 
the party since all draftees had had to undergo sandinista 
political education as well as military training 
mrs chamorro abolished the draft when she took office on april 
25 ending more than a decade of sandinista rule she announced 
last week that the army would be reduced by about half to 41000 
soldiers by aug 3 
the new government is also making changes in the educational 
system that the sandinistas see as a threat to their survival 
the us agency for international development aid will help 
pay for new school books that eliminate references to sandinista 
heroes and us imperialism according to government and us 
embassy officials 
the sandinistas thought that history began with them said 
poet pablo antonio cuadra a director of the chamorro family 
newspaper la prensa and critic of the sandinistas 
their worst damage was to the nicaraguan character he said 
they tried to impose an ideology and politicize generations they 
ruined our educational system 
cuadra says it will take years to repair the damage but 
nicaragua must be careful that it does not return to the 
exploitation of the prerevolutionary dictatorships 
we must study the experiences left by sandinismo he said 
how far can we go before freedom gives room to exploitation how 
can the state be a watchman over the economy

new supreme court decisions on abortion and 
the right to die send conflicting messages on the familys role in 
deciding a loved ones medical care medical ethics experts say 
the courts rulings monday on parental involvement in such 
issues seem to be going in different directions said k danner 
clouser a humanities professor at the pennsylvania state 
university college of medicine one seems to enhance the role of 
the family and the other one doesnt 
the court ruled monday that states can bar family members from 
ending the lives of persistently comatose relatives who have not 
conclusively made their wishes known 
the court said casual remarks years ago by a missouri woman 
nancy cruzan who has been in a vegetative state since an 
automobile accident six years ago did not constitute clear and 
convincing evidence that she would have wanted to die her family 
had wanted their daughters food and water tubes disconnected 
the court also made it significantly more difficult for young 
girls to obtain legal abortions without first notifying their 
parents 
the justices upheld an ohio law that said minors must notify a 
parent before having an abortion the court also upheld a minnesota 
law requiring either notification of both parents or permission 
from a judge 
the rulings are consistent in putting limitations on the right 
to privacy analysts said but they diverge on the issue of 
parental involvement 
in the missouri case the court said competent patients have the 
right to refuse lifesustaining treatment including food and water 
but analysts said the ruling went against the prevailing trend 
in saying the state of missouri could disregard the course of 
treatment that ms cruzans parents believed would be in their 
daughters best interest 
youre undermining the role of the family and saying some 
government agency or bureaucrat or impersonal law is going to look 
after somebodys interest better said stuart youngner a 
biomedical ethics professor at casewestern reserve university 
medical school i find it very disruptive to have the state 
step in and say it knows better 
william colby the cruzans lawyer said monday that ms cruzan 
might be moved to another state with fewer restrictions or he may 
request a hearing to present new evidence about her stated wishes 
the cruzans are hurt by the decision certainly and will 
still try to get an audience somewhere someone who will say yes 
family is very important he said 
many analysts interpreted the court ruling as an open door to 
new state legislation but they said such laws could go either way 
granting relatives the right to make such lifeanddeath 
decisions for their loved ones or making it harder for families to 
end lifesustaining treatment 
several analysts said they did not understand the courts ruling 
because it is commonly accepted that at least in some cases 
letting an incompetent patient die is in the patients best 
interest 
this seems to say that a state can rule that its never in the 
interest of an incompetent to have treatment stopped said dr 
robert deatch director of georgetown universitys kennedy 
institute of ethics 
he and others expressed concern about the effect of such a state 
law on a comatose baby or child who had never explicitly said he or 
she did not want to live in a vegetative state they also wondered 
whether a generally worded living will would meet the courts 
standard of proof 
weve catalogued 30 types of lifesustaining treatment said 
arthur caplan director of the center of biomedical ethics at the 
university of minnesota people just cant anticipate every twist 
and turn of their medical care you cant just fill out a living 
will you must formally assign legal authority to someone who can 
be your decisionmaker 
as a result of the court ruling said clouser he would no 
longer merely give his wife power of attorney to make health 
decisions for him 
i want to type her a long paragraph about what i value about 
life and when i dont want to live he said there is such a 
thing as a quality of life not worth living and a persistent 
vegetative state is it

weeds grow waist high around the empty 
old homes where girls with bobbed hair set out tea for their dolls 
and young ice skaters squinted into the sun 60 years ago 
the old mining town is gone its 800 or so residents forced to 
move on when the depression and cheaper copper from chile led the 
kennecott copper co to abandon its claim high in mountains 
we had everything here said bud seltenreich 75 of 
anchorage everybody who left here said if that place ever 
opens up again im going back 
this month the kennicott kids now retirement age or better 
went back 
the gathering june 1617 was the first reunion for the 40 or so 
children of kennicott among the countrys biggest ghost towns and 
a national historic landmark surrounded by deep forests 
many at the reunion had never returned before many had lost 
touch after their families moved on 
with lots of people i couldnt attach a name said frank 
morris the son of a kennicott paymaster who came to the reunion 
from juneau but then as soon as they spoke there was instant 
recognition 
they searched out their past in the rain tramping through the 
brush in borrowed boots and spikes to look for old landmarks they 
walked kennicott glacier for fun the way they did as children at 
night as bulging photo albums were passed around they wished that 
life in the company town had never ceased 
the copper mines operated from 1911 until 1938 when the bottom 
dropped out 
the last train out was nov 11 1938 my birthday said 
inger jensen ricci who left as an outdoorsy 20yearold and at 71 
still keeps in touch with childhood friends she helped organize 
the reunion with a lodge owner who gave the group free room and 
board 
no one has worked the copper mines since in kennicott which is 
actually a misspelling of the company name although quality ore 
remains the company simply walked away from its copper holdings in 
alaska 
machinery rusts in the moist air the towns landmark a 
14story concentration mill and leaching plant is rotting on a 
hillside papers and books still cover dusty office desks 
sixty years ago when many americans stood in bread lines and 
abandoned the dust bowl in search of jobs miners worked the 
kennicott copper pockets around the clock 
at the rate of one bucket every 52 seconds for 27 years almost 
5 million tons of ore were sent three miles down the mountain to 
kennicott where it was loaded onto rail cars and shipped 125 miles 
to the coastal town of cordova 
pay was about 100 a month so good that mothers encouraged 
sons to forget about school and stay on with the company which 
built trim red and white houses for the superintendents foremen 
and their families 
the miners worked under contract said george sullivan a 
former anchorage mayor who was 15 when he left home in valdez to 
work at kennicott during the summer of 1937 
the more ore they moved the more money they made lots of 
them never even came down from the mines 
five miles away was mccarthy a collection of shops saloons 
cafes and tent brothels that the families of kennicott called 
downtown 
kennicott children were not allowed to go there unchaperoned 
it was a rough little prospectors town said mildred 
erickson reis 79 who came to the reunion from whidbey island 
wash kennicott was very staid 
she recalled listening one night as a child at the kitchen table 
while her father told of a woman who was asked to leave town 
because of some whispered lapse of morals 
it was all formal and correct reis recalled we had 
saturday night dances and i learned to dance very early the men 
wore business suits we wore pretty dresses 
there were two rooms in the company schoolhouse children often 
found themselves in grades by themselves and teachers amounted to 
private tutors every year at christmas the company gave each 
child a new toy 
at the reunion national park service historians were invited to 
photograph old family albums and collect oral history on tape 
the town really had the feel of a resort said linda cook 
who is putting hundreds of the old photographs into archives 
one gentleman here told me no kennicott kid ever ended up in 
jail i believe him

attorney general don siegelman hoped for 
a strong turnout today to carry him past teacherlobbyist paul 
hubbert in a democratic runoff for the right to challenge 
republican gov guy hunt 
hubbert led a sixcandidate field in the june 5 primary with 32 
percent of the vote against 25 percent for siegelman and remained 
the frontrunner in weekend polls 
the threeweek runoff has been bruising siegelman tried to 
close the gap with negative ads and the candidates accused each 
other of racist tactics 
whoever wins the democrati nomination once tantamount to 
winning the governors office in alabama will face an uphill 
battle against hunt 
the preacherfarmer in 1986 became alabamas first gop governor 
in 112 years thanks to a split in democratic ranks he is favored 
in the polls over either hubbert or siegelman 
an estimated 31 percent of alabamas 24 million registered 
voters cast ballots in the primary and analysts forecast lighter 
turnout today 
siegelman said if voters whose candidates lost in the primary 
returned to the polls today it could spell victory for him 
hubbert 54 has been executive secretary of the alabama 
education association for 21 years he built the teacher 
organization into one of the most influential forces at the 
statehouse 
siegelman 44 a former executive director of the alabama 
democratic party was state manager of george mcgoverns 1972 
presidential campaign he won two terms as secretary of state and 
then the attorney generals office in 1986 
siegelman has depicted his opponent as a man opening classroom 
doors to child molesters while hubbert has exploited siegelmans 
admission he smoked marijuana in college 
siegelman accused hubbert of using racist code words in 
calling for a workfare program to replace welfare while hubberts 
camp said a siegelman ad warning about a black leaders influence 
amounted to racist tactics 
the black leader is joe reed the no 2 man behind hubbert at 
the teachers union

the future of abortion in the united states 
more than ever before appears to hinge on the views of one woman 
supreme court justice sandra day oconnor 
and her latest word on the divisive issue is cheering 
antiabortion forces while alarming abortionrights advocates 
the court ruling in cases from ohio and minnesota on monday 
upheld state laws making it significantly more difficult for girls 
to obtain legal abortions without first telling their parents 
although the decisions did not directly affect the abortion 
rights of adult women the court again indicated a willingness to 
reconsider its landmark 1973 decision in roe vs wade that 
legalized abortion 
oconnor cast the key vote as the court upheld 54 a minnesota 
law banning abortions for most unmarried girls under 18 unless both 
parents are notified or a judges permission is obtained instead 
she also voted with the 63 majority to uphold an ohio law that 
said minors must notify a parent before having an abortion 
oconnor provided the critical vote in a 54 ruling that struck 
down a version of the minnesota law that would have required 
twoparent notice without allowing the judicial bypass option 
she played the same role in july 1989 when the court also by a 
54 vote gave states greater power to regulate abortions 
how far can states go in imposing new restrictions precisely 
as far as justice oconnor will let them go roger evans of 
planned parenthood said monday 
four highcourt members chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
seem ready to reverse roe vs wade that would allow states to 
outlaw virtually all abortions 
four justices harry a blackmun william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and john paul stevens seem determined to defend womens 
right to abortion 
left in the middle is oconnor who has criticized the 1973 
ruling and until monday had never voted to strike down a state 
regulation making abortions less accessible 
she soon may get another opportunity to reassess roe vs wade 
the us territory of guam recently passed a restrictive abortion 
law and the louisiana legislature is considering similar 
legislation 
oconnors votes monday and the thrust of a concurring opinion 
she wrote in the minnesota case drew fire from abortion rights 
advocates but praise from abortion opponents 
women still have a right to abortion but that right is 
becoming emptier and emptier said janet benshoof of the american 
civil liberties union 
gary bauer president of the antiabortion family research 
council said these two cases represent further evidence that roe 
vs wade will sometime soon slip into the history books as an 
illfated supreme court decision 
oconnors pivotal role could change if the courts makeup 
changes before the next abortion test case arrives in that event 
president bushs first appointment to the high court would carry 
enormous impact for the future of abortion 
alluding to that fact kate michelman of the national abortion 
rights action league said the threat to overturning the right 
to abortion is as close as the next supreme court vacancy 
mondays decisions offered these guidelines for states seeking 
to enact parental notification laws 
states may require that both parents be notified only if a 
judicial bypass option is included 
even requiring notice to one parent must be accompanied by an 
alternative that allows a girl to avoid telling her parent if she 
can prove to a judge it would be against her best interest 
the girl may be required to prove by clear and convincing 
evidence not by just a preponderance of the evidence that she 
is mature enough to make the decision on her own 
doctors personally may be required to notify the parents 
states may require that parental notice occur at least 48 hours 
before an abortion is performed

here is a chronology of the supreme courts 
major abortion decisions 
jan 22 1973 in roe vs wade the court for the first time 
legalized abortion nationwide the court based its 72 ruling on a 
womans constitutional right to privacy 
the court said a womans decision to have an abortion during the 
first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor 
it said states may interfere in the abortion decision during the 
second trimester only to protect the womans health and may take 
steps to protect fetal life in the third trimester state authority 
to regulate abortions after the first trimester was not made 
absolute however 
jan 22 1973 in roe vs bolton the court that same day 
struck down by a 72 vote restrictions on facilities that could be 
used to perform abortions the decision gave rise to a new kind of 
medical facility the abortion clinic 
july 1 1976 in planned parenthood vs danforth the court by 
a 63 vote said states cannot give husbands veto power over their 
pregnant wives decision to abort their pregnancies by a separate 
54 vote the court said that neither can parents of minor unwed 
girls be given an absolute veto 
june 20 1977 in maher vs roe the court 63 ruled that 
states have no legal obligation to pay for nontherapeutic 
abortions 
jan 9 1979 in colautti vs franklin reached by a 63 vote 
the court reaffirmed its intention to give doctors broad discretion 
in determining the timing of fetal viability when a fetus can 
live outside the mothers womb the justices said states may seek 
to protect a fetus that has reached viability but that 
determination is up to doctors not courts or legislatures 
july 2 1979 in bellotti vs baird the court by an 81 vote 
elaborated on its parental consent decision of 1976 it said states 
may be able to require a pregnant unmarried minor to obtain 
parental consent to an abortion so long as the state law provides 
an alternative procedure to parental approval such as letting the 
minor seek a state judges approval instead 
june 30 1980 in harris vs mcrae the socalled hyde 
amendment was upheld by a 54 vote the court said the federal 
government and individual states are under no legal obligation to 
pay for even medically necessary abortions sought by women on 
welfare 
march 23 1981 in hl vs matheson the court ruled by a 63 
vote that states may require doctors consulted by some young girls 
those still dependent on their parents and too immature to 
decide such matters for themselves to try to inform parents 
before performing a requested abortion 
june 15 1983 in three decisions called city of akron vs 
akron center for reproductive health planned parenthood of kansas 
city vs ashcroft and simopolous vs virginia the court 63 said 
states and local communities may not require all abortions for 
women more than three months pregnant to be performed in a hospital 
the court also struck down regulations that among other things 
imposed a 24hour waiting period between the signing of an abortion 
consent form and the medical procedure and required doctors to tell 
women seeking an abortion that a fetus is a human life 
june 11 1986 in thornburgh vs american college of 
obstetricians and gynecologists the court voted 54 to strike down 
pennsylvania abortion regulations somewhat similar to those it 
invalidated in 1983 the court said states may not require doctors 
to inform women seeking abortions about potential risks and about 
available medical assistance benefits for prenatal care and 
childbirth 
the court also struck down requirements that doctors performing 
thirdtrimester abortions which are rare use procedures least 
risky to a fetus capable of surviving outside the womb and that 
two doctors always be present for abortions performed in the third 
trimester also invalidated was a regulation requiring doctors to 
make a record which could become available to the public of every 
abortion they perform 
july 3 1989 in webster vs reproductive health services the 
court gave states greater power to make abortions harder to get by 
a 54 vote the court ruled in a missouri case that states may 
require doctors to determine through various testing whether a 
fetus at least 20 weeks old is viable or capable of living 
outside the womb 
the court also said states may ban any public employee from 
performing or assisting in most abortions and that states may ban 
the use of any public hospital or other facility for performing 
most abortions 
june 24 1990 in ohio vs akron center for reproductive health 
and hodgson vs minnesota the court allowed states to impose 
regulations making it more difficult for girls to obtain abortions 
without first notifying their parents 
the court said a state may require notice to both parents of an 
unmarried girl under 18 who is dependent on at least one of the 
parents as long as the state law lets the girl avoid telling either 
parent by getting a judges permission for the abortion

chinas release of dissident fang lizhi 
praised as a positive step by the bush administration apparently 
is doing little to change minds in congress about warming relations 
toward beijing 
the astrophysicists release on monday from the us embassy in 
beijing where he had been living in asylum for the past year was 
welcomed at the white house and on capitol hill 
but while presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater hailed it as 
a farsighted significant step that will improve the atmosphere 
for progress in our bilateral relations congressional skeptics 
remained unpersuaded 
while i am pleased by professor fangs release i continue to 
be concerned about the lack of freedom available to millions of his 
fellow citizens said senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine a leading critic of bushs china policy 
mitchell said he would continue efforts to head off an extension 
of most favored nation trade status for china which bush recently 
ordered although it is considered unlikely that lawmakers can 
muster the necessary twothirds vote 
rep stephen solarz dny chairman of the house foreign 
affairs asia subcommittee said the release removes an important 
symbolic irritant in uschinese relations 
but it does not alter the opinion of the american public or 
the us congress as to the oppressive nature of the chinese 
regime he said 
it is far from clear that his release marks a significant 
turning point for the hundreds of courageous dissidents still 
imprisoned silenced or in hiding in china sen edward m 
kennedy dmass said 
until far greater progress is made there continues to be no 
justification for the bush administrations decision for granting 
most favored nation trade status to the brutal and repressive 
chinese regime kennedy said in a statement 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan used the occasion to 
claim victory for bushs muchcriticized china policy 
it is a small but significant step toward the path that we 
want china to take the path of reason and the path of reform 
dole said in a brief floor speech it is also one bit of tangible 
evidence that president bush is on the right track in the way he is 
managing uschinese relations 
fang took refuge at the embassy in beijing last year after the 
chinese governments brutal crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators in and around tiananmen square his continuing 
presence became an issue in the two countries faltering relations

it is prudent for americans to be concerned 
about food safety but theres no need to go overboard about it a 
senior agriculture department official says 
prudence demands that we examine every threat to the food we 
eat and the water we drink deputy secretary jack c parnell 
said that is why the department and other agencies are 
continually developing new tests to prevent harmful chemical 
residues in food from reaching consumers 
but parnell told a conference on food and nutrition here monday 
that the comments of some groups demanding tougher federal 
regulations make him wonder 
i get the feeling that the only things that would make them 
happy is if we shot down every crop duster arrested every 
toxicologist and sent every college student majoring in chemistry 
to a reeducation camp he said 
parnell said there is a better way and that the usda and other 
agencies are using it 
we will make sure that good health is promoted not by 
requiring foods to be pesticidefree but by making certain that 
levels are no greater than what is considered absolutely safe based 
on scientific measurement he said 
science isnt perfect parnell said scientists can make 
mistakes and they can miscalculate but they are light years ahead 
of rumor hysteria and passions of the moment 
parnell said irrational fears about chemicals and food safety 
could drive up the costs of farm production and lead to higher 
prices at the grocery store 
if we react carelessly without science in response to 
imagined risks and thereby needlessly increase food costs the 
poor will be the first to notice reduced buying power and higher 
nutrition costs he said 
the efficiency of farmers productivity has more than doubled 
in the last 40 years he said and chemicals have played a role in 
this american victory over hunger 
parnell who was director of the california department of food 
and agriculture before becoming usdas no 2 official last year 
said it has been american agriculture through inexpensive food 
that has helped enormously to raise our standard of living and 
that of many others around the world 
on the whole americans spend about 12 percent of their 
disposable income for food of which nearly 5 percent is for food 
eaten in restaurants and other places away from home 
by comparison he said residents of japan spend almost 20 
percent of its takehome pay for food the soviet union more than 
25 percent and china and india over half of their income 
but parnell said he has noticed there is a group of americans 
who are not always remembered in the debate about the safety of 
the nations food supply 
those are poorer americans who spend a much larger share of 
their budgets on food he said there are millions of 
americans perhaps over 30 million americans who spend over 50 
percent of their income on food 
foreign countries including poor third world nations also 
would feel the pinch parnell said 
these are more good reasons to act as quickly as the threat 
demands to the extent the danger requires but avoid alarmist 
calls for excessive or selfdefeating policies he said

federal and state animal health authorities 
have begun a campaign to check on the possibility of mad cow 
disease in the united states a disorder that has stricken 
britains cattle industry 
the disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy or bse attacks 
the central nervous system and is fatal to cattle officials said 
monday there has been no scientific evidence to date that it is 
a human health hazard 
james w glosser administrator of the agriculture departments 
animal health and inspection service said bse is not known to 
exist in the united states 
the agency he said has barred the importation of live cattle 
from britain since july 1989 
also over 150 federal and state veterinarians constantly 
conduct field investigations of suspicious diseases and report 
their findings to us glosser said 
the national surveillance program will include usda animal 
health officials state veterinary diagnostic laboratories and iowa

initially glosser said laboratories in at least 16 states will 
be cooperating in the program california iowa illinois indiana 
kentucky maryland michigan minnesota missouri new york ohio 
pennsylvania tennessee virginia washington and wisconsin 
glosser said additional states also have requested to be 
included so laboratory specimens may be received from other 
sources as well 
cattle affected by bse may suffer changes in temperament such 
as nervousness or aggression thus accounting for it sometimes 
being called mad cow disease 
other symptoms include abnormal posture lack of coordination 
and difficulty in rising reduced milk production loss of body 
weight despite continued appetite and eventually death 
confirmation of the disease is possible only through postmortem 
examination of the animals brain there is no test to detect the 
disease in a live animal

the supreme courts first right to die 
ruling contains good news for proponents of living wills that allow 
people to assure their lives are not prolonged against their wishes 
already adopted by most states living will laws allow people to 
specify in writing that should they ever become mentally 
incompetent and severely disabled no extraordinary medical 
treatment may be used to keep them alive 
in its 54 decision monday the court said states may block 
family members from ending the lives of permanently comatose 
relatives who have not made their wishes known conclusively 
the ruling bars the parents of a 32yearold missouri woman 
nancy cruzan from ordering removal of a feeding tube that is 
keeping the irreversibly unconscious woman alive 
but chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the 
majority suggested the court might uphold a constitutional right 
to choose death for those who put their wishes in writing in living 
wills 
for purposes of this case we assume that the united states 
constitution would grant a competent person a constitutionally 
protected right to refuse lifesaving hydration and nutrition he 
said 
also rehnquist said the court was not deciding what would 
happen if a competent person designated in writing a surrogate who 
would be empowered to make life and death decisions if the 
individual became mentally incompetent 
the differences between the choice made by a competent person 
to refuse medical treatment and the choice made for an incompetent 
person by someone else to refuse medical treatment are so obviously 
different that the state is warranted in establishing rigorous 
procedures for the latter class of cases which do not apply to the 
former class rehnquist said 
those words were somewhat heartening to justice william j 
brennan who dissented in the cruzan ruling 
brennan said the majority seemed to suggest that existence of a 
living will would be adequate proof of a persons intention to 
choose death over life for those like ms cruzan in a persistent 
vegetative state 
but the problem is that relatively few americans have taken the 
time or trouble to draw up living wills even though they are legal 
in most states brennan said 
too few people execute living wills or equivalently formal 
directives to ensure that the wishes of incompetent persons 
will be honored he said 
for them he said the testimony of close friends and family 
members may often be the best evidence available of what the 
patients choice would be 
m rose gasner of the society for the right to die in new york 
said her organization will continue to lobby for stronger living 
will laws 
although were sorry for the cruzans she said in terms 
of the decisions effect on the law well just have to keep doing 
what weve been doing which is working state by state to get laws 
passed

a computernavigation system to be tested by 
commuters on the santa monica freeway was revved up monday but ran 
into a few bumps 
the futuristic car guidance system with digitally recorded 
voices a televisionscreen map display and text displays worked 
only sporadically during the exhibit for reporters at the state 
transportation department 
at one point during a demonstration session a calm female voice 
got out half a warning before the system crashed in an electronic 
screech 
eastbound santa monica freeway congested from la brea on ramp 
to hwonk 
officials insisted the system is an improvement over traffic 
advisories offered by commercial radio stations and defended 
investing in an experiment tilted to keeping people in their cars 
rather than using mass transit 
data gathered by the state transportation department from 
sensors in freeways city workers and other sources is radioed to 
the cars for display on a bosch travel pilot system the system 
uses a dashboardmounted 3inchby4inch tv screen to show maps of 
the freeway and nearby streets 
on monday the system was demonstrated on the freeway it will 
be tested in cars over the next year on a 14mile stretch of the 
freeway linking downtown to the westside 
by punching buttons drivers can zoom out for an overall picture 
or in on a few blocks they can display traffic information in text 
form on the tiny tv screen or they can listen in on messages 
broadcast from caltrans control center 
the latter seemed a likely preference for many motorists given 
the difficulty of monitoring the screen and the freeway 
simultaneously 
the transportation department known as caltrans kicked in 
900000 to see how drivers make use of the system and how they 
prefer to get their traffic messages the federal highway 
administration provided 750000 general motors corp chipped in 
25 oldsmobile 88s 
deputy us transportation secretary elaine l chao who helped 
introduce the system at a news conference said transportation 
planners must look decades ahead 
we are approaching the end of the national highway development 
system and we now have to concentrate more on alleviating 
congestion ms chao said 
a similar experiment to begin soon in the orlando fla area 
will install electronic mapping systems in 100 rental cars with 
tourist information available as part of the display 
the cars in los angeles will become part of caltrans network of 
traffic sources by feeding information back into trafficcontrol 
computers delivery and cab companies are expected to show 
interest and some testing will be done by commercial drivers after 
state employees and hired test drivers are studied 
jerry baxter caltrans los angeles chief said it provides more 
detailed information than radio traffic reports especially about 
streets that often are faster than jammed freeways 
that could encourage drivers to take alternate routes easing 
congestion he said 
ive been up in a helicopter a lot of mornings and you see the 
freeway is bumper to bumper and the parallel arterials are wide 
open baxter said 
the bosch navigation systems without the processor to overlay 
local traffic information will be on the market by years end 
priced between 3000 and 4000 on the test cars the gear totals 
nearly 10000 per vehicle 
baxter was asked if there werent a cheaper way to get 
information to drivers such as special radio frequencies like 
those available around airports other reporters questioned whether 
caltrans shouldnt be concentrating on getting drivers out of cars 
and into mass transit 
he said caltrans is also exploring all those alternatives in 
other programs 
this wont work for everybody he said but i think weve 
got to try everything we can think of

the senate heads toward a purely symbolic but 
difficult vote on flag burning with each side accusing the other of 
exaggerating and distorting the issue 
the flag protection amendment is dead but flag politics 
is just beginning said sen joseph biden ddel judiciary 
committee chairman 
the house last week rejected the proposal to amend the 
constitution to give congress and the states power to ban flag 
burning that killed it legislatively but the senate planned to 
vote on it late today anyway 
republicans are using democratic opposition to the 
constitutional amendment as an issue in the fall campaign and want 
the senate vote to help that along democrats currently hold a 
5545 majority in the senate which republicans hope to reduce or 
eliminate 
why are we voting on this said sen dale bumpers dark 
noting the seeming futility of the debate answering his own 
question he suggested that all incumbent democrats vote for the 
amendment to foil the gop strategy of 30second ads questioning 
their patriotism 
but republicans said democrats were wrong in characterizing 
their amendment which is backed by president bush as an assault 
on the bill of rights 
what were doing is letting a ragtag group of people who hate 
this country to go beyond parameters that we ought to be 
setting said sen orrin hatch rutah 
the senate should vote favorably on this proposal and send it 
back to the house so they may atone for their earlier decision 
said sen strom thurmond rsc 
the house last thursday voted 254177 in favor of the flag 
amendment 34 votes short of the twothirds majority required 
house speaker thomas foley dwash led the opposition and said 
the house would not vote again on the issue this year 
the amendment was first proposed a year ago after the supreme 
court found flag burning to be a form of free speech protected by 
the first amendment congress approved a revised statute against 
flag burning but the court on june 11 ruled 54 that the new law 
also violated the constitution

federal marshals are serving warrants to seize 
the publichousing leases of suspected drug dealers in 19 cities 
despite a court order limiting their ability to evict the tenants 
the effort to shut down what one official called grocery 
stores selling crack cocaine is part of a campaign by housing 
secretary jack kemp to rid public housing of drug trafficking 
we want to purge them of the criminal element and put in 
decent lawabiding citizens frank keating general counsel of 
the department of housing and urban development said monday 
the problem is a shocking one that makes life miserable for 
the men women and children who live in public housing he said 
hud officials originally had planned to send us marshals to 
seize the leases under a 1988 federal asset forfeiture law and 
immediately evict the suspected drug dealers from public housing 
but a federal judge in richmond va late last week issued an 
order barring evictions except in exigent circumstances 
without giving the tenants prior notice and an opportunity for a 
hearing 
officials said they believe the order by us district judge 
richard l williams empowers marshals to immediately evict 
suspected drug dealers who have firearms or if there is fear the 
suspect might retaliate against neighbors for calling the police 
if there is firearms if there is a large amount of drugs like 
a kilo of coke they can be evicted said hud spokesman bob nipp 
the 1988 antidrug abuse act specifically authorizes the seizure 
of publichousing leases from suspected dealers if the apartment is 
used as a place to sell illegal drugs 
the same law empowers law enforcement officials to seize guns 
cars cash boats and other property of suspected drug dealers 
but civil libertarians argued that publichousing evictions 
without prior notice was unconstitutional 
legal aid attorneys in richmond obtained a preliminary 
injunction requiring such notification cary copeland head of the 
justice departments asset forfeiture program said government 
lawyers were studying the ruling to decide whether to file an 
appeal 
florence roisman a staff attorney for the national housing law 
project charged that hud was trying to shortcircuit dueprocess 
protections in the constitution 
a basic constitutional principle is that the government cant 
take things away from people without prior notice and a hearing 
she said 
law enforcement officials may be able to justify seizing 
transportable items like cash without notice to prevent its 
disappearance ms roisman said 
but the most concrete rooted unmovable thing is a piece of 
real estate its not going anyplace she said 
hud planned this week to seize between one and five apartments 
in each of the 19 targeted cities keating said 
originally there were to be seizures in 22 cities officials 
declined to describe changes made in the original list which was 
obtained by the associated press 
besides richmond the targets include housing projects in new 
york los angeles chicago atlanta washington baltimore dallas 
hartford conn newark nj indianapolis flint mich 
charleston sc macon ga kansas city mo el paso texas 
omaha neb portland ore and st louis 
the original list had also included chandler ariz tacoma

ali reza rezapurs blue eyes looked 
exhausted he had rescued his two sisters from the debris but lost 
his parents 
the 26yearold sales clerk said he believed that all of the 
100000 people who lived in this city 180 miles northwest of tehran 
when the earthquake struck thursday have been accounted for with 
some 6000 to 10000 dead 
relief specialists arent so sure but they realize they can no 
longer count on residents like rezapur to help them look 
they have been digging for three or four days said 
christian brauner of the german red cross they cant do any 
more 
down the street an old woman wrapped in a black chador or head 
covering rocked herself and wailed monday in the gateway of what 
had been her home 
her 10yearold granddaughter somaya reached out her hand to 
stop the woman from beating her chest 
i have lost everyone the grandmother cried nine of her 
family including two married daughters have been killed the 
remaining members of her family all still griefstricken gathered 
around her on the sidewalk 
among them was her 2yearold grandson who sat dazed in his 
fathers arms sucking on a pink pacifier his face like his 
fathers bore scabs from cuts sustained in the rubble before they 
were pulled out 
a helicopter flight over the rugged mountainous region near the 
caspian sea showed cities towns and villages that are little more 
than fields of rubble 
the pilot lamented that there was no way to reach all the remote 
villages in time to save trapped people landslides have closed the 
narrow roads to heavy equipment 
in rudbar virtually every building was severely damaged or 
destroyed 
latest estimates put the nationwide toll at 50000 dead 200000 
dead and a half million homeless 
rezapur said he survived the early morning quake because he was 
sleeping on the roof of his parents house 
when the earthquake started i didnt know what to do so i 
just prayed he said 
when the shaking stopped he stood up to go check on his family 
i took one step and fell through a hole he said i didnt 
realize the roof had collapsed 
he pointed far up the hillside to a gap in the houses to show 
where his home had been 
then i started digging as fast as i could to get my sisters 
out from under a wall that had fallen theyre fine now but my 
parents were in another room and i wasnt able to get to them for 
eight hours they were dead 
he said he also helped rescue four or five other people 
including his neighbors wife 
many of the people in the street crowded around visiting foreign 
reporters to say how much they appreciated the aid being sent from 
abroad 
the red cross brauner who is assessing the iranian reaction 
and needs said the country was coping remarkably well but still 
needs foreign help 
he said help from outside is important psychologically as well 
as physically there is nobody who hasnt lost a loved one they 
cant comfort each other

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan says aids activists who drowned out his speech at a 
conference over the weekend stepped over the line of legitimate 
protest 
ive been heckled before but ive never had the intensity 
that i heard there where the clear intent was not for the 
protesters to simply make a point but to prevent me from 
making a point he said 
and that is unamerican that is clearly antithetical to the 
basic principle we have in this country of free speech the 
secretary said in an interview monday evening 
sullivan dodged wads of paper and other objects thrown by 
several hundred protesters who shouted and blew whistles and air 
horns as he made the closing speech sunday to the sixth 
international conference on aids in san francisco 
their demonstration created a deafening roar that prevented 
about 6000 people attending the conference from hearing the 
secretarys nearly 20minute speech which he delivered in full 
they stepped over the line between what is appropriate or 
legitimate protest and what is inappropriate infringement upon my 
right or the right of anyone else to speak and be heard sullivan 
said 
the secretary said he knew his speech would be targeted by 
protesters who have criticized us immigration restrictions on 
people with aids and want the government to put more money into the 
battle against the deadly disease 
but he said he ignored advice from members of his staff to forgo 
the conference and went because i felt i had a responsibility to 
go and as a physician wanted to be to show support and concern 
its paradoxical and contradictory for them to state so 
explicitly they want evidence from the administration that it cares 
and is concerned and is trying to work with them and then once i 
go there not allow me to speak sullivan said 
aids activists led by members of the aids coalition to unleash 
power or act up staged demonstrations throughout the fiveday 
conference but not until sullivans speech did they disrupt the 
proceedings 
sullivan said the reason he persevered through the protest and 
completed his speech to make the point to those demonstrators 
that i will not be silenced on this issue and i will not be 
intimidated by their antics or those of any other extremist group 
arawn eibhlyn a member of san franciscos act up said in a 
telephone interview that sullivans anger over the protest is 
misplaced its time to stop talking and time to start saving 
peoples lives 
he was basically being an apologist for the bush 
administration eibhlyn said this administration has not shown 
any commitment to ending this epidemic its all pretty language 
empty words 
the text of sullivans speech that was distributed to the news 
media spoke of the need to find ways to work together to help 
people with aids and prevent spread of the disease 
he did not refer in the speech to the immigration issue that 
inflamed aids activists and prompted dozens of groups to boycott 
the conference in protest

many of last years accidental shooting deaths 
of children could have been prevented by use of a new gun lock that 
will be provided at cost to nonprofit groups a shotgun 
manufacturer says 
the deaths of 247 children aged 14 and under last year from 
accidents with firearms left around the house is a tough 
statistic said alan i mossberg president of of mossberg amp 
sons inc the nations largest producer of pumpaction shotguns 
cablelock which is threaded through a guns action to make it 
inoperable is produced by mossberg and has been included at no 
extra charge with the estimated 250000 mossberg shotguns sold 
since last october he said monday 
the lock can be used on about 80 percent of the estimated 200 
million handguns rifles and shotguns owned by americans mossberg 
said 
some 15000 locks have been sold separately since december said 
richard m pelton executive vice president of the company 
although the recommended retail price is 695 the locks will 
be available this year to nonprofit groups at the companys cost 
of 246 apiece to boost their use mossberg said he suggested 
that the groups could use them as a fundraising tool

an amtrak bill now devoid of the railroad 
antitakeover provision that president bush vetoed is being sent 
back to the white house 
the bill was approved monday by a voice vote first in the house 
and then in the senate 
the legislation caps federal subsidies for the governmentowned 
passenger railroad at 684 million in the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 and at 712 million in fiscal 1992 
in vetoing an earlier version bush said he accepted the 
spending figures but objected to a plan that would have required 
interstate commerce commission approval of railroad takeovers by 
nonrailroad companies 
the house voted to override bushs veto but the senate narrowly 
failed to get the needed twothirds majority to enact the bill over 
his objections 
because the presidents concerns have been addressed the 
current version of the bill is acceptable to the administration 
the white house said in a statement monday

the pentagon and congress have reached a 
compromise over a requirement that the department maintain some of 
the sr71 blackbird spy planes for use in a national crisis 
according to a letter 
the air force and congress agreed last year to terminate the top 
secret program opting instead for satellites that could provide 
the same intelligence information for less money 
but in report language accompanying a 4 billion spending bill 
president bush signed last month lawmakers called on the pentagon 
to maintain th aircraft by tail numbers so that flight 
operations could begin within 90 days of an emergency 
defense secretary dick cheney criticized the provision which 
though nonbinding would do serious damage to the relationship 
between congress and the pentagon if the department ignored it 
the air force and congressional committees negotiated a 
compromise that cheney detailed in a june 21 letter to sen robert 
c byrd dwva chairman of the senate appropriations committee 
we will place three sr71a aircraft and six associated 
reconnaissance sensors and electronic countermeasure suites into 
longterm storage as a hedge against a protracted conflict some 
time in the future cheney said in the letter released monday

language in a civil rights bill that would 
have allowed employers to move aids sufferers away from 
foodhandling jobs is being removed from a civil rights bill 
because it flies in the face of scientific evidence proponents 
say 
the action on monday came as representatives of the house and 
senate discussed changes made on the respective floors in the 
landmark civil rights legislation aimed at ensuring the rights of 
43 million disabled 
earlier this month the senate had accepted a houseadded 
provision placing the limit on work assignments of aids sufferers 
a move that was seen at the time as a major victory for sen jesse 
helms rnc 
but sponsors of the legislation including sen david 
durenberger rminn edward m kennedy dmass and thomas 
harkin diowa argued that no such restrictive language was 
necessary they said it could not be justified in view of existing 
scientific evidence indicating that the aids virus is not 
transmitted through such casual means as the preparation and 
handling of food 
kennedy said in a statement later that he was happy the 
conferees turned back the foodhandlers amendment 
this amendment flies in the face of all scientific and medical 
evidence and is a step backwards in our public understanding of and 
compassion for this nations aids crisis he said 
the senate by voice vote on june 6 had approved a nonbinding 
motion by helms to have the americans with disabilities act include 
an exemption that would allow employers to reassign infected 
workers from foodhandling jobs 
helms motion instructed senate negotiators to accept a 
houseadopted exemption when they worked out a final version of the 
bill 
but the socalled chapman amendment named for rep james 
chapman dtexas was deleted from the bill during mondays 
conference committee work 
harkin had said earlier that the amendment would codify 
ignorance about aids and how it is transmitted 
the house had approved the exemption 199187 last month before 
it finally passed the entire act 40320 the senate passed the bill 
768 last september 
the conference report is expected to go first to the senate 
possibly as early as wednesday and then to the house and sponsors 
said they expected final congressional passage before a fourth of 
july recess 
the house had adopted the amendment even though health and human 
services secretary louis w sullivan said it was unnecessary the 
white house had not spoken out against the amendment however 
although it specifically endorsed another unrelated change 
it was endorsed by the restaurant and foodservice industry as 
well as by the national federation of independent business a chief 
critic of the entire disabilities bill

before the decade is out youll be able to pull 
a telephone from your overcoat and make a call from anywhere on 
earth 
motorola inc announced plans today to build a satellitebased 
cellular phone system that would allow users of a portable 
25ounce phone to make and receive calls in regions where phone 
service is troublesome or unavailable 
current portable phones cannot be used in many areas because 
they rely on radio antennas atop buildings or towers being close 
enough to relay a signal 
motorolas iridium system under development since 1987 and 
expected to be fully operating by 1996 envisions a constellation 
of 77 satellites to relay calls motorola said it hopes to charge 
less than 3500 for each phone 
motorola the worlds largest maker of cellular phones is the 
first company to announce plans for such a system 
what we have done is put together a concept that allows for 
the first time personal communications to occur anywhere in the 
world said durrell w hillis general manager of motorolas 
satellite communication division 
john pemberton an analyst with the research firm gartner group 
of stamford conn said american telephone amp telegraph co is 
believed to be working on plans for a cellular system that would 
use two giant satellites 
the iridium system could be used in nations where conventional 
telephione service is poor such as in eastern europe hillis said 
iridium phone users could place a call directly to anyone with 
an iridium phone and their calls also could connect with a 
conventional landbased phone system 
the system will cost about 2 billion to develop and the cost 
will be shared by four or five partners that have not yet been 
chosen hillis said 
motorola said it has signed with three satellite operators to 
explore constructing the system 
the satellites would be 475 miles above the earth considered a 
low orbit that would ensure that each point on the earths surface 
would be in a continuous line of sight with a satellite 
iridium users would be given personal phone numbers and someone 
wanting to reach users would not need to know their location 
motorola said 
since iridium phones would be incompatible with conventional 
cellular systems a user probably would need to carry both types of 
phones to always be in contact hillis said he envisions the 
development of phones compatible with both systems 
motorola based in schaumburg ill has wide experience in 
satellite communications and has made communications equipment for 
every us space mission hillis said

a judge threw out a plea bargain as too generous 
and ordered a warehouse owner to stand trial for rigging a shotgun 
booby trap that killed a teenage intruder 
whats next punji sticks claymore mines bouncing betties 
district judge richard spriggs said monday 
a prosecutor and philip connaghans lawyer had reached an 
agreement under which the 24yearold from arvada would plead 
guilty to reckless manslaughter and violating the state boobytrap 
law 
in exchange he would have served no jail time and his record 
would have been wiped clean manslaughter carries up to eight years 
in prison while the other offense is punishable by a fine up to 
5000 and a year in jail 
but the judge tossed out the agreement and ordered a trial on 
the charges by dec 24 
the death of 19yearold michael mccomb is nonjustifiable 
and to me deferred judgment does not seem warranted spriggs 
said a booby trap is a deadly device without mercy or 
distinction brutally savage and inhumane 
district attorney norm early and defense attorney bob ransome 
had argued that connaghans warehouse had been repeatedly 
burglarized and that he had tried other means of thwarting burglars 
before setting the trap 
the booby trap killed mccomb when he broke in with three 
juveniles april 14 he died of a blast to the chest the juveniles 
were not hurt 
authorities said mccomb had burglarized the warehouse at least 
once before 
connaghan set two shotgun booby traps there after a breakin in 
january during another burglary in march one booby trap was 
tripped but malfunctioned 
he dismantled one of the traps but told authorities he forgot to 
disarm the other

fang lizhis departure for a safe haven in 
britain leaves china without a prominent dissident with the courage 
and stature to speak out against the government 
a year after tanks crushed the prodemocracy movement china has 
effectively silenced all open dissent through arrests intimidation 
and forced exile 
fang refrained from speaking out during his year of refuge in 
the us embassy in beijing but as long as he stayed in china 
outside the grasp of a government that sought to try him as an 
instigator of unrest he remained a symbol of resistance to 
political oppression 
now the 54yearold astrophysicist and his activist wife li 
shuxian join a growing list of dissidents who have escaped the 
country or been banished 
most have been frustrated by lack of funds poor organization 
and an inability to make their voices heard where it counts at 
home in china 
the decision to allow fang and his wife to leave the country 
came one week after china similarly dispatched another wellknown 
advocate of democratic reform taiwanese singer hou dejian 
hou who defected to the mainland from taiwan in 1983 played a 
key role in negotiating the evacuation of students from tiananmen 
square during the june 4 1989 military assault theat crushed the 
prodemocracy movement 
he hid in the australian embassy for two months before the 
chinese promised he would not be arrested emerging to become one 
of the few chinese willing to openly criticize the government 
hou and two other companions from tiananmen activists gao xin 
and zhou duo finally went too far when they tried to hold a news 
conference for foreign journalists on may 31 to call for the 
release of political prisoners all three disappeared hours before 
the news conference 
police released gao and zhou who had previously spent months in 
prison after the anniversary of the june 4 crackdown had passed 
but hou was taken out to sea put on a taiwanese fishing boat and 
returned to taiwan 
also monday china announced that another dissident arrested 
last summer wang xuezhi was being released from a canton prison 
and allowed to go abroad to rejoin his french wife 
china appears to have concluded that exiling dissenters such as 
fang and hou serves both to ease western criticism of chinas human 
rights record and diminish their ability to influence opinion at 
home 
those who left or escaped after the military crackdown people 
like student leader wuer kaixi political scientist yan jiaqi and 
entrepreneur wan runnan say they fear the world is gradually 
losing interest in china 
liu binyan a journalist and maker of film documentaries who has 
been living in exile in the united states for two years said in a 
recent interview that he longs to return home but thinks he might 
face arrest 
this is a very important time in china he said i want to 
go back and experience everything myself even if i cant write 
about it 
those released from prison in recent months as china seeks to 
improve its image abroad have sought the safety of silence almost 
all under police orders have avoided political activities and 
stayed away from foreign reporters 
coming back home was like a dream said journalist dai qing 
when she was freed in may after being imprisoned for 10 months 
but dai one of the free spirits of chinas tightly controlled 
mass media said she could say no more speaking to a foreign 
reporter without permission would mean a return to prison

liberian rebel forces have broken 
off peace talks with the government and are threatening to attack 
the capital of monrovia a top rebel spokesman says 
the national patriotic front withdrew monday from peace talks in 
freetown sierra leone after liberian president samuel doe failed 
to meet rebel demands said thomas woewiyu chief negotiator for 
the rebels 
president doe has provided no satisfactory response to our 
demands and we see no reason to go to freetown woewiyu said in a 
telephone interview 
the rebel forces led by a former doe official charles taylor 
will continue their offensive against monrovia woewiyu said 
rebel soldiers have moved to within 15 miles of the capital and 
taylor has said he could capture this capital city of 400000 
residents in 12 hours 
in monrovia doe was to have made a televised speech to the 
nation monday evening announcing further concessions to the rebels 
but officials said doe canceled the broadcast apparently after 
hearing the rebels would not attend the talks unless he resigned 
doe has made several concessions to rebel demands in recent 
days including legalizing opposition parties granting amnesty to 
government opponents and dropping embezzlement charges against 
taylor 
taylor who once headed liberias general services 
administration under doe was charged with embezzling 1 million 
from the government and fled to the united states in 1983 he was 
to be extradited to liberia when he escaped and made his way back 
to africa 
taylor launched the insurgency from neighboring ivory coast last 
december and his forces now control most of the country taylor has 
demanded that doe step down or face an assault on the capital doe 
came to power in a violent 1980 coup

r gene simmons who murdered 14 relatives 
and two other people in a christmastime 1987 rampage was put to 
death by injection after refusing all appeals and pleading for a 
swift execution 
simmons 49 was pronounced dead at 919 pm after a brief 
statement justice delayed finally be done is justifiable 
homicide 
in texas james smith 37yearold former taxi driver and 
tarotcard reader who killed a houston businessman man in 1983 was 
executed by injection at 1231 am today he too had refused all 
appeals 
i go to my death without begging for my life he said in a 
statement i will not humiliate myself i will let no man break 
me 
the two executions brought to 132 the number of people put to 
death since the us supreme court in 1976 allowed states to resume 
use of capital punishment 
the execution of simmons was the second in arkansas in a week 
the june 18 electrocution of john edward swindler was the states 
first execution in 26 years 
unlike swindler simmons was convicted after the states method 
of execution was changed to lethal injection 
simmons shot clubbed shot at or strangled 21 people 16 of 
whom died the dead included his wife becky four of his 
daughters three of his sons and four of his grandchildren eight 
victims were children ages 1 to 17 
the killings were believed to have occurred between dec 22 and 
dec 28 1987 
after his first conviction simmons said he would not appeal and 
asked that no one interfere i only ask for what i deserve he 
told the court let the torture and suffering in me end please 
allow me the right to be at peace 
death penalty foes intervened and delayed simmons execution for 
about two years 
simmons went to his death without giving a motive for the 
slayings when he was arrested at the end of the killing spree he 
reportedly told a woman he had held hostage its all over now 
ive gotten everybody who wanted to hurt me 
in texas smith was put to death in huntsville for the slaying 
of larry rohus he winked smiled to reporters and muttered hare 
krishna as he was injected 
he denied being a killer and said that when people wake up to 
the reality of executions the price to be paid will be a dear one 
witnesses said smith showed up at rohus insurance office and 
demanded money when rohus 44 complied and began walking away 
smith summoned him back then shot him through the heart as rohus 
begged for his life 
smith came within six hours of dying in 1988 before death 
penalty opponents persuaded his mother to seek legal help to save 
her son the us supreme court stayed the execution 
however in a recent ruling in an arkansas case the high court 
said that inmates have the right to refuse appeals and may 
volunteer to be put to death 
smiths mother alexine hamilton failed again last weekend to 
delay her sons death when a texas appeals court and a federal 
judge rejected arguments that smith is incompetent to decide 
whether he should die 
smith said last week that he wants to die because dogooders 
already have robbed him of time in the next world 
after all this unnecessary suffering and abuse here on death 
row im not going to change my mind smith said 
on monday smith was reevaluated by a psychiatrist and 
pronounced competent assistant texas attorney general bob walt 
said

reform judaism the most liberal of the 
religions three main branches broke with 4000 years of jewish 
tradition and voted to accept gay and lesbian rabbis but it 
stopped short of endorsing homosexual unions 
the decision monday by the 1550member central conference of 
american rabbis makes reform judaism the biggest religious group to 
officially recognize homosexual clergy the decision applies in the 
united states and canada 
participants said reform judaism already has rabbis who are 
homosexual and that the vote merely recognizes reality 
its a breakthrough for our reform movement said rabbi yoel 
kahn of shaar zahav in san francisco a primarily homosexual 
congregation 
it is certainly a breakthrough for gay and lesbian jews and i 
think its an important step for religious liberalism in this 
country 
there are about 15 million reform jews worldwide including 
about 13 million in the united states 
the voice vote came after 45 minutes of debate at the 
conferences 101st annual convention attended by about 500 rabbis 
a 17member committee studied the issue four years before issuing a 
report endorsing gay and lesbian rabbis 
jewish law embodied in the torah and other texts condemns 
homosexuality as an abomination 
but out of concern for human dignity one is permitted to 
violate the prohibitions of torah said rabbi samuel karff of 
houston conference president and a member of the committee 
the committees minority inserted a statement affirming that 
homosexual unions can fulfill a jews religious duty to create a 
traditional jewish home but the report states that heterosexual 
marriage remains the jewish ideal 
in reform judaism many jews do not observe traditional dietary 
laws or cover their heads in prayer these among key differences 
with conservative and orthodox jews 
the union of american hebrew congregations which represents 
reform jewish congregations overwhelmingly endorsed homosexual 
rabbis last fall 
in 1972 reform judaism became the first major branch to ordain 
women rabbis 
some reform rabbis said they will push for greater acceptance of 
homosexuality in their congregations more traditional rabbis said 
reform judaism has gone far enough and they are not comfortable 
endorsing gay role models 
i am not here to state that homosexuality is a sin but 
that there are individuals who are not appropriate as rabbis 
said rabbi philip bregman of temple shalom in vancouver british 
columbia 
its a first step im hoping well be able to do more 
education to build a foundation of more support and education about 
gay and lesbian jews and rabbis said rabbi denise eger lesbian 
leader of beth chayim chadashim a primarily homosexual 
congregation in los angeles 
in its report the conference recognized that many congregations 
might find themselves unable to accept gay or lesbian rabbis the 
conference helps place rabbis in congregations but congregations 
can dismiss them 
we do not encourage our gay and lesbian colleagues to come out 
of the closet because we cannot protect them karff said 
the conservative jewish movement has had women rabbis since 1985 
but does not openly accept homosexual rabbis orthodox judaism 
opposes ordination of women or homosexuals as forbidden by jewish 
law 
judaisms smaller reconstructionist movement and the unitarian 
universalist church openly accept homosexual clergy and some other 
christian denominations approve ordination of homosexuals if they 
remain celibate

former ku klux klan leader david dukes 
bill to ban affirmative action has been bottled up by a state 
senate committee 
the finance committee voted 62 monday to sit on the republican 
representatives bill apparently killing it for this session 
which ends july 9 the house overwhelmingly approved the measure 
earlier this month 
black legislators have called the bill racist duke a former 
kkk grand wizard elected from the new orleans suburb of metairie 
has said it merely prohibits discrimination in favor or against 
anyone on the basis of race 
sen je jumonville a democrat said the bill does nothing 
because it is superseded by federal laws that allow affirmative 
action 
i know you are a candidate for the us senate and this makes 
good political hay said jumonville but are we really doing 
anything i think its window dressing 
duke said after the hearing that opponents pulled a dirty 
political trick by sending my bill to the finance committee there 
are no republicans on this committee 
duke is running for the senate as a maverick member of the 
party the gop chose state sen ben bagert to oppose us sen

prime minister yitzhak shamir said today that 
israels policy on soviet jews does not forbid them from settling 
in the occupied territories 
the statement came two days after housing minister ariel sharon 
suggested that israel did not intend to settle soviet jews in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the immigration wave of soviet jews projected to total up to 
150000 this year has raised fears among arabs that many would 
move to the occupied territories forcing out palestinians 
the united states the soviet union and european countries have 
all called on israels new rightwing government to state 
unequivocally that it will not settle soviet jews in the 
territories 
sharon a champion of jewish settlements in the occupied 
territories caught many observers by surprise sunday when he said 
israel would not move the immigrants beyond the green line a 
reference to israels pre1967 borders the west bank and gaza were 
seized in that years middle east war 
however shamir said this did not represent a change in the 
previous policy under which israel would not encourage settlers to 
move to the territories but would not prevent them from doing so 
either 
the israeli government doesnt have any policy to convince the 
new immigrants to go here or there he said on israel radio 
of course he sharon said that nobody will be sent by us to 
certain territories and to certain locations he said but 
everybody in a democratic country has the right to settle wherever 
he wishes 
the radio report said shamirs comments were meant to clarify 
those of sharon 
the hebrew daily newspaper maariv also quoted shamir as saying 
that sharons statement did not apply to arab east jerusalem which 
was annexed by israel after its capture in the 1967 war 
shamirs rightwing likud bloc favors retaining the occupied 
territories considering them part of the historic land of 
israel 
israeli officials have said only about 300 of the more than 
50000 soviet immigrants arriving since april 1989 have moved to 
the west bank and gaza an estimated 3400 to 4500 moved into arab 
east jerusalem 
after sharons statement sunday an aide to shamir said monday 
that the prime minister had previously sent messages to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev and european leaders offering 
assurances that israel does not have a policy of settling soviet 
jews in the territories 
however neither sharon nor shamir stated that israel would 
block the new immigrants from joining the 70000 jews living in the 
130 settlements that have been built in the territories since 1967 
the state department responded to sharons statement with a 
cautious welcome in view of its vagueness 
department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said it was a step in 
the right direction but then added we have seen various 
reports and we dont yet have a detailed analysis 
washington opposes the settlements in the territories since us 
policy calls for at least part of the occupied land to be returned 
in exchange for peace with palestinians and the arab states 
the united states also has threatened to hold up 4 million in 
loan guarantees to build housing for the soviet immigrants unless 
it is assured us funds will not go to settling the immigrants in 
the territories 
shamir also said in messages to european leaders sent last week 
before the european community summit in dublin that his government 
wanted to reinstitute the middle east peace process 
the prime minister introduced a peace initiative while on a 
visit to washington in april 1989 that proposed holding elections 
in the territories as a step toward limited autonomy for the 17 
million palestinian residents 
however the proposal has been stalled by palestinian demands 
that the peace process eventually lead to an independent 
palestinian state israel opposes creation of a palestinian state 
further delay has come from resistance by shamirs government to 
us proposals to hold a palestinianisraeli dialogue in cairo to 
discuss the election plan

cars conked out tempers flared and air 
conditioners taxed power supplies as the city hit an alltime high 
of 120 degrees 
the national weather service predicted the extreme heat will 
last through the middle of the week 
the temperature monday was the highest ever recorded in phoenix 
beating the old mark of 118 equaled as recently as july 4 1989 
tucson reached 113 degrees one degree shy of that citys alltime 
high 
hot weather plagued other parts of arizona including highs of 
118 in yuma 102 in prescott 94 in flagstaff and 92 at the grand 
canyons south rim 
some elderly people suffered heat exhaustion said steve jensen 
a fire department spokesman we probably had a few more 
heatrelated calls but nothing major he said 
the citys two largest power suppliers urged customers to 
conserve and put on extra generators to handle the demand 
the arizona automobile associations main office in phoenix said 
it took at least 1500 service calls up from a usual 900 to 1000 
most of the additional calls were from motorists whose vehicles 
overheated or had dead batteries 
roger austin a police officer in tempe said police used 
trained volunteers to respond to some calls of stranded vehicles 
freeing officers to answer domestic violence calls partly generated 
by the heat 
business is up he said being stranded in the heat can be 
very dangerous especially if you have small children or animals 
traveling with you these are high priority calls for us 
jim hight a psychologist at camelback hospital in phoenix 
advised people with low tolerance to heat to stay inside 
problems that seem runofthe mill in the months of january 
and february may seem a lot more complex and more difficult to 
handle come june or july he said

outside the downtown hotel where nelson and 
winnie mandela are staying crowds chanted mandela 
mandela nearby debora cates of st louis and her companions 
shrieked oh no hes here again 
cates kim lingo and bernice gum this week are learning the 
drawbacks of vacationing in the nations capital while theres a 
famous person around 
streets get blocked for security and for motorcades traffic 
grinds to a halt pedestrians get detoured blocks out of their way 
life gets well disrupted when bigwig visitors come to town 
it happened again today when mandela took a 40minute walk 
through the heart of downtown and into a residential neighborhood 
during early rushhour traffic 
mandela wearing a new york yankees warmup jacket and cap was 
surrounded by about 50 police and other security officers as he 
left his hotel and walked about two miles waving to surprised 
onlookers 
traffic quickly backed up when mandela walked down the middle of 
a busy business street police ordered pedestrians to keep their 
hands in sight as he passed by 
washingtonians are pretty used to it but it can be 
discombobulating for the millions of tourists who visit here each 
year 
hes really cramping our style that man its like oh no 
hes here again joked cates a 30yearold airline worker who 
was resting from a tour at a smithsonian museum monday 
there have been a lot of motorcades the african national 
congress leader stayed put after he got to his hotel sunday 
afternoon but streets were closed off when his wife winnie later 
walked to a nearby church to address a program honoring south 
african women 
on monday the couple crisscrossed the city traveling first to 
the white house for meetings with president bush then down to the 
state department over to the aflcio and up to capitol hill for 
dinner 
cates and company first encountered the mandela entourage sunday 
when their tour bus sat helpless in traffic on monday with 
washington back at work downtown traffic was so jammed they gave 
up and walked several blocks to their hotel 
not every tourist was disgruntled about the disruption mandelas 
visit caused some didnt know he was in town and some had no idea 
who he was 
i dont know what hes all about to tell you the truth 
said jerry gwyn of mooresville nc who was trying to find his 
way to arlington cemetery we learned of his visit last night on 
television 
olidia thomas and jovita davis of ypsilanti mich also were 
irritated by the stalled traffic and blocked streets that made it 
difficult to get to the popular tourist sites

good cause he needs to promote the need for support and to be more 
visible 
because mandela is right here we cant go into the white 
house joked bart stuurman 19 of the netherlands in fact the 
white house is closed to tourists every monday 
stuurman is part of a lions club international youth camp 
touring the south this summer 
a companion alex elizondo 18 of monterrey mexico said i 
dont know him i dont know anything about him but then stared 
in disbelief when another friend pedro ulovecio 19 explained in 
rapid spanish that mandela had spent 27 years in prison for the 
freedom of his country 
thats nice elizondo said 
hal walls of oklahoma city said i havent put a whole lot of 
thought into the mandela visit but there must be progress with

the interior minister said today that 99 
percent of the victims from a devastating earthquake have been 
counted but a red cross official said the death toll could reach 
70000 
officials say at least 50000 people have been killed 200000 
injured and half a million rendered homeless from thursdays quake 
in northern iran 
boneweary rescuers are losing hope of finding more survivors in 
the rubble of nearly 350 earthquakeflattened cities and towns but 
some took heart when a 1yearold girl was found alive in her 
bedroom four days after the quake 
foreign aid continued to pour into the capital tehran more 
than 130 planes carrying relief supplies medical volunteers and 
financial contributions have arrived since sunday 
much of the help comes from countries including the united 
states that iran considers sworn enemies 
interior minister abdullah nouri said 99 percent of the bodies 
of quake victims have been recovered but said there was still no 
definitive casualty count 
christian brauner a relief worker with the west german red 
cross said the death toll could reach as high as 60000 to 70000 
nouri who is in charge of relief operations thanked the 
hundreds of foreign relief workers saying their presence was 
useful some iranian hardliners have opposed the presence of 
western rescuers 
french and iranian rescue teams said an iranian team from the 
red crescent the islamic version of the red cross found the 
1yearold girl alive in the familys wrecked home in the mountain 
village of kelishom 30 miles east of manjil they had believed she 
was dead and were digging into the rubble of what had been a 
bedroom believing they would find her body 
manjil on the border between the stricken provinces of zanjan 
and gilan was virtually destroyed it lies in the heart of the 
quake zone about 125 miles northwest of tehran 
col gholamreza gohari head of police in gilan province said 
as many as 7000 people had died in rudbar a nearby town of 
100000 
brauner said that since large extended families live together 
the wreckage of even a small home can yield a horrifying number of 
dead 
he said in one village he visited he was told twothirds of the 
3000 residents were dead 
brauner said residents soon would need a new water system and 
insulated trailers instead of tents they will have a hard and 
cold winter he said 
the quake region has been jolted by about 360 aftershocks since 
thursdays jolt some measuring up to 6 on the richter scale 
tehran universitys geophysics center said the main quake measured 
between 73 and 77 
for survivors the aftershocks are a constant terrifying 
reminder of the quake for rescuers they have foiled desperate 
efforts to pluck life from the devastation 
a french rescue team related the story of one such nearrescue 
the team using sound detectors picked up the sound of a knock on 
sunday morning they quickly set to work removing debris piled 
several yards deep 
but then a strong aftershock struck sending dirt and debris 
cascading back into the excavated area 
when the team was able to resume digging the knocking had 
stopped said the team leader andre laska they found a woman dead 
in what had once been a closet in her home 
we were really really sad rescuer francis piat said he 
said that was the closest his team had come to finding someone 
alive under the rubble 
a team from the soviet armenian city of spitak destroyed by the 
december 1988 earthquake that killed about 25000 people said they 
had found no one alive in the wreckage of manjil but they said 
they would keep searching 
in armenia a year and a half ago the whole world helped our 
people said movses poghossian the teams head right now we 
are here to do the same work 
fatimah sadagriyen a 55yearold rudbar woman wept as she 
described the loss of 14 family members she had no tools with 
which to dig out her shop and nowhere to sleep 
i have not seen a relief team she said her eyes welling 
with tears i have nothing nothing 
most foreign rescue workers said the red crescent was managing 
to get tents for the homeless even to remote villages but probably 
not enough of them 
some foreign workers said the iranians had balked at letting 
them into the quake zone 
they only want materials they dont want people said 
valerie trouot a 26yearold french doctor of emergency medicine 
they dont want westerners to see how the country is 
but the first deputy foreign minister mohammed besharati said 
foreign doctors had been welcomed

the vatican said today that open dissent 
cannot be tolerated and ordered theologians to refrain from 
publicly challenging church teaching 
a major document issued by the congregation for the doctrine of 
the faith replied in strong terms to western theologians who have 
questioned the roman catholic church ban on artificial birth 
control papal authority and other issues 
to succumb to the temptation of dissent is to allow the 
leaven of infidelity to the holy spirit to start to work said 
the report approved by pope john paul ii 
the document defended punitive action taken against dissidents 
and said theologians must adhere to doctrine whether it is 
infallible or not it rejected the notion that the church should 
leave moral and sexual matters to personal choice or conscience 
it warned dissenters against making their complaints in the 
media or trying to influence public opinion 
last year 170 germanspeaking theology professors issued a 
widely publicized statement criticizing the pope for his opposition 
to contraception and his exercise of power 
west german cardinal josef ratzinger head of the congregation 
told a news conference that the vatican document was not a direct 
response to the german declaration but addressed the general 
climate of conflict fomented by dissident theologians 
during john pauls 11year papacy several theologians have been 
punished for straying from church positions on birth control and 
other issues of sexual morality they include the rev charles e 
curran who was stripped of his right to teach theology at catholic 
university in washington dc in 1987 
the 28page document called instruction on the ecclesial 
vocation of the theologian was written by ratzinger a strict 
doctrinal conservative and the popes guardian of orthodoxy 
in a blunt appraisal of the situation the document said 
theology is sometimes exposed to risks and moments of crisis and 
tension open dissent by theologians has caused serious harm 
to the church it said 
the document said theologians might in some cases question the 
timeliness the form or even the contents of some church 
teaching in such an event they should try to resolve the 
differences in dialogue with bishops it said 
however if in the end a theologian still can not accept the 
teaching he should keep quiet it said 
such a situation can certainly prove a difficult trial the 
document said it can be a call to suffer for the truth in 
silence and prayer but with the certainty that if the truth 
really is at stake it will ultimately prevail 
ratzingers report said the church cannot be run like a 
democracy a position voiced by the pope on several occasions 
standards of conduct appropriate to civil society or the 
workings of a democracy cannot be purely and simply applied to the 
church it said

poverty illiteracy malnutrition and 
forced labor have robbed many of the boys and girls in indias 
capital of their childhood according to a united nations report 
issued today 
why should we call them children asked the unicef report 
titled the invisible child these children are grownups 
these children are old 
citing statistics on child labor health care infant mortality 
and education the report describes a life of grinding work and 
abuse for a child in new delhis slums 
it also highlights the plight of indias urban poor often 
forgotten in this largely agricultural nation of 880 million people 
more than half of new delhis 8 million people inhabit the 
shantytowns squatters huts and slums of this sprawling metropolis 
while the average per capita income in the city is about 410 in 
the slums the people make onetenth that amount the report said 
according to the report more than 500000 children 80 percent 
of them illiterate and many underfed are forced to work in new 
delhi 
about 40000 work as laborers 20000 in car repair shops 
30000 in restaurants and 30000 as shop assistants the report 
said tens of thousands more work in oneroom factories where labor 
safety regulations are not enforced others scratch by as rag 
pickers shoe shine boys newspaper sellers and porters 
child labor is only outlawed in india for certain hazardous 
jobs many of the children are bonded labor latterday slaves the 
report said the pervasiveness of such servitude makes it difficult 
to wipe out 
the children have to put up with long working hours eight to 
12 hours a day the unicef report said they face verbal 
physical and sexual abuse from most people who deal with them 
the necessity of work makes going to school impossible the 
report said a survey of parents in the slums indicated that less 
than 5 percent wanted their children to stop working they just 
wanted labor conditions to improve 
girls usually face the worst treatment the study said citing 
longstanding beliefs that girls are less valuable and provide less 
income to the family than boys 
girls are yanked from school faster than boys fed less and 
forced into wedlock early the report said 
i work like a machine says parvati a 13yearold girl

people and just one household in every 156 has access to potable 
water the report said

english soccer fans went on a 
bottlethrowing windowsmashing rampage in this seaside resort 
early today that left at least 20 people injured and resulted in 
246 arrests officials said 
the clashes were the worst incident involving english fans 
since the world cup soccer tournament began in early june a 
british embassy spokeswoman kay coombs said 
she said police were expelling the arrested fans today 
one italian newspaper called the fighting between the british 
fans and italian police true urban guerrilla warfare 
fan violence five years ago led to a ban on english soccer clubs 
from european club tournaments and soccer authorities have said 
british fans behavior at world cup matches would help determine 
whether to lift that ban 
ms coombs said the violence broke out when italian fans were 
celebrating italys 20 victory over uruguay in a world cup match 
monday night 
some english fans drinking in a bar started throwing bottles at 
the italians ms coombs told reporters in bologna 60 miles 
inland where england was to play a world cup match today against 
belgium 
batonwielding police stepped in and the fighting engulfed 
downtown rimini and spilled over onto its waterfront and beaches 
before police managed to restore order 
officials said 20 people were treated in hospitals dozens of 
shop windows were smashed and many parked cars damaged 
police chief lorenzo donofrio said the detained english fans 
would be sent home as soon as a judge signed a deportation order 
the embassy spokeswoman said they would probably be flown back to 
britain on an airliner chartered by the italian government 
il resto del carlino a bologna newspaper said the scene in 
rimini was one of true urban guerrilla warfare it said police 
fired shots into the air in an effort to disperse the rowdy fans 
about 4000 italian police and carabinieri or paramilitary 
police were on duty for todays match in bologna alcohol sales 
were banned 
a bologna police spokeswoman said the authorities would try to 
keep the english and belgian fans separated inside the stadium but 
she said it will be very very difficult because the tickets 
were not sold in blocs by nationality 
english clubs were banned from european club tournaments after 
the 1985 heysel stadium riots in brussels in which 39 fans most 
of them italians were killed at the european cup of champions 
final between liverpool and juventus of turin 
fourteen british fans were sentenced in 1989 to threeyear 
prison terms for their role in the riots today a belgian appelate 
court raised the sentences of 11 fans up to five years upheld the 
threeyear terms for two fans and acquitted one person 
the original sentences were appealed by both the prosecution and 
defense 
the european soccer federation has said it wants english clubs 
to rejoin the annual tournaments but that final approval would 
depend on how english fans behaved at the world cup

the mayor of miami and four other cubanamerican 
mayors in surrounding dade county have denounced nelson mandela for 
failing to condemn human rights violations in cuba 
the rebuke which angered black leaders came in a statement 
issued monday two days before the south african antiapartheid 
leaders scheduled wednesday evening arrival in miami on thursday 
mandela is scheduled to address delegates of the american 
federation of state county and municipal employees at the miami 
beach covention center 
mayors xavier suarez of miami julio martinez of hialeah pedro 
reboredo of west miami jose rivero of sweetwater and gilda 
oliveros of hialeah gardens signed the declaration condemning 
mandelas support for cuban president fidel casto 
we cuban americans find it beyond reasonable comprehension 
that mr nelson mandela a victim of oppression by his own 
government not only fails to condemn the cuban government for its 
human rights violations but rather praises virtues of the 
tyrannical castro regime the five mayors said 
last week mandela defended his support for castro palestine 
liberation organization leader yasser arafat and libyan leader 
moammar gadhafi in a nationally televised interview 
while the mayors note also congratulated mandela on his newly 
acquired freedom it angered leaders of miamis black community 
they already were upset that suarez and one other miami city 
commissioner withdrew their support for a june 7 city commission 
resolution honoring mandela as a champion of human rights in his 
country 
johnnie mcmillian miamidade chapter president of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people called the lack 
of a warm welcome for mandela in miami a slap in the face to 
the citys black community

government officials and educators in the 
middle east have urged a california parole board to release sen 
robert f kennedys assassin from prison his attorney said 
the lawyer luke mckissack said monday the officials suggested 
in a petition that sirhan b sirhans release could speed peace in 
the middle east 
in the interest of the peace process its time to let him 
out mckissack said in a telephone interview before leaving for 
the state prison at soledad where sirhan was to appear at a parole 
hearing scheduled for today 
sirhan now 46 was convicted of gunning down the senator in the 
pantry of los angeles ambassador hotel on june 5 1968 minutes 
after kennedy won californias democratic presidential primary 
he was originally sentenced to death but the sentence was 
changed to life in prison with possibility of parole after 
californias death penalty law was overturned in 1972 he has been 
turned down for parole 10 times since 1975 
mckissack said the latest petition was the result of two trips 
he made recently to the middle east to seek support for sirhans 
parole 
los angeles deputy district attorney larry trapp said he was 
surprised at mckissacks move 
it would suggest that sirhan should have some place in making 
political decisions or influencing political decisions trapp 
said noting that sirhan was convicted of an assassination for 
political purposes 
the petition was signed by about 40 people including two 
members of israels parliament the mayor of bethlehem on the 
israelioccupied west bank members of the arab womens union and 
officials of bir zeit university a west bank palestinian school 
the two parliament members are mohammed miari of the progessive 
list for peace and abdel wahab daroushe of the arab democratic 
party both parties in opposition to the shamir government 
the petition bears the official seals of the university and 
other organizations supporting the release 
we of israel and palestine are concerned that inmate sirhan 
sirhan be given equal treatment under the law the document said 
it concerns us that after 22 years of considerable confinement 
and isolation he is repeatedly denied parole while other convicted 
murderers many more dangerous than he are released after serving 
much less time the petition said 
sirhan sirhan as a palestinian has suffered much as have 
both of the peoples of this land if peace is ever to come to our 
land recognition of the sufferings of both must be given it 
said sirhans equitable release will give him the chance to 
contribute to a process that will lead to a just and comprehensive 
peace in our region 
mckissack said he traveled at his own expense to sirhans native 
jordan as well as israel and kuwait in search of support and 
understanding for his client

some of the drugs sent to soviet armenia for 
victims of the 1988 earthquake were useless or even dangerous 
experts say and they warn of similar problems with emergency 
supplies now being sent to iran 
the armenian shipments included pharmaceuticals that came from 
stocks of expired drugs and others of a type no longer sold 
according to an article in the respected british medical journal 
the lancet 
we know exactly the same problems are happening now in iran 
said dr philippe autier an epidemiologist and researcher in 
public health for the brusselsbased european association for 
health and development 
autier wrote the report in the june 9 issue of the lancet with 
members of doctors without borders a french humanitarian group 
and the soviet armenian ministry of health 
the quantities of expired and useless drugs are especially 
worrying it said the supply of massive amounts of drugs for 
the purpose of humanitarian aid still represents a good way of 
disposing of stocks of expired drugs or of those that are normally 
no longer marketable 
in a telephone interview monday autier said people feel 
forced to do something immediately when confronted with the 
suffering from natural disasters 
adam kellettlong a spokesman for the british red cross said 
his organization was sending its first shipment of drugs to iran 
today after receiving a list of needed medication and supplies from 
iran his organization only has sent drugs that are requested 
iranian officials said that more than 130 planes had arrived 
since sunday carrying supplies and medicines 
unlike armenia iran is much more controlled the iranian red 
crescent has been very strict on what it will accept but of course 
there are a lot of other groups and countries involved which may 
not be taking the same care 
after the armenian earthquake on dec 7 1988 which killed 
25000 people international relief agencies and governments rushed 
in 5000 tons of drugs consumable medical supplies and other 
equipment the report said 
medical workers needed injectable painkillers like morphine 
antibiotics anesthetics intravenous fluids syringes and needles 
the same supplies now needed in iran 
drugs worth about 55 million were sent to armenia but only 
about 30 percent of them were available when they were most needed 
because they arrived unsorted and were impossible to identify the 
lancet report said 
none of the boxes was labeled in armenian and few in russian it 
said in 24 warehouses in the armenian capital of yerevan 238 
kinds of antibiotics were labeled in 21 languages it said 
in spitak the most badly affected area pharmacists wasted 
about twothirds of their time merely looking for and identifying 
useful drugs among the relief parcels the report said 
autier said experts know that only 30 to 40 types of medicines 
are commonly needed in most earthquake relief efforts 
about 11 percent of the drugs were useless including nasal 
spray and drugs for treating tropical diseases such as malaria and 
bilharzia it said 
eight percent of the drugs had expired by the time they arrived 
the report said some of these drugs such as tetracycline were 
potentially dangerous 
for a year following the catastrophe the armenian ministry 
worked with doctors without borders making an inventory of the 
drugs 
by the end of their work about 21 percent of the drugs were set 
to expire or already had expired 
an incinerator had to be sent to the region because old 
pharmaceuticals should be burned in temperatures above 2200 
degrees farenheit and burying them or burning them in the open 
would be environmentally hazardous the report said

a new environmental protection agency study 
says secondhand tobacco smoke is a human carcinogen causing about 
3800 lung cancer deaths annually among nonsmokers 
the study which is in draft form and has not been evaluated by 
epas independent science advisers was quickly criticized by a 
tobacco industry trade association 
a statement from the the tobacco institute said an analysis by 
the epas science advisory board is likely to significantly 
undermine the very basis of this draft 
the study prepared by the epas office of research and 
development said an evaluation of studies about environmental 
tobacco smoke which originates from burning cigarettes shows that 
it causes cancer among nonsmokers 
this conclusion the study said is based on a total weight of 
evidence 
the evidence includes what the report calls detectable 
association at environmental exposure levels between cancer and 
nonsmoking family members who live with a smoker 
within the population of women who are lifelong nonsmokers 
the study said the excess lung cancer risk of those married to a 
smoker is large enough to be observed 
twentyfour studies from eight countries provide no other 
broadly applicable explanation for the association between 
environmental tobacco smoke and lung cancer among nonsmokers the 
report said 
although only 30 percent of the adult population smokes the 
study said there are detectable levels of cotinine a metabolic 
product of nicotine detected in the blood saliva and urine of 50 
percent to 75 percent of nonsmokers tested 
the estimate of 3800 lung cancer deaths annually among 
nonsmokers the study said includes approximately 1750 females 
who have never smoked 800 males who have never smoked and 1250 
former smokers of both sexes 
about 130000 people will die of lung cancer every year about 
85 percent of which is caused by smoking directly smoking causes 
an estimated 390000 premature deaths a year when emphysema and 
cardiovascular deaths are added to the lung cancer total according 
to government estimates 
the epa report said studies also have linked cigarette smoking 
in the home with increased respiratory disorders among children 
particularly infants 
the cumulative evidence indicates strongly that parental 
especially the mothers smoking is associated with increased 
incidence of respiratory illnesses in the first one to two years of 
life the study said recent studies also solidify the evidence 
of a link between parental smoking and increased middle ear disease 
in young children 
the tobacco institute said the epa draft report has technical 
problems and inadequacies and suffers from the lack of 
scientific support 
the statistical manipulations represented by the epa draft 
risk assessment constitute at the very best speculation without 
an adequate scientific foundation the tobacco institute 
statement said

west germany today unveiled proposals 
for full unification by middecember after joint elections 
the plan was made public just five days before the two countries 
are to merge their economies and social institutions a move that 
effectively marks the end of four decades of socialism in east 
germany 
according to a discussion paper released by the interior 
ministry unification would become effective the day after united 
german elections proposed for either dec 9 or dec 16 
west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he 
expected the east german cabinet to begin discussing the proposed 
elements of the treaty on political unification on wednesday in 
east berlin 
the treaty for the accession of east germany its joining with 
the west should be taken up by both german parliaments by early 
september he added 
the parliaments of both countries last week ratified an initial 
treaty outlining the monetary economic and social union that is to 
take effect sunday when the west german mark replaces the nearly 
worthless east german mark 
the victors and vanquished from world war ii are still working 
on the international ramifications of german unity namely the 
military posture of a united germany and what to do about the 
380000 soviet troops on east german soil 
west germany is a member of the western nato alliance and the 
allies have insisted a united germany remain in nato the soviets 
have so far rejected that idea east germany has been the most 
strategically important member of the sovietled warsaw pact as 
the first line of defense against the west 
bonn wants to limit the political treaty to only those laws and 
regulations that differ between east and west germany and are 
necessary for political unification 
according to the discussion paper issues which could be left 
unresolved before unification include the differing abortion laws 
a highly controversial issue 
in west germany a woman must prove medical necessity or 
financial hardship to have an abortion in east germany abortions 
are free on demand in the first trimester

lithuanian president vytautas 
landsbergis met with mikhail s gorbachev at the kremlin today 
then returned to his republic as its parliament prepared to debate 
a moratorium on independence 
gorbachev invited vytautas landsbergis to the unannounced 
meeting apparently to discuss gorbachevs proposal that the 
lithuanian parliament pass a moratorium on its march 11 
declaration said haris subacius a spokesman in the lithuanian 
supreme council parliament 
an aide to landsbergis also confirmed the meeting but declined 
to comment further 
landsbergis returned later to vilnius for a parliament debate on 
the moratorium which has been recommended by lithuanian prime 
minister kazimiera prunskiene 
the proposed temporary moratorium could save our dignity and 
at the same time promote the solution of the accumulated 
problems the official soviet news agency tass quoted mrs 
prunskiene as telling a news conference monday 
lithuania has been under an kremlin economic blockade since 
shortly after its declaration 
soviet authorities partially lifted the embargo by resuming 
natural gas shipments to a lithuanian fertilizer factory amounting 
to 15 percent of soviet gas deliveries to lithuania crude oil and 
gasoline shipments remain cut and many lithuanian businesses have 
closed forcing thousands out of work 
the lithuanian council of ministers which mrs prunskiene 
heads accepted gorbachevs proposal earlier this month 
landsbergis has been less inclined to compromise 
gorbachev proposed the moratorium as a formula to enable him to 
open talks with the secessionist republic and lift the economic 
embargo details are sketchy but he appears to be seeking a 
longterm agreement with lithuania and its sister baltic states 
latvia and estonia to keep them as republics in a newly 
constituted soviet union 
his chances of forcing them to retain their old status or to 
accept recently passed soviet rules governing secession diminished 
this month when russia the largest soviet republic passed a 
resolution declaring its sovereignty 
although the russian declaration did not go as far as steps 
taken by the three baltic republics it set the stage for the 
transfer of many powers from central authorities to elected 
governments in the 15 soviet republics 
mrs prunskiene and some soviet officials have been searching 
for a compromise to resolve the impasse 
her popularity has been rising rapidly among lithuanians during 
the crisis compared with that of landsbergis who is losing favor 
according to a poll released monday 
it was conducted by the sociological research department of the 
lithuanian academy of sciences and reported by interfax an 
unofficial news service of radio moscow 
mrs prunskiene had a favorable rating among 61 percent of those 
surveyed followed by the deputy prime minister and leader of the 
breakaway lithuanian communist party algirdas brazauskas with 50 
percent the report said 
landsbergis rating has declined from 45 percent to 28 percent 
since the independence declaration it said 
interfax did not report the polls margin of error or say how 
many people were contacted 
despite signs of a compromise the lithuanian parliament has 
continued to pass and implement laws that seem likely to anger 
soviet hardliners 
on monday landsbergis and other members of parliament received 
new lithuanian identity cards which are to be distributed later 
this week to all young men as a first step toward avoiding 
compulsory service in the soviet army according to tass

western european leaders today signaled 
support for mikhail gorbachevs efforts to rescue his ailing soviet 
economy but fended off a francogerman push for an immediate 15 
billion aid package 
the leaders of the 12nation trading bloc ended a twoday summit 
by asking aides to consult with the kremlin about urgent proposals 
for immediate loans and longer term assistance 
prime minister charles haughey the host of the meeting said 
the leaders were aware of concerns about the soviet presidents 
chances of success in pushing his perestroika program of economic 
reform 
the community is concerned lest those difficulties on the 
economic front might impede disrupt the process of perestroika 
in which we all have a very real vested interest he told a news 
conference 
the troublesome question also will be at the top of the agenda 
of next months economic summit of the seven leading industrialized 
nations in houston 
in their final statement the leaders praised reform efforts in 
south africa but made no move to ease the economic sanctions 
imposed against the whiteled government in 1986 
they renewed their willingness to consider a gradual relaxation 
of the prohibitions when there is clear evidence that the process 
of change already initiated continues 
britains margaret thatcher who has pushed for a lifting of 
prohibitions hailed their statement urging an end to violence in 
south africa she said it was directed at black leader nelson 
mandelas african national congress and its support for an armed 
struggle which ought to be abandoned 
in a separate statement the leaders expressed their deep 
revulsion at recent signs of antisemitism in europe since may 
10 there have been numerous incidents of vandalism at jewish 
cemeteries although nonjewish cemeteries have also been targets 
they also expressed their profound sympathy to iran after an 
earthquake in the northwestern part of the country killed tens of 
thousands they promised to provide all possible assistance to 
disaster victims 
on the question of soviet aid a senior west german official 
demanding anonymity said he expected an aid package to be decided 
by years end 
i think there is a majority for providing help to the soviet 
union the official said but he acknowledged that no figure 
will be cited at the end of the summit 
in taking a cautious approach on the soviet union the 
officials led by mrs thatcher rejected an appeal by france and 
west germany for an immediate 15 billion aid package 
i favor support for economic reform but there has to be reform 
to be supported mrs thatcher said 
spains prime minister felipe gonzalez said it wouldnt be 
responsible for the community to fix a budget aid package without 
knowing the needs 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany who made a stong pitch 
for immediate help for the soviet union said he was satisfied with 
the results of the summit he emphasized that aid for moscow is a 
longterm investment from which we all can benefit 
it only makes sense if the soviets understand that this is 
help to help themselves he said 
west german banks have already agreed to pump 31 billion worth 
of loans into the soviet economy 
in exchange for the help kohl has said he would urge the 
kremlin to adopt a constructive approach toward membership of a 
united germany in the north atlantic treaty organization 
gorbachev has opposed immediate and full membership for the new 
german state in the western military alliance west germany now 
belongs to nato its eastern neighbor to the crumbling sovietled 
warsaw pact

battle for a strategic fort in the northern city of jaffna tamil 
tiger rebels said today

fought for control of tamildominated areas in the north and east 
military officials and residents said 
the charred bodies of at least 100 tamil tiger rebels were found 
in an eastern town and 50 policemen were massacred by the rebels 
in the north the officials and residents said in addition the 
military said it had killed 41 rebels and lost five soldiers in a 
mine explosion 
the tigers in a statement to an indian news organization said 
five air force bombers and one helicopter gunship dropped 
incendiary devices and 120pound bombs on residential areas in 
jaffna on monday 
at one point bombers and helicopters attacked the area 
continuously for three hours and hundreds of buildings near the 
jaffna fort were set on fire the rebels said 
military officials speaking on condition of anonymity said sri 
lankan air force planes were again bombing and strafing rebel 
positions today the government said the 270 security forces who 
had been trapped in the 200yearold fort in the heart of the city 
had established positions 1000 yards outside the garrison 
military officials have said troops would try to avoid killing 
civilians 
we are not hellbent on bombing and killing people defense 
secretary gen cyril ranatunge said he added that helicopter 
gunships would try to pinpoint their targets 
there was no way to independently verify either rebel or 
government claims because transportation and telephone services to 
the region have been cut off travelers reaching vavuniya just 
south of jaffna confirmed that heavy bombing and strafing 
operations had begun along the whole of the jaffna peninsula 
the fort is in the heart of jaffna a city of 120000 that is 
the headquarters of the tamil separatist movement it is 186 miles

residents contacted by telephone said it was filled with soldiers 
today

after a tamil man claimed he was manhandled by police of the indian 
ocean island nations majority sinhalese tamil tigers then overran 
a series of police stations 
the clashes ended a tenuous 13month ceasefire between ethnic 
tamil separatists and the sinhalesedominated government 
the tigers apparently are digging in for a protracted guerrilla 
war according to some of their military leaders who spoke to 
reporters from their jungle hideouts in batticaloa district last 
week 
tamil tiger rebel mortars rockets and gunfire have pounded the 
jaffna fort for the past two weeks last week the government 
reported the 270 soldiers and policemen pinned down inside were 
running out of food water medicines and ammunition 
if the rebels do not permit food and medicine to reach the 
soldiers and policemen in the fort we will be taking military 
action to clear a path deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne 
warned monday 
over the weekend air force planes dropped leaflets warning 
residents near the fort to leave the area 
at least 12000 people including 1150 indian soldiers have 
been killed in the tamil separatist war since 1983 indian troops 
withdrew from sri lanka in march ending an unsuccessful 
32monthlong operation to disarm tamil separatists 
tamils mostly hindu form 18 percent of the islands 16 million 
people tamils have long accused the sinhalese majority of 
discrimination 
the sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the population 
control the government and the military

and when is a freebie golf trip considered a gift only when 
lawmakers say so 
in 1988 the pennsylvania manufacturing association spent a 
reported 20000 entertaining seven lawmakers at a florida golf 
resort only one reported the outing although three others said 
they went but didnt consider it a gift 
lawmakers can get free movie passes in pennsylvania free lift 
tickets at ski resorts in utah race track tickets in maryland 
college basketball tickets in kentucky and all sorts of freebies to 
professional sports 
take a ticket in wisconsin however and youll be criminally 
prosecuted wisconsin is the only state that bars lawmakers from 
taking anything of value even a cup of coffee 
four wisconsin senators were fined for accepting free lodging 
from a special interest while attending a chicago bearsgreen bay 
packers football game in a separate case the tobacco institute 
was fined for giving tickets to a state senator for the los angeles 
lakersboston celtics basketball game during a legislative trip to 
boston 
thirteen states set limits on the value of gifts a legislator 
can accept from a single lobbyist ranging from a 10 per month in 
california to 100 per gift in west virginia 
but theres plenty of room for ambiguity despite nebraskas 
limit of 25 per gift a lobbyist onced hauled a senator around 
with a private plane until state officials intervened 
dannie trautwein executive director of the states 
accountability and disclosure commission said the lobbyist was 
lectured on the intent of the states lobbying law but no one was 
prosecuted because of the vagaries of defining a gift 
he looked me right in the eye and said the plane was just 
going in the same direction as the senator and anbyody could have 
gotten on it trautwein said

a prosecutor described in gruesome detail the 
gangrape and attempted murder of a central park jogger as the 
trial of three teenagers accused in the attack got under way 
defense lawyers suggested their clients statements were coerced 
she was forced to submit to repeated sexual intercourse as 
each one took his turn after the group finished raping and beating 
and sexually abusing her somebody still took a pipe and struck her 
in the head leaving her for dead assistant district attorney 
elizabeth lederer told the jurors monday 
every bone supporting her left eye was broken she was in 
shock she had cuts and bruises covering her body they left her to 
die naked and stripped the prosecutor said 
the woman an investment banker was making her nightly jog 
through the park on april 19 1989 when she was attacked she 
survived but suffered brain damage and has no recollection of 
what happened to her that night lederer said 
photos of the victim showed that she suffered the same injuries 
that the defendants described inflicting lederer said adding that 
the three would convict themselves with statements they made after 
they left the woman gangraped and beaten nearly to death 
each of these defendants told police they participated in the 
attack that night said lederer 
in testimony today a police officer raymond alvarez described 
how he encountered a bloodied man believed to be the first victim 
assaulted by the gang who later attacked the woman jogger as he 
and the injured man antonio diaz looked for his assailants they 
came upon a bicyclist who said a group of youths tried to assault 
him but he managed to get away 
alvarez was the third person to testify the first two were 
technical witnesses who had made maps of central park 
charged with attempted murder rape sexual abuse assault 
robbery and riot are raymond santana and yusef salaam both 16 and 
antron mccray 15 they are charged as adults but if convicted 
they would be sentenced as juveniles to up to 10 years in prison 
three other youths are due to stand trial on the same charges 
later this year 
mccray and santana gave written and videotaped statements to 
police after they were arrested salaam gave neither but a police 
fficer took notes on comments he allegedly made and justice thomas 
galligan has ruled the notes may be presented as evidence 
lawyers for the defendants said in brief opening remarks that 
the statements had been coerced by police lies ruses and 
intimidation 
michael joseph mccrays lawyer said his client initially 
denied involvement in the attack and then the police added 
facts because he was not telling them what they wanted to hear 
the defense lawyers also argued that there is no scientific 
evidence linking the defendants to the attack and that without the 
statements the prosecutions case is weak at best 
lederer said the defendants were part of a larger group of 30 to 
35 youths who entered central park at 110th street around 9 pm 
the night of the attack specifically to rob beat and assault 
people 
the three were also charged with assaulting two male joggers the 
same night lederer said that by the time the group left the park 
around 10 pm they assaulted or tried to assault at least eight 
people 
police said the defendants called their action wilding lederer 
said the victims were randomly chosen 
the prosecutor said mccray told police we charged her we got 
her on the ground and everybody was hitting her everybody was 
stomping and everything and we all took turns getting on top of 
her i just kicked there was a whole bunch of us just kicking 
lederer said she expects to call more than 50 witnesses and 
present an array of photographs and medical records during the 
trial which is expected to last six to eight weeks 
the victim now 29 spent several months in a new york hospital 
before being transferred to a connecticut facility for further 
rehabilitation she recently returned to work at salomon brothers

prime minister yitzhak shamir said tuesday that 
israel will not block soviet jewish immigrants from settling in the 
occupied territories 
his statement was seen as a clarification of remarks made sunday 
by housing minister ariel sharon sharon said the immigrants would 
not be settled beyond the green line israels pre1967 
borders 
but israel radio quoted shamir as saying this was not a change 
from previous policy 
shamir said of sharons statement of course he said that 
nobody will be sent by us to certain territories and to certain 
locations but everybody in a democratic country has the right to 
settle wherever he wishes 
the united states and soviet union strongly oppose settling 
soviet jewish immigrants in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
saying such settlements are obstacles to peace palestinians and 
arab countries fear the palestinians will be pushed out of the 
territories if immigrants are allowed to settle in them 
also tuesday palestinian leaders from the occupied west bank 
urged the united nations to play a stronger peacemaking role in the 
middle east in view of the failure of american diplomacy 
they also asked the united nations to set up a system to monitor 
the settlement of soviet jewish immigrants in the west bank and 
gaza strip 
the requests were made during a meeting with un envoy 
jeanclaude aime aime is on a weeklong factfinding visit to 
israel and the occupied territories at the behest of un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
aime met monday with shamir and israeli newspapers said tuesday 
he had offered un mediation between israelis and palestinians 
the hebrew daily haaretz said shamir declined the offer saying 
israel still hoped for us backing for its own election plan in 
the territories the election would lead to limited autonomy for 
the 17 million palestinians in the territories 
defense minister moshe arens meanwhile met with three mayors 
of west bank towns and promised to reopen two more palestinian 
universities the abu dis college of science and technology near 
jerusalem and an najah college in nablus 
two weeks ago the army announced that a nursing school in the 
west bank town of el bireh would be the first academic institution 
to reopen 
the army closed universities and colleges in the occupied 
territories shortly after the start of the palestinian uprising 30 
months ago contending they were hotbeds of antiisraeli activity 
arens also promised to release an unspecified number of detained 
palestinians as a gesture of good will on the upcoming moslem 
holidary of eid eladha 
the palestinian plea for un help came in a petition by the 
west bank leaders who included five university professors and one 
physician 
saeb erekat a political science lecturer in nablus read the 
12point petition to reporters 
in view of the failure of american diplomacy to start a peace 
process and as a result of the decision taken by the united states 
to suspend its dialogue with the plo the palestinian people 
request from the un secretarygeneral to intensify his efforts in 
this field the petition said 
president bush last week announced the suspension of the 
18month us dialogue with the palestine liberation organization 
he did so after plo chief yasser arafat failed to condemn an 
attempted raid on israels coast by palestinian guerrillas

imelda marcos lawyer today mocked prosecutors 
for trying to convict her of fraud with musthavebeens instead 
of solid evidence 
attorney gerry spence said the case against the former 
philippine first lady was she spent a lot of money it must have 
been dirty money she must have known of course she must and 
everybody lied 
that argument is a presumption of guilt he said in his 
closing statement today 
spence depicted mrs marcos as a loyal wife and mother for 35 
years who had been unfairly accused of stealing and excoriated in 
the press for her personal habits she is the widow of former 
philippines president ferdinand marcos 
as for the spending sprees that the government alleges were 
financed with money stolen from the philippine treasury he said 
she could have bought every piece of jewelry on the face of this 
earth and not be guilty of anything 
he reminded jurors that the prosecution was obligated to prove 
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that burden never changes and 
that doesnt mean there are a lot of musthavebeens spence said 
in a daylong closing statement monday assistant us attorney 
charles labella said powerful circumstantial evidence had shown 
that mrs marcos helped steal millions from her countrys treasury 
and defrauded us banks in buying four new york office buildings 
artworks and jewelry 
labella said her codefendant saudi financier adnan khashoggi 
had agreed to help mrs marcos and her husband circumvent a 1986 
federal court order freezing their us assets not as a favor 
but for a fee 
khashoggis attorneys were to follow spence with the case 
expected to go to the jury thursday 
labella repeatedly urged the jury to use your common sense 
in sorting out the complicated case which involved testimony by 95 
witnesses and thousands of documents over three months 
you can be sure that when taken all together the evidence 
will show imelda marcos and adnan khashoggi actively participated 
in the crimes charged in this indictment he said 
labella also urged the jury not to be swayed by the fact that 
mrs marcos fell ill three times during the trial 
as hard as it may be for you its your responsibility to make 
a decision solely on the facts he said 
us district judge john f keenan said he planned to sequester 
the jury during deliberations 
mrs marcos 60 could draw a sentence of up to 50 years in 
prison and a 1 million fine if convicted on charges of 
racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction of justice 
khashoggi 54 faces up to 10 years in prison and 500000 in 
fines if convicted of mail fraud and obstructing justice 
in his closing statement labella said that both mrs marcos and 
khashoggi had used trusted aides to conduct their financial 
dealings but that both were fully aware of what was going on 
the marcoses were ousted from power in february 1986 and moved 
to exile in hawaii marcos originally charged along with his wife 
died last september

the ira claimed responsibility today for bombing 
an elegant social club frequented by conservative party leaders and 
warned that no government policymakers would be safe until britain 
withdraws from ireland 
a porter was badly injured and eight other people were hurt in 
monday nights explosion at the carlton club in londons 
fashionable mayfair district 
in a statement issued in dublin the irish republican army said 
an active service unit had struck at the heart of tory rule 
it described the club as the rest and recreation center for 
the british government who legislate for a military occupation of 
the north of ireland 
the ira bombed the grand hotel in brighton during a governing 
conservative party conference in 1984 killing five people and 
narrowly missing prime minister margaret thatcher 
like brighton in 1984 the statement said the ira has 
brought the war directly to those who keep the british army on the 
streets and in the fields of ireland 
while such occupation continues and the nationalist people 
face daily oppression the policy makers and their military arm 
will not be safe it said 
scotland yard examined security camera videotapes today for 
clues to the bombers 
mrs thatcher the clubs only female member called monday 
nights bombing one more outrage in a catalog of terrorist 
inhumanity 
tory leaders said they were determined to rebuild the club as 
it was after being hit by german bombs in world war ii 
commander george churchillcoleman head of scotland yards 
antiterrorist squad told a news conference theres not much 
doubt that it was the work of the ira which killed five people 
in a bomb attack on a conservative party conference in 1984 
the bomb which exploded at 840 pm was placed inside a 
porchway but outside locked security doors churchillcoleman said 
there was a video camera outside the building and were 
examining that tape now he said 
the most serious injuries were suffered by charles henry 76 a 
porter at the club and lord kaberry 82 a former vicechairman of 
the conservative party who is a member of the house of lords 
henry suffered serious head injuries and was recovering from 
surgery today in the intensive care unit said westminster hospital 
duty manager kim hodgon 
lord kaberry was suffering from shock minor cuts and bruises 
and would be kept in the hospital for observation hodgson said 
hospital spokeswoman margaret mcdagh said two police constables 
treated for smoke inhalation would probably be discharged today 
police said five others were slightly injured two other 
employees at the club another man and two american tourists jane 
kahan 49 and jacob boaltefhuva 61 both of new york they were 
in the street at the time of the explosion and were treated for 
cuts from flying glass a spokesman for st thomas hospital said 
the ira whose armed campaign is intended to undermine british 
resolve in northern ireland has renewed its offensive in britain 
and continental europe the ira which draws its support almost 
entirely from roman catholics wants to unite the predominantly 
protestant province with the 95 percent catholic republic of 
ireland under socialist rule 
the carlton nestled among the establishment watering holes 
known collectively as clubland is a favorite haunt of conservative 
party cabinet ministers and lawmakers 
the blocks around the club were bustling with thousands of 
tourists heading to restaurants and west end theaters in the 
neighborhood when the bomb went off 
the fire brigade rescued 23 people from the threestory 
building and dozens of others escaped on their own 
i hope the timing of this attack coming during the european 
summit will bring home to the international community just what 
depraved and evil crimnals we face mrs thatcher said in dublin 
today at the conclusion of meeting of european community leaders

here is the text of nelson mandelas address 
tuesday to the joint meeting of congress 
speaker thomas s foley members of the congress it is my great 
privilege and i deem it a high honor and personal pleasure to 
present to you mr nelson mandela deputy president of the african 
national congress 
mr mandela mr speaker mr president esteemed members of the 
united states congress your excellencies ambassadors and members 
of the diplomatic corps distinguished guests ladies and 
gentlemen it is a fact of the human condition that it shall like 
a meteor a mere brief passing moment in time and space fleet 
across the human stage and pass out of existence 
even the golden lads and lasses as much as the chimney 
sweepers come and tomorrow are no more after them all they leave 
the people enduring multiplying permanent except to the extent 
that the same humanity might abuse its own genius to emulate life 
itself 
and so we have come to washington in the district of columbia 
and into these hallowed chambers of the united states congress not 
as pretenders to greatness but as a particle of a people whom we 
know to be noble and heroic enduring multiplying permanent 
rejoicing in the expectation and knowledge that their humanity will 
be reaffirmed and enlarged by open and unfettered communion with 
the nations of the world 
we have come here to tell you and through you your own people 
who are equally noble and heroic of the troubles and trials the 
fond hopes and aspirations of the people from whom we originate 
we believe that we know it as a fact that your kind and moving 
invitation to ask us to speak here derived from your own desire to 
convey a message to our people and according to your humane 
purposes to give them an opportunity to say what they want of you 
and what they want to make of their relationship with you 
our people demand democracy our country which continues to 
bleed and suffer pain needs democracy it cries out for the 
situation where the law will decree that freedom to speak of 
freedom constitutes the very essence of legality and the very 
thing that makes for the legitimacy of the constitutional order 
it stands for the situation where those who are entitled by law 
to carry arms as the forces of national security and law and order 
will not turn their weapons against the citizens simply because the 
citizens assert that equality liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness are fundamental human rights which are not only 
inalienable but must if necessary be defended with the weapons of 
war 
we fight for and visualize a future in which all shall without 
regard to race color creed or sex have their right to vote and to 
be voted into all elective organs of state we are engaged in 
struggle to ensure that the rights of every individual are 
guaranteed and protected through a democratic constitution the 
rule of law an entrenched bill of rights which shall be enforced 
by an independent judiciary as well as a multiparty political 
system 
mr speaker we are acutely conscious of the fact that we are 
addressing an historic institution for whose creation and integrity 
many men and women lost their lives in the war of independence the 
civil war and the war against naziism and fascism that very 
history demands that we address you with respect and candor and 
without any attempt to dissemble what we have said concerning the 
political arrangements we seek for our country is seriously meant 
it is an outcome for which many of us went to prison for which 
many have died in police cells on the gallows in our towns and 
villages and in the countries of southern africa

north of berlin 
many stores selling household goods closed to clear space for 
the western products that will pour into the country after sunday 
when the germanys merge their economies 
some merchants said they also wanted to avoid taking in large 
amounts of east german marks in the days before the nearly 
worthless currency is replaced by the valuable west german mark 
experts say many east german companies are keeping their 
products off the market until next week when they can sell them 
for west german marks 
grocery stores have been canceling their orders with east german 
suppliers and letting their stocks run out 
next week well get the west products and the customers will 
have west german marks said liane fischer a clerk at the 
blankenburg store 
lines of up to 1000 people snaked down sidewalks as people 
converged on banks to fill out paperwork necessary for converting 
savings accounts to west german marks 
the government in an attempt to protect its ailing industries 
from the first rush of western competition announced tuesday a 
series of tariffs on western goods beginning sunday 
an 11 percent tariff is to be imposed through the end of the 
year replaced the following quarter by a 6 percent tariff 
food will not be affected east germanys huge farm collectives 
are expected to be battered by western agricultural producers 
however it is uncertain if the tariffs will remain if the 
current pace of unification continues and the nations are fully 
unified in december 
many stores are already stocking west german goods under 
agreements made in march that allowed a limited entry of some 
products into the country 
but many staples still were in short supply mrs kroll said she 
could find no detergent and rejected the skimpy selection of meat 
she also had mixed feelings about the end of the east german mark 
my husband mints east german coins for a living she said 
some experts say 1 million to 4 million workers will lose their 
jobs in the first two years of economic unification 
many of the heavy industries that were once the backbone of the 
former centrally planned economy are expected to fail as they face 
leaner more efficient western concerns 
the small businesses that will suddenly become independent are 
expected to have a much better chance of survival than the large 
inefficient factories that churn out outmoded cars electronics and 
other products 
dietmar mueller a spkesman for the east german economics 
ministry said retailers can make more money by selling west german 
goods which have profit margins sometimes three times as high as 
east german goods 
merchants have not ordered enough from east german producers 
because merchants think people wont buy them he said the 
result he said is that consumers have to bite the bullet and 
buy the much more expensive west german goods 
but werner schwartz spokesman for the commerce ministry which 
represents small businesses said east german goods have merely 
sold out 
the government last month ordered massive price cuts to clear 
textiles electronics and other goods that customers were refusing 
to buy some televisions for example were cut by 90 percent 
cord schwartau an expert on east german industry for the german 
institute for economic research in west berlin said both officials 
are correct 
he said the amazingly low prices of unattractive goods 
helped move them off shelves but that merchants also have been 
refusing to order new east german goods because they fear consumers 
wont want them 
he said many east german manufacturers themselves are keeping 
their goods off the market so they can take advantage of higher 
prices that are expected after sunday

indeed we have even had our political representatives killed in 
countries as far away from south africa as france unhappily our 
people continue to die to this day victims of armed agents of the 
state who are still determined to turn their guns against the very 
idea of a nonracial democracy but this is the perspective which 
we will trust congress will feel happy to support and encourage 
using the enormous weight of its prestige and authority as an 
eminent representative of democratic practice 
to deny any person their human rights is to challenge their very 
humanity to impose on them a wretched life of hunger and 
deprivation is to dehumanize them but such has been the terrible 
fate of all black persons in our country under the system of 
apartheid the extent of the deprivation of millions of people has 
to be seen to be believed 
the injury is made that more intolerable by the opulence of our 
white compatriots and the deliberate distortion of the economy to 
feed that opulence 
the process of the reconstruction of south african society must 
and will also entail the transformation of its economy we need a 
strong and growing economy we require an economy that is able to 
address the needs of all the people of our country that can 
provide food houses education health services social security 
and everything that makes human life human that makes life joyful 
and not a protracted encounter with hopelessness and despair 
we believe that the fact of the apartheid structure of the south 
african economy and the enormous and pressing needs of the people 
make it inevitable that the democratic government will intervene in 
this economy acting through the elected parliament we have put 
the matter to the business community of our country that the need 
for a public sector is one of the elements in a many sided strategy 
of economic development and restructuring that has to be 
considered by us all including the private sector 
the anc holds no ideological positions which dictate that it 
must adopt a policy of nationalization but the anc also holds the 
view that there is no selfregulating mechanism within the south 
african economy which will on its own insure growth with equity 
at the same time we take it as a given as given that the 
private sector is an engine of growth and development which is 
critical to the success of the mixed economy we hope to see in 
future in the future south africa 
we are accordingly committed to the creation of the situation in 
which business people both south african and foreign have 
confidence in the security of their investments are assured of a 
fair rate of return on their capital and do business in conditions 
of stability and peace 
we must also make the point very firmly that the political 
settlement and democracy itself cannot survive unless the material 
needs of the people the bread and butter issue are addressed as 
part of the process of change and as a matter of urgency 
it should never be that the anger of the poor should be the 
finger of accusation pointed at all of us because we failed to 
respond to the crisis of the people for food to the cries of the 
people for food for shelter for the dignity of the individual 
we shall need your support to achieve the postapartheid 
economic objectives which are an intrinsic part of the process of 
the restoration of the human rights of the people of south africa 
we would like to approach the issue of our economic cooperation not 
as a relationship between donor and recipient between a dependent 
and a benefactor 
we would like to believe that there is a way in which we could 
structure this relationship so that we do indeed benefit from your 
enormous resources in terms of your capital technology allaround 
expertise your enterprising spirit and your markets 
this relationship should however be one from which your people 
should also derive benefit so that we who are fighting to liberate 
the very spirit of our entire people from the bondage of the 
arrogance of the ideology and practice of white supremacy do not 
build a relationship of subservient dependency and foreign 
ingratitude 
one of the benefits that should accrue to both our peoples and 
to the rest of the world should surely be that this complex south 
african society which has known nothing but racism for three 
centuries should be transformed into an oasis of good race 
relations where the black shall to the white be sister and brother 
a fellow south african an equal human being both citizens of the 
world

visits to the hotel room of a convicted drug dealer in 1988 were 
not unusual or criminal according to a taperecording of his 
testimony played today at the mayors cocaine possession and 
perjury trial 
his assertion contradicted the testimony last week of the 
convicted drug dealer charles lewis who said he and the mayor 
smoked crack cocaine on each of four visits barry allegedly made to 
lewis hotel room 
barry is accused of three felony counts of perjury stemming from 
his testimony before the grand jury 
his taped testimony contradicted lewis on several other points 
barry told the grand jury he thought his first visit to lewis 
hotel room in washington dc took place on dec 17 1988 lewis 
testified it was dec 16 
barry said his dec 19 visit with lewis lasted an hour or less 
lewis testified it lasted well into dec 20 and long past the end 
of the monday night football game 
was there anything unusual about the visit dec 17 
assistant us attorney judith retchin asked barry during one of 
the mayors two grand jury appearances in january 1989 
not that was unusual or criminal replied the mayor 
in his grand jury testimony it was the mayor who first brought 
up the subject of drugs 
barry told the grand jury that lewis mentioned the term 
working 50 in casual conversation and that the mayor thought 
the words had something to do with hot clothes prostitution 
or drugs 
it just popped out of lewis mouth i didnt pursue it 
the mayor told the grand jury 
lewis testified last week that a working 50 is a bundle of 
crack cocaine that retails on the streets of washington dc for 
50 
barry is accused of lying when he told the grand jury that he 
had seen nothing to indicate that lewis was involved with drugs and 
that he and lewis hadnt ever given each other cocaine 
on monday witnesses testified that barry coerced a woman into 
having sex with him and made repeated advances toward others during 
a string of drug parties in the virgin islands 
witnesses testified about the mayors 1986 and 1988 visits to 
the virgin islands they described drug use drinking and the 
alleged sexual encounter with one of them linda creque maynard 
in an interview later with washington station wjlatv barry 
insisted that the jury in his case should be allowed to decide on 
the credibility of each government witness 
he has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession one count of conspiracy and three felony counts of 
lying to a federal grand jury about involvement with drugs by 
himself and a friend charles lewis 
maynard a virgin islands resident testified that she was 
forced into having sex when she visited barry in his virgin islands 
hotel room in march 1988 
the incident allegedly occurred when lewis left the two together 
for about 10 minutes after maynard and lewis had smoked crack 
cocaine together in front of the mayor maynard testified 
she said barry dressed only in a robe had been after me 
from the moment she entered the hotel room 
assistant us attorney judith retchin asked her whether barry 
had limited himself sexually with you at all 
no he didnt maynard replied 
did you have sexual relations in the hotel room retchin 
asked 
yes maynard said softly 
throughout this section of testimony barry sat expressionless 
at the defense table staring at the witness 
defense attorney robert mance then asked maynard whether she had 
fought barry all over the room in order to avoid the incident 
no maynard replied he already had me down on the bed 
maynard who said earlier that she had considered it an honor 
to meet the mayor of washington dc testified that she did not 
report the incident to lewis or local authorities

to destroy racism in the world we together must expunge 
apartheid racism in south africa justice and liberty must be our 
tools prosperity and happiness our weapon 
mr speaker distinguished representatives of the american 
people you know this more than we do that peace is its own 
reward our own fate borne by a succession of generations that 
reach backwards into centuries has been nothing but tension 
conflict and death 
in a sense we do not know the meaning of peace except in the 
imagination but because we have not known true peace in its real 
meaning because for centuries generations have had to bury the 
victims of state violence we have fought for the right to 
experience peace 
on the initiative of the anc a process towards the conclusion 
of a peaceful settlement has started according to a logic dictated 
by our situation we are engaged in an effort which includes the 
removal of obstacles to negotiations this will be followed by a 
negotiated determination of the mechanism which will draw up the 
new constitution this should lead to the formation of this 
constitutionmaking institution and therefore the elaboration and 
adoption of a democratic constitution elections would then be held 
on the basis of this constitution and for the first time south 
africa would have a body of lawmakers which would like yourselves 
be mandated by the whole people 
despite the admitted commitment of president de klerk to walk 
this road with us and despite our acceptance of his integrity and 
honesty of his purposes 
we would be fools to believe that the road ahead of us is 
without major hurdles too many among our white compatriots are 
steeped in the ideology of racism to admit easily that change must 
come tragedy may yet sully the future we pray and work for if 
these slaves of the past take up arms in a desperate effort to 
resist the process which must lead to the democratic transformation 
of our country 
for those who care to worry about violence in our country as we 
do it is at these forces that they should focus their attention a 
process in which we are engaged we must contend still with the 
reality that south africa is a country in the grip of the apartheid 
crime against humanity the consequences of this continue to be 
felt not only within our borders but throughout southern africa 
which continues to harvest the bitter fruits of conflict and war 
especially in mozambique and angola peace will not come to our 
country and region until the apartheid system is ended 
therefore we say we still have a struggle on our hands our 
common and noble efforts to abolish the system of white minority 
domination must continue we are encouraged and strengthened by the 
fact of the agreement between ourselves this congress as well as 
president bush and his administration that sanctions should remain 
in place 
sanctions should remain in place because the purpose for which 
they were imposed has not yet been achieved we have yet to arrive 
at the point when we can say that south africa is set on an 
irreversible course leading to its transformation into a united 
democratic and nonracial country we plead that you cede the 
prerogative to the people of south africa to determine the moment 
when it will be said that profound changes have occurred and an 
irreversible process achieved enabling you and the rest of the 
international community to lift sanctions 
we would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for the 
principled struggle you waged which resulted in the adoption of the 
historic comprehensive antiapartheid act which made such a 
decisive contribution to the process of moving our country forward 
towards negotiations we request that you go further and assist us 
with the material resources which will enable us to promote the 
peace process and meet other needs which arise from the changing 
situation you have helped to bring about

the stand you took established the understanding among the 
millions of our people that here we have friends here we have 
fighters against racism who feel hurt because we are hurt who 
seek our success because they too seek the victory of democracy 
over tyranny and here i speak not only about you members of the 
united states congress but also of the millions of people 
throughout this great land who stood up and engaged the apartheid 
system in struggle the masses who have given us such strength and 
joy by the manner in which they have received us since we arrived 
in this country 
mr speaker mr president senators and representatives we 
went to jail because it was impossible to sit still while the 
obscenity of the apartheid system was being imposed on our people 
it would have been immoral to keep quiet while a racist tyranny 
sought to reduce an entire people into a status worse than that of 
the beasts of the forest 
it would have been an act of treason against the people and 
against our conscience to allow fear and the drive towards 
selfpreservation to dominate our behavior obliging us to absent 
ourselves from the struggle for democracy and human rights not only 
in our country but throughout the world we could not have made an 
acquaintance through literature with human giants such as george 
washington abraham lincoln and thomas jefferson and not been 
moved to act as they were moved to act 
we could not have had heard of and admired john brown sojourner 
truth frederick douglass web dubois marcus garvey martin 
luther king jr and others we could not have heard of these and 
not be moved to act as they were moved to act 
we could not have known of your declaration of independence and 
not elected to join in the struggle to guarantee the peoples life 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness we are grateful to you all 
that you persisted in your resolve to have us and other political 
prisoners released from jail you have given us the gift and 
privilege to rejoin our people yourselves and the rest of the 
international community in the common effort to transform south 
africa into a united a democratic and nonracial country 
you have given us the power to join hands with all people of 
conscience to fight for the victory of democracy and human rights 
throughout the world 
we are glad that you merged with our own people to make it 
possible for us to emerge from the darkness of the prison cell and 
join the contemporary process of the renewal of the world we thank 
you most sincerely for all you have done and count on you to 
persist in your noble endeavors to free the rest of our political 
prisoners and to emancipate our people from the life of prison that 
is apartheid south africa 
the day may not be far when we will borrow the words of thomas 
jefferson and speak of the will of the south african nation in 
the exercise of that will by this united nation of black and white 
people it must surely be that there will be born a country on the 
southern tip if africa which you will be proud to call a friend and 
an ally because of its contribution to the universal striving 
towards liberty human rights prosperity and peace among the 
peoples 
let that day come now let us keep our arms locked together so 
that we form a solid phalanx against racism to ensure that day 
comes now by our common actions let us ensure that justice 
triumphs without delay when that has come to pass then shall we 
all be entitled to acknowledge the salute when others say of us 
blessed are the peacemakers 
thank you for your kind invitation to speak here today and 
thank you for your welcome and the attention you have accorded our 
simple message thank you

a battle is developing in the communist party 
leadership about whether to go ahead with a crucial congress that 
many say will decide the partys future reformer boris n yeltsin 
said today 
yeltsin spoke in response to news reports that a member of the 
partys politburo contacted party officials in the baltic republic 
of estonia to ask their opinion about delaying the congress 
increasingly vocal reformers and traditional soviet communists 
have promised a battle for control of the party at its 28th 
congress which is scheduled to open july 2 in moscow 
a large group of party reformers already has indicated it will 
leave if the party is not completely overhauled 
some top party members want to hold the congress quickly after 
the conservativeminded meeting of 2700 communists from the 
russian republic last week said yeltsin president of the soviet 
unions largest republic 
others in order to somehow stabilize the political situation 
that has emerged now are for delaying for a time perhaps until 
fall yeltsin said 
yeltsin said he favored postponement to prepare it more 
thoroughly 
any decision to postpone the congress would contrast with 
previous similar sessions which were planned months in advance 
a decision to delay the congress would have to be made by a 
plenary meeting of the partys central committee expected within 
the next few days 
the plenum will be very difficult yeltsin said there 
will be a real struggle at the plenum 
he criticized soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for not 
preparing more carefully for the conference of russian communists 
last week it elected a conservative first secretary ivan 
polozkov who had opposed yeltsin unsuccessfully last month for the 
presidency of the russian federation the largest soviet republic 
gorbachevs spokesman arkady a maslennikov told reporters 
after yeltsins news conference that gorbachevs position on a 
possible delay in the plenum would not be disclosed until the 
central committee meeting 
it was not clear exactly when the central committee would meet 
a news service of the baltic republic estonia today quoted a 
spokesman for the republics communist party as saying that 
politburo member vadim a medvedev had contacted officials about 
the possibility of delaying the congress 
a spokesman for medvedev alexander vladimirov and foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said they could not confirm 
the reports

two centuries after he took the helm of a new 
nation george washington is being charged with treason sedition 
high crimes and misdemeanors 
not to worry the reputation of the father of his country is 
probably intact the charges are merely a bit of lighthearted 
litigation prompted by a british noblemans tongueincheek 
challenge to us jurists 
still several chicago lawyers who plan to defend washington 
when the case comes to trial in october arent letting the british 
get the upper hand in this battle 
there is absolutely no question that george washington the 
father of our country is not guilty of any crime said michael 
w coffield one of the defense attorneys 
it all began at a luncheon this month in washington dc 
during the national meeting of the american inns of the court the 
association comprises legal groups inspired by four inns that 
operate as law schools eateries and fraternal organizations for 
british jurists 
lord goff of chievely a british lawyer and nobleman launched 
the battle at the luncheon when he called washington a traitor he 
challenged his american colleagues to prove otherwise 
we dumped over a few tables and were the first to accept that 
challenge said jim figliulo secretarytreasurer of the chicago 
inn of the court and a defense team member 
queen elizabeth iis chief prosecutor was sitting at a nearby 
table and agreed to represent britain in the challenge 
the chicago defenders say the trial likely will be held in the 
old bailey londons criminal courthouse and actors may be hired 
to portray washington and other revolutionaryera heroes 
depending on the outcome figliulo said we might invite them 
back for a trial of king george

the national pta convention voted today to 
support legislation that would prohibit businesses from forcing 
students to view advertising as a condition of receiving donations 
the resolution did not deal specifically with channel one a 
controversial 12minute daily news program that includes two 
oneminute commercials however the program was mentioned in 
debate 
to obtain channel one schools sign a contract that loans them 
free color televisions a satellite dish and two videocassette 
recorders for the life of a contract as long as the program is 
aired in its entirety including commercials 
the resolution adopted today says that donations of the 
equipment should not be offered on the condition that students view 
advertising it urged state and federal legislation to bar the 
practice 
some delegates argued that newspapers have advertising and are 
viewed in the schools but others argued that no one was forcing 
students to read those ads or watch commercials on other television 
stations 
the operation by selection of program content could wield a 
great deal of influence on the minds of youngsters who dont have 
the option of turning to an alternative channel or turning the set 
off said sharon voliva a delegate from dolton ill the 
commercialism is much more damaging than the commercials 
the convention also approved a resolution urging congress to 
further study pesticide residues and children 
the pesticide resolution said preschool children have greater 
exposure to pesticide residues because they eat more food relative 
to their weight and consume larger quantities of fruit which can 
have a higher likelihood of pesticide contamination 
the group asked that congress clarify the environmental 
protection agencys authority on pesticides and dietary exposure

peace corps staffers have been pulled 
out of rural areas and brought to the capital following 
intelligence reports that communist rebels planned to kill 
volunteers officials announced tuesday 
the move was the latest in a series of measures taken in the 
wake of threats against americans by the communist new peoples 
army it has been fighting 21 years to establish a marxist 
government in the philippines 
last week the philippine military said rebels in manila plan to 
target americans and other foreigners for assassination and 
kidnapping over the next six months 
us embassy spokesman stanley schrager said ambassador nicholas 
platt ordered the recall of peace corps staffers last weekend but 
delayed the public announcement for security reasons 
he said no decision had been made on when the 261 volunteers 
would be allowed to return to their posts mostly in remote rural 
areas where security is poor 
schrager said the embassy had received a report that peace corps 
volunteers had been added to the target list of the new peoples 
army which is believed to have killed eight americans here since 
april 1989 
he refused to identify the source of the report but said the 
embassy took it seriously 
in washington peace corps director paul coverdell said he was 
taking the step as a precautionary measure and that all 
volunteers are safe 
communist rebels claimed responsibility for killing two american 
airmen last month near the usrun clark air base they threatened 
to kill more until all us troops leave this country 
last week the us embassy warned americans to take precautions 
against terrorism in advance of the next round of usphilippine 
talks on the future american military bases here those talks are 
expected in august 
the lease on the bases expires in september 1991 and the rebels 
have demanded they be closed 
at the admiral hotel where many peace corps volunteers were 
temporarily housed several said they were ordered to manila on 
short notice but were not briefed on the reason beyond the 
embassys official statement 
most of the filipinos in my area support cory president 
corazon aquino have nostalgic feelings for the late president 
ferdinand marcos and want nothing to do with the npa said one 
volunteer who works on an agricultural project in nueva vizcaya 
province 
he and the other volunteers declined to give their names 
coverdell issued a statement saying i wish to assure 
relatives and friends of the volunteers that the volunteers are 
safe and emphasize that we are taking these steps only as a 
precautionary measure he said most of the volunteers were 
already in manila 
the rebels have made no specific public threats against peace 
corps volunteers but have charged that us and japanese aid 
workers secretly assist the philippine government in its 
counterinsurgency operations 
both washington and tokyo deny the charges 
on may 29 rebels on negros island kidnapped fumio mizuno a 
training director for a private japanese aid group the 
organization for industrial spiritual and cultural advancement 
negros authorities have appointed a team to negotiate mizunos 
release but no talks have been held 
last week the philippine military said troops arrested 10 
members of a rebel assassination squad and seized documents 
indicating the guerrillas plan to target foreigners 
military sources said the assassination list included one 
american but they refused to reveal his name 
diplomatic sources speaking on condition of anonymity said one 
american embassy staffer was spirited out the country this month 
the us embassy estimates there are up to 140000 americans 
including 40000 affiliated with the us military in the 
philippines 
peace corps volunteers are stationed throughout the main island 
luzon and the central visayas chain including negros volunteers 
were recalled from the southern island of mindanao in 1985 because 
of lawlessness and never returned 
volunteers are involved in projects including education 
environment agriculture and community development

nelson mandela appealed to congress today to 
support the struggle for a multiracial democracy in south africa 
and said his country continues to bleed and suffocate under the 
repression of whiteminority rule 
our people continue to die to this day victims of armed 
agents of the state who are still determined to turn their guns 
against the very idea of a racial democracy the south african 
black leader told a rapt audience of lawmakers diplomats and 
cabinet officers in the house of representatives chamber 
mandela was interrupted by standing applause several times once 
when he said the us economic sanctions against south africa 
should not be lifted now the purpose for which they were imposed 
has not been achieved 
mandela did not specifically address his support of violence as 
a lastresort alternative in the struggle for freedom but he 
reminded his audience of the many americans who died for freedom in 
the revolutionary war the civil war and two world wars 
mandela was greeted with prolonged applause as he made his way 
into the chamber he beamed a wide smile as he mounted the podium 
despite the public show of support for mandela some members did 
not attend as a show of protest over mandelas support for cuba 
libya and the palestine liberation organization and his backing of 
armed struggle 
conservative rep william dannemeyer rcalif said he 
boycotted the speech as a matter of principle rep larry 
smith dfla also stayed away 
rep william broomfield rmich said he was disappointed 
mandela continued to advocate armed struggle who is the real 
nelson mandela he asked 
but other praised the speech its an extraordinary day 
said rep ron dellums dcalif he said lawmakers heard a 
magnificent black man speak powerfully and eloquently as a man 
of peace 
in his speech mandela said we would be fools to believe that 
the road ahead of us is without major hurdles too many among our 
white compatriots are slaves in the ideology of racism to admit 
easily that change must come 
he added pointedly for those who care to worry about 
violence in our country as we do it is at these forces that they 
should focus their attention 
he credited the economic sanctions in place against south africa 
for contributing to his release from prison after 27 years and 
said they should remain in place until a new constitution is passed 
and democratic elections held 
and he clearly preferred to talk of his vision of a peaceful 
future 
let us keep our arms locked together so that we form a solid 
phalanx against racism to ensure that that day comes now by our 
common actions let us ensure that justice triumphs without delay 
envisioning a day when the whiteminority government has been 
replaced mandela said the countrys economy must be transformed 
but addressing administration concerns about his socialist 
economic views mandela said the anc holds no ideological 
positions which dictate that it must adopt a policy of 
nationalization 
mandela asked for resources for the anc even though us 
officials say president bush has been reluctant to provide direct 
financial support for the anc because the group has refused to 
renounce violence 
here we have friends here we have fighters against racism who 
feel hurt because we are hurt who seek our success because we 
too seek the victory of democracy over tyranny 
in their struggle for democracy mandela said black south 
africans are following the examples of george washington abraham 
lincoln and thomas jefferson as well as black american leaders 
like martin luther king jr 
our people demand democracy our country which continues to 
bleed and suffocate needs democracy he said 
mandela had a separate breakfast meeting with members of the 
congressional black caucus and singer harry belafonte 
later several thousand jubilant people gathered for a noontime 
rally to honor mandela on pennsylvania avenue although organizers 
said mandela might stop he did not waving instead from his 
limousine 
mandela who met with bush on monday was wrapping up his visit 
to washington later in the day after several other public 
appearances including an afternoon outdoor rally and an evening 
speech to a crowd that paid 10 or 25 per ticket in between he 
was meeting with congressional leaders 
he was traveling to atlanta on wednesday the next stop on his 
eightcity tour of the united states 
mandela 71 was honored at a dinner monday night hosted by 
sens david boren dokla chairman of the senate intelligence 
committee and terry sanford dnc 
meanwhile monday senate leaders decided to postpone a 
procedural vote on a civil rights bill opposed by the 
administration scheduled for today republicans complained that 
the vote was a ploy by democrats to embarrass them during mandelas

west germany unveiled proposals 
tuesday to unify the two germanys politically by middecember and 
finally end the countries 40year split along cold war lines 
the proposals in the form of a discussion paper released by 
the west german interior ministry were made public just five days 
before the two countries merge their economies and social 
institutions 
under proposed wording for a treaty on political unification 
east germany would officially join west germany the day after 
elections for a joint german parliament west and east german 
politicians have proposed dec 9 or dec 16 as possible dates for 
the balloting 
west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he 
expected the east german cabinet to decide wednesday to begin 
negotiations on the political treaty he added that the pact should 
be ready for debate in both parliaments by early september 
the parliaments of both countries last week ratified a treaty 
outlining the monetary economic and social union that is to take 
effect sunday on that day the west german mark officially 
replaces the nearly worthless east german mark and 40 years of 
rigid socialist economic policy give way to freemarket rules 
the victors and vanquished from world war ii are still working 
on the international ramifications of german unity namely the 
military posture of a united germany and the disposition of the 
380000 soviet troops on east german soil 
west germany is a member of the western nato alliance and the 
allies have insisted a united germany remain there the soviets 
have rejected that idea east germany has been the most 
strategically important member of the sovietled warsaw pact as 
the first line of defense against the west 
the discussion paper notes that the socalled twoplusfour 
talks among the world war ii victors and the germanys are expected 
to be concluded by december and that the political treaty is 
conditional on the results of those talks 
other proposed articles of the political treaty declare that the 
five prewar states that now comprise east germany as well as the 
city of berlin would be individual states under a united germany 
proposed wording for a third article of the treaty says 
germans in both parts of germany will form a united nation of 
people 
bonn wants to limit the political treaty to only those laws and 
regulations that differ between east and west germany and that must 
be changed before political unification can be achieved 
issues which initially could be left unresolved include the 
countries differing abortion laws schaeuble told west german 
reporters 
in west germany a woman must prove medical necessity or 
financial hardship to have an abortion in east germany abortions 
are free on demand in the first trimester of pregnancy 
schaeuble also suggested it was not absolutely necessary for 
political parties in both parts of germany to have the same minimum 
election requirements in a joint election 
in west germany political parties must receive at least 5 
percent of the total vote for representation in parliament there 
is no such limit in east germany and politicians there have been 
arguing for a limit lower than 5 percent so that their parties are 
not at such a disadvantage in a united german election 
schaeuble also told reporters monday night that he wanted to 
have representatives of the european economic community observe the 
negotiations on a final unification treaty 
in a related development west german finance minister theo 
waigel in east berlin on tuesday said quick unification is 
important because of the unstable situation in the soviet union 
waigel in an apparent reference to president mikhail s 
gorbachevs uncertain grip on events in his turbulent nation said 
we need to go through the door to unification because it can 
close shut again

experts say some of the drugs sent to soviet 
armenia for victims of the 1988 earthquake were useless or even 
dangerous and they say there could be similar problems with 
emergency supplies now being sent to iran 
supplies sent to armenia included pharmaceuticals that came from 
stocks of expired drugs and others of a type no longer sold 
according to an article in the lancet a respected british medical 
journal 
the quantities of expired and useless drugs are especially 
worrying the june 9 issue said the supply of massive amounts 
of drugs for the purpose of humanitarian aid still represents a 
good way of disposing of stocks of expired drugs or of those that 
are normally no longer marketable 
the article was wriiten dr philippe autier an epidemiologist 
and researcher in public health for the european association for 
health and development also contributing to the article were 
members of doctors without borders a french humanitarian group 
and the soviet armenian ministry of health 
we know exactly the same problems are happening now in iran 
autier said in a telephone interview monday 
adam kellettlong a spokesman for the british red cross said 
his organization was sending its first shipment of drugs to iran on 
tuesday after receiving a list of needed medication and supplies 
his organization only has sent drugs that are requested bu iran 
iranian officials said more than 130 planes had arrived since 
sunday carrying supplies and medicines 
unlike armenia iran is much more controlled the iranian red 
crescent has been very strict on what it will accept but of course 
there are a lot of other groups and countries involved which may 
not be taking the same care said kelletlong 
after the armenian earthquake on dec 7 1988 which killed 
25000 people international relief agencies and governments rushed 
in 5000 tons of drugs consumable medical supplies and other 
equipment the report said 
medical workers needed injectable painkillers like morphine 
antibiotics anesthetics intravenous fluids syringes and needles 
the same supplies now needed in iran a major quake killed in 
iran on thursday killed at least 50000 people according to 
officials 
drugs worth about 55 million were sent to armenia but only 
about 30 percent of them were available when they were most needed 
because they arrived unsorted and were impossible to identify the 
lancet report said 
none of the boxes was labeled in armenian and few in russian it 
said in 24 warehouses in the armenian capital of yerevan 238 
kinds of antibiotics were labeled in 21 languages it said 
in spitak the most badly affected area pharmacists wasted 
about twothirds of their time merely looking for and identifying 
useful drugs among the relief parcels the report said 
autier said experts know that only 30 to 40 types of medicines 
are commonly needed in most earthquake relief efforts 
about 11 percent of the drugs were useless including nasal 
spray and drugs for treating tropical diseases such as malaria it 
said 
eight percent of the drugs had expired by the time they arrived 
the report said some of these drugs such as tetracycline were 
potentially dangerous 
for a year following the catastrophe the armenian ministry 
worked with doctors without borders making an inventory of the 
drugs 
by the end of their work about 21 percent of the drugs were set 
to expire or already had expired

donald trumps bankers have approved a 30day 
20 million loan after agreeing in principle to a bigger longterm 
financial rescue for the cashstrapped developer a source said 
today 
an immediate 20 million cash infusion will enable trump to make 
necessary bond payments while finishing touches are placed on a 
complex 65 million bailout a participant in the negotiations said 
the source who spoke on condition that his name not be used 
said it could take anywhere from 30 to 60 days to draw up the final 
documents on the financial package intended to shore up trumps 
empire 
a spokesman for trump dan klores refused to comment on the 
report of a deal but said he hoped to have a statement later in the 
day 
some 65 to 70 banks and their attorneys are involved in the 
process all but one bank agreed in principle to the deal 
the german bank dresdner bank ag continued to balk but attorneys 
decided that dresdners endorsement wasnt essential 
dresdner whose 15 million loan to trump is secured by the 
first lien on the trump tower fifth avenue residential and 
commercial skyscraper has been opposed to placing a second lien on 
the building 
it was decided last night that dresdners holdout wouldnt 
prevent the deal from going forward the source said 
trump faces a midnight deadline to cover principal and interest 
payments due on bonds sold to finance the trump castle hotel and 
casino in atlantic city nj the process of making those payments 
began today after seven key banks extended the 20 million bridge 
loan to trump 
trump had missed a june 15 deadline for the casino bond payment 
but a 10day grace period extended the time to tonight a 
declaration of default could allow creditors to seize various trump 
properties used as collateral to back the bonds and other loans 
and could affect his licenses to run casinos in atlantic city 
trump also is overdue on a 30 million bank loan payment to a 
group led by manufacturers hanover trust 
in spite of the german banks continued reluctance to accept the 
bailout it was considered possible that dresdner might eventually 
agree to go in on the deal during the time it takes to complete the 
paperwork the source said 
the longterm 65 million bailout and debt restructuring package 
contains numerous stipulations including a requirement that trump 
sell assets to raise cash the source involved in the negotiations 
said the agreement didnt specify which properties trump must sell 
under the plan the banks reportedly would extend trump 65 
million to meet any payments due and would suspend some payments on 
his 2 billion in bank loans in exchange for equity in some of his 
properties 
the new loan package reportedly would contain tough restrictions 
on how much the freespending trump could spend on charitable 
contributions and personal and household expenses some published 
reports earlier in the week had said that the tentative agreement 
limited his spending to 450000 per month in the first year less 
in subsequent years 
the loan package also reportedly requires trump to stick to a 
business plan hire a chief financial officer adopt a system of 
accounting controls and change accounting firms

nelson mandela drove by his biggest open rally 
in the nations capital tuesday without stopping 
the african national congress leader had not been scheduled to 
address the several thousand people who gathered in downtown 
washington but rally organizers had hoped he would halt his 
motorcade when he saw the jubilant crowd and hundreds of balloons 
i thought there was going to be a little more said one 
young woman who waited in the hot sun to catch a glimpse of mandela 
on his way from the us capitol 
the mans tired said another woman who had waited through 
several speeches by local politicians 
the hastily arranged rally caused a rift between mandela aides 
who saw the washington stop as an important working visit and local 
activists who wanted to celebrate his presence in a city that is 
watching its mayor stand trial on drug charges 
but mandelas car and twoblock motorcade pressed on down the 
same route taken by presidential inaugural motorcades and mandela 
only waved from behind a closed window 
two white south african tourists ian and karin wood joined the 
crowd on pennsylvania avenue were really anxious to see him 
weve heard so much about him and he has such an aura said ian 
wood 
this brings us together said councilwoman nadine winter 
who had pushed for the noontime celebration its something 
positive something we can feel good about 
police had no immediate estimate on how many people had gathered 
at freedom plaza across from city hall or how many were lining the 
motorcade route but there appeared to be several thousand along 
the streets who watched the brief parade it was just a nice 
motorcade not really a parade said dc police lieutenant 
reginald smith 
winter organized the event after all 19000 seats for in a 
ticketsonly rally tuesday night were sold

shut away in a small room on the banks of the 
thames a group of diplomats haggled tuesday over an international 
accord to save the ozone layer 
they met through the weekend and until late tuesday preparing 
for a meeting in november of environment ministers and other 
officials from nearly 100 countries that meeting may for the first 
time impose an international ban on a group of chemicals that 
threatens the planet 
the threeday ministerial conference also will consider a 
proposal to create an international fund to help developing 
countries pay the high price for technology that could help the 
ozone layer 
conference sources said the diplomats were close to agreement on 
such a fund which the united states opposed until two weeks ago 
in small working groups they have been banging heads over how 
decisions will be made for the fund and over who will pay the 
estimated 2 billion to 7 billion bill to eliminate 
ozonedepleting chemicals 
the fund would be a milestone in green diplomacy and could 
serve as a model for future accounts that will be needed to pay for 
solving other environmental problems such as global warming 
world leaders are set to debate global warming a result of the 
socalled greenhouse effect at a november conference in geneva 
everyone is very tired said one diplomat speaking 
privately between meetings in a room at the international maritime 
organization but what we are doing has never been done before 
establishing an environmental agreement with money to back it up 
the ministers work if successful will extend and strengthen 
the montreal protocol of 1987 already considered an environmental 
watershed 
acting with unusual speed 56 nations agreed in september 1987 
to cut the use of chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs in half by 1996 
last year in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence on 
the effect of cfcs on the ozone layer 81 nations decided in 
principle to ban them by the year 2000 
in london the ministers will debate whether to move up the ban 
to 1997 and at what speed to phase out the chemicals the 12nation 
european community along with scandinavia australia and new 
zealand wants to move up the ban the united states and japan are 
opposed 
the signatories to the montreal protocol also hope to persuade 
more developing nations to sign it especially india and china 
which account for 40 percent of the world population and could be 
major cfc users 
both say they wont sign unless the rich nations help pay for 
the more expensive chemicals to replace cfcs 
cfcs used in aerosol sprays refrigerators foams and cleaning 
solvents destroy ozone 
ozone is a gas thinly sprinkled through the stratosphere that 
filters out harmful ultraviolet rays scientists say that without 
ozone life on earth would die 
higher ultraviolet radiation damages the human immune system 
causes skin cancer and cataracts harms crops and disrupts sea life 
the ministers are likely to agree to ban halons and carbon 
tetrachloride in addition to cfcs by the year 2000 both are used 
in firefighting 
scientific studies overwhelmingly show the ozone layer will not 
be fully restored unless all the severely damaging chemicals are 
banned worldwide and some of the less harmful substitutes are 
strictly controlled 
environmentalists and conference observers say the stakes extend 
beyond the meeting they say negotiations on ozone which are 
backed by a strong international consensus are a trial run for 
tougher battles looming over global warming

the vatican on tuesday ruled out public 
dissent by theologians striking at those challenging papal 
authority and the churchs ban on birth control 
saying the church has suffered serious harm from open 
criticism the congregation for the doctrine of the faith ordered 
theologians to uphold its moral teaching or keep quiet 
to succumb to the temptation of dissent is to allow the 
leaven of infidelity to the holy spirit to start to work the 
commission said in a 28page document approved by pope john paul ii 
the document was expected to draw sharp criticism from liberal 
catholics who have charged that the vatican is quietly extending 
the scope of church teachings treated as infallible and displaying 
an authoritarian attitude 
the document defended punishments meted out to dissidents in 
recent years and declared that adherence to church doctrine is not 
a matter of free speech 
it also affirmed the right of the church to speak out on issues 
of sexual morality rejecting the idea that its voice should be 
limited to economic and social issues 
west german cardinal josef ratzinger the head of the 
congregation and the popes main guardian of orthodoxy told a news 
conference the document was a response to a climate of conflict 
fomented by dissident theologians 
these include a group of 170 germanspeaking theology professors 
from four countries who publicly criticized the pope last year 
their statement known as the cologne declaration attacked john 
paul for his opposition to artificial birth control and his use of 
authority particularly his choice of conservative bishops 
ratzinger said preparation of his instruction on the ecclesial 
vocation of the theologian began before the cologne declaration 
but he said the german protest was an expression of the same 
tensions that prompted the writing of his document 
ratzinger rejected dissent as a legitimate form of expression 
describing it instead as a political ploy for power in the church 
during the popes 11year papacy several theologians have een 
punished for straying from church positions they include the rev 
hans kung of switzerland who was stripped of his right to teach 
theology in 1979 and the rev charles e curran barred from 
teaching at catholic university in washington dc in 1987 
the vatican document acknowledged theologians might in some 
cases question the timeliness the form or even the contents 
of some church teaching in that event they should try to resolve 
the differences in dialogue with bishops it said 
in cases like these the theologian should avoid turning to 
the mass media for it is not by seeking to exert the pressure 
of public opinion that one contributes to the clarification of 
doctrinal issues and renders service to the truth 
if the theologian still cannot accept the teaching he should 
keep his objections to himself the document said 
such a situation can certainly prove a difficult trial it 
said it can be a call to suffer for the truth in silence and 
prayer but with the certainty that if the truth really is at 
stake it will ultimately prevail 
asked whether theologians could publish books or articles 
espousing dissident views ratzinger said they should take their 
case to the competent forum in the church 
stressing the collaboration between theology and official church 
teaching the document noted theologians take an oath of fidelity 
binding them to present doctrine in its integrity and with full 
accuracy 
the theologian who is not disposed to think with the church 
contradicts the commitment he freely and knowingly accepted to

chafets author of three other books describes the racial 
polarization in metropolitan detroit between the majority black 
central city of 1 million people and the suburbs whose 32 million

a federal judge says the rev donald wildmon 
must stop using a pamphlet to support his groups antipornography 
campaign because it misrepresents the artists work and may harm 
the artists reputation 
the judge however said wildmons tupelo missbased american 
family association could use the pamphlets if it makes it clear the 
pictures being used were only fragments and not the artists entire 
work 
the case was brought to us district court in manhattan after 
east village artist david wojnarowicz learned the organization was 
distributing pamphlets with pieces of his work taken from much 
larger collages 
one picture taken from a multilayered work shows christ with a 
hypodermic needle in his arm 
wildmons group mailed out about 6000 pamphlets to members of 
congress clergy and media outlets to bolster its view that the 
national endowment for the arts supports pornography 
the nea gave the illinois state university galleries a 15000 
grant which they used to hold a wojnarowicz retrospective last 
winter and publish a catalogue containing his work 
after viewing wojnarowiczs work wildmon said i kind of got 
sick to my stomach he testified at a oneday trial that he was 
angry and upset because tax dollars went to help pay for some of 
this 
wojnarowicz claimed the pamphlet was a gross distortion of his 
work and filed a 1 million damage lawsuit charging the pamphlet 
violated copyright laws 
judge william c conner on monday agreed in part with 
wojnarowicz and issued a temporary injunction saying the afa could 
not use the pamphlet as it was 
the pamphlet could be construed by reasonable persons as 
misrepresenting the work of the artist with bringing harm to the 
artists reputation and to the value of his works the judge said 
wildmons attorney benjamin w bull objected to the ruling he 
said the pamphlet was protected by the first amendments freedom of 
speech 
the judge said the pamphlet could be used if it contained a 
clarifying statement 
conner said he would rule next month on the monetary and 
copyright infringement complaints 
wildmon and his group have for years led the conservative 
campaigns against films music television shows magazines and art 
that they deem obscene 
i consider this to be a vindication of sorts the artist 
said after the judge issued mondays ruling 
i didnt know mr wojnarowicz personally and had no knowledge 
of him wildmon said outside court the whole thing we have 
done is try to address the issue of government support of this kind 
of art i had no malice toward mr wojnarowicz

minorities for the first time make up more than 
half the citys resident labor force a milestone that raises stark 
challenges for new yorks social and economic future researchers 
said tuesday 
its a historic moment in the life of the city minorities 
have become the majority of new yorkers in the labor market said 
samuel ehrenhalt regional chief of the federal bureau of labor 
statistics 
ehrenhalt who reported the trend said it will increase 
pressure on the city to better educate black and hispanic youths 
other researchers said it will gradually force employers to open 
management jobs to minorities 
its a signpost on a difficult path of necessary change 
said john mollenkopf a political scientist at the graduate center 
of city university it points to a future that we all have to 
recognize and embrace 
the labor bureau reached its conclusion after analyzing its 
monthly employment surveys for 1989 it found that nonhispanic 
whites made up 497 percent of the resident labor force under half 
for the first time 
outoftown residents who work in the city mainly whites 
were not included in the analysis 
demographers say the citys population has been less than half 
white since the early or mid1980s it now is estimated at about 47 
percent but never before has the labor force residents ages 16 
or older who are working or looking for work reached that point 
ehrenhalt said the arrival of black hispanic and asian 
immigrants is the prime reason for the trend the white population 
is about stable and the number of nativeborn blacks and hispanics 
has grown only slowly 
immigrants are playing a bigger role in new york city than 
they have at any time in the past threequarters of a century 
ehrenhalt said he said the trend will continue as the white 
population ages and leaves the workforce 
that underscores the need to encourage a more rapid and 
purposeful move of minorities into the educational and occupational 
mainstream ehrenhalt said the city economy will need them as 
never before 
lack of a highschool education is higher among minorities than 
among white residents ehrenhalt noted and minority unemployment 
remains far higher 96 percent in 1989 compared with 41 percent 
for whites 
education is not the only issue mollenkopf said the trend 
increases the demands on employers to open fuller job opportunities 
to minority workers now minorities often hold lowerpaying 
clerical jobs while senior management is virtually all white he 
said 
the labor bureaus figures supported the point while 36 percent 
of working whites held managerial professional and technical jobs 
that fell to 24 percent of blacks and 15 percent of hispanics and 
hispanic workers were concentrated in the declining manufacturing 
sector largely in semiskilled and unskilled jobs 
the citys strength is in service jobs said mollenkopf and 
the higher echelons of these service firms are still basically all 
white they have to come to grips with the fact that the citys 
labor force is multiracial they put themselves at a disadvantage 
if they resist that

the national organization for women said 
tuesday the us political process is unresponsive to women 
minorities and young people and named a panel of prominent 
americans to help improve it 
we have many many obstacles to overcome said now president 
molly yard there are many groups that agree that its time 
to take another look at our democracy 
yard said there were too few women minority or young 
officeholders and politicians now in power arent addressing the 
concerns of those groups 
the commission for responsive democracy stems from a resolution 
adopted last year at the national now conference it created a stir 
because it was interpreted as a call for a third political party 
yard said tuesday that a third party was only one option to be 
considered at six regional hearings by the commission which 
includes two past thirdparty presidential candidates 
we intend to be openminded she said our conclusions 
will depend upon what we hear the whole history of third parties 
has clearly been important in the development of american political 
life 
she said the republican party descended from a third party 
george wallaces thirdparty presidential bid forced both major 
parties to the right and the national womans party at the 
beginning of the century is cited by some as the reason women won 
the right to vote 
asked about the reaction of the democratic and republican 
parties to the commission yard said she hoped they would testify 
and welcome whatever recommendations the panel develops 
surely no political leader in this country believes we have a 
perfect system she said if they do theyre like rip van 
winkle and havent waked up from their sleep yet 
yard cited the difficulty of raising money and defeating 
incumbents as two major problems for women and minorities she said 
low voter turnout was a sign that people are unhappy with political 
leadership on issues ranging form defense and the environment to 
social welfare programs and the savings and loan bailout 
in addition to the thirdparty option the now commission is 
expected to examine proposals such as setting up a shadow cabinet 
eliminating political action committees public financing of 
elections reforms in the use of television during campaigns and 
mail and sameday registration of voters 
the commission is scheduled to report its recommendations at 
nows 1991 convention next summer 
among the panel members are rose bird former chief justice of 
the california supreme court former us attorney general ramsey 
clark former new mexico gov toney anaya former presidential 
candidates john anderson and barry commoner essayist barbara 
ehrenreich and poet robin morgan and retired rear adm gene la

checking fees have jumped 28 percent in seven 
years with the typical holder of a regular account paying 108 a 
year according to a consumer group survey released tuesday 
the consumer federation of america said fees on regular 
noninterest checking accounts averaged 10796 while fees on 
interestpaying now accounts averaged 11139 
compared with a similar survey in 1988 regular checking account 
fees are up 67 percent while now account fees rose 64 percent 
compared with the groups first survey in 1983 regular fees are 28 
percent higher and now fees 623 percent greater 
the consumer group collected information in march from 170 banks 
and savings institutions in 16 states and the district of columbia 
comparisons between 1990 and 1988 however are based only on the 
111 institutions included in both surveys 
the nonprofit group representing 240 consumer organizations 
around the country is using the survey results in its push for 
legislation requiring banks to cash government checks for 
noncustomers and to provide lowfee accounts to the poor and the 
elderly 
sen henry metzenbaum dohio is trying to attach a provision 
requiring checkcashing to housing legislation pending on the 
senate floor the house and senate banking committees are 
considering truthinsavings bills that would require financial 
institutions to disclose fee and interest rate information in a 
uniform manner 
bankers are fighting governmentimposed lowfee accounts 
arguing that there is more than enough competition among banks to 
keep fees reasonable 
banks are businesses not public utilities and their prices 
reflect their costs of doing business with a margin for profit 
the american bankers association said in a statement 
the bankers group said 59 percent of 856 banks surveyed last 
year offered special lowfee accounts for basic checking service 
ken mceldowney executive director of consumer action a san 
francisco group said banks are competing for wealthier customers 
by offering high interest rates on certificates of deposit to 
offset the high rates banks are raising fees on smaller accounts 
he said 
in a sense low and middleincome consumers are a captive 
audience mceldowney said 
according to the survey a typical now account customer needed 
an average balance of 1180 or a minimum balance of 600 to avoid 
fees 
in calculating average fees the consumer group assumed that the 
typical account had an average balance of 400 falling to 200 
once a month it assumed 10 checks four withdrawals from automatic 
teller machines and two deposits a month as well as two bounced 
checks and one returned deposit per year 
monthly fees averaged 511 for regular checking accounts and 
596 for now accounts percheck fees averaged 27 cents for 
regular accounts and 26 cents for now accounts bounced check fees 
averaged 15 and returned deposits 485 the average interest paid 
on now accounts was 497 percent

the plight of frogs wounded in a 
debrisclogged creek prompted a group of fourthgraders to spring 
into action cleaning the stream and performing first aid on the 
amphibians 
then they wrote a 36page report on the incident earning a 
presidential award for excellence certificate and qualifying 
for a national competition run by the us environmental protection 
agency 
they were very excited they really felt that they made some 
mark said thomas j kennedy science teacher to the six boys who 
wrote let the frogs leap again chronicling their clean up 
tenyearold daniel doerpholz one of the first to get involved 
said he and a friend from mosier elementary school had played in 
the creek behind their house for some time when they noticed last 
fall that the frogs were dying 
they were getting cut up on everything they were dying from 
all the pollution he said tuesday 
the boys tried some first aid on frogs cut by rusted pipes and 
broken glass and put tags around the rescued frogs to keep track of 
them 
daniel and his friend phillip bernier began hauling trash out 
of the creek and then learned from kennedy that they could turn 
their afterschool hobby into an entry for the epa competition 
in relation to cleaning up they did that on their saturdays 
and after school they stayed after school with me sometimes for 
two hours and they sat there and we brainstormed kennedy said 
the two boys called on four other friends and they came up with 
some solutions to the problem of trash in the stream one solution 
was to wrap a plastic grid over a pipe allowing water to flow 
through while trapping trash 
some untested ideas detailed in the report included using 
hamsters to power a water wheel to stir up the water lifting trash 
to the top and rigging a pulley system to lift the trash away off 
the surface 
their efforts were rewarded with the award certificates and 
entry into the national competition the presidential youth 
environment awards which will be judged later this year said 
evelyn sullivan of the epas boston office 
if projects are worthwhile then i encourage them to enter 
the national competition and thats pretty much what i did she 
said 
daniels mother sue doerpholz said she didnt realize how 
serious the children were until she saw the report this spring 
i knew that he and his buddy phillip would go down there and i 
thought they were just goofing off then he came home one day with 
all this paperwork she said 
kennedy said hes proud of his students 
i have three college degrees but the brightest people ive 
ever seen in relation to new ideas is 9 and 10yearolds who 
really have some great ideas kennedy said

irans fractious leaders turned a relief 
operation for victims of a catastrophic earthquake into a political 
dispute tuesday with parliament insisting the west cannot buy 
forgiveness with humanitarian aid 
in northwestern provinces weary rescuers dug through the 
remnants of 342 cities towns and villages demolished in thursdays 
temblor another quake measuring 49 on the richter scale shook 
southeastern iran on tuesday but caused no casualties or damage 
tehran universitys geophysics center reported 
officials have said 50000 people were killed 200000 were 
injured and 500000 others lost their homes on thursday when a 
quake measure 73 to 77 on the richter scale hit iran many of the 
reported 360 aftershocks have hampered rescue operations 
interior minister abdullah nouri who supervised relief 
operations told a news conference that an accurate casualty count 
was not yet possible he said 99 percent of the bodies have been 
recovered in roundtheclock operations by local rescuers backed 
by foreign relief teams and sniffer dogs 
the official islamic republic news agency said 171 planeloads of 
relief supplies had arrived by tuesday from more than 26 countries 
including some of irans bitterest foes 
nouri a middleranking cleric in president hashemi rafsanjanis 
political camp thanked all those who sent relief teams and aid and 
said if new relief teams are willing to come to iran on 
humanitarian grounds they are welcome 
nouri like rafsanjani is considered a pragmatist who favors 
improved ties with the west 
but in parliament hardline deputies said the aid will not buy 
closer relations with the west or nullify positions taken by 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini those stands include the february 1989 
death threat to british author salman rushdie for offending some 
moslems in his novel the satanic verses 
one deputy ayatollah saddegh khalkhali said quake aid from the 
united states iraq and saudi arabia was appreciated but iran 
could not forget our martyrs 
we cannot forgive the killing of 300 people on the airbus or 
the 400 at mecca the highranking cleric said 
he was referring to the us downing in july 1989 of an iranian 
jetliner that killed all 290 aboard the navy said the jetliner was 
mistaken for a warplane 
more than 400 moslem pilgrims most of them iranians died when 
saudi troops opened fire on a demonstration in mecca in july 1987 
house speaker hojatoleslam mahdi karrubi told parliament the 
dispute between the islamic republic and saudi arabia is a rooted 
and fundamental quarrel between americanstyle islam and the 
genuine islam of prophet mohammed 
there is no compromise in this dispute 
his deputy hossein hashemia said we hate having relations 
with those countries because what those countries did to our nation 
was worse than the earthquake 
the parliament known for its fierce opposition to ties with the 
west is struggling with rafsanjanis pragmatists who advocate 
closer ties to help iran recover from its eightyear war with iraq 
western diplomats said the aid gives rafsanjanis faction a 
means of pushing the opening with the west if opponents argued too 
loudly they would seem to be opposing the policy of getting as 
much aid as possible to the victims one western diplomat said 
in earthquakedevastated gilan province provincial police chief 
gholamreza gohari said the people were satisfied with the aid and 
it would improve irans links to the west 
but one customs inspector examining a pen offered by a visiting 
america growled we dont need a pen just give us back our 
assets referring to billions held in us banks since the 1979 
seizure of the us embassy in tehran 
editorials in irans leading newspapers this week on the aid 
highlighted the split in attitudes 
jomhuri islami the main publication of the radicals on sunday 
wrote our people even under the rubble chant death to 
america and demand the almighty god to curtail the us 
planseven those hands stretched to help 
another paper noted sunday that the 1 million or 2 million in 
us aid was far lower than the salary paid to actor sylvestor 
stallone for the movie rambo 
but the englishlanguage kayhan international on tuesday called 
it very selfish of a newspaper man to sit in his airconditioned 
office in tehran with his family intact to ask quake survivors to 
say down with america 
also tuesday the agriculture ministry announced that it would 
take over the harvest of the areas rice and tea crop threatened 
because so many farmers died in the quake

the soviet union is having trouble paying 2 
billion in foreign bills and needs more western credits to help 
make the transition to a market economy a government spokesman 
said tuesday 
if we have credits it will be easier for us to have economic 
reform foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told 
reporters 
were experiencing come commercial difficulties now 
gerasimov said our perfectly immaculate record on the external 
market of always paying our debts is now under question 
he quoted the soviet state bank president viktor gerashchenko 
as saying the soviet union has a current accounts deficit the 
difference between cash on hand and outstanding bills of 2 
billion 
this is due to several factors including the disruption 
involved in the transition from central planning to a market 
economy he said 
european community leaders meeting in dublin this week agreed to 
have the communitys executive commission undertake a study of 
moscows needs but they refused to grant immediate aid to the 
soviets 
gerasimov said the soviet union needs more western economic 
credits like the 31 billion west german bank credit backed by 
west germany at the dublin meeting 
the soviet unions economic potential should be sufficient 
collateral to guarantee repayment of largescale economic credits 
he said 
its not aid its credit he said this credit must be 
returned must be paid back with interest 
to pay them back with interest we must work harder so its 
just a kind of input to our perestroika he said referring to 
president mikhail s gorbachevs program of economic reform 
there are no detailed plans to implement large infusions of 
foreign credits gerasimov said the lack of such a plan is a 
little bit of danger but it is premature to worry about it now 
he said 
according to the soviet business weekly commersant deliveries 
from foreign firms worth up to 500 million have gone unpaid since 
october 1989 similar debts have been run up before but they were 
always taken care of by credits from the foreign economic bank it 
said 
many foreign companies have been giving their soviet partners 
more time to make good on their debts 
a western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
the soviet current account debt has been steadily growing as 
imports continue to surpass exports a 2 billion debt is not 
surprisingly large to economists familiar with the soviet economy 
he said 
the total soviet foreign debt is thought to be about 3 billion 
some estimates have run as high as 8 billion

the bush administration today announced 
partial plans for protecting the rare northern spotted owl at the 
cost of at least 1000 logging jobs in the northwest 
but for the second time in less than a week officials delayed 
issuing a complete blueprint designed to save the bird without 
devastating the regions timber industry 
the admininstration is deeply concerned both about endangered 
speies and the livelihood of families in the pacific northwest who 
depend on timber production agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter said 
yeutter and interior secretary manuel lujan jr appeared at a 
news conference to discuss their plans to save the estimated 6000 
owls which were declared a threatened species under the endangered 
species act last week 
lujan and yeutter said the bureau of land management will 
implement a plan that will result in the loss of 1000 jobs due to 
reduce timber harvests on blm lands in oregon and northern 
california 
but they called for formation of a government committee to come 
up with a specific plan to protect the owl on forest service land 
today we have set into motion a process to balance our 
responsibility in preserving the owl and forests while protecting 
the economic lives of american men and women who live and work in 
the region he said 
an earlier proposal by government scientists would have resulted 
in the loss of 7600 jobs as a result of reductions in blm harvests 
and the loss of another 20000 jobs by the end of the decade as a 
result of reductions in forest service harvests 
lujan said the blm proposal will protect 125 more pairs of owls 
than would the proposal offered by the government scientists led 
by forest service biologist jack ward thomas 
that panel would have taken about 3 million acres out of 
production some 25 million of that from the forest service lujan 
and yeutter had no acreage estimates today 
lujan said annual blm harvests in the region would drop from 950 
million board feet to about 750 million compared with the 500 
million envisioned under the recommendations of the scientific 
panel 
the forest service will operate under existing forest plans 
until the new timber task force can come up with an interim 
conservation proposal for the owl 
under the earlier recommendations of the government scientists 
harvests in the region would have been cut back to between 23 
billion and 25 billion board feet 
the fish and wildlife service last friday announced its decision 
to classify the owl as a threatened species entitled to protection 
under the endangered species act the same law that has protected 
the grizzly bear and bald eagle 
members of congress expressed fears that environmentalists would 
go to court to halt logging if they were dissatisfied with the 
administrations recommendations 
other lawmakers said congress ultimately would try to write its 
own protection plan possibly embracing greater environmental 
protection and less concern for the timber industry 
biologists say each nesting pair of owls needs a large tract of 
undisturbed oldgrowth forest estimates of the owl population 
range from 3000 to 5000 pairs 
a government scientific panel proposed in april to give the owl 
protection throughout its range of oregon washington and northern 
california 
its recommendations would take more than 3 million acres of 
previously unprotected national forests out of production cut 
federal harvests in the northwest nearly in half and result in the 
estimated loss of more than 28000 jobs by the end of the decade

block the jailing of a television reporter who refused to disclose 
his sources in a murder story 
kmoltv reporter brian karem said he would probably surrender

garcia ruled against him and ordered him to give the notes to 
defense and prosecution lawyers garcia also refused to delay the 
jail sentence while karem appealed 
an arrest warrant was issued monday the 5th us circuit court 
of appeals on tuesday also refused to delay the sentence while an 
appeal is pending 
it bothers me very deeply karem said tuesday just the 
way the first amendment has been trampled on really bothers 
me 
the sources named in the notes karem said helped him obtain a 
jailhouse interview with henry david hernandez 25 who is accused 
with his brother julian of killing san antonio police officer 
gary lee williams in the interview hernandez said he shot the 
officer last march in selfdefense 
lawyers say they must have the identity of karems sources in 
order to give the brothers a fair trial they are scheduled to 
stand trial in november

the bush administration is willing to send a 
second plane load of relief supplies to earthquake victims in iran 
and is waiting to hear what is needed us officials said tuesday 
meanwhile a private group of iranian expatriates plans to fly 
to tehran on saturday among them are doctors nurses and engineers 
the first load of us supplies was airlifted from pisa italy 
to iran last sunday the plane chartered for 66000 by the red 
cross under a us grant carried 225000 worth of blankets 
tents water jugs and searchandrescue equipment 
the plane picked up the equipment at leghorn italy one of five 
major relief depots maintained by the united states around the 
world 
the us relief operation is being conducted under rules 
specified by iran while accepting help it insists the aid be 
channeled through the red cross or other private relief 
organizations 
while authorities said they would not accept aid form israel or 
south africa kamal kharrazi the iranian ambassador to the united 
nations said monday that the iranian people do not have any 
problem with the american people 
in fact he said the us help might create a better atmosphere 
for relations between the united states and iran 
iranian authorities have previously referred to the united 
states as the great satan 
but the iranian foreign ministry has said the nation welcomed 
international help due to the magnitude of the earthquake in which 
at least 50000 people are said to have died with 200000 injured 
and a halfmillion homeless 
the group of expatriates known as the society for iranian 
professionals has been in negotiations with iran to provide the 
kind of professional help the country has declined to accept from 
foreign governments 
us officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the 
doctors nurses engineers and other professionals will leave 
washington on saturday 
the officials said a second plane load of us supplies would be 
dispatched once iran makes clear through switzerland and other 
intermediaries what kind of assistance it requires 
as soon as we hear from them we will help an official said 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said 
that the united states is interested in helping in a very tragic 
situation politics dont enter into it 
the united states broke relations with iran in 1980 after the 
seizure of the us embassy and the taking of american hostages in 
november 1979 six americans are now being held hostage in lebanon 
by militants believed to be under iranian influence

democratic and republican senators reached 
agreement with the bush administration tuesday on key elements of a 
major housing bill that had been stalled in the senate since last 
week senate and administration sources said 
the agreement came in a meeting with housing and urban 
development secretary jack kemp and senators including sen alan 
cranston dcalif the principal sponsor of the housing bill 
the agreement to be detailed at a news conference wednesday 
clears the way for the senate to resume debate on the nearly 18 
billion bill probably on wednesday 
the senate debated the bill for five days last week before it 
was shoved aside with senate majority leader george mitchell 
saying he would await the outcome of negotiations with the 
administration before pressing for a vote 
a key stumbling block to an agreement had been the bush 
administrations proposals for increasing down payment requirements 
as part of a package of reforms aimed at halting massive losses 
that threaten the federal housing administration program 
the bush administration proposed increasing premiums and upfront 
cash requirements so that fha borrowers would have to pay 
twothirds of closing costs at the time of purchase sen alfonse 
damato rny proposed going further by requiring a 5 percent 
down payment on loans over 5000 adding a premium over the life 
of the loan and requiring that all closing costs be paid at the 
beginning of the loan without being financed 
cranston had proposed another plan that he said would shore up 
the fha program without increasing down payment requirements 
the agreement included provisions for merging the 
administrations plan for helping public housing tenants to 
purchase their homes with senate democrats proposal for a 2 
billion program to encourage local governments to rehabilitate or 
build new lowincome housing 
senate sources speaking on the condition they not be 
identified said the compromise bill emphasizes the rehabilitation 
of existing housing units and it would continue to authorize 
nearly 4 billion more in federal spending on housing than 
president bush has proposed

parliament voted overwhelmingly tuesday 
to immediately suspend hungarys activities in the warsaw pact and 
eventually withdraw from the east bloc military alliance 
the 2320 vote with four abstentions again puts hungary in 
conflict with the soviet union which wants to maintain the 
organization as a political union a similar declaration in 1956 
prompted soviet tanks to invade hungary and crush a popular 
uprising led by former premier imre nagy 
the warsaw pact has admitted that invasion was a mistake and 
tuesdays hungarian vote came the same day soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze criticized the warsaw pact for failing to 
keep pace with the times 
it is high time we understood that neither socialism nor 
friendship nor goodneighborly relations nor respect can be 
maintained with bayonets tanks and bloodshed shevardnadze was 
quoted as saying in the communist party daily pravda 
the parliament resolution called on the government to begin 
negotiations with the warsaw pacts six other members to prepare 
for the planned withdrawal 
we seek to come to agreement with all member countries on 
hungary ending membership the state mti news agency quoted the 
resolution as saying 
as a first step the resolution called on the government to 
suspend hungarys participation in the military organization 
the armed forces should not take part in joint warsaw pact 
military exercises and warsaw pact troops should not hold exercises 
in hungary mti quoted the resolution as saying 
parliament also asked the government to open talks with fellow 
member nations to review existing treaties to delete all 
references which would allow for military intervention or which 
would impinge upon hungarys sovereignty in any way 
the decision followed prime minister jozsef antalls 
announcement june 9 that hungary wants to restore full 
sovereignty over the hungarian armed forces and revamp its 
forces into a defensive organization 
neither antall nor the resolution gave a timetable for hungarys 
planned withdrawal or specified how soon officials would like to 
see a complete pullout from the warsaw pact 
early this month however defense minister lajos fuer was 
quoted by mti as saying hungary wanted to cancel its warsaw pact 
membership by late next year 
antall told reporters at the warsaw pact meeting in moscow on 
june 9 that hungarian leaders felt the military aspect of the 
pact should be dissolved by the end of 1991 
in an interview published june 9 in the west berlin newspaper 
morgenpost east germanys defense minister rainer eppelmann 
predicted the breakup of the warsaw pacts military structures this 
year 
the other warsaw pact members are bulgaria czechoslovakia east 
germany poland romania and the soviet union the alliance 
founded in 1955 has been a counterbalance to the wests north 
atlantic treaty organization 
in 1956 soviet forces suppressed a popular uprising led by 
nagy who had called for a hungary independent of the warsaw pact 
nagy and several aides were executed in 1958 following a show 
trial hungarians remained bitter at the soviets and budapests 
communist leaders 
following popular uprisings in eastern europe that toppled 
ruling communists hungary held free elections in march that 
relegated the reform communists to a minor role 
the new noncommunist government is led by antell and president 
arpad goencz who was sentenced to life in prison for his role in 
the 1956 uprising 
warsaw pact leaders in june admitted the 1956 invasion of 
hungary and a 1968 advance into czechoslovakia were grave errors 
in moscow shevardnadze followed the same theme in an article 
published in pravda 
our organization turned out to be not very perceptive of 
changes failed to keep pace with the times didnt modernize 
itself didnt perfect its military and political structures 
shevardnadze said

police killed a soviet army sergeant in a 
shootout after he kidnapped a family in an attempt to return home 
officials said tuesday 
the couple and their two children were freed unharmed but a 
police officer with an east german antiterrorist unit was injured 
by flying glass according to the government news agency adn 
the soldier was armed with a submachine gun and more than 800 
rounds of ammunition when he fled a soviet weapons garrison monday 
night in magdeburg about 50 miles west of berlin 
the soldier took the family hostage later at a campground in 
nearby burg magdeburg police chief hansjoachim stephan told adn 
police spotted the soldier at the campground but took no 
immediate action because of the number of people in the area he 
said 
the soldier fled in a car with the hostages and was later 
stopped by a police roadblock where he was killed in an exchange 
of gunfire stephan said 
the soldier apparently wanted to return to the soviet union 
because of family problems at home adn said 
the family taken hostage was being treated for shock it said 
the soviet defense ministry in a report carried by the official 
soviet news agency tass confirmed the incident and identified the 
soldier as s suvorov adn said

the ira claimed responsibility tuesday for a 
bombing at fashionable club that is a bastion of the conservative 
party and it said no government member will be safe until britain 
pulls out of northern ireland 
the bomb at the carlton club which injured nine people was the 
first directed at the party since the ira bombed the grand hotel in 
brighton during the 1984 conservative conference that attack 
killed five people and narrowly missed prime minister margaret 
thatcher 
scotland yard said it was examining videotapes taken by a 
security camera outside the club for clues to the bombers 
mrs thatcher toured the bombedout building and visited two of 
those injured in monday nights attack 
it was dreadful inhuman depraved she said they are 
trying to undermine democracy in northern ireland everyone has a 
vote and they voted to stay with the united kingdom 
in a statement issued in dublin the irish republican army said 
an active service unit struck at the heart of tory rule 
the carlton club is the rest and recreation center for the 
british government who legislate for a military occupation of the 
north of ireland the statement said 
like brighton in 1984 the ira has brought the war directly to 
those who keep the british army on the streets and in the fields of 
ireland it said while such occupation continues and the 
nationalist people face daily oppression the policymakers and 
their military arm will not be safe 
police have not said whether any bomb fragments have been found 
a spokeswoman who by custom was not identified said the extensive 
damage and instability of the 158yearold building made it 
difficult to search for evidence 
mrs thatcher said she believed the ira bombed the club to gain 
publicity during a summit in dublin of european community prime 
ministers 
home secretary david waddington who is responsible for law and 
order said the bombing and another on june 12 at the former home 
of the conservative treasurer lord mcalpine signaled a change in 
ira tactics 
whether they strike at military or civilian targets barracks 
or private homes they are attacking democracy itself and they do 
not care who is killed or injured in the process he told the 
house of commons 
two of the injured charles henry 76 a porter at the club and 
lord kaberry 82 a former vicechairman of the conservative party 
who is a member of the house of lords were hospitalized in stable 
condition tuesday a westminster hospital spokesman said 
two uniformed police officers treated for smoke inhalation were 
released tuesday the spokesman said the others including two 
american tourists were treated and released the americans were 
jane kahan 49 and jacob boaltefhuva 61 both of new york 
churchillcoleman said the device was left in a bag or parcel 
against a wall near steps inside the clubs front door probably 
within an hour of the blast 
the ira which draws its support almost entirely from roman 
catholics has stepped up its offensive in britain and continental 
europe it wants to unite the predominantly protestant province 
with the 95 percent catholic republic of ireland under socialist 
rule 
conservative party leaders said they were determined the club 
would be rebuilt as it was after being hit by german bombs in 
world war ii

a dramatic increase in smoking worldwide has been 
fostered by us trade policies that ignore the health problems 
associated with tobacco according to a report 
globally increasing tobacco use is responsible for almost 25 
million excessive or premature deaths per year almost 5 percent 
of all deaths said the report in wednesdays journal of the 
american medical association 
us trade policy is perpetuating the problem by trying to 
develop overseas especially in asia a market that is drying up 
at home said the report by the amas council on scientific affairs 
the reports recommendations included urging the nations 
largest group of physicians to lobby the us government to alter 
tobacco trade policies and imposing foreignlanguage health 
warning labels on cigarette packages for export 
a bill in congress and supported by the ama would require such 
labeling 
the us cigarette export association which represents 
manufacturers responsible for 98 percent of cigarette exports 
contends the united states has no business imposing its 
restrictions on other countries 
andrew copenhaver counsel to the cigarette export association 
said the united states is not resposible for the popularity of 
smoking overseas 
theres no evidence that consumption trends overseas are 
being affected by whether or not the us product is there 
copenhaver said 
the ama report adopted as ama policy in june 1989 said 
worldwide tobacco use has increased nearly 75 percent in the past 
20 years in 1988 alone us cigarette exports to asia increased 
75 percent the report said 
the tobacco industry ignoring longterm costs of medical 
care loss of productivity from tobaccoattributable morbidity and 
mortality continues to promote tobacco as an excellent cash 
crop the report said 
last month at a world conference on lung health meeting former 
us surgeon general c everett koop said smoking dropped 5 percent 
in the united states last year while american tobacco exports rose 
20 percent 
export of tobacco products is a moral outrage koop said 
koop said foreign advertising aimed at women and young people 
combined with a lack of warning labels cause many nonsmokers to 
take up the habit 
dr harvey estes jr an ama council member said the government 
wrongfully views tobacco exports as a trade issue rather than a 
health issue 
it seems irrational to advocate that we export a product that 
we know is going to cause death and disability to another segment 
of the world he said in a telephone interview monday 
but us trade officials believe tobacco is a legal commodity 
and therefore should not be unfairly restricted said timothy 
oleary spokesman for the office of the us trade representative 
its probably suitable for any given country in the world 
to decide if it wants to permit smoking but as long as smoking is 
legal then that country ought not to discriminate against us 
tobacco he said by telephone tuesday from washington

air force planes and helicopters 
firebombed and strafed residential areas near jaffna fort a 
strategic military garrison and hundreds of buildings were ablaze 
tamil rebels said tuesday 
authorities and witnesses reported the deaths of 196 people 
nationwide bringing the death toll in two weeks of fighting to 
1626 combatants many civilians have also been killed 
in the northern city of jaffna the rebel stronghold the 
government used bombers and a helicopter gunship to pound 
residential areas around jaffna fort in which 270 soldiers and 
policemen have been besieged since the fighting began 
five air force bombers and a helicopter gunship used 120pound 
bombs and 66pound incendiary devices in the attack said a rebel 
statement telexed to newspaper and news agency offices in colombo 
it described attacks on monday and said hundreds of buildings 
near jaffna fort were set on fire the whole area is ablaze it 
said 
military officials said tuesday that air force planes continued 
to bomb and strafe rebel positions and were trying to avoid 
civilian targets in the city 186 miles north of colombo 
we are not hellbent on bombing and killing people defense 
secretary gen cyril ranatunge said 
there was no way to independently verify rebel or government 
claims because transportation and telephone services to the region 
were cut off 
but travelers reaching vavuniya just south of jaffna confirmed 
that the jaffna was being heavily bombed 
over the weekend air force planes dropped leaflets warning the 
citys 120000 residents to evacuate 
the rebel statement claimed the military was using napalm 
bombs but then said the bombs were made of coal tar rubber 
shavings and explosives there was no indication that napalm a 
powerful defoliant was used by the military 
the government considers jaffna fort one of its main bases in 
the area and it would be a serious military blow if it lost the 
area to the rebels 
the tamils started a war for separatism in 1983 but there had 
been a 13month halt to hostilities during a ceasefire between the

managed to get into the truck and take control of the vehicle the 
employees told police 
when the woman returned the gunman ordered the two to drive to 
a more rural location about a half mile away ryan said 
the money was then transferred from the armored truck to another 
vehicle believed to be a gray van ryan said the armored car 
company workers were tapedup and had their wrists bound 
at least one of the gunmen wore a mask 
after the robbers fled the scene in the second vehicle the 
employees said they took about 15 minutes to free themselves

meloni said investigators were working closely with the fbi and 
were interviewing the driver and the assistant the armored truck 
has been checked for fingerprints he said and examined for other 
clues investigators were looking into records and routes of the 
armored vehicle and were questioning other people in the area he 
said

buffalo which serves as a source of coin and currency for banks 
throughout western new york banks in turn send surplus money to 
the federal reserve for storage

the visiting presidents of the east and west 
german parliaments assured israel tuesday that concerns here and 
elsewhere about german unification are unfounded 
rita suessmuth of west germany and sabine bergmannpohl of east 
germany also pledged that a united germany would be a strong 
supporter of the jewish state 
the two presidents spoke on the second day of a threeday visit 
to israel the trip has been seen as an effort to allay concerns 
about german unification 
we take the concerns seriously but they are unfounded ms 
bergmannpohl said in a speech before israels council on foreign 
relations a private group that regularly discusses foreign affairs 
it will be an important task of german foreign policy to deal 
with these fears and to take into consideration the legitimate 
security concerns of its neighbors she added 
ms suessmuth rejected predictions that a united germany would 
dominate europe saying that instead it would pave the way for 
european unity 
without ending germanys division there cannot be a unified 
europe without german unity the policy of confrontation between 
the eastern and western blocs will not end she said 
she also took a gentle swipe at those expressing concern 
we are being watched intensively sometimes too intensively 
if we make mistakes they are weighed more heavily than those of 
others said ms suessmuth 
many israelis remain skeptical of german unification including 
shevach weiss a deputy speaker of parliament who as a child spent 
two years hiding from the nazis in a basement in the ukraine 
i know we cant change historical processes but we have the 
right and maybe the obligation to be afraid and alarmed by the 
enormous power of a united germany said weiss 
the two german officials toured the yad vashem holocaust 
memorial in jerusalem an exhibit that tells the story of the 
genocide in which 6 million jews were slain by the nazis 
in yad vashems hall of remembrance a darkened room with an 
eternal flame and the names of nazi death camps inscribed on the 
floor ms bergmannpohl and ms suessmuth each laid a wreath with 
red and yellow flowers and stood silently for a moment 
ms bergmannpohl who had remained silent while viewing 
pictures of executions gas chambers and bodies piled in mass 
graves cried when she later addressed her hosts 
i wanted to make a promise here that i will work hard that 
such injustice will never happen again and i will work especially 
hard for this in a united germany she said outside the hilltop 
memorial overlooking jerusalem

extreme rightwing groups 
expressed disappointment tuesday after meeting president fw de 
klerk and accused him of capitulating to the united states britain 
and local communists 
several proapartheid groups met de klerk in pretoria and 
demanded guarantees that whites would maintain political 
sovereignty and that there would never be a communist government in 
south africa 
jaap marais leader of the reconstituted national party said de 
klerk refused to make such pledges 
marais said the president should stop capitulating to the 
demands of the usa united kingdom and the communists 
marais and other rightwing leaders consider nelson mandela and 
his african national congress a communistinspired terrorist group 
the anc the countrys largest black opposition movement is 
closely allied with the south african communist party but it says 
communist beliefs do not guide anc policy 
de klerks government seeks to negotiate with the anc and other 
antiapartheid groups to establish a new constitution that would 
give blacks some share of power in the government 
he de klerk has become entrapped in a web in which only 
people of the left have entrance to him marais said he 
realized today that there are people of different views 
rightwing groups believe de klerk has instituted his reforms to 
persuade western governments to lift economic sanctions against 
south africa the limited sanctions were imposed in recent years to 
protest the apartheid system that allows the white minority to 
maintain political and economic control over the country 
the european community on tuesday refused to lessen sanctions 
until there is further clear evidence of political change in 
south africa 
in washington president bush told mandela on monday that the 
united states would maintain sanctions for the time being 
mandela addressed a joint session of the us congress on 
tuesday and told the legislators his country continues to bleed 
and suffocate under the repression of whiteminority rule 
both de klerk and mandela have warned that heavily armed 
rightwing extremists could undermine efforts to launch blackwhite 
political negotiations 
one of the groups that met de klerk the neonazi afrikaner 
resistance movement has established commando units and threatened 
to take up arms if the government lessens white privileges 
none of the organizations holds seats in the white chamber of 
parliament but together the groups claim tens of thousands of 
followers their support comes mostly from workingclass and rural 
afrikaners the countrys dutchdescended settlers who account for 
about 3 million of the 5 million whites 
the rightwing groups seek to carve up south africa into 
separate homelands for whites and the 28 million blacks 
the proapartheid conservative party which was not present at 
tuesdays talks in the capital of pretoria captured 31 percent of 
the white vote in elections last september 
most political analysts believe support for the conservatives 
has increased in response to de klerks reforms 
rightwingers have been threatening the government for months 
last week provided the strongest indications yet that such groups 
are ready to act 
piet rudolph a leader of the boer state party declared war on 
the government in a videotape sent to a local newspaper rudolph 
has been in hiding since he allegedly stole arms and ammunition 
from air force headquarters in april 
also two offices belonging to de klerks national party were 
bombed friday night causing damage but no injuries no one claimed 
responsibility but government officials say they suspect 
rightwingers 
a local newspaper reported friday that white extremists were 
planning to assassinate mandela and de klerk police arrested 11 
whites for questioning but all were released and no charges have 
been filed

after 55 years at the bottom of the sea 
the last us dirigible and two rare sparrowhawk scout planes were 
located in 1500 feet of chilly water by a tiny navy submarine 
the 785footlong macon was returning to moffett field about 45 
miles south of san francisco when it was damaged in a storm on 
feb 12 1935 and settled into the sea it was carrying a crew of 
83 and four sparrowhawks 
lifeboats saved 81 of the crew but the macon slid beneath the 
surface about 100 miles south of san francisco and disappeared it 
was spotted on sunday by the threeman crew of the titaniumhulled 
seacliff which had been commissioned to find the wreck 
its a delightful surprise said squadron leader henry 
miller now 87 the only macon crewman still alive 
im simply thrilled miller said in a telephone interview 
from his home in shawnee mission kan 
the dirigible which was about four times as long as the popular 
goodyear blimps went down after a tail fin snapped in heavy wind 
and rain puncturing three helium cells according to john sanders 
a spokesman at the naval postgraduate school in monterey 
recalling the accident miller said it was obvious the ship 
was a goner after it began losing altitude as the deflated tail 
section dragged the airship downward the captain sent several men 
to the nose to try to balance the ship 
when the macon went into the ocean about 15 miles offshore 
miller was one of the men on the nose 
it was just like a big old hen settling down on a nest he 
said of the crash 
sanders said searchers have always looked south of the 
lighthouse for the wreckage but apparently the macon was dragged 
north by the california undercurrent a clue discovered in the late 
1970s helped solve the puzzle 
a piece of the macon was pulled from the water by fisherman dave 
canepa and it eventually wound up hanging on the wall of a 
restaurant chris grech of the monterey bay aquarium one of a 
small group of people looking for the wreck heard about the junk 
hanging on the dining room wall and traced it back to canepa 
canepa who says he never threw any of my fishing records 
away told grech where he found the debris grech passed it on to 
the navy 
the discovery is a tremendous find for aviation museums 
said sanders only one intact sparrowhawk exists on display at the 
smithsonian institution in washington dc 
they were the most beautiful little planes i ever flew 
miller said 
the sea cliff discovered the wreck in just 15 minutes on the 
first dive pilot lt pat scanlon said scanlon said the airships 
frame was collapsed but the crew could see two sparrowhawks intact 
it was amazing said observer lt jg jerry peterson my 
heart skipped a beat when we saw it 
the macon is settled on a flat sandy bottom scanlon said with 
two of the sparrowhawks visible the third and fourth planes are 
probably buried in the sand he said 
the planes only had a range of 100 miles sanders said but the 
macon could stay aloft for days or even weeks the sparrowhawks on 
the macon were the only planes in the navy that didnt have landing 
gear they landed on trapezes suspended from the dirigible 
the macon crash followed the crash of its sibling ships the 
akron and shenandoah both of which were lost in storms the three 
crashes doomed the navys plans to expand the lighterthanair 
program

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan on tuesday disclosed additional details about the 
foodlabeling rules being drafted but its still undecided whether 
they will apply uniformly 
sullivan declined to discuss the uniformity question during a 
speech to a conference on food safety and nutrition saying this 
issue is under review within the administration he also declined 
to discuss it after his speech 
administration sources have said sullivans department wants the 
federal regulations to supersede state regulations but that white 
house officials dont want to preclude the states from adding 
stronger regulations 
california is the only state that might be directly affected 
sullivan said he believed the uniformity question would be 
resolved very soon he previously said he wanted to get the 
proposed regulations out by the end of this month but he declined 
tuesday to be that specific 
the proposal to be issued by the food and drug administration 
would require nutrition labeling on most foods including most 
fresh produce and seafood 
nutrition labels would have to appear on all packaged food for 
unpackaged foods such as fresh fruits vegetables and seafood 
other methods of displaying the information would be allowed such 
as leaflets or posters where the foods are sold 
also manufacturers would have to show on the label the number 
of calories from fat and the amount of saturated fatty acids 
cholesterol and total dietary fiber 
the regulations would define the terms cholesterol free 
low cholesterol and reduced cholesterol to eliminate 
misleading claims 
restaurants bakeries cafeterias and some small businesses 
would be exempt from the regulations sullivan said also waived 
from the requirements would be bitesize foods and foods that have 
no meaningful sources of calories and nutrients he said 
another change would update the reference values now called the 
recommended daily allowance or rda used to compare the nutrition 
content of foods and evaluate a foods contribution to the diet 
rda would be replaced with the term reference daily intakes or 
rdi and updated values would be proposed for protein and for 12 
vitamins and seven minerals that have rdas 
vitamin k manganese and other nutrients that dont have rdas 
would be added to the list with reference values 
reference values also would be established for fat cholesterol 
sodium and fiber but manufacturers would not be required to 
include that in their nutrition labels sullivan said 
the food industry has lobbied strongly for a labeling policy 
that would be standard across the country 
john cady president of the national food processors 
association said that if labeling rules differed from state to 
state consumers would be confused and distribution logistics would 
increase food costs substantially 
the center for science in the public interest wants the states 
to be able to bolster any federal foodlabeling requirements but 
even with that issue aside center officials say the departments 
proposals are inadequate given the severity of the problem 
bruce silverglade legal affairs director for the center said 
the organization obtained a draft copy of some portions of the 
proposed regulations because of several deficiencies in the 
proposal he said the center is urging passage of congressional 
legislation that is tougher 
silverglade said sullivans proposal was defective because it 
would not require manufacturers to disclose how much fat 
cholesterol sodium and fiber a food contributes to the maximum 
daily amounts a person should consume it also would not require 
disclosure of sugar content or set a deadline for final agency 
action he said 
current requirements established 17 years ago call for 
nutrition labeling only when a manufacturer adds vitamins minerals 
or proteins or makes a nutritional claim about the product 
about 60 percent of packaged foods list nutrients a majority of 
which is labeled voluntarily

moslem fundamentalists threatened to 
kill the american director of the largest private relief group 
working with refugees from the war in afghanistan officials said 
tuesday 
the death threat against thomas yates director of the 
international rescue committee was made in a letter delivered 
sunday to the world food program said the officials who insisted 
they not be identified by name nationality or agency 
the letter made available to the associated press was written 
in english and addressed to whom it may concern it said 
western aid groups were being watched and that yates would be 
killed to prove the claim it accurately described the car he 
drives clothes he had worn and places he often went 
we know your secrets and your locations said the letter 
signed by the shadowy international jihad organization 
the group has been linked with hezbiislami or party of god 
the most antiwest of the seven resistance groups based in 
pakistan spokesmen for hezbiislami said the attacks would be 
justified but they denied involvement 
as washington and moscow move closer to a political settlement 
of the afghan war diplomatic sources say many afghans have 
launched an antiwest campaign to counter what they consider a us 
attempt to sideline the moslem fundamentalists 
the officials said yates and his family had left peshawar the 
border city that has served as headquarters for the guerrillas who 
have been trying for 12 years to overthrow the sovietbacked 
government of afghanistan 
the usbased international rescue committee opened its 
peshawar operations in 1980 it has sponsored educational 
agricultural and health care programs in border camps where nearly 
4 million afghans have taken refuge during the war 
attacks on private western relief groups have increased since 
late april and many agencies have threatened to close their 
operations unless the government guarantees their safety 
in a related development the australianbased shelter now 
international said tuesday it was indefinitely suspending its 
operation pending a final decision by the board of directors 
shelter now which ran programs for afghan widows and orphans 
has been the target of repeated fundamentalist attacks in both 
pakistan and afghanistan the decision to freeze its operation was 
prompted by the june 16 attempted murder of its director american 
thor armstrong 
although we may never know the motive behind this attack we 
are convinced this was not just a coincidence but a serious sign of 
the escalating danger to both expatriates and afghans the 
release said 
this is not an easy decision but circumstances leave us no 
choice it said 
when the soviet union withdrew its soldiers from afghanistan in 
february 1989 after nine years of military involvement the 
guerrilla governmentinexile was touted by its western backers as 
likely to replace the communiststyle government left behind in 
kabul 
but the guerrillas have failed to achieve a significant military 
victory and the governmentinexile has degenerated into a chaotic 
collection of bickering warlords diplomats and analysts say

imelda marcos was a worldclass shopper but 
the racketeering case against her is a prosecutors fantasy based 
on rhetoric rather than evidence her attorney said tuesday 
there is no crime in being wealthy or in spending money 
defense lawyer gerry spence told the us district court jury in 
closing arguments he said mrs marcos committed no crime except 
of loving a man for 35 years raising his children taking his 
lavish gifts and being his ardent supporter 
spence a flamboyant attorney from wyoming gave a dramatic plea 
for acquittal he raised and lowered his voice waved his arms and 
used his cowboy hat to illustrate a point 
he said the government had wrongly concluded that the former 
philippines first lady knew stolen money was used for investments 
in the united states 
he compared the theory to a big leap like superman would 
make and said it violated his clients right to a presumption of 
innocence 
its a hole so big you could drive a truck through it 
spence said 
the lawyer also claimed that philippines president corazon 
aquino had threatened to cancel the usphilippine military base 
agreement unless the marcoses were brought to trial 
corazon aquino used the american bases on the philippines as 
leverage spence said no prosecution no bases 
he ridiculed the governments case in a mocking tone and 
attacked the lead prosecutor assistant us attorney charles 
labella 
his proof is his arguments his musthavebeens his 
fantasies spence said mrs marcos was the most open woman in 
the world there isnt any evidence in this case that she ever did 
anything 
mrs marcos 60 is accused of helping her late husband former 
philippines president ferdinand marcos embezzle 222 million from 
their countrys treasury to buy four new york buildings jewelry 
and art works 
she faces up to 50 years in prison and 1 million in fines if 
convicted of racketeering racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and 
obstruction of justice 
her codefendant saudi financier adnan khashoggi is charged 
with mail fraud and obstructing justice for allegedly helping the 
marcoses hide their ownership of the properties after a us court 
order froze their assets 
khashoggis attorney james linn is to present his closing 
arguments on wednesday the jury is expected to begin deliberations 
on thursday 
spence said the building purchases were arranged by mrs marcos 
husband and constituted a threeway investment by the philippines 
government marcos himself and their close friends benedicto and 
gliceria tantoco 
the tantocos who are fugitives in the case owned the largest 
department store in manila and benedicto tantoco was the former 
philippine ambassador to the vatican 
spence said marcos was not a crook but a politician who wanted 
to hide his partial ownership of the buildings 
he didnt want people to know he was investing in the us 
he said dont you think he has the same right as the japanese 
the dutch and the english 
spence said marcos did not acquire his wealth by illegal means 
but rather through 30 years of investing in philippine companies 
in his opening statement the attorney had attributed marcos 
wealth to a secret horde of gold hidden in the philippines by a 
japanese general during world war ii 
spence again and again came back to his argument that none of 
the evidence directly linked mrs marcos to the transactions 
one document out of 300000 has her signature after the date 
of the alleged wrongdoing and that is 700000 from a swiss account 
to her private account to pay for her jewels he said there is 
something almost fantastically silly about this case 
spence said the defense called no witnesses because there was 
nothing to rebut 
spence said at another point ill tell you she was a 
worldclass shopper but ill tell you she was a worldclass decent 
human being

nelson mandelas planned visit here has aggravated 
tensions in this racially divided community as cubanamericans 
protest his stand on fidel castro while blacks rally to his support 
black radio talk shows on tuesday called for demonstrations to 
rival the protests called for by cubanamerican radio programs 
outside the miami beach labor convention mandela is to address 
thursday 
mandelas visit was welcomed until a nationally televised 
interview last week when he defended his support for cuban leader 
fidel castro palestine liberation organization leader yasser 
arafat and libyan leader moammar gadhafi mandela said they had 
supported the african national congress in the early years of its 
struggle against apartheid in south africa 
miami with its large cubanamerican population immediately 
withdrew a planned proclamation in mandelas honor five miamiarea 
mayors all cubanamericans criticized mandela for being 
insensitive to human rights in cuba 
we cuban americans find it beyond reasonable comprehension 
that mr nelson mandela a victim of oppression by his own 
government not only fails to condemn the cuban government for its 
humanrights violations but rather praises virtues of the 
tyrannical castro regime their statement said 
mayors xavier suarez of miami julio martinez of hialeah pedro 
reboredo of west miami jose rivero of sweetwater and gilda 
oliveros of hialeah gardens signed the declaration 
on tuesday mayor alex daoud of miami beach where mandela is to 
address the american federation of state county and municipal 
employees convention also criticized mandela over his praise for 
gadhafi and arafat 
the mayors statements angered black leaders and blackoriented 
radio stations on tuesday called for mandela supporters to turn out 
in support of the black south african leader 
we look like a bunch of stupid clowns around this country and 
around the world for not knowing who it is that is coming here and 
how he ought to be treated said johnnie mcmillian head of the 
miamidade chapter of the naacp 
callers to cubanoriented talk shows were almost unanimous in 
condemning mandela callers to blackoriented stations were 
particularly angry with suarez who enjoyed widespread black voter 
support in his two election victories against more militant cuban 
challengers 
representatives from the southern christian leadership 
conference and other black groups presented suarezs office with a 
protest letter tuesday afternoon and called on blacks to rally at 
the miami beach convention center and in miami on thursday to greet 
mandela 
local jewish leaders while praising the black south african 
leader for his struggle against apartheid have been critical of 
his stand toward gadhafi and arafat 
we also recognize that we have profound and fundamental 
difference with mr mandela said howard r scharlin president 
of the greater miami jewish federation these differences are 
deeply troubling to us 
feuding between blacks and hispanics in miami has simmered for 
more than a decade polarizing the citys politics along racial 
lines 
the latest friction grew from the january 1989 shooting of a 
black motorcyclist by a colombianborn miami police officer 
sparking three days of rioting 
officer william lozano was convicted of manslaughter in the 
case but blacks objected to his widespread support in the hispanic 
community and among latin police officers who raised money for his 
defense and wore black armbands in his support following the 
conviction

antismoking forces view a new environmental 
protection agency report as a key victory in their decadesold war 
against tobacco use but tobacco industry sources say the report is 
simply flawed and unsupported speculation 
the epa report which is still in draft form and has not 
received final agency approval was released monday it contends 
that secondhand smoke causes about 3800 lung cancer deaths 
annually among nonsmokers it also says that children of smokers 
suffer more respiratory problems than children of nonsmokers 
for the first time the government has come up with a real 
body count on the effects of environmental tobacco smoke john 
banzhaf the executive director of the antismoking group action on 
smoking and health said tuesday its going to have a major 
impact 
nonsense said brennan dawson vice president of public affairs 
for the tobacco institute the epa report she said is filled with 
scientific inaccuracies and is but another example of the 
antismoking bias in some government agencies 
she said a review of the study by an epa independent science 
board will destroy the conclusions drawn in the draft report 
a test of the reports effect will come this week when rep 
thomas lukin dohio introduces legislation called the equal 
treatment for cigarettes act the bill for the first time would 
require the epa to treat cigarette smoke as a carcinogen that it 
can regulate just as it now can act against some industrial 
chemicals 
benjamin cohen an aide to lukin said the legislation would 
remove from the 1976 toxic substance control act a clause exempting 
tobacco products from epa control 
the toxic substance control act is the law that permits epa to 
regulate asbestos said cohen the new legislation would 
require the epa to also regulate cigarette smoke 
banzhaf said the epa study also will strength the antismoking 
side in lawsuits across the country including one that his group 
filed against the occupational safety and health administration 
when we can point out that a sister federal agency has 
determined that second hand smoke is dangerous it will strengthen 
our litigation against osha he said the suit an attempt to 
force osha to regulate smoking in the workplace will be heard in 
federal court in the district of columbia this fall 
phil wilbur director of the smoking control advocacy resource 
center of the advocacy institute a nonprofit organization that 
assists specialinterest groups said the epa report has put a 
number 3800 on the lung cancer deaths caused by secondhand 
smoke people will realize that the number of deaths from 
secondhand smoke rivals the number of deaths from cocaine 
banzhaf said there now are about 150 nonsmokers rights groups 
around the country many are lobbying city councils and state 
governments for such things as limiting cigarette advertising and 
enforcing laws to cut off minors access to tobacco 
despite all this ms dawson said that the tobacco industry is 
not in retreat and is still defending strongly what the group 
believes is a fundamental right of people to smoke 
we still do pretty well said ms dawson the fact is that 
most corporations still allow people to smoke on company premises 
most legislative and others battles are won by the industry 
you dont hear about the smokingrestriction bills that dont 
get passed or the tobacco taxes that dont pass she said 
and she noted despite decades of increasing opposition to 
smoking fifty million adult americans still smoke 
the war said ms dawson is not just for the tobacco industry 
because our customers deserve a battle also and representation 
against the antismoking forces 
she said with things like limits on advertising and enforced 
restrictions on certain behaviors there are people who support the 
industrys efforts to fight government action 
they may be no friends of tobacco but they dont like this 
nannyism and behavior modification coming from their elected

in the draft report the epa said evidence includes what the 
report calls detectable association at environmental exposure 
levels between cancer and exposure among nonsmoking family 
members who live with a smoker 
the report also said that although 30 percent of the adult 
population smokes there are detectable levels of cotinine a 
metabolic product of nicotine detected in the blood saliva and 
urine of 50 to 75 percent of nonsmokers tested

a plutoniumpowered satellite that 
will be launched from the shuttle discovery this fall to explore 
the suns poles poses little health risk in the event of an 
accident space officials said tuesday 
we have looked at the statistics and our conclusion is 
that we think its definitely as safe as it can be and were not 
worried about it said astronaut thomas akers who will be part 
of discoverys fiveman crew 
ulysses scientific instruments will be powered by one 
radioisotope thermoelectric generator rtg which converts heat 
from decaying plutonium into electricity two such generators were 
aboard the galileo spacecraft that was sent on a sixyear journey 
to jupiter from the shuttle atlantis last october 
environmentalists had opposed galileos power supply they said 
a challengerlike accident could scatter the deadly plutonium over 
florida but willis meeks ulysses project manager for nasa said 
at a news conference the chances of that happening were very 
small 
in the likelihood of the worst possible disaster in which 
plutonium was released into the atmosphere meeks said there would 
be an additional 300 to 400 cancer deaths over 50 years based on 
the worlds entire population but a us energy department 
engineer at the briefing who refused to identify himself said that 
estimate was much too high 
president bush is expected to approve ulysses launch in early 
september presidential approval is necessary when rtgs are used 
the approximately 750 million mission is on schedule for an 
oct 5 launch said john conway director of payload management and 
operations for the national aeronautics and space administration 
there is no evidence of any damage to discoverys right payload bay 
door which inadvertently was yanked upward earlier this month by 
an overhead bridge he said 
ulysses will be the first spacecraft to orbit over the suns 
poles providing new insight into solar winds and magnetic fields 
said peter wenzel ulysses project scientist for the european space 
agency the european agency is splitting the cost and 
responsibility of the mission with nasa 
wenzel said it will be like seeing the sun in the third 
dimension 
think of some little green man from mars who comes lands near 
the equator looks around goes back and describes what the earth 
is like thats not the whole story you have to look at all 
latitudes wenzel said 
discovery has until oct 23 to lift off with ulysses because of 
the alignment of earth the sun and jupiter whose gravitational 
field will slingshot the satellite back to the sun otherwise the 
flight must be delayed for 13 months said willis meeks ulysses 
project manager for nasa 
it will take ulysses 16 months to reach jupiter and 2 more 
years to reach the suns 70degree south latitude in mid1995 the 
satellite is expected to be in the same spot on the northern side 
the 814pound satellite will not be any closer to the sun during 
the fiveyear mission than it is now on earth a distance of 93 
million miles it will be twice that far in fact when it passes 
over the solar poles 
ulysses is named after the heroic adventurer in greek mythology

donald trump never wanted to sell his yearold 
airline shuttle and probably wont the president of the trump 
shuttle said on tuesday 
ultimately were going to dominate this marketplace said 
bruce nobles who added that shuttle employees and suppliers have 
expressed some anxiety over the new york developers financial 
difficulties but he said the airline is unaffected 
trump is 73 million overdue on loan payments but his bankers 
on tuesday approved a 30day 20 million loan and agreed in 
principle to a bigger longterm financial bailout which would force 
him to sell some of his properties 
the shuttle a major trump asset has hourly flights linking new 
york with boston and washington trump in april hired merrill lynch 
co to negotiate the possible sale of the shuttle which he 
purchased last june from eastern airlines for 365 million 
nobles in a speech to an aviation industry meeting said he had 
spoken with trump earlier in the day 
he doesnt want to sell the shuttle and has never wanted to 
sell the shuttle nobles said adding that a sale was unlikely in 
view of pan ams efforts to sell its competing shuttle operation 
pan am put its shuttle up for sale a month ago 
nobles said trump earlier indicated he would sell the airline 
only if he were offered a lot of money he said there is 
continuing interest but no offer has been made 
its probably unlikely someone will make an offer we cant 
refuse said nobles who has worked for both the pan am and 
eastern shuttles 
he announced the airline was extending until sept 30 a program 
that guarantees service seats and ontime arrival failure to 
deliver gives customers a choice of bonus frequent flier miles 
restaurant coupons or a discount on a future flight 
asked if criticism of trump and jokes about his business and 
marital difficulties affect the airline nobles said i dont 
know of any hard feelings i guess a lot of people are having fun 
bashing donald 
he said the shuttle is running 50 to 55 percent of capacity and 
has to add several hundred extra flights a month because 
peakhour flights are filled up 
the airline has been losing money and will continue to do so 
into its second year because of the need to pay off loans nobles 
said but he said it has been earning profits over its operating 
costs for some time 
he spoke candidly of some of the airlines failures a 
concierge service which he said cost too much to make it worthwhile 
and a helicopter service into manhattan he said it needs to find 
ways to attract more passengers on weekends when fares already are 
lower and has had to cut back to a flight every two hours on 
saturday afternoon and sunday morning 
nobles said the shuttles high fare 119 one way on weekdays 
between new york and washington is justified by the fact that 
passengers can walk on any hour without reservations 
he said a decline of shuttle passengers from 4 million in 1988 
to an expected 37 million this year is due to general economic 
decline in the northeast and increasing competition from carriers 
using other airports in the new york and washington area and from 
amtrak 
nobles blamed air traffic control limitations over the busy 
airports it serves for any delays we would be 100 percent on 
time if air traffic control could handle the demand he said

reformers are trying to postpone a major communist 
party congress scheduled to open next week that is expected to be a 
showdown between party liberals and hardliners boris yeltsin said 
tuesday 
a delay could prevent communist party hardliners from 
capitalizing on their successes last week at a meeting of 2700 
party members from the russian federation the largest and most 
populous of the 15 soviet republics 
yeltsin newly elected president of the russian federation and 
other reformers favor a delay as a means of preserving their 
influence 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs stand on the delay was 
not immediately known and one western expert said postponement was 
unlikely 
the 28th congress of the soviet communist party to be attended 
by 4700 delegates from around the country was originally planned 
for next year but its opening date was moved up to july 2 to boost 
gorbachevs reform efforts 
now however the congress seems likely to result in a walkout 
by radical reformers that could further polarize the political 
situation 
the final decision on whether to delay the congress will be made 
at a plenary meeting of the partys policymaking central 
committee expected within days yeltsin told a news conference 
there will be a real struggle at the plenum yeltsin said 
some top party members want to hold the congress while memory of 
last weeks meeting of russian communists is still fresh he said 
others in order to somehow stabilize the political situation 
that has emerged now are for delaying the congress for a time 
perhaps until fall yeltsin said i am personally for delaying 
it to prepare more thoroughly 
yeltsin said last weeks meeting of russian delegates will 
have a very serious influence on the 28th congress and this is 
alarming 
that meeting was dominated by traditional soviet communists who 
accused gorbachev of weakening the party with his reforms it 
elected conservative ivan polozkov first secretary of a newly 
reconstituted communist party of the russian federation those same 
delegates from the russian federation would form a majority at the 
national party congress 
gorbachevs most visible conservative rival on the partys 
ruling politburo yegor k ligachev told the russian gathering 
last week that it was impossible for the soviet leader to 
effectively run the party while he also holds the job of soviet 
president 
in another sign of the struggle the lead article in the 
government newspaper izvestia expressed doubt about holding any 
largescale gatherings such as the congress now 
izvestia writer albert plutnik said such meetings objectively 
in the current situation do not benefit the supporters of 
perestroika gorbachevs reform program 
gorbachev spokesman arkady a maslennikov declined to comment 
about gorbachevs position and said the central committee would 
decide when the congress would be held 
a western diplomat in moscow speaking on condition of 
anonymity said he doubted the congresss would be postponed 
party congresses normally held every five years theoretically 
are the most powerful party gatherings with the right to elect the 
central committee and party leadership and change the partys 
rules and program in the past however the meetings have been 
carefully orchestrated from the top 
gorbachev is bringing a new program and new party rules to this 
congress 
yeltsin elected last month president of the russian republic 
which has 52 percent of the soviet population and threequarters of 
its territory is a leader of the partys reform wing 
gorbachev whose position as soviet president would not be 
affected by a challenge to his party leadership has made clear he 
intends to be a candidate for the top party job at the congress and 
has pledged to keep the party from splitting 
but the main reform group within the party democratic platform 
has instructed its delegates to walk out of the congress if the 
party is not completely transformed a majority of delegates to a 
democratic platform conference june 17 in moscow called for forming 
a new political party if the communist party does not reform 
yeltsin who was active in democratic platform before being 
elected russian president said the congress was the last chance 
for radical renewal of the party and indicated he would suspend 
his party membership if he is dissatisfied with the results 
if there is no such renewal then yeltsin as chairman of 
the supreme soviet of russia either holds up his communist party 
membership or maybe takes other steps yeltsin said 
according to some reports politburo member vadim medvedev had 
contacted party officials in the baltic republic of estonia to poll 
them about delaying the congress

sothebys auction house pulled a painting 
attributed to vincent van gogh out of a sale tuesday after the 
amsterdam museum devoted to the artist warned it could be a fake 
the small picture of a house with a red roof between trees and 
two figures on a path titled the steps at auvers lescalier 
a auvers had been estimated at 35 to 52 million in the 
tuesday night sale of impressionist and modern art 
the unidentified seller bought it in 1984 at sothebys for 
430000 pounds then worth about 602000 if it is proved to be a 
fake its value would be no more than 5000 pounds or about 
8500 as a curiosity 
as the fiveyear period needed for a claim has expired the 
seller has no right to seek compensation from the auction house but 
a sothebys statement said we do consider our moral 
obligations 
there is a larger version of the disputed picture in the st 
louis art museum 
the withdrawn work had been sold in copenhagen in 1925 as a 
genuine work of the artist and scholars dated it to july 1890 
shortly before van gogh shot himself it was exhibited as his work 
in tokyo in 1985 
but experts at the van gogh museum in amsterdam recently cast 
doubt on its authenticity 
as a result sothebys said they were withdrawing it from sale 
pending further research 
this year is the centenary of van goghs death and all his work 
is being subjected to close scrutiny fakes of his art first 
appeared in paris soon after the turn of the century 
van gogh never sold a picture in his lifetime but he has become 
the most popular artist ever known 
in 1987 his paintings of sunflowers and irises set world art 
auction records and on may 15 his portrait of a doctor who had 
treated him for mental illness received a new record price of 825 
million in new york 
the buyer was a japanese industrialist ryoei saito 
when the twoday sothebys sale of impressionist and modern art 
started tuesday seibu the japanese store chain paid 314 
million for a set of 42 colored lithographs by marc chagall the 
company said the price was an auction record for a set of prints 
the works illustrated the pastoral romance of a goatherd and a 
shepherdess daphnis and chloe attributed to the third century 
greek writer longus 
the set of 42 lithographs was published in paris in 1961

an additional 300000 food packages to participants over the final 
three months of this fiscal year nelsen said

city council members voted tuesday to end one 
of the nations most generous municipal policies for the homeless 
in an effort to control a budget crisis that could leave the 
district of columbia with a 95 million budget deficit 
the council voted to stop immediately providing unlimited 
shelter to the homeless the legislation now goes to mayor marion 
barry for his approval 
the vote scaled back an initiative that had passed with more 
than 70 percent of the vote in 1984 it guaranteed overnight 
shelter for any homeless person who requested it 
the new policy authorizes the city to restrict annual spending 
for shelter limit the number of nights individuals and families 
can stay at the shelters and require people with money to help 
defray the cost of finding permanent housing for themselves 
the city was expected to spend 40 million on the homeless this 
year or about 15 million more than originally budgeted the cost 
of implementing the law has nearly tripled from 10 million in 
fiscal 1985 to 27 million in fiscal 1988 
tuesdays decision angered homeless advocates who said they 
planned to file suit against the city 
i think whoever voted for this thing should be run out of 
town advocate mitch snyder said this is going to put 
thousands of people out on the streets 
if shelter money is exhausted before the end of the budget year 
the mayor could transfer money from other city accounts but he 
would not be required to do so 
the barry administration is facing a budget deficit of about 95 
million for the fiscal year ending sept 30 the mayor has proposed 
that 26000 city workers be furloughed for four days each that 
services be cut and that new taxes be enacted

farmers and homeowners frequently use 
weedkillers that contain a key ingredient of agent orange that may 
be more harmful than previously thought scientists told a 
congressional panel tuesday 
it appears to me that there are other contaminants in 
herbicides as well as herbicides per se which have not been 
adequately evaluated for carcinogenicity in animals let alone 
studied for their effect in humans daniel thau teitelbaum a 
denver physician told a house government operations subcommittee 
teitelbaum studied industry records as part of the classaction 
lawsuit by vietnam veterans against the makers of agent orange 
in the 20 years of controversy surrounding whether the 
government should pay benefits to ailing vietnam veterans who were 
exposed to agent orange attention has focused on dioxin 
contamination 245t one of the herbicides two key ingredients 
the environmental protection agency has labeled dioxin a 
probable human carcinogen and 245t has been out of 
circulation for years 
but scientists told the subcommittee that the other key 
ingredient 24d causes cancers and other ailments linked to 
agent orange evidence shows that 24d was also contaminated with 
harmful compounds some related to dioxin according to testimony 
on the government handling of agent orange research 
the farmchemical industry says ongoing research into 24d is 
needed but that the weight of the evidence so far indicates the 
risk of harm is relatively small if it does indeed exist industry 
spokesman garry hamlin said in a telephone interview from 
indianapolis 
a socalled phenoxy herbicide 24d is sold over the counter to 
kill dandelions and other lawn weeds farmers use it against weeds 
in corn wheat rice and sorghum 
teitelbaum noting that use of 245t was first discontinued 
because of concern about birth defects said studies were needed on 
possible birth defects resulting from 24d exposure 
two national cancer institute studies have shown an increased 
risk of nonhodgkins lymphoma a rare cancer in frequent users 
of agriculture chemicals said nci researcher shelia hoar zahm 
the studies of farm workers in kansas and nebraska found that 
the risk grows or drops according to skin exposure and how soon 
after exposure the worker changed clothes 
vietnam veterans were exposed to agent orange in concentrations 
far in excess of the normal strength special adviser elmo r 
zumwalt jr has told the veterans affairs department 
the department said this year it would compensate veterans for 
nonhodgkins lymphoma and for another rare cancer soft tissue 
sarcoma however the government maintains that exposure cant be 
documented 
zumwalt a retired admiral ordered agent orange sprayed in 
vietnam to clear dense jungle his son who served in vietnam 
later died of cancer which zumwalt attributes to agent orange he 
said 27 ailments can be linked to agent orange 
zumwalt appearing before the subcommittee on human resources 
and intergovernmental relations reiterated his contention that 
government and industry officials intentionally manipulated or 
withheld compelling information on the adverse health effects 
associated with exposure to the toxic contaminants contained in 
agent orange 
in a related matter rep ted r weiss dny said his 
subcommittee had forced the air force to release a 4yearold draft 
report showing an increase of birth defects among the offspring of 
those who handled and sprayed agent orange from the air 
patti turner a spokeswoman for the air force surgeon generals 
office said the conclusions were premature

gov michael s dukakis awash in budget woes had 
a rueful response to president bushs concession tuesday that tax 
increases were needed to shrink the federal budget 
i told the truth and i paid the price said dukakis mr 
bush did not and were all now going to have to pay the price for 
that 
bush who made read my lips no new taxes a hallmark of his 
1988 campaign against dukakis released a statement tuesday that a 
tax revenue increase was necessary to battle the budget deficit 
dukakis who said during the campaign he would raise taxes as a 
last resort has been fighting to raise taxes to bridge a state 
budget gap now estimated at more than 1 billion 
this is going to be a long and difficult process for the 
president and the congress and theyre going to have to go through 
what whether we like it or not weve had to go through in the 
past year and a half dukakis said 
dukakis political popularity in his own state has plunged since 
the presidential campaign 
massachusetts revenues have decline steadily and the states 
bond rating has fallen to the lowest in the nation due largely to 
political paralysis over the issue of raising taxes 
standard amp poors last week put the state on credit watch 
warning that its bond rating could fall to junk bond status if 
fiscal problems are not quickly resolved 
although the fiscal year ends in four days the massachusetts 
house and senate have so fair failed to agree on either a tax plan 
or a budget for fiscal 1991

sugar producers got a taste on tuesday of the 
debate that can be expected on the house floor when urban lawmakers 
attack what they see as an overly protective us sugar policy in 
the 1990 farm bill 
you have gotten away with murder and i dont blame you for 
wanting to continue it rep thomas downey dny told a 
gathering of the american sugar alliance 
he and rep willis gradison rohio want a 10 percent reduction 
in the government guaranteed sugar price they say beet and cane 
farmers should prepare themselves for changes in world trade that 
will eventually lead to even greater adjustments in the program 
the sugar program is bitterly opposed by manufacturers of candy 
baked goods soft drinks and other sweets because it prevents 
cheaper worldpriced sugar from being sold in the united states 
in defense of government sugar support house agriculture sugar 
subcommittee chairman jerry huckaby dla said it keeps prices 
stable and predictable for sweets manufacturers it is necessary to 
compete with more heavily subsidized sugar from europe he said 
the world market is a dump market said arlan stangeland 
rminn ranking minority member on huckabys subcommittee 
stangeland said sugar producing countries take what they need 
for themselves sell to preferred customers at the highest rates 
possible and dump the rest on the world market at low prices often 
subsidized by their governments 
downey and gradison also attacked the program as bad foreign 
policy 
it holds domestic prices at 22 cents a pound about 9 cents more 
than the average world price by controlling the amount of sugar 
that can be imported from sugar producing nations many of the 
countries are desperately poor but have excellent sugargrowing 
capacity 
it doesnt make any sense to not allow sugar imports from 
countries we are paying foreign aid said downey 
he said the united states should allow those countries to get 
out from us infusing them and allow them to do something 
productive 
gradison said the governments import quota program squeezes the 
economies of caribbean nations who have a better climate for sugar 
production than the united states 
downey and gradison said the bush administration has shown 
support for their position 
huckaby said he feared the administration saw the sugar program 
as something that could be traded away in exchange for concessions 
from other countries during international trade talks aimed at 
reducing subsidies worldwide 
he and the other three congressmen all said it was too early to 
predict the outcome of the international talks though huckaby said 
i would be amazed if any significant agreement was reached in 
agriculture 
the house and senate are each expected to begin floor debate on 
the 1990 farm bill next month 
huckaby said the house and senate sugar proposals are similar 
except the house would require the government to allow no less than 
125 million tons of imported sugar in the country each year and 
permit another half million tons in imports through a reexport 
program involving us refiners 
downey and gradison said theyll make the case on the house 
floor that sugar or any agricultural product should not be 
treated so differently as other goods us makers sell abroad

mayor marion barry told a grand jury he had 
neither given nor gotten drugs from a man who later pleaded guilty 
to drug dealing according to tapes played tuesday at barrys 
cocaine and perjury trial he said he saw nothing unusual or 
criminal in visits to the mans hotel room 
charles lewis testified at the trial last week that he and the 
mayor smoked crack cocaine on each of four barry visits to lewis 
hotel room 
the january 1989 grand jury tapes include new material as well 
as previously released statements barrys responses to questions 
about whether he knew lewis was involved with drugs and his 
denials that he ever gave lewis drugs or that lewis gave him drugs 
that form the basis for the three felony perjury charges the 
mayor faces 
for example the tapes indicate that on dec 22 1988 the day 
barrys links to lewis were becoming public the mayor visited 
three people who law enforcement officials have said could 
eventually be called to testify about his alleged drug use 
barry testified before the grand jury in two appearances a few 
weeks after a police operation aimed at lewis was called off when 
city officers learned barry was with him at a downtown hotel 
since that episode assistant us attorney judith retchin asked 
barry during the grand jury proceeding have you talked with 
anyone or has anyone come to your attention who you believe has 
information about charles lewis connection with narcotics or drugs 
of any kind 
no i had gotten the feeling again just an impression 
from having known him over the years having seen him in the virgin 
islands that one chuck lewis was not a drug dealer and two i 
didnt get the impression that he used drugs barry said 
when asked by retchin whether he had ever given lewis anything 
of value barry responded no if youre getting at ive 
never given mr lewis any cocaine or any other drugs announce that 
right up front 
in addition to the perjury felony charges barry 54 also has 
been charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession and 
one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count he has pleaded innocent 
to all 14 charges 
his taped testimony differed from lewis version on minor as 
well as major points for example barry said his dec 19 1988 
visit with lewis lasted an hour or less lewis testified that he 
and the mayor smoked crack cocaine well into dec 20 and long past 
the end of the monday night football game they had been watching 
also barry told the grand jury he thought his first visit to 
lewis hotel room in washington took place on dec 17 while lewis 
testified it was a day earlier 
was there anything unusual about the dec 17 visit 
assistant us attorney retchin asked barry during his grand jury 
testimony 
not that was unusual or criminal replied the mayor 
in a jan 24 1989 grand jury session barry also described how 
he attempted to handle revelations that he had paid repeated visits 
to lewis hotel room the mayor detailed a telephone conversation 
with top police officials and said he met a man now considered a 
possible witness against him who noted the mayors anxiety about 
the situation 
barry told the grand jury he first learned of the developing 
revelations from one of his security guards while he was visiting 
the hotel room of willie davis a former aide to birmingham ala 
mayor richard arrington 
barry also said he had spent 45 minutes alone that day in the 
washington hotel room of doris crenshaw he testified he visited 
the hotel room of davis before traveling to an official function 
and then to the georgetown restaurant of hassan mohammadi 
mohammadi recognized i was very upset about this whole thing 
that had gone on that night barry said on the tape 
davis crenshaw and mohammadi are considered potential witnesses 
at the trial according to law enforcement sources who have 
commented only on condition they not be named 
barry also testified that on that same day he visited church 
organist mary moore she is the mother of rasheeda moore who later 
cooperated in the fbi sting that led to his arrest at a washington 
hotel 
in his grand jury testimony barry said he chatted for about 30 
minutes with the elder moore then had his security guard drive her 
to a prayer meeting at her church while he talked with her son and 
waited for the car to return 
the grand jury tapes also reveal that it was barry who first 
brought up the subject of drugs while answering questions about his 
relationship with lewis a former city employee 
barry told the grand jury that lewis mentioned the term 
working 50 in casual conversation and that the mayor thought 
the words had something to do with hot clothes prostitution 
or drugs 
it just popped out of lewis mouth i didnt pursue it

wind erosion in the great plains dropped 
sharply this season because of improved moisture conditions in much 
of the region the agriculture department said tuesday 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said an estimated 78 million acres were damaged by wind 
in the 10 states that make up the great plains down 45 percent 
from 143 million acres in 198889 
the agency measures wind damage during a sevenmonth season that 
runs from november 1 through may 31 when winds are usually the 
strongest and soils the driest the survey covers 541 counties in 
the 10 states 
most of this decrease is the result of precipitation in 
colorado and kansas where land damaged from wind decreased from 
65 million acres last year to 463000 acres this year for the two 
states scaling said 
the greatest damage was in north dakota in its third year of 
severe drought he said the state reported 29 million acres 
damaged this season compared with 23 million last year and a 
record 35 million acres in 198788 
north dakota accounted for more than onethird of the total wind 
erosion in the 10state region 
kansas after setting a record with 51 million acres damaged 
last year largely due to a oneday storm that damaged nearly 48 
million acres reported only 190000 damaged this season 
the least damage was in nebraska with 130000 acres damaged 
compared with 192000 last year 
officials said the record for land damaged by wind in the great 
plains was 153 million acres in 195455 the year that the agency 
began annual records

the farm where lawrence welk learned to 
play the accordion became center stage tuesday for a project to 
create a museum honoring the king of champagne music 
about 100 people gathered to hear bands play german polkas 
waltzes and marches and gov george sinner planted a tree during a 
groundbreaking ceremony at the farm where welk lived until he was 
21 
sinner said welk symbolizes the talent of the descendants of the 
germans who came to north dakota 100 years ago 
they are people who work hard and play hard sinner said 
they are people who believe that artistic ability is at its best 
when it is for the common people 
the bandleader himself now 87 and living in los angeles did 
not attend but sent a letter of thanks 
little did i dream when i was growing up on the farm so many 
many years ago that someday it would be restored and people would 
come and marvel at how life was lived in the early 1920s welk 
wrote 
looking back i would say that life on the farm was very hard 
and i didnt always like it especially when i had to help butcher 
the hogs but they were really happy days too because there was 
always love 
the farm has been vacant since 1966 but folks in this town of 
600 about 75 miles south of bismarck decided to refurbish the 
farm to chronicle welks achievements and the history of his 
germanrussian ancestors 
carpenters have finished rebuilding a granary and a buggy house 
a summer kitchen and the outhouse on the farm where welks parents 
came from russia in 1893 renovation work is under way on the 25by 
28foot sod house built by welks father at the turn of the century 
and a barn that was not part of the original farm is being 
turned into a museum of germanrussian immigration 
the cost of the project is estimated at 750000 including 
500000 for a trust to maintain the museum after it opens welk 
heritage inc which is coordinating the restoration has raised 
150000 including 80000 from welks foundation in california 
it hopes to collect the rest from grants and donations 
sharon eiseman a spokeswoman for welk heritage said plenty of 
visitors are expected strasburg bills itself as the gateway to 
south dakotas black hills 
during the summer we have 1000 to 1100 cars a day going 
through here down to south dakota and back up to canada eiseman 
said 
one recent visitor was the rev john nieuwsma of holland mich 
who stopped at the farm with his sisters to reminisce about growing 
up in the area 
lawrence is older than we are but we used to go to town on 
saturday night and peek through the windows of the blue room and 
see him playing with the hotsy totsy boys nieuwsma recalled 
back there in the haymow thats where he practiced his 
accordion until he left nieuwsma said 
lawrence never wanted to be a farmer but he made a deal with 
his father that hed work on the farm until he was 21 in return 
for a 400 accordion 
welk kept his part of the bargain and went on to one of the 
countrys most successful bandleaders he formed his own band in 
1927 and got his start in radio at wnax in yankton sd the band 
was known as the honolulu fruit gum orchestra and lawrence 
welk and his hotsy totsy boys and played at area ballrooms for 
several years in the late 1920s and early 1930s 
he started out with polkas and waltzes eiseman said its 
just the general heritage around here everybody plays polkas and 
waltzes 
in the late 1930s the band traveled east to the william penn 
hotel in pittsburgh where champagne music was born welk then 
made his headquarters in the chicago area in the 1940s and became 
a national television hit in the late 1950s first as a summer 
replacement and then as a regularly weekly show 
his syndicated television show now in reruns is still a 
favorite among north dakotans on saturday nights

egypt sent its foreign minister to the white 
house on tuesday with a message of peace and this advice talk 
to the plo again 
the us reply through spokesman marlin fitzwater was that 
talks with yasser arafats group had only been suspended not cut 
off forever more 
to get the 18month dialogue resumed all arafat has to do is 
punish the perpetrators of the attempted may 30 assault on tel aviv 
and denounce it as well us officials said 
as for the message carried by foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid the egyptian emissary declined to provide any 
details and fitzwater and other us officials were not filling in 
the information blanks 
but abdelmeguid provided a couple of clues after he saw 
secretary of state james a baker iii at the state department 
he said it was up to israel to get the stalled process going 
and that egypt was willing to resume its role of conduit to the 
palestine liberation organization 
if this can help if the parties are ready the foreign 
minister told reporters 
i think the palestinians are certainly part of the peace 
process and this has been known since the peace process started 
abdelmeguid said 
at the same time he suggested it was israels fault there are 
no negotiations in the middle east it is for israel to respond 
to the peace process now the foreign minister said 
egypt working with the plo helped arrange the formula that 
baker presented to israel in march it provided for talks between 
israel and palestinians in cairo 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir who proposed palestinian 
elections last year resisted provisions to include palestinians 
deported from the west bank and others with homes in east jerusalem 
in the negotiations 
the israeli cabinet collapsed under the strain this month 
shamir formed a new government and bush has written to ask the 
prime minister what his intentions are for dealing with 
palestinians 
margaret d tutwiler the state department spokeswoman said 
tuesday that shamir had not replied nor has the bush 
administration invited the new israeli foreign minister david 
levy to washington for talks 
fitzwater said bushs meeting with abdelmeguid focused on the 
peace process and on bushs decision to suspend the 18month us 
dialogue with the plo 
the president made two essential points in the discussion 
the spokesman said first that the united states is committed to 
continuing the peace process and we want to work as best we can to 
get a dialogue going that will help resolve those issues 
secondly the president reiterated that his action with regard 
to the plo was a suspension of our dialogue and that we continue to 
look to the plo to make those actions and statements that would 
allow us to resume a dialogue at some point in the future 
fitzwater said 
in the foiled raid two speedboats crammed with palestinian 
guerrillas were spotted by radar and intercepted by the israeli 
navy before they could reach the tel aviv beach four of the 
guerrillas were killed and 12 captured 
abul abbas a member of the plos executive committee claimed 
responsibility for the attack the bush administration wants arafat 
to punish him but so far there is no sign the chairman will act 
against the head of the palestine liberation front

lithuanias prime minister told 
parliament tuesday that breaking away from the soviet union would 
be impossible without a compromise with the kremlin and asked the 
lithuanian supreme council to freeze its declaration of 
independence 
kazimiere prunskiene said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
agreed in a telephone call earlier in the day that in return for a 
temporary suspension of its march 11 independence declaration he 
would end the nineweekold economic embargo against the breakaway 
baltic republic 
gorbachev also said he would begin negotiations that will 
discuss a different status for lithuania including as an 
independent state the prime minister said 
there was no confirmation from soviet officials of mrs 
prunskienes claim that gorbachev had softened his position on 
independence the only statement from moscow about lithuania was 
more toughly worded 
mrs prunskiene argued that lithuania will not escape the 
economic blockade imposed in april by the kremlin take control of 
its borders or be free of soviet army soldiers without 
compromising 
we need negotiations she said we dont have a magic wand 
to solve these problems 
mrs prunskiene also hinted the future of her government 
including her own possible resignation may depend on how the 
supreme council parliament reacts to the proposed compromise 
maybe a new government could find some such solution she 
said 
lithuania a republic of 38 million people and its parliament 
are divided over whether to accept a compromise with moscow over 
the declaration of independence 
gorbachev met with lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis in 
moscow on tuesday morning then telephoned mrs prunskiene two 
hours later in the lithuanian capital of vilnius to offer what the 
prime minister described to parliament as a softening of his 
position 
mrs prunskiene said she was optimistic a compromise would lead 
to lithuanian independence in part because gorbachev in the 
telephone conversation did not repeat his demand that the republic 
return to march 10 once again act as a soviet republic rather 
than an independent state 
she argued that that amounts to willingness to negotiate with 
lithuania as a sovereign state and recognition of its declaration 
of independence 
but the soviet news agency tass quoting what it said was an 
official report on the meeting with landsbergis said the 
lithuanian president was told talks can only be held if lithuania 
declares a moratorium and suspends the act of march 11 for a period 
of talks they can be held only in the context of an 
interrepublican dialogue on the preparation of a new union treaty 
and the formation of a union of sovereign socialists states 
landsbergis did not give the parliament a clear account of his 
meeting with gorbachev but said he came away from it with a much 
better idea of what was acceptable to the soviet leader 
he said he may return to moscow on wednesday if more discussions 
are necessary 
committees of the supreme council will meet on wednesday to 
discuss 10 versions of the compromise the full parliament is to 
discuss them thursday 
landsbergis said gorbachev reviewed eight of the 10 options 
during the meeting 
unlike mrs prunskiene landsbergis made no appeal for 
acceptance of the compromise in his speech to parliament the 
lithuanian president said he was simply offering a draft for 
discussion 
top soviet officials also reportedly were debating whether to 
delay the critical national communist party congress scheduled to 
open july 2 gorbachev might face a challenge to his leadership 
from traditional soviet communists at the meeting and a walkout by 
progressives 
lithuanian officials said privately a sharp debate was going on 
in the republic on how their drive for independence would be 
affected by the congress and its effect on gorbachevs power 
the lithuanians indicated they do not know if they should accept 
the compromise while gorbachev is strong enough to offer it or 
hold out for possible victory by reformers who support the 
republics right to independence 
the kremlin cut off all oil most natural gas and some other raw 
materials to the republic in nine weeks ago in an attempt to force 
it to rescind the declaration of independence 
mrs prunskiene said western powers want lithuania to negotiate 
and reduce the tension between east and west caused by the 
confrontation 
a small group of foreign correspondents was allowed back into 
the republic for the first time in weeks on tuesday the soviet 
foreign ministry has been barring correspondents from traveling to 
lithuania

the worlds first testtube tiger cub pounced 
and growled during her national zoo debut tuesday before settling 
down with a big bottle of milk 
the 20pound bouncing bengal is one of a litter of three cubs 
produced by in vitro fertilization in an effort to save endangered 
tiger species 
mary alice the only surviving cub was born by caesarean 
section april 27 
this is a marvelous step forward for all those cats on the 
verge of extinction said michael robinson director of the 
national zoo in 20 years of our lifetime we have lost three 
subspecies of tigers 
during a meetings with journalists mary alice fussed and 
squirmed until her keeper stuck a milk bottle in her mouth 
then the yellowandblack cub stood up on her hind legs 
grasped the bottle with her front paws closed her eyes and sucked 
aggressively until her chin was covered with milk 
mary alice is expected to weigh about 300 pounds when she is 
fully grown 
a second yellowandblack cub died of pneumonia three weeks 
after birth but zoo officials said the death was not related to 
the in vitro procedure the third cub a white tiger died shortly 
after birth 
the surrogate mother nicole a 9yearold siberian tiger is 
from the henry doorly zoo in omaha neb a male tiger named chester 
provided the sperm that scientists used to fertilize three eggs 
taken from two other tigers 
mary alice eventually will be housed at the omaha zoo 
of the 37 species of felines all but the domestic cat are 
threatened or endangered according to the national zoos center 
for new opportunities in animal health sciences that means a 
species is either dying out or not reproducing rapidly enough to 
survive longterm 
since 1969 three subspecies of tigers have become extinct and 
the south china tiger is critically endangered with only 50 
remaining in the world 
there are more tigers in the worlds zoos than there are in the 
wild 31 blackfooted cats 21 sand cats and 12 pallas cats in 
zoos according to center officials 
sometimes people use the words captive and research as 
fourletter words said lee simmons director of the omaha zoo 
this animals relatives are captive in siberia and other 
countries he said the habitats for many animals are in 
isolated enclaves 
when tigers natural habitats are destroyed they are limited to 
a small area isolated from other tiger species in their home 
countries while kept in a small area tigers inbreed not 
producing new genetic material which causes extinction simmons 
said 
national zoo officials said in vitro fertilization helps 
conserve rare tiger species by allowing animals that are sexually 
incompatible or separated by long distances to reproduce 
mary alice is named after the wife of ulysses seal a major 
participant in programs to conserve tigers in zoos simmons said

the soviet union on tuesday denied reports it is 
shifting nuclear warheads out of its rebellious baltic and southern 
republics and into less volatile regions 
as they told us in the defense ministry press center there is 
no need to remove soviet troops with nuclear weapons around the 
soviet union so no unscheduled movements have been made foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a regular briefing 
us officials and private specialists said last week that the 
soviets were moving nuclear warheads out of the baltics and 
southern republics including armenia and azerbaijan 
the us officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
moves reflected moscows concerns about nationalist and ethnic 
tensions that could lead to attempts by rebel forces to take 
control of a nuclear weapons storage depot 
stephen meyer an authority on the soviet military and a 
professor at the massachusetts institute of technology said last 
week that soviet government officials had told him recently they 
were consolidating their weapon storage sites for security reasons 
this is a very touchy subject for them meyer said 
meyer said it seemed from his conversations with soviet 
officials that the warhead removal started after a flareup of 
violence in january between armed azerbaijani and armenian groups 
around baku a city where some nuclear warheads are believed to be 
stored 
moscow sent russian airborne units to stop the fighting but 
isolated attacks on military units in that area reportedly have 
continued 
meyer said the consolidation involves not only nuclear warheads 
but also conventional armaments he likened the move to an american 
decision in the 1970s to reduce the number of nuclear warhead 
storage sites in western europe in response to a rise in terrorist 
threats against us installations

civil rights leaders who worked with martin 
luther king jr say they support nelson mandela in his effort to 
liberate south africas blacks despite his refusal to renounce 
violence as king did 
mandela is to visit the king center for nonviolent social change 
on wednesday to lay a wreath at kings tomb he is to meet with 
kings widow coretta scott king and the rev joseph lowery 
president of the kingfounded southern christian leadership 
conference 
civil rights leaders in atlanta generally have said it is more 
important to liberate south african blacks than to insist on 
following kings staunch policy of nonviolence 
as an advocate of nonviolence i am very concerned about 
violence but violence has a lot of ramifications lowery said in 
an interview after a recent trip to south africa there is state 
violence in south africa which makes it difficult for blacks to 
commit themselves to nonviolence the government has not renounced 
violence 
we are more than anxious to be helpful lowery said if 
our experiences in desegregation can be helpful we will offer 
them 
mrs king has said more attention is paid to mandelas position 
on violence than is to the south african governments acts of 
violence against blacks 
in a newspaper column she said that as chairwoman of the 
mandela visit host committee she would like to show the 71yearold 
african national congress leader the city of atlantas impressive 
spirit of interracial cooperation 
there are some differences in every revolution but i have to 
advocate nonviolence ive seen the results said the rev hosea 
williams kings field lieutenant during the 1960s right now if 
the blacks in south africa could overcome apartheid with violence 
they would still be sitting ducks for violence against them 
i would tell mr mandela to please study and evaluate the 
teachings of martin luther king jr before deciding that violence 
is the only way to bring about needed social change williams 
said 
as a young baptist minister king led bus boycotts in 
montgomery ala in 1955 and was successful in achieving 
integration of the citys public transportation system without 
violence he founded the sclc in 1957 and dedicated the group to 
fighting for social change through peaceful means 
king advocated worldwide economic sanctions against south africa 
as a means of destroying apartheid and in a 1964 speech on the 
south african situation said we can understand how in that 
situation people felt so desperate that they turned to other 
methods such as sabotage 
at the time of his death king was greatly troubled by a trend 
among black youth to embrace violence 
mandela helped found and launch the ancs guerrilla campaign 
after the group was banned in 1960 he was arrested in 1962 and in 
1964 was sentenced to life in prison for sabotage and plotting to 
overthrow south africas white government 
while on trial mandela said the anc had no choice but to wage 
an armed struggle because the group had been outlawed mandela and 
the organization continue to support armed struggle saying it is 
necessary to keep pressure on the government 
on tuesday speaking to a joint session of congress mandela did 
not directly restate his position that violence is a necessary tool 
in battling apartheid but he pointed to the south african 
governments oppression of the black majority 
for those who care to worry about violence in our country as 
we do it is at these forces that they should focus their 
attention mandela said

young men in the united states are more than four 
times as likely to be homicide victims than those in 21 other 
industrialized countries according to a study released tuesday 
in 1987 there were 4223 male homicide victims aged 15 to 24 in 
the united states or 219 for every 100000 men in that age group 
researchers said in an article in this weeks journal of the 
american medical association 
the country with the next highest rate was scotland with 22 
victims or 50 for every 100000 men in the same category 
austrias 03 was the lowest rate 
if the us homicide rate could be reduced to the next highest 
rate more than 3000 lives would be saved each year wrote lois 
fingerhut and joel kleinman of the federal national center for 
health statistics in hyattsville md 
while there is no clear reason for the wide differences we 
have to look at the availability of firearms said fingerhut in a 
telephone interview from hyattsville 
the researchers found that 75 percent of the us deaths were 
caused by guns france was second with 54 percent 
the researchers used the latest available figures for each of 
the 21 countries most were for 1987 but some were for 1986 or 1985 
a spokesman for the national rifle association in washington 
tom wyld said the nra wouldnt comment without studying the 
article 
but james wright a tulane university sociologist who 
specializes in criminology noted that the swiss own guns and have 
almost no history of violence 
but they do emphasize responsible firearm ownership much more 
than we do he said 
according to the nchs study only one of 14 homicides in 
switzerland was by firearm 
and if you subtract all the firearm homicides were still 
killing loads more people than any other country wright said 
from his office in new orleans 
homicides in the united states in 1987 not involving firearms 
outnumbered annual murder totals in all 21 other countries combined 
by more than 3to1 1036 to 308 according to the study 
the argument has been made that comparisons of homicide in the 
united states and other countries are not valid because the united 
states has such a heterogeneous population the researchers said 
but they point to ohio whose black and metropolitan percentages 
mirror the entire united states but whose homicide rates for both 
blacks and whites are less than half the national average 
fingerhut said the research focused on the 15to24 age group 
because 20 percent of all us homicides occurred in this age 
group and because public health service objectives include a sharp 
reduction in homicides especially among black males 
when comparisions were made for the total population the us 
rate 87 per 100000 was still 26 times higher than the next 
highest rate finland with 33 per 100000 
the us rate among black males 15 to 24 was 856 per 100000 
more than seven times this nations rate for young white males but 
the rate for white males alone 112 was still more than twice the 
rate in scotland the study found 
in the united states homicide is the leading cause of death 
among black males aged 15 to 24 years and the third leading cause 
after motor vehicle injuries and suicide among white males 15 
through 24 years of age the researchers wrote in the 
chicagobased jama

the state department on tuesday estimated 
there still are 1000 to 2000 chinese in prison after beijings 
crackdown last year on the prodemocracy movement 
us officials have been telling the chinese that we hope the 
names of all those released will be made available and that china 
will provide an accounting of all those who remain in detention 
said department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
our best guess is that probably up to 1000 perhaps 2000 
remain in prison but i must caution you that we do not have 
accurate information ms tutwiler told reporters 
she noted the chinese have officially declared that fewer than 
400 people remain in detention while amnesty international a 
human rights organization estimates that 650 are still in prison 
others have reported higher numbers of prisoners 
china has announced three releases of prisoners ms tutwiler 
said one in january of 573 people one in may of 211 and a third 
in june of 97 
assistant secretary of state richard solomon testified before a 
congressional panel earlier this month that at least 2000 remained 
in custody out of the 15000 arrested in last summers violent 
upheaval the number of those killed has been estimated in the 
hundreds or thousands

robbers with a shotgun ambushed an 
armored car whose crew had stopped to buy sandwiches and stole more 
than 10 million cash tuesday in one of the largest heists in us 
history authorities said 
the armored motor service of america inc truck was headed to 
the federal reserve bank branch in buffalo when the robbery 
occurred the monroe county sheriffs department said the trucks 
driver and guard were bound and gagged but were not injured 
we dont have an exact amount sheriff andrew p meloni 
said its in the neighborhood of 108 million he said 
authorities have no suspects 
meloni said officials have not yet determined where the money 
came from 
the largest reported robbery from a us armored car company was 
in 1982 when 11 million was taken from the sentry armored car 
courier co in new york city but authorities have since said much 
of the missing money may have been previously embezzled 
in 1985 nearly 8 million was stolen from a wells fargo depot 
in manhattan in 1983 robbers took gold estimated to be worth up 
to 11 million from a smelting firm and jewelry wholesaler in north 
miami fla 
fbi spokesman bill carter said armored car robberies are usually 
larger than bank robberies 
the amsa truck left the companys offices in the rochester 
suburb of chili about 7 am tuesday with a male driver and a 
female guard aboard sheriffs department spokesman tom ryan said 
the employees names have not been released 
they stopped at a store nearby and the guard left the truck to 
buy coffee and sandwiches ryan said 
while the woman was in the store a man stuck a shotgun in the 
slot of the armored car and took control of the vehicle meloni 
said when the woman returned to the car she also was placed under 
the gunmans control 
ryan said investigators believe at least one other person was 
involved in the robbery the employees said they could not give a 
good description of the robbers because they were told not to turn 
around he said 
the employees were ordered to drive to a wooded area in the town 
of henrietta about half a mile from the convenience store where 
they were tied up blindfolded and gagged 
the robbers transferred the money bags weighing at least 1600 
pounds from the armored car to another vehicle and drove off ryan 
said 
the amsa employees were able to free themselves within 15 
minutes drove back to the company headquarters and reported the 
robbery 
it was the second multimilliondollar heist amsa has suffered in 
the past 13 months 
in may 1989 29 million was stolen from an amsa truck in east 
syracuse two men drove a oneton truck through an overhead garage 
door and pistolwhipped two guards in that robbery 
two suspects are now on trial in federal court in syracuse one 
of the security guards involved pleaded guilty last year to taking 
part in the robbery 
meloni would not comment on whether tuesdays robbery could have

the senate rejected a constitutional amendment 
against flag burning tuesday with critics arguing that it was 
already dead and being debated largely as ammunition for use 
against them at election time 
we will take a meaningless vote so that some campaign 
operatives can try to bludgeon senators who are willing to stand up 
for the bill of rights and vote against this amendment sen 
howard m metzenbaum dohio declared 
the senate voted 5842 in favor leaving it nine short of the 
required twothirds majority needed to approve amendments 
thirtyeight republicans voted in favor and seven voted against 
among democrats it was 20 in favor and 35 against 
president bush has been calling for approval of the measure 
which said simply that congress and the states shall have power 
to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the united 
states 
but the house rejected it last week falling 34 votes short of 
twothirds with a 254177 tally in favor speaker thomas foley said 
lawmakers would not get a chance to reconsider this year 
the senates action thus was largely a symbolic gesture that 
gave senators a chance to vent their views on an issue that has 
raged in the year since the supreme court held unconstitutional a 
texas flagburning law 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas conceded before the 
vote that were not going to win now but he said that were 
not going to give up and well see what happens in the days and 
weeks and months ahead 
in the heartland of america some folks just cant understand 
what congress is up to dole said 
democratic leader george mitchell of maine told lawmakers they 
could support the american flag without changing the american 
constitution 
he said it would be a sad irony to see flag burners 
stampeding those who love america into taking the unwise action 
of changing the bill of rights for the first time in our history 
i love america and the american flag and the american bill of 
rights too much to let that happen without a fight mitchell said 
conservative supporters held out hope that if the senate 
approved the amendment they could somehow revive the measure in the 
house while critics said the idea was to put them on record on an 
emotional issue that could help their challengers 
stirred by fears of soundbites and 30second spots members 
of congress who should know better are expressing a willingness to 
sacrifice the bill of rights for what they hope will be a benefit 
in the polls said sen edward m kennedy dmass 
but sen strom thurmond rsc said the issue was so 
important that it should be sent to the states where the american 
people can decide whether they want to protect the flag 
if we in the senate pass it i have a feeling the house will 
pass it thurmond said 
in a dramatic switch sen charles robb dva declared he had 
changed his mind since last year when he backed the constitutional 
amendment 
robb said that after the supreme court decision he as a veteran 
felt anger toward flag burners and feared the visceral outrage of 
most americans 
robb fought in vietnam as a marine corps officer 
i have concluded that our flag can better be protected by not 
tinkering with the first amendment to the constitution robb said 
sen howell heflin dala called for approval of the 
amendment saying that americanism cannot survive unless it has 
nationalism and americanism is bottomed on nationalism 
americanism must have sacred symbols heflin said 
sen warren rudman rnh reminded the senate that president 
woodrow wilson had advocated a maximum of free speech to make sure 
that those who were fools would be exposed as such by their own 
words 
those who burn the american flag are fools lets not dignify 
them by changing the bill of rights rudman said 
before voting on the amendment itself the senate rejected three 
rival versions 
the senate rejected 9010 a plan offered by sen jesse helms 
rnc that would strip the supreme court of its authority to 
decide flagburning cases 
helms pointed to the close 54 vote in the supreme court and 
said his measure was the most effective way to combat these kooks 
these loonies who burn the american flag 
critics said the helms plan would violate longestablished law 
giving the supreme court jurisdiction over constitutional issues 
its almost as ancient as the republic said sen christopher 
dodd dconn 
the senate also voted 5148 to kill a plan offered by sen dale 
bumpers dark that would replace the amendment with legislation 
to ban burning the flag in any way that would cause a breach of the 
peace 
critics said approval of the measure would make it impossible to 
get a vote on the amendment that had been urged by the president 
for a year but bumpers said that measure was drawn so broadly that 
it would cover numerous harmless uses of the flag 
you cant buy a coke without a reproduction of the flag on the 
cup bumpers said pantyhouse swizel sticks everything 
by 937 the senate rejected a proposal offered by judiciary 
committee chairman joseph r biden jr ddel that would allow 
congress to ban flag burning but deny that power to the states

peruvians lined up to buy bread gasoline and 
other essentials tuesday as presidentelect alberto fujimori 
prepared to travel to the united states to seek aid to cope with a 
deepening economic crisis 
in lima housewives stood in blocklong lines to buy bottled 
cooking gas children waited hours to buy fistsized loaves of 
bread hundreds of taxis and buses idled near the few open gas 
stations 
perus currency the inti lost value by the hour on the free 
market the inti has been devalued by 48 percent in one week and by 
23 percent since monday morning 
the shortages come five weeks before fujimori is to be sworn in 
as perus next president fujimori an agronomist who was a 
political unknown at the start of the election campaign defeated 
noted novelist mario vargas llosa in the june 10 presidential 
runoff 
on thursday fujimori is scheduled to travel to new york where 
he plans to visit the united nations to seek emergency economic aid 
to finance food imports 
he will also travel to washington to meet with officials of the 
international monetary fund world bank and interamerican 
development bank he hopes to reestablish ties with international 
lenders that were broken by his predecessor alan garcia who 
limited payments on the countrys 20 billion foreign debt 
fujimori the son of japanese immigrants will then travel on to 
tokyo for meetings with japanese leaders japan has said it is 
willing to resume loans to peru if the country can show a 
willingness to deal with its serious social and economic problems 
in lima the shortages have only added to the problems of the 
capitals 7 million residents who already suffer from daily 
blackouts severe water rationing and runaway inflation 
the general manager of petroperu the stateowned oil company 
blamed the fuel shortages on panic buying and excess demand 
petroperu is very worried by the situation pedro touzett 
told a news conference tuesday people whose gas tanks are 
normally half empty are trying to fill them up every night 
housewives who normally store one gallon of kerosene are storing 
five 
touzett added that the shortage of electricity had increased 
demand for cooking gas and gasoline to power private generators he 
said the power shortages also hampered fuel distribution because 
gas stations cannot operate their pumps and natural gas bottlers 
their machinery 
the bread industry association attributed the bread shortages to 
reduced wheat imports peru imports all but 150000 tons of the 12 
million tons of wheat the country consumes each year 
once more we beg the government to import on a bigger scale 
and to do so continuously gilberto hinojosa teves of the bread 
industry association told reporters monday 
but economists say that many imports have been reduced because 
of a lack of foreign currency 
the government has been selling silver and gold to raise money 
the central bank reserves stand at 900 million mostly gold and 
silver 
centrist politician manuel moreyra said monday that the rapid 
devaluation of the inti was due to the governments unusual 
emission of bills as well as the uncertainty before political 
change 
the countrys problems have been compounded by a severe drought 
that has cut crop production and hydroelectric power and attacks 
by maoist shining path guerrillas on power lines

there still are 1000 to 2000 chinese in prison after beijings 
crackdown last year on the prodemocracy movement 
us officials have been telling the chinese that we hope the 
names of all those released will be made available and that china 
will provide an accounting of all those who remain in detention

remain in prison but i must caution you that we do not have 
accurate information ms tutwiler told reporters 
she noted the chinese have officially declared that fewer than 
400 people remain in detention while amnesty international a 
human rights organization estimates that 650 are still in prison 
others have reported higher numbers of prisoners 
china has announced three releases of prisoners ms tutwiler 
said one in january of 573 people one in may of 211 and a third 
in june of 97

the bush administration announced preliminary 
plans for saving the threatened northern spotted owl tuesday 
contending it can be done with a farlessdrastic reduction in 
timber cutting than government scientists say even so 1000 
northwest logging jobs would be lost 
for the second time in a week officials delayed issuing a 
complete proposal to support their public hopes that the bird can 
be saved without economically devastating the region by greatly 
restricting timber cutting 
tuesdays outlook from agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and 
interior secretary manuel lujan jr was in stark contrast to 
estimates by government scientists that timbercutting reductions 
that would cost 28000 jobs by the end of the decade would be 
necessary to save the owls habitat in the northwests oldgrowth 
forests 
environmental groups said in advance they would likely challenge 
in court any action short of that 
today we have set into motion a process to balance our 
responsibility in preserving the owl and forests while protecting 
the economic lives of american men and women who live and work in 
the region yeutter said 
he said he will chair a new timber task force that will present 
to president bush no later than sept 1 a comprehensive proposal 
for protecting the owl while pursuing maximum timber harvests on 
forest service lands in the pacific northwest 
at the same time the cabinet secretaries also called on 
congress to broaden provisions of the endangered species act so 
that an exemption committee will have more latitude to consider the 
economic and social impact of protecting such wildlife 
congressional members of both parties blasted administration 
officials for failing to outline more specific proposals accusing 
them of ducking the issue 
these proposals are a sham theyre smoke and mirrors said 
rep bob smith an oregon republican 
rep jolene unsoeld dwash said the administration is trying 
to throw it back to us and expect us to work miracles 
i think they have come up with something they know is 
impossible but will give them a chance to dump it back on 
congress she said 
the estimated 6000 remaining owls were declared a threatened 
species under the act last week 
under the act federal agencies are prohibited from harming the 
owl or its critical habitat without first receiving permission from 
the fish and wildlife service 
lujan and yeutter said the bureau of land management will put 
into effect a plan that will result in the eventual loss of 1000 
jobs due to reduced timber harvests on blm lands in oregon and 
northern california 
an earlier proposal by government scientists would have resulted 
in the loss of 7600 jobs as a result of cutting reductions on 
bureau of land management land and the loss of an additional 20000 
jobs by the end of the decade as a result of reductions on forest 
service land 
despite the lesser reductions lujan said that by careful 
cutting the blm land proposal would protect 125 more pairs of owls 
than would the proposal offered by the government scientists led by 
forest service biologist jack ward thomas 
lujan said cutting on bureau of land management acreage in 
oregon and northern california would be reduced from 950 million 
board feet annually to about 750 million board feet the thomas 
proposal would have cut harvests on the lands to less than 500 
million board feet 
lujan said the bureau of land management is determined to have a 
minimal impact on owl habitat as it seeks maximum timber harvest 
levels 
were not going to just go in there and cut willy nilly any 
contract submitted to us must meet the test of the fish and 
wildlife service if we dont meet the test we dont cut he 
said 
yeutter said the forest service will operate under existing 
forest plans until the new timber task force can come up with an 
interim conservation proposal for the owl a move that should allow 
the service to harvest the 385 billion board feet of timber 
mandated by congress last year 
under the earlier recommendations of the government scientists 
cutting on forest service lands in the region would have been 
reduced to between 23 billion and 25 billion board feet 
yeutter also announced for the first time publicly that the 
administration supports a proposal to ban exports of raw logs from 
state lands in oregon and washington as a way to offset any 
reduction in timber supply resulting from owl protection 
the fish and wildlife service last friday announced its decision 
to classify the owl as a threatened species entitled to protection 
under the same law that has protected the grizzly bear and bald 
eagle 
biologists say each nesting pair of owls needs a large tract of 
undisturbed oldgrowth forest

the coast guard ended its efforts to 
track spilled oil from the supertanker mega borg after crews 
tuesday failed to find any sign of the oil sheen in the gulf of 
mexico 
since sunday coast guard pilots have been unable to spot the 
sheen once 45 miles long which had come within 7 miles of the 
texas shoreline last week officials said 
were expecting it to dissipate said coast guard chief 
warrant officer howard edmonds we dont think it will come 
ashore 
an estimated 39 million gallons of angolan crude oil spilled 
from the norwegian supertanker when it exploded june 8 officials 
believe most of the oil burned evaporated or was scooped up by 11 
skimmers 
edmonds said tuesday the coast guard was calling back its flight 
crews and beach patrols which have been looking for tar balls from 
galveston to sabine pass for the past 10 days he said winds and 
waves are believed to have broken up the remaining oil and pushed 
it back out to sea 
meanwhile salvage crews continued transfering oil from the mega 
borg to smaller cargo vessels the transfers are expected to be 
completed wednesday edmonds said 
the 886foot norwegian ship exploded while crews were 
transferring its 38 million gallon cargo onto a smaller vessel in a 
process called lightering the supertanker burned for more than a 
week some 57 miles offshore from galveston 
two crew members were killed while two others remain missing 
and are presumed dead seventeen other crewmen were injured the 
ship owners have not said whether the supertanker will be repaired 
or scrapped

president bush who won the white house with a 
readmylips pledge of no new taxes conceded tuesday that tax 
increases must be part of any plan to shrink the mushrooming budget 
deficit 
the politically charged admission was quickly hailed by 
democrats who had demanded that bush and his republican allies 
share the heat for digging deeper into taxpayers pockets during an 
election year 
rep dan rostenkowski dill and chairman of the taxwriting 
house ways and means committee called bushs statement an 
important step in the right direction while the white house said 
it marked the turning point in sluggish negotiations with congress 
to write a plan to reduce the deficit 
were going to have to do some things that are probably not 
going to be universally popular in dealing with the budget 
deficit said house speaker thomas foley dwash 
neither the white house nor congressional democrats would 
speculate on what taxes might be raised or what spending programs 
might be trimmed 
were not willing to give it any definition presidential 
press secretary marlin fitzwater said of bushs statement thats 
a matter for the negotiators 
some republicans balked at bushs decision and it quickly became 
a political target 
rep robert walker rpa a member of the house gop leadership 
urged members of congress to sign a letter declaring any increase 
in tax rates unacceptable by the end of the day 90 republicans 
more than half the 176 gop members of the house had put their 
names on the paper 
rep robert torricelli dnj said the charade is finally 
over 
the other shoe raised in the 1988 presidential campaign has 
just dropped george bush has announced that hes raising taxes 
torricelli said 
sen john breaux dla said bush had scotched an electionyear 
theme for republicans 
it removes this socalled tax and spend issue from their 
arsenal of weapons he said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said the 
president had concluded that tax increases are necessary and we 
share the presidents view 
foley added i think someone who is complaining about taxes 
being raised in the budget summit will have to complain against 
both parties and the president 
white house chief of staff john sununu tried to calm the 
republican revolt house republican whip newt gingrich of georgia 
said sununu had assured him that nothing had changed in bushs 
position on taxes the white house claims the statement doesnt 
mean anything new gingrich insisted 
deficit estimates have sharply increased since bush unveiled his 
budget in january and red ink may total more than 200 billion in 
the next fiscal year 
were not interested in whos first to mention taxes and 
whos last and who gets the blame for this and that fitzwater 
said both sides want to move in a bipartisan way to resolve this 
issue and this statement is designed to reflect that feeling 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis bushs democratic rival in 
the 1988 presidential election said he told the truth about the 
need for higher taxes and paid the price by losing the 
presidency 
mr bush did not tell the truth and were all now going to 
have to pay the price for that dukakis said in boston 
meanwhile democratic party chairman ron brown said bushs 
statement was candid and sober and gives no one comfort its no 
time for partisan gloating 
budget talks are scheduled to resume wednesday and the white 
house expressed hope for a final agreement by the august 
congressional recess 
bush issued his statement after a breakfast session with top 
congressional leaders and following a weekend of meetings between 
democrats and white house budget negotiators 
it is clear to me bush said that both the size of the 
deficit problem and the need for a package that can be enacted 
require all of the following 
he listed tax revenue increases cuts in spending for 
federal benefits as well as reductions in other domestic and 
defense programs reform of the budget process and growth 
incentives a term often used to describe a cut in the capital 
gains tax rate 
bush asked about his statement as he left a photo session said 
the written statement speaks for itself and declined to 
specifically address reporters questions about his position 
i want to see this economy grow he said i want jobs i 
want to see the deficit down and this bipartisan statement speaks 
for itself now were going on to some serious negotiation 
he hailed congressional democrats for the good faith spirit 
of the budget talks and said it was essential that these talks 
get moving 
from the outset of the budget talks bush had said that 
everything was on the table for negotiation 
until now however he had refused to say explicitly that tax 
increases must be included in the deficitreduction formula 
the white house refused to acknowledge that bush had scrapped 
his nonewtaxes pledge 
are you crazy fitzwater goodnaturedly asked reporters 
however fitzwater said bushs statement amounted to a 
refinement of his earlier remarks 
weve got to deal realistically with this problem he said 
on the other hand fitzwater said i dont think that it 
bushs statement is that big a change were still a long way 
from the final details of a settlement 
there is a general consensus among budget negotiators that they 
need to reduce the deficit by 45 billion to 60 billion in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 and about 400 billion to 600 billion 
over the next five years 
technically the grammrudman deficit reduction law would 
require far deeper cuts based on current revenue and spending 
projections by law the government will be forced to absorb deep 
acrosstheboard spending cuts unless the deficit is kept to 74 
billion in fiscal 1991

nelson mandela who spent 27 years in jail for 
opposing his government will meet this week with another famous 
dissident natan sharansky 
the meeting with the former soviet prisoner will take place on 
friday in los angeles a day before mandela winds up his 10day 
us tour the antidefamation league announced tuesday 
sharansky was imprisoned in soviet jails and labor camps for 
more than eight years on false charges of treason before being 
exchanged in a 1986 eastwest prisoner swap and allowed to go to 
israel 
it is indeed appropriate for these two giants of our 
generation heroes to blacks and jews worldwide to share their 
experiences and to begin a dialogue exploring common grounds on a 
variety of issues said adl director abraham h foxman 
foxman said he proposed the meeting to mandela when he met with 
him in geneva earlier this month at the head of an american jewish 
delegation that wanted to protest the south african leaders warm 
praise for palestinian chieftain yasser arafat mandela allayed 
some of the jewish officials concerns by advocating israels right 
to exist within secure borders 
mandela told foxman he had read sharanskys autobiography 
fear no evil the jewish official said

the 12nation european community on 
tuesday called on all south africans to renounce violence in a 
declaration that britain said was directed squarely at nelson 
mandelas african national congress 
but the leaders of the trade bloc at the end of a twoday 
summit refused to ease sanctions against south africas whiteled 
government saying they need further clear evidence that 
changes to end apartheid will continue 
the statement came as mandela was being lionized on a visit to 
the united states where he called for sanctions to be maintained 
but mandela also caused unease in washington by his continued 
refusal to renounce violence 
british prime minister margaret thatcher said it was a great 
pity that the ec nations were unable to agree publicly to make 
a start now on easing sanctions 
what they have done is something i am very pleased about 
she added they have condemned pretty clearly anyone who 
advocates violence and that goes straight to the armed struggle 
in no uncertain terms and that ought to be abandoned 
despite the refusal to lift sanctions south africas government 
welcomed the ec statement 
what the declaration says albeit not in so many words is 
that south africa has regained international respectability 
foreign minister pik botha said in pretoria the use of violence 
is rejected he added by implication this means that the 
ancs adherence to the armed struggle is unacceptable 
the summit was dominated by the south african issue and by a 
west german and french demand for 15 billion in immediate aid to 
help the soviet unions deteriorating economy other leaders 
rejected the demand 
on the issue of south african sanctions the community said it 
affirms its willingness to consider a gradual relaxation of this 
pressure when there is further clear evidence that the process of 
change already initiated continues 
the european council calls on all parties to refrain from 
violence or advocacy of violence the communiquesaid 
the leaders described south african president fw de klerk as a 
man of foresight and courage and said mandela has inspired 
millions of south africans opposed to apartheid 
but in effect the community stuck to a position adopted at a 
summit in strasbourg france six months ago since then de klerk 
has begun a reform program including releasing mandela after 27 
years in jail legalizing the anc and scrapping some apartheid laws 
britain backed by portugal argued that de klerk deserved a 
specific reward but ireland and denmark were adamant that 
sanctions remain 
britain italy spain and portugal have already lifted some 
relatively minor restrictions 
but unanimous support by the ec nations is needed to end joint 
embargoes imposed in 1986 that banned imports of south african 
iron steel and gold coins 
on soviet aid the community ordered its executive commission to 
undertake with the world bank and other international agencies a 
study of moscows needs 
most of the leaders opposed giving money to the soviet union 
with no clear idea of how it would be used 
it wouldnt be responsible for the community to fix a budget 
without knowing the needs said spains prime minister felipe 
gonzalez 
in a related development a soviet foreign ministry spokesman 
acknowledged in moscow on tuesday that the soviet union was having 
trouble paying 2 billion in foreign bills but he asked for more 
western credits to help move toward a market economy 
officials said they expected italy which takes over the 
communitys sixmonth rotating presidency july 1 to have soviet 
aid proposals ready by fall 
west german chancellor helmut kohl predicted that an aid package 
would be organized by the end of the year but kohl who has 
pledged 31 billion of west german credit guarantees for the 
soviet union complained that whenever there is a question of 
money the question first goes to the federal republic of germany 
in a separate development the leaders expressed deep 
revulsion at recent manifestations of antisemitism racism and 
xenophobia in western europe particularly a spate of 
desecrations of jewish graves 
italian prime minister giulio andreotti said he had received a 
letter from palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat 
distancing himself from the foiled may 30 seaborne attack by 
palestinian guerrillas on a beach near tel aviv 
andreotti referred to the letter while speaking to italian 
reporters but gave no details 
the united states last week suspended its 18month dialogue with 
the plo because of arafats failure to condemn the raid and 
discipline mohammed abbas palestine liberation front which 
claimed responsibility for the attack 
on monday pressing ahead with plans for closer union the 
leaders agreed to start intergovernmental conferences in rome in 
middecember aimed at achieving an undefined form of political 
union and economic and monetary union by 1993

joint meeting in these revolutionary times 
lech walesa an electrician from poland vaclav havel a

mandela is a representative of a struggle he pointedly made

he craftily reminded his audience of american blood that has been 
shed in the cause of freedom using words known to every 
schoolchild and every member of congress 
equality liberty and the pursuit of happiness he said 
are fundamental human rights which are not only inalienable but 
must if necessary be defended with the weapons of war 
this was said by an erect trim tidy calm man in a soft 
lilting south african english that made his audience strain to hear 
before him sat washington the house the senate the cabinet 
military men led by a black general colin powell chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff the diplomatic corps including one black 
african ambassador in a sweeping white robe 
often when dignitaries visit members of congress find other 
demands more pressing and the seats are filled by staff not this 
time 
the overflow sat in statuary hall amid the granite figures 
watching on four television sets when he finished even that 
audience applauded 
sen jesse helms rnc stayed away he had fought vigorously 
when congress overriding a veto by thenpresident reagan imposed 
sanctions on south africa to bring pressure for an end of the rigid 
system of segregation known as apartheid 
helms had said in the debate that sanctions would lead to 
everlasting tyranny 
rep william dannemeyer rcalif said he boycotted as a 
matter of principle he said mandela was more like the 1960s 
revolutionary h rap brown than martin luther king jr 
but for the 24 black members of the house the moment was 
precious 
kweisi mfume formerly frizzell gray wore a black african sash 
with stripes of red and gold over his gray business suit he is a 
democratic member of the house from baltimore 
someone else apparently a staff member brought his tiny son 
dressed in a suit and led him across the house floor by the hand 
before his address mandela met with congress blacks members 
and a handful of their white allies he thanked them for pushing 
through sanctions 
to be there to see him to have him thank members of the 
congressional black caucus makes my lifetime in politics 
worthwhile said rep charles b rangel a democrat who 
represents harlem 
during the speech a shriek a whoop went up when mandela 
ticked off the names of his american heroes 
all right people called out right on 
he named washington jefferson lincoln of course but his list 
included names not always on such lists 
john brown the firebrand abolitionist whose anger at slavery 
helped start the civil war sojourner truth the black lady 
preacher who could neither read nor write but whose words stirred 
the north frederick douglass the runaway slave who bought his own 
freedom with the earnings from his speeches against slavery marcus 
garvey the black moses and king who dreamed of freedom from 
the steps of the lincoln memorial 
none of them in their time had been honored with an invitation 
to address congress the american equivalent to knighthood 
mandela became the first black who was not a head of state to 
whom that honor was bestowed 
he said he came not as a leader but as a particle of a 
people who we know to be noble and heroic enduring multiplying 
permanent rejoicing in the expectation and knowledge that their 
humanity will be reaffirmed

nelson mandela who spent 27 years in jail for 
opposing his government will meet this week with another famous 
dissident natan sharansky 
the meeting with the former soviet prisoner will take place on 
friday in los angeles a day before mandela winds up his 10day 
us tour the antidefamation league announced tuesday 
sharansky was imprisoned in soviet jails and labor camps for 
more than eight years on false charges of treason before being 
exchanged in a 1986 eastwest prisoner swap and allowed to go to 
israel 
it is indeed appropriate for these two giants of our 
generation heroes to blacks and jews worldwide to share their 
experiences and to begin a dialogue exploring common grounds on a 
variety of issues said adl director abraham h foxman 
foxman said he proposed the meeting to mandela when he met with 
him in geneva earlier this month at the head of an american jewish 
delegation that wanted to protest the south african leaders warm 
praise for palestinian chieftain yasser arafat mandela allayed 
some of the jewish officials concerns by advocating israels right 
to exist within secure borders 
mandela told foxman he had read sharanskys autobiography 
fear no evil the jewish official said

sirhan b sirhan who shot sen robert f 
kennedy to death 22 years ago was denied parole tuesday for the 
13th time 
after a hearing of more than five hours in soledad prison 
sirhan was told his next parole hearing would be in 1992 
commissioner david brown one of the three board of prison terms 
members said parole was denied because the prisoner committed a 
political assassination which is unique in american history 
brown said another reason for the denial was that the 
underlying cause of the offense and the prisoners role in the 
offense remain unresolved and a longer period of time is needed to 
resolve this issue 
brown did not elaborate on that comment and was not available 
for questions after the hearing 
sirhan now 46 was convicted of gunning down kennedy on june 5 
1968 in the pantry of los angeles ambassador hotel kennedy who 
had just won californias democratic primary died early the next 
day 
sirhan is serving a life term in prison he was sentenced to 
death in 1969 but the sentence was reduced to life imprisonment in 
1972 after the state supreme court struck down the death penalty 
the parole board had been petitioned by about 40 prominent 
middle east officials and citizens they included two arab members 
of israels knesset the mayor of bethlehem members of the arab 
womens union and officials of bir zeit university 
sirhans lawyer luke mckissack said monday the petition 
suggested that sirhans release could speed peace in the middle 
east 
los angeles deputy district attorney larry trapp said he was 
surprised at mckissacks move 
it would suggest that sirhan should have some place in making 
political decisions or influencing political decisions trapp 
said 
the petition said we of israel and palestine are concerned 
that inmate sirhan sirhan be given equal treatment under the law 
it concerns us that he is repeatedly denied parole while other 
convicted murderers many more dangerous than he are released 
after serving much less time

sharp food price increases and rebate 
reductions will force nearly a quarter of a million lowincome 
pregnant women and children from a federal supplemental nutrition 
program according to a survey released tuesday 
between march 1990 and september 1990 the end of the current 
fiscal year our survey found that at least 240000 participants 
would no longer be served by the wic program said dennis bach 
president of the national association of wic directors 
bach said at least 25 states already have begun reducing their 
monthly participation in the special supplemental food program for 
women infants and children known as wic 
the program provides needy women and children with vouchers 
redeemable at grocery stores for food including milk cheese 
juices and cereals 
since may 1989 the consumer price index shows that milk prices 
have risen 107 percent cheese costs have climbed 127 percent and 
fruit juices and frozen fruit prices have risen 138 percent 
congress has appropriated 21 billion for the current fiscal 
year bach said an additional 72 million was needed to prevent the 
reductions 
the house approved a fiscal 1991 increase of 235 million 
including 85 million to maintain current services and 150 million 
for program expansion 
but bach said the 150 million could be eaten up to maintain 
current levels 
only half of those currently eligible are receiving benefits 
according to bach 
the agriculture department meanwhile announced it was 
allocating an additional 11 million to 46 states for the wic 
program for the final three months of the fiscal year ending sept 
30 
many states have managed their wic caseloads carefully enough 
that they arent having any budgetary problems said betty jo 
nelsen administrator of the departments food and nutrition 
service 
others have had to economize by choosing less expensive 
but nutritious foods she said 
the house select committee on hunger planned a second hearing to 
examine program reductions on wednesday 
the estimated cutbacks are prompted by an increase in wic foods 
prices that the study said are averaging 7 percent or more in 
onethird of the states 
the department of agricultures food and nutrition service 
which runs the program had estimated only a 45 percent food price 
inflation 
in a recent status report the usda said no high priority 
pregnant or breastfeeding women or infants were being removed from 
the program as of march 
the government report however acknowledged some states will 
experience declines but said as many as 20 states would maintain 
or increase participation levels by the end of the fiscal year 
the states hardest hit in the cutbacks include california new 
york texas and florida

congressional investigators reported tuesday 
that the fate of the endangered mount graham red squirrel has 
become precarious and raised new objections to a planned 
observatory on the arizona mountaintop that is its only home 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress suggested that 1988 legislation authorizing construction 
of the 200 million observatory be changed to permit a delay while 
new studies are undertaken to weigh the impact of the installation 
on the squirrels chances for survival 
the forested site of the proposed observatory on mount graham in 
the pinaleno mountains 110 miles northeast of tucson is the 
squirrels only known habitat 
in testimony before four house environmental subcommittees 
james duffus iii natural resources director of the general 
accounting office sharply questioned the validity of a 1988 study 
by the interior departments fish and wildlife service which 
concluded that building the observatory would not pose an 
unacceptable risk to the squirrel 
duffus testified that since the wildlife services biological 
report was issued and the act approving the construction of the 
observatory was passed the status of the mount graham red 
squirrel has become more precarious 
available data suggest that squirrel numbers have dropped from 
about 215 in 1988 to between 132 and 146 in may 1990 he said 
duffus said that although the exact cause of the population 
decline in unknown biologists consulted by the gao suggest that 
reduction of the red squirrels source of food mostly spruce and 
fir tree cones is a major reason 
they contend that removing trees that produce these cones in 
order to build the astrophysical facility is not biologically 
sound he said 
the university of arizona initially sought to build a 
seventelescope facility atop the emerald and high peaks of the 
mountain 
duffus said the eventual fish and wildlife report giving a green 
light to a compromise bid to build three telescopes was flawed 
because it was based on other than biological information and 
ignored the concerns of the services own biologists 
the wildlife services regional director decided on his own that 
the universitys determination to build a worldclass facility 
outweighed the risk to the squirrel an officially endangered 
species duffus said 
we do not believe that it is appropriate for a fish and 
wildlife service official to consider nonbiological information in 
reaching an opinion that could jeopardize a speciess existence 
the gao official said we believe that biological decisions 
should be based on biological information 
sam marler director of external affairs for the service said 
later there is nothing only in what the field biologist does 
and recommendations from those staff members frequently are 
modified by more senior biologists before the regional director 
makes his decision 
marler said he had heard allegations that the decision was 
improper but i havent seen or heard anything that would suggest 
it was improper 
allan beigel a vice president of the university in washington 
for the hearing said in a statement issued in tucson the 
university believed the government witnesses had saisfactorily 
responded to the concerns raised by the gao report 
university officials will try to allay concerns of members of 
the arizona delegation who believe the observatory should be 
reassessed he said 
a joint statement from the states two senators and reps morris 
udall a democrat and john kyl a republican said until the 
biological opinion is updated the project should not proceed 
their statement noted the gao opinion that the government 
would have difficulty persuading a court that it had complied 
with all the requirements of the endangered species act 
duffus said congress now faces a policy decision 
on the one hand it can allow construction of the observatory to 
continue as planned he said 
but he said it can also order the wildlife service to update its 
opinion in light of the squirrels precarious situation and 
concerns over the process used to arrive at the original opinion 
this may require additional legislation to hold construction 
in abeyance until a new biological opinion is rendered he said

record heat threatened crops forced a desert 
water district to issue restrictions and sent hundreds of thousands 
of southern californians fleeing to beaches tuesday as temperatures 
pushed past well into the 100s 
the 112degree high at the los angeles civic center was an 
alltime record for downtown beating the previous record high of 
110 degrees set on sept 4 1988 
other areas that reached three digits were woodland hills with 
112 pacoima with 114 ontario with 112 san bernardino with 111 
san gabriel with 111 and santa barbara with 103 
the deserts were even hotter palm springs and thermal recorded 
highs of 120 while needles had a high of 119 
the second day of high heat put firefighters on alert as brush 
already dry after four years of drought sat on hillsides shimmering 
in heat that dropped humidity below 10 percent 
at least one brush fire was reported in the sunland area 
northeast of downtown 
the national weather service issued a heat advisory for inland 
orchards and vineyards in san diego county and growers said berry 
crops would be damaged immediately and some fruits could be lost if 
the heat continues 
this is going to finish up the strawberries said ben 
hillbrecht a grower with about 200 acres near escondido and the 
boysenberries will cook right on the vine we wont have any this 
year he said the heat also will stop raspberry bushes from 
producing for about one month 
avocados have just appeared as tiny green buds and hillbrecht 
said if they dont get enough moisture they may fall off 
there are certainly some crops that are threatened though at 
this moment we have seen no damage said grower jim bathgate of 
valley center 
he said fruits such as apricots and peaches still on the tree 
could be affected if the heat wave continues a few days as the 
weather service has predicted 
it wont help the water shortage because everyone turns on 
their water to keep things as wet as they can said hillbrecht 
in the mojave desert the small hidesert water district in 
yucca valley announced use restrictions to begin wednesday after 
the rural water company noticed an average sixtoseven foot drop 
in its wells one well dropped 20 feet over the past six weeks

and washing cars at homes will be banned along with water use for 
construction such as mixing concrete puffer said the district 
serves about 5200 customers 
not everybody was having a hard time with the heat wave 
at raging waters a 15milliongallon water playground in san 
dimas calif business was also brisk said spokeswoman lynne 
matallana

visit us she said 
hundreds of thousands of people headed to beaches where 
temperatures were more than 20 degrees cooler than inland 
lifeguards reported nearly 100000 at santa monica 150000 at

nelson mandela urged congress tuesday to 
supplement economic sanctions against south africa with material 
resources to hasten the end of whiteminority rule our people 
demand democracy the celebrated black leader said 
mandela made an impassioned plea for justice in his historic 
address to a joint session of congress comparing the struggle of 
south african blacks with that of americas founding fathers 
the onetime prisoner was accorded the kind of reception from 
congress normally reserved for us presidents his entrance was 
greeted with a 2minute ovation and there was even longer applause 
from the packed house chamber when he finished 
our people demand democracy our country which continues to 
bleed and suffocate needs democracy he said 
at an evening rally attended by more than 19000 people in the 
citys convention center mandela again called for the united 
states to maintain its economic sanctions against his country but 
he also called for financial assistance to the nation once the 
apartheid system is abolished 
new investment will play a key role in this respect he told 
an often cheering crowd of thousands 
we need to mobilize the country for peace mandela said 
we need to train personnel for economic recovery for all 
this we shall continue to rely on your firm support 
mandela said he had been encouraged by his trip to the united 
states 
the masses of the american people are with us both congress 
the house and the senate are with us surely apartheid must go 
he said 
mandelas tardiness of more than an hour prevented him from 
speaking at a private 1000perperson reception before the rally 
and he apologized for that in his speech he said the unspecified 
amount raised would be devoted to the struggling masses of south 
africa 
mandela was introduced by the rev jesse jackson who apologized 
for us complicity in his arrest by the south african government 
27 years ago 
our cia was a factor in your arrest jackson said we are 
ashamed of that 
mandela spent most of the day in private talks with lawmakers 
in his speech congress mandela appealed to the senators and 
house members to let the people of south africa not the us 
government be the ones to judge when the sanctions imposed by 
congress four years ago should be lifted 
standing before the assembled lawmakers cabinet members and 
foreign ambassadors mandela skirted the controversial issues that 
have arisen since he began his us tour last wednesday he made no 
reference to his support for antiamerican radicals such as 
libyas moammar gadhafi and did not reiterate directly his view 
that violence is a useful tool in the antiapartheid struggle 
he was at pains however to praise american founding fathers 
such as george washington who resorted to armed confrontation in 
the american war of independence he compared the struggle of south 
african blacks to that twocenturyold struggle 
and he pointedly referred to pretorias armed tyranny of the 
black majority 
we would be fools to believe that the road ahead of us is 
without major hurdles too many among our white compatriots are 
slaves in the ideology of racism to admit easily that change must 
come he said for those who care to worry about violence in 
our country as we do it is at these forces that they should focus 
their attention 
in an apparent response to concerns about marxist influence 
within his african national congress mandela praised private 
industry as an engine of growth and development and said the 
anc holds no ideological positions which dictate that it must adopt 
a policy of nationalization but he left open the possibility of 
a dominant state role in the economy when he said priority 
attention must be given to meeting the material needs of the people 
after thanking the congress for imposing the sanctions that have 
crippled south africas economy mandela said we request that 
you go further and assist us with material resources which will 
enable us to promote the peace process and meet other needs which 
arise from the changing situation you helped bring about 
he was not specific about the type of assistance the anc is 
seeking congress has approved 10 million in aid for south africa 
which is to be used for promotion of democracy in that country 
officials have said the anc would be entitled to a portion of these 
funds if it renounces violence they would be channeled through the 
national endowment for democracy which seeks to promote the 
consolidation of democracy worldwide 
the lifting of the sanctions is expected to be an issue of 
heated debate and mandela appealed to the lawmakers to leave the 
decision to south africans 
we plead that you cede the prerogative to the people of south 
africa to determine the moment when it will be said that profound 
changes have occurred and an irreversible process achieved 
enabling you and the rest of the international community to lift 
sanctions he said 
administration officials have said they would consistent with 
legislative requirements consult with congress on lifting the 
sanctions once the state of emergency is suspended in natal 
province and all political prisoners are released mandela 
estimates the total at 1000 
in addressing the congress mandela was virtually guaranteed a 
friendly audience it was the congress four years ago which 
overrode president reagans veto and imposed a ban on new 
investments in south africa as well as trade and travel 
restrictions as part of a broader sanctions program 
the only other private citizens who have addressed a joint 
meeting were solidarity leader lech walesa of poland last year and 
the marquis de lafayette in 1824 
while acknowledging that the struggle is not yet over mandela 
seemed confident of eventual victory discussing his vision of a 
postapartheid south arica 
at times the 71yearold leader used soaring rhetoric to make 
his points he said that south african society which has known 
nothing but racism for three centuries should be transformed into 
an oasis of good race relations where the black shall to the white 
be sister and brother a fellow south african an equal human 
being both citizens of the world 
to destory racism in the world we together must expunge 
apartheid racism in south arica justice and liberty must be our 
tool prosperity and happiness our weapon

environmentalists and lawmakers applauded president bushs 
decision tuesday to ban much offshore oil drilling for at least a 
decade but some complained the move was politically motivated and 
didnt go far enough 
bush blocked new drilling off much of the west coast florida 
and new england until at least the year 2000 he ordered further 
environmental studies to determine if drilling leases might be 
offered after that 
well take a half a loaf because its better than none said 
rep dante fascell dfla a 10year moratorium is better than 
fighting for a moratorium every year 
i view this as a major victory for environmentalists and 
coastal advocates we have won time up to 10 years said 
california assemblyman tom hayden a democrat so im thankful 
for the actions in washington whatever the motives are 
some environmentalists said bush acted to help republican 
candidates in california and florida concerned about possible 
negative voter reaction to new drilling in a year that has seen 
many news stories on oil spills 
the presidents decision to delay leasing and development for 
10 years off most of californias coast is an important concession 
to the political reality but it merely postpones the controversy 
instead of solving it said ann notthoff of the natural resources 
defense council of san francisco 
notthoff also warned that a provision in bushs order that would 
lift the moratorium if oil supply is disrupted is a loophole big 
enough to drive a truck through 
bush suspended until at least the year 2000 any new leases to 
oil companies for drilling off the coast of nearly all of 
california he permanently banned drilling in a marine sanctuary in 
monterey bay 
the moratorium also applies to the waters off washington and 
oregon 14 million acres off south florida and 128 million acres 
of georges bank off cape cod 
bush directed interior secretary manuel lujan to begin talks 
with florida officials on a federalstate buyback of 73 leases that 
oil companies already had bought for drilling off florida that 
rankled some florida officials who estimated the buyback could 
cost 100 million to 200 million 
the people of florida should not be asked to bear what is 
rightly a federal responsibility said gov bob martinez who 
otherwise called bushs moratorium a major victory 
ann whitfield spokeswoman for the florida public interest 
research group also complained that bush did not ban drilling in 
the gulf of mexico 
we look at it as winning a battle but not winning the war 
she said 
in oregon republican congressman denny smith called bushs 
action a sound decision 
i believe that drilling for oil would put oregons coastal 
wildlife habitat rich fishing runs and growing tourism industry at 
risk in exchange for a few days worth of energy said smith 
sen brock adams dwash said while i would have preferred 
an outright ban on any leasing off our coast a 10year breathing 
space will be welcome 
new england lawmakers have been fighting drilling on the 
prolific georges bank fishing ground since it first was proposed 
early in the reagan administration 
sen john kerry dmass said the bush decision represented a 
shift and a welcome one in reaganbush policy 
anybody who knows or cares about georges bank should be 
delighted said rep gerry studds dmass hes not even going 
to be president by the year 2000 hes done all that he can for 
georges bank on his watch 
oil companies acknowledged public worry over oil drilling 
president bush has recognized that most americans are not 
prepared at this time to develop certain environmentally sensitive 
offshore areas los angelesbased arco said in a statemen 
arco supports the president under these circumstances 
chevron oil co said initial reports of bushs decision 
indicated the presidents actions seem to go too far 
but we certainly realize there is great concern by the 
american public over this issue the company said in a statement 
in san francisco 
were anxious to see the various parties to the offshore 
development controversy work together to find longterm solutions 
that will satisfy both the need for a sound us energy policy and 
for protection of the environment the company said

president bush would be authorized to cut 
debts to the us government by latin american countries under a 
provision approved tuesday by the house banking committee 
there was no record vote two republicans stan parris of 
virginia and marge roukema of new jersey said they disapproved 
but another republican rep jim leach of iowa joined democrats 
joseph kennedy of massachusetts and esteban edward torres of 
california in sponsoring the proposal 
a subcommittee last wednesday voted to authorize the president 
to reduce the debts of african and east european countries the 
united states and other creditor governments have already reduced 
some african debt 
tuesdays vote added latin american countries to the proposal if 
their debt and the interest they pay on it are large enough to meet 
a series of requirements that show the debt to be particularly 
heavy 
it asked the bush administration to urge other governments also 
to negotiate reductions of debts owed to them there has been 
particular pressure to reduce the debt of poland much of which is 
owed to west germany and france the bush administration has so far 
opposed reductions in europe 
leach made it plain that he does not intend the bill to apply to 
debts owed to the world bank and the international monetary fund 
which are jointly owned by 152 governments

had been set on four occasions the last time on july 4 1989 
tuesday mornings low of 91 degrees also set a record for the 
date and was close to the 93degree reading of july 20 1989 which 
was the highest low temperature ever recorded here 
weather service meteorologist craig ellis said the high 
temperatures were caused by a strong highpressure area in the 
upper atmosphere and the sun beating almost directly down on the 
earth 
he predicted the temperature would peak tuesday or wednesday 
before cooling off to around 113 degrees 
in tucson which is about 1200 feet higher the temperature hit 
an alltime record of 115 degrees by 1 pm tuesday arizonas 
secondlargest city had a high of 113 monday and had never gone 
higher than 114 degrees 
the state didnt swelter alone 
an alltime high of 112 was set in downtown los angeles where 
the previous record high of 110 degrees was set sept 4 1988 
borrego springs calif in the anzaborrego desert had mondays 
nationwide high of 122 degrees and the weather service reported 
temperatures above 110 degrees in low deserts from the coastal 
mountains eastward to new mexico 
at death valley national monument in eastern california park 
ranger karen rosga said she advised people to drink a lot of liquid 
and slow down the temperature hit 120 degrees monday and was 
expected to top out at 121 tuesday the weather sevice issued a 
heat advisory for much of northcentral texas lubbock in west 
texas hit an alltime high of 110 degrees sunday according to 
weather service forecaster loren phillips 
some businesses rejoiced in the extreme heat 
these will be recordbeaking days for our stores believe 
me said marilyn novak marketing director for baskinrobbins ice 
cream stores based in glendale calif 
business also was brisk at raging waters a 1 milliongallon 
water playground in san dimas calif we love the hot weather it 
encourages people to come out and visit us raging waters 
spokeswoman lynne matallana said 
several people passed out from heat exhaustion monday at the 
south rim of the grand canyon spokeswoman maureen oltrogge said 
although temperatures on the rim reached only 92 it was 110 
degrees deeper in the canyon she said 
the salt river project one of the two major utilities for the 
phoenix area appealed to the public to conserve energy by setting 
thermostats 2 to 3 degrees higher and to not run appliances during 
peak hours of the day 
the arizona automobile associations main office in phoenix took 
at least 1500 calls about 500 or 600 more than usual said frank 
kuczora shift supervisor of the road service department many were 
from motorists whose vehicles overheated or had dead batteries he 
said 
ellis the weather service forecaster said he believed the heat 
lent credence to theories of global warming 
however robert gall a professor in the university of arizonas 
atmospheric sciences department attributed the extreme 
temperatures to the atmospheres natural variability 
i dont think it represents a longterm trend he said if 
the extreme heat is related to greenhouse warming there is no 
way of proving it he said 
this kind of anomaly warm temperatures could be naturally 
occurring gall said there is variation all the time i 
would say that if the dice were rolled it just came up hot

the farm where lawrence welk learned to 
play the accordion became center stage tuesday for a project to 
create a museum honoring the king of champagne music 
gov george sinner and other state officials were expected to 
attend the groundbreaking ceremony at the farm where welk lived 
until he was 21 the bandleader himself now 87 and living in los 
angeles did not attend but sent a letter of thanks 
little did i dream when i was growing up on the farm so many 
many years ago that someday it would be restored and people would 
come and marvel at how life was lived in the early 1920s welk 
wrote 
looking back i would say that life on the farm was very hard 
and i didnt always like it especially when i had to help butcher 
the hogs but they were really happy days too because there was 
always love

so many books in the world so what shall we read 
three british bookmen and 15 collaborators have produced a list 
of 2500 books they consider are the best in the english language 
thats a lot of titles but if you start young enough we 
think you could get through it you could read a book a week if you 
wanted to said brian last one of the three editors of an 
english library from gower publishing co 
their book contains 15 categories of books from fiction to 
reference and cites 11 books of the bible in the old testament and 
seven in the new testament 
charles dickens novels and william shakespeares plays mingle 
with the poems of the present poet laureate of england ted hughes 
and modern american novels such as ken keseys one flew over the 
cuckoos nest 
the new book is based on an english library by the late 
frank seymour smith a librarian whose choice ran to more than 
5000 books in 1963 none of them by a living author 
our changes take account of more modern tastes said last in 
an interview we wanted to remodel smith put in contemporary 
writers and add new sections like world literature in english which 
takes account of important authors in australia canada india and 
africa 
last 39 is managing editor of scholar press a gower 
subsidiary he and coeditors nigel farrow 50 chairman of gower 
and vernon pratt a researcher at lancaster university who is in 
his 40s say they compiled their list with the single aim of 
extending peoples enjoyment of reading 
we all write teach or publish books for a living but read 
them for enjoyment farrow said 
at the end of the day there is always the worry that we might 
have left out something important but we have done as much 
painstaking research as we could last said we tried to 
include everything that is first rate of its kind 
smith put asterisks against his personal choices in what he 
called the exhilarating wealth of genius in english books 
the editors of the new edition have not done the same but at the 
request of the associated press last and farrow pratt was 
unavailable selected their top books in each category here they 
are with the original publication dates

there was some argument over the american novel and gatsby 
was challenged by huckleberry finn mark twain said last 
there was a problem with the poetry as we felt that geoffrey 
chaucer philip larkin thomas hardy and andrew marvell had a 
right to the top spot but we agreed that yeats had the edge 
it was enormously difficult to choose a play of shakespeare as 
all his plays should really be there and on another day we might 
have picked othello 
the editors final advice if you dont like something dont 
plow through it reading isnt competition its enjoyment the 
classic you dont like is in our book because it is a classic 
an english library costs 2550 it is available in the

in spite of the imperfections americans 
generally tolerate their systems of governance and banking calming 
their occasional outrage by considering the alternatives 
those alternatives generally are worse than what already exists 
defects and all but sometimes it is hard to accept that verdict 
the systems are forever being tested and so therefore is the 
patience of americans 
the latest outrage is expressed by representatives of 37 states 
and the district of columbia who will see a net transfer of wealth 
from their economies to those with the biggest savings and loan 
collapses 
in the abstract the outrage is muted this is one great 
country it is reasoned and if the worst of the collapses were 
concentrated in just 13 states it is still a national issue to be 
dealt with by all the people 
it is when the numbers the specific dollar amounts are 
detailed and then broadast as they are now that the muted outrage 
is expressed in a great roar this happens for instance when 
residents in certain states stand to lose 1000 each 
it is then that acceptance breaks down and questions and threats 
begin why asks connecticut should our people lose 1000 each to 
send money to texans who will benefit by several times that amount 
why should areas of the country whose savings and loan 
associations played by the rules and kept their institutions 
solvent have to ship money to those areas in which sampls squandered 
their funds on foolish investment schemes 
alas that is the way the system works a system that appears to 
be filled with injustices but which experience suggests is still 
second to none yes outrages abound 
in the 1970s you may recall the nation humiliated its savers 
the saltoftheearth types who played by the rules who lived 
within their limits and tried to put a few dollars in the bank for 
a rainy day 
for whatever reasons it might have been fiscal and monetary 
stupidity the money saved in the bank was thrown away 
perhaps stolen would better describe what happened to it 
because inflation raged and because banks paid out in interest 
far less than was taken away by inflation the buying power of 
savers deteriorated every day 
meanwhile those who borrowed and bought goods with the money of 
savers enjoyed tremendous appreciation in value they enjoyed the 
good life with the money took tax deductions and repaid the savers 
with cheaper dollars 
the examples are myriad and they exist right now 
the young couple who postponed buying a house for the past 
decade just waiting for prices to stabilize 
now that they have the money to buy some lenders who had been 
throwing money around are stiffening their terms because they made 
so many bad loans in the past 
the smallbusiness person who took the slow but sure and steady 
course who proved his financial reliability by foregoing the 
wildly expansive course taken by his competitor 
now his credit line is shrinking because the bank made so many 
bad loans such as to his competitor that it has decided to assume 
a more conservative lending policy 
the young worker who is paying increasingly higher 
contributions to the social security system not simply to finance 
his own retirement but to make possible the retirements of the 
generation before 
anyone can cite specific personal examples especially when 
insurance or taxes are involved they can rage against the 
injustice threaten legal action demand reform but then somehow 
they learn to live with it 
it may not be fair but it is the system a very imperfect one 
always in need of fixing

when henry mancini was a kid in the steel town 
of aliquippa pa the fourth of july wasnt that big a deal he 
recalls no big parades no rockets red glare no sousa marches 
however he notesi grew up in an almost 100 percent italian 
neighborhood where patriotism was alive and well but the big 
events were the august festas parties celebrating the feast of 
st anthony and the like 
next wednesday though hell be part of a big july 4 deal on 
pbs a 90minute musical celebration a capitol fourth 1990 
hosted by beverly sills and broadcast live from washington itll 
start at 8 pm edt 
mancini will be the guest conductor of the national symphony 
orchestra on the show the third time in 10 years hes done that 
its a little different from his usual work which is writing 
scores for films hes done more than 80 or collecting oscars 
for his music nominated 18 times he owns four oscars which go 
nicely with his 20 grammy awards 
a flutist and pianist mancini now 66 began writing music 
arrangements when he was 14 he was inspired three years earlier 
when his father took him to pittsburgh to see the crusades a 
cecil b demille extravaganza 
that was the first score that i ever heard with a large 
orchestra he says and thats what kind of stuck in my head in 
all those early years i always had that writing for film 
in the back of my mind 
his first hollywood effort in the early 50s was for a scene 
in an abbott and costello epic lost in alaska he had studied 
composition theory and harmony and all that and arranged for big 
bands 
but nobody taught him to write for films that small omission 
from his education didnt bother him he says you had no choice 
but then i didnt want any choice i just wanted to work 
such onthejob training can be dicey film music has to convey 
the moment and be precisely timed right down to the nanosecond 
this may lead some to think of a hollywood composer as an ulcer 
with a stopwatch 
but it would do no good for the rousing chase music of one scene 
to keep going into the next scenes seduction attempt at least in 
most cases 
mancini insists that such problems are small 
sure he says you make mistakes in your timing and all of a 
sudden youve got 10 bars too many because you skipped some time 
or you dont have enough but you go in and fix it 
such errors usually are caught before the musicians go to work 
in the soundstage he adds he didnt say what happens if the error 
isnt caught but when was the last time you saw a seduction scene 
with chase music 
mancinis musical dossier includes such evergreens as moon 
river days of wine and roses and two for the road 
but his jazzy score for tvs peter gunn series of 195861 is 
the one that first gained him national attention with its use of 
jazz improvisation and such rarely heard instruments as bass and 
alto flutes 
hollywood being hollywood gunn music touched off several tv 
imitators including shotgun slade the only western ever to 
have a jazz score 
mancinis film scores which include breakfast at tiffanys 
10 and bill cosbys new ghost dad generally seem to use 
the whole range of instruments and have a rich natural 
nonsynthesized sound 
it may therefore sadden foes of computer music to learn that 
mancini the graduate of big bands uses synthesizers 
ive been using them almost since the first time they came 
out in one way or another he says they get interesting 
sounds and they get better and better i use them in conjunction 
with an acoustic orchestra 
heresy no says the composer i just think they give you a 
much bigger palette to work from

while statistics have a chiseled exactness 
suggesting hard truth savvy members of this information age know 
it isnt always so whether the subject is real estate insurance 
or economics 
they recognize for example that numbers may be even more 
misleading than words and subject to manipulation twists and 
torture in a manner beyond what such mere linguists as shakespeare 
could do with words 
sometimes the intent can be to deceive sometimes not often the 
numbers are clear to the eye and equally so to the mind but the 
mind chooses to be deceived sometimes just a bit of probing 
reveals the truth 
as in this example 
since the mid1980s sections of the country have had depressed 
housing markets marked by repeated lowering of asking prices and 
prolonged periods between listings and sales 
at the same time the popular statistics on housing sales may 
continue to indicate price increases your own observations tell 
you that many prices are lower the statistics continue to show 
price increases 
is it you or is it the statistics 
there are a couple of elements in the explanation the first 
being that asking prices are indeed being cut but sometimes the 
cuts only bring the selling price back to where it was a couple of 
years before 
those high asking prices are understandable at least in terms 
of human behavior only reluctantly do sellers adjust to newer 
market forces they live a bit in the past and they ask for the 
extreme prices of the past 
even when they do adjust to the new reality some selling prices 
remain higher than they were several years before or even one year 
before in spite of the cuts but thats only one part of the 
explanation 
glenn crellin of the national association of realtors explains 
a slow market means there are fewer ready willing and able 
buyers in the market but those who do remain active want both a 
good home and a good deal quite often the better deal is in the 
larger home 
larger homes cost more of course but the buyer who is active 
in a slow market is often highly motivated a real buyer rather 
than a looker 
its human nature says crellin if they can afford the 
larger home most families will opt to spend a few extra dollars 
now to get closer to their dream house rather than save a little 
and be dissatisfied 
to illustrate the medianpriced twobedroom home in boston was 
200 less in the first quarter of 1990 than it was in 1989 the 
medianpriced threebedroom home was 2200 less the medianpriced 
larger home was 200 less 
however the median of all homes sold in the boston metropolitan 
area was 1000 more the reason the composition of home sales 
changed the market share held by fourbedroom homes soared to 39 
percent from 346 percent 
as a result the medianpriced home in metropolitan boston rose 
while actual prices in all categories fell 
ultimately says crellin this means that users of statistics 
must periodically review what the statistics measure 
how true whether youre reading about economic numbers in the 
newspaper listening to a life insurance salesman extol the merits 
of a policy or trying to get a measure of the housing market

get ready for a plateful of soul more hot 
sounds from hotlanta 
atlanta in the 1990s is emerging as the new center for rhythm 
and blues just as detroit did in the 60s with motown 
recording artists are flocking to the souths capital from new 
york and los angeles drawn by a cheaper real estate market and 
more privacy 
atlanta was one of the countrys bestkept secrets said tom 
wright owner of cheshire sound studios where singers such as 
peabo bryson and bobby brown come to record not anymore 
bryson was new in the music business and atlanta seemed like a 
good place to start so when the relatively unknown bang records 
offered him a contract he snapped it up nineteen years later 
hes still here after raising a family and building a prosperous 
career 
atlanta was not a throbbing metropolis full of opportunity in 
the recording industry but it was also not a new york city all 
crowded bryson said in an interview 
i wanted to develop my writing style here learn to make 
recordings now the producers are here the equipment is here im 
glad i stayed 
bryson was joined last year by brown the former new edition 
member whose multiplatinum album dont be cruel sold 5 
million copies 
brown bought a downtown building which he is calling bosstown 
to convert to a recording and preproduction studio 
arista producers antonio la reid and kenny babyface 
edmonds responsible for no 1 hits by brown reids wife pebbles 
and paula abdul opened their own label laface records they have 
an office in suburban norcross and plan a nearby studio to handle 
at least eight projects a year including whitney houstons new 
album 
its a place we felt we could raise a family and live normal 
lives edmonds said 
producer dean sir gant of platinum plus productions who has 
worked with anita baker george howard and madonna also has opened 
shop in atlanta others whove been lured here include the vocal 
group after 7 and matt atlanta bliss trumpeter for prince 
unless youre somebody everybody really knows like bobby 
brown youre safe here bliss said people here arent used to 
looking for stars on the street in la yeah thats all it is 
bryson is a visible celebrity in atlanta hes frequently 
spotted walking around town and says he enjoys the citys most 
popular and crowded nightclubs petrus and ruperts hes also an 
avid patron of the regions first comedy club catering to black 
acts the comedy act theatre 
although anonymity is not readily afforded here people are 
very calm he said theyll walk up to you but they dont 
necessarily have to bother you you wont get your clothes torn off 
here it has a lot to do with southern hospitality our attitude is 
basically different 
georgia isnt new to the music scene the industry has been 
building since james brown formed his band in toccoa about 30 years 
ago progressive rockers rem the georgia satellites and the indigo 
girls all started here 
but the newcomers are primarily rampb artists and their producers 
with the producers comes atlantas chance at becoming a major 
recording market just as detroit once was and other cities as 
well memphis in the 60s with stax records muscle shoals in the 
60s with aretha franklin chicago in the 60s with curtis mayfield 
and jerry butler philadelphia in the 70s with the ojays and 
spinners and minneapolis in the 80s with prince and jimmy jam 
productions 
bryson said the producers presence means its no longer 
necessary for artists to fly to new york and los angeles for 
recording sessions production costs are relatively equal in every 
city he added and the latest technology has come to atlantas 
studios 
theres a producers network now unheralded and unspoken 
but its here bryson said and cheshire studio is the place to 
be we hang out exchange ideas 
atlanta is a very sophisticated place people can afford to 
live here on an opulent level new york and la these are 
glorious places where opulence is the order of the day but theyre 
not afforded by a whole lot of people 
real estate costs that are significantly lower than new york or 
los angeles have prompted many artists to move here 
you can get 1200 square feet if youre lucky for a quarter 
of a million dollars there bryson said and here if youre 
willing to drive just 20 minutes you can get five bedrooms with a 
circular drive on an acre of land thats pretty decent 
rent also is often prohibitive for musicians living in new york 
former cameo singer charlie singleton now a solo artist said 
about 700 here will get you a nice place thats worth 1200 or 
so there 
gant working on his third album with bryson moved to 
alpharetta to raise his three children save money and to gain some 
privacy 
youd be out for lunch and the waiter finds out youre a 
producer and pops out the demo tape you dont find that here he 
said 
with all the recording here and theres a lot of it going on 
this will be one of the biggest recording places in the world 
said bobby byrd who played with james brown for 25 years after 
helping the singer start his band in his grandmothers basement in 
toccoa i think two years and well be big on the map 
byrd just opened his own studio and production facilities 
called phase one and byrds nest productions to work with jackson 
records 
bliss who moved to marietta from minneapolis said atlanta will 
define the 90s as a decade of musical variety from a mellow 
bryson to the more pop sounds of singleton 
the influx of artists has meant big business to the citys 
recording studios cheshire studios were booked solid last year 
with 1989 the best of wrights 20 years recording 
talent scouts are taking note too the owners of two 
nightclubs the point and the cotton club signed a threeyear 
contract with warnerchappell the worlds largest music 
publishers to scout the area 
bobby browns live at sensations talent showcase regularly 
attracted scouts from atlantic warner bros cbs and arista until 
the club lost its lease this month said sensations manager ed 
rucker 
while brown seldom attended the showcase other stars often 
joined the amateurs for impromptu concerts 
jermaine jackson and peabo bryson were performing one week and 
stevie wonder walked in rucker said he upstaged everybody 
just walked on to the stage 
industry insider bob patton former booking manager for james 
brown said while atlanta probably wont become the musical new 
york of the south it can easily surpass detroits claim as the 
countrys soul capital 
experts said its too early to guess just what share of the 65 
billion recording industry atlanta has snared but bryson said 
within three years 25 percent of the recording will come from 
atlanta 
you can make a great recording anywhere agreed 
23yearresident rodney mills former producer for 38 special now 
working with singleton but theres something of an advantage 
when enough people in the same business are in the same city

did a terrorist plant a bomb or did a missile go 
astray in an aerial dogfight was there a bungled investigation or 
an international coverup of what caused the mysterious jetliner 
crash that killed 81 people 
ten years after a dc9 on a domestic flight blew apart in 
twilight skies and fell into the sea near the tiny island of 
ustica the questions remain unanswered 
many theories have been advanced but little information has 
been revealed a complicating factor is judicial secrecy which 
forbids disclosure until the investigation leads to indictments or 
closure of the case 
in may an official panel of five experts who said in march 1989 
that a missile had struck the plane reexamined the evidence and 
split between missile and bomb 
premier giulio andreotti declared recently the more i read 
about it the less i understand its very disturbing this 
interweaving of suspicions and rumors 
a week earlier a state television report claimed authorities 
ignored or forgot radar data from a station in tuscany the report 
interpreted the data as indicating the dc9 bound for sicily was 
caught in an engagement between french and libyan jet fighters but 
gave no proof 
it joined a multitude of sensational unsubtantiated theories 
that have arisen over the years 
some contended a libyan aircraft with col moammar gadhafi 
aboard was above sicily shortly before the crash 
one spoke of gadhafis favorite air force pilot chasing a 
defector across the skies in another us jets fired a missile 
that hit the airliner by mistake 
french us and nato officials have denied any military 
activity in the skies that night gadhafi has blamed the united 
states but offered no evidence 
discovery of a crashed libyan mig fighter in the calabrian 
mountains almost due east of where the dc9 went down bolstered 
claims of a libyan connection 
doctors who performed an autopsy on the pilot first gave the 
date of death as july 18 then as late june then switched back to 
the later date 
investigators suspect air force officials of manipulating 
hiding or destroying evidence and of lying about what happened that 
friday when 57 minutes into the flight and without a hint of 
trouble the plane disappeared from radar screens while flying from 
bologna to palermo 
the dc9 of itavia a small private carrier carried 77 
passengers including 11 children and two infants and a crew of 
four school vacations had begun and many passengers were 
businessmen joining their families for the weekend 
italy was plagued by terrorism in 1980 and and a bomb first 
seemed the likely cause a few months after the crash however 
transport minister rino formica told parliament a missile was 
suspected 
in 1987 the government yielded to the outcries of relatives and 
engaged salvagers who raised part of the wreckage 
evidence studied by several official investigations indicated 
the kind of explosive found in corpses and wreckage was used to 
make missiles examination of the fuselage indicated the aircraft 
was struck from the outside according to news reports 
still investigating commissions have differed in may 1989 two 
months after the commission report that a missile was to blame 
another commission appointed by ciriaco de mita then premier 
decided a bomb could not be ruled out 
this spring when two members of the first commmission reversed 
themselves and concluded a bomb was responsible an association of 
victims relatives joined by some politicians protested that the 
two had ties to a stateowned company involved in making missiles 
for the air force 
after the protest and the television report about the radar 
tapes investigating magistrate vincenzo bucarelli announced that 
an october deadline to close the case would be lifted 
every time we got close to the truth someone pushed us back 
but i think we have finally succeeded in getting politicians on 
our side said daria bonfietti who heads the association of 
victims relatives her brother alberto was killed in the crash 
the ustica mystery has been compared to other unsolved cases in 
italy including assassinations of mafia investigators and 
terrorist bombings including one in a milan bank 21 years ago 
corriere della sera a leading daily said in an editorial 
a country without truth evidently around so many italian 
mysteries theres an invincible force capable of confusing the 
ideas of experts playing with the efforts of the magistrates 
office mocking the appeals of the head of state its this force 
in reality that struck the itavia jet massacring 81 people and 
the sense of justice

among the boardedup flophouses art schools and 
artists lofts in denvers suddenly hip but still seedy lower 
downtown is a little tavern with a big metal cactus sign out front 
that is known throughout the jazz world as a real jumpin joint 
well it should be since the literal translation of el 
chapultepec from the aztec means the hill of grasshoppers 
its really like a step back in time said sax player rich 
chiaraluci who has played for mel torme tony bennett and nancy 
wilson its kind of a dive but it reminds me of walking into a 
jazz club in about 1945 
theres never a cover the music is for the people when you 
have a cover the music is just for those who can afford it said 
jerry krantz the touslehaired ownerbartender 
among the jazz greats who have dropped by to stretch out and 
blow their brains out since krantz began bringing jazz to el 
chapultepec have been all three marsalis brothers wynton 
branford and darfileo woody herman the count basie orchestra 
artie shaw eddie lockjaw davis sax player buddy collette and 
tenor sax player charlie rouse 
buddy defranco clarinet player came to the university of 
denver to do a clinic he came down and played here he was the 
first of the greats krantz recalled pretty soon everybody in 
the country was calling 
guitarist ozzie carlson likes the place because people go in 
to hear some good american jazz people from the symphony and what 
you might say is higherechelon society come in and not just to go 
slumming theyre serious to hear jazz 
i guess just about every wellknown jazz musician in the 
country would know the name el chapultepec as a jazz place 
the 20by40 foot main barroom with the bandstand jammed down at 
the west end by the restrooms sometimes becomes so crowded that 
krantz says each patron gets just one of the footsquare black and 
white checkerboard floor tiles to stand on or less 
the place is no bigger than an rtd bus and it does fill up 
just as much as one of em at rush hour the former packing house 
worker and cab driver said 
at 5foot6 and 180 pounds the 55yearold krantz is built like 
a brick at least they say thats what it feels like when i hit 
them but i have very very little trouble down here that is the 
beautiful part of it 
jerry is very nice to the guys says carlson when it 
comes time to pay there is never any hesitation he pays right 
smack on the spot there are a lot of joints that arent 
particularly like that 
when a good musician is scuffling for work he could go in 
there and jerry would hire him and put him in on the weekends with 
the house band to help out the guy he doesnt have to do that the 
guy seems to care chiaraluci said 
drummer bruno carr says the clientele sets the pec apart 
because they come from all walks of life and everybody rubs 
elbows the rich and the poor and the in between 
carr who has played for sarah vaughn john coltrane and ray 
charles said for a long time the pec was the only joint in town 
that really had any jazz 52 weeks a year 
it all began back in 1978 10 years after krantz bought the pec 
from his fatherinlaw that he changed the clubs music format 
from mexican mariachi to jazz 
i went to an afterhours club and got the jazz group to come 
down he said the people loved them i went strictly into jazz 
in 1978 friday saturday and sunday the people wanted more i 
tried a blue monday where a jazz band came in and played blues 
beebop jazz they just kept packing the place in 1980 i went 
jazz seven nights a week its been that way ever since 
the clientele changed the hispanic crowd that had supported the 
pec since it opened at the close of prohibition in 1933 began to 
give way 
the kids think they found a new music i have doctors 
lawyers merchants thieves they all get involved with the 
music all colors all walks of life nobody cares whos alongside 
them everybody is welcome and everybody is treated equal 
last night i had the minister of arts from poland he was 
here in town doing a study of american ballet they came to listen 
to the music he said during the war in poland jazz represented 
freedom to the polish people because jazz represented the united 
states he startedan underground jazz thing 
but the noisy crowds irk longtime jazz fans of the pec 
id been going in there for years before it got hip to go 
there said linda grunow who writes for downbeat and cadence 
magazines and is jazz critic for denvers westword alternative 
newspaper 
its a wonderful place a smoky old jazz bar but its 
not what it used to be she said the public at large has 
discovered it they think its hip youd better stake out your bar 
stool a good two hours before the music starts 
there have been other attempts to establish jazz clubs in 
denver they failed after a few months of thin crowds new ones on 
the scene now include la cupol the jazz works and the burnsley 
hotel 
the pec is a survivor 
during its 57year stand at the corner of market and 20th 
streets it has seen the citys old red light district torn 
down except for madame mattie silks old parlor house across 
the street neighboring chinatown was torn down for warehouse 
construction during world war ii now the warehouses are falling to 
the wrecking ball as developers hope lower downtown is denvers 
next development boom site 
through it all the pec continues and the jazz goes on 
it has been beyond any imagination how the music got the 
attention and satisfaction of the people krantz said still awed 
by his success my era was the jazzswing music and all i do is 
provide a place for them to play it 
somewhere amid the din of the crowded hot little joint lies the 
magic elixer of success 
when all the other clubs die el chapultepec will still be 
standing chiaraluci said if it wasnt for the owners love of 
jazz it just wouldnt be there

in tiny bancroft maine they gave an election 
and nobody came 
in texas a hot primary campaign for governor drew 15 percent of 
the voters 
in california about 40 percent went to the polls on primary 
day but that still was close to the record low established in 1986 
for the state 
midway through the election year experts are predicting 1990 
will bring a continuation of a 30year downward trend in voter 
participation 
analysts politicians and voters interviewed around the country 
said voter frustration and disillusionment and the increasing 
complexity and stress of life seem to be at least partly to blame 
i dont know anybody who was in a 10minute traffic jam going 
to work 10 years ago who is not in a 45minute traffic jam going to 
work now and it doesnt matter who gets elected said curtis 
gans director of the committee for the study of the american 
electorate the private group tracks voter participation 
in 1960 the year john f kennedy was elected president 628 
percent of registered voters cast ballots 
by 1988 when george bush was elected turnout had dropped to 
5016 percent 
in 1986 the most recent nonpresidential general election year 
only 37 percent made it to the polls 
edward j rollins director of the republican congressional 
campaign committee recently predicted turnout this year could go 
below 30 percent 
i think part of it just has to do with folks just generally 
giving up on all of us said al la pierre executive director of 
the democratic party in alabama in his state the turnout of 
750000 voters in the june 5 primary was down by about 200000 from 
1986 
they just dont see any need to go do it any more which is 
sad la pierre said 
toni grygo who runs a hair styling parlor in pittsburgh said 
the feedback that i get is that they are disillusioned this is 
the main thing i hear from the women and some of the men that i 
do 
in bancroft a rural community in northern maine with 61 
residents and 35 registered voters deputy town clerk mary irish 
said two or three people usually come out to vote in offyear 
elections in presidential years she said turnout gets up to 14 
in the june 12 maine primary nobody voted in bancroft voting 
statewide appeared low but final turnout figures had not been 
tabulated 
it was a beautiful day and there should have been greater 
interest said keron kerr the state democratic chairman 
alan heslop professor of government at claremont mckenna 
college in claremont calif said part of the problem is 
population growth after the 199l redistricting california is 
expected to have legislative districts of 750000 people three 
times what they were in 1950 
people feel powerless said heslop it is hard to convince 
oneself that one vote is going to make a difference in these 
enormous giant districts 
maybe the vote in boise county idaho helps make his point the 
sparsely populated county had a turnout of 4251 percent in idahos 
may 22 primary about the same as in 1986 and much higher than 
turnout statewide in this years primary 
i think people vote here because we are so small that we feel 
like it really matters said jan longpre city editor of the 
weekly idaho world newspaper in idaho city even if it doesnt 
we think it does 
heslop thinks people are turned off by the slick packaging that 
is wrapped around todays candidates 
i think a lot of people are tired of the soundbite approach 
to politics the graphics mailer the snappy computerized letter 
he said people are seeing that all of these things are in fact 
means of pulling the wool over the voters eyes 
that may to a degree be true agrees alabama democrat la 
pierre but how else can you reach the masses but through tv 
gans believes negative campaigning is a big part of the problem 
what they want to do with those ads is create doubts about the 
character of the opponent and weaken the impulse to vote among weak 
partisans and undecideds gans said when this is reciprocally 
done it has got to weaken the impulse on both sides 
nevertheless despite a campaign widely criticized as negative 
virginia voters turned out in record numbers last year to make 
douglas wilder the nations first elected black governor 
in certain situations you can transcend the negative campaigns 
because the issues are more important gans said 
something else has changed beside campaigns said heslop and 
that is the widespread perception among voters that incumbents have 
become unbeatable 
it is something new for them to know that there is no way of 
throwing the rascals out he said 
frank sullivan who runs a landscaping business in cincinnati 
said he votes anyway 
i feel like its our only revenge sullivan said i dont 
think they pay any attention to us but we are only making it worse 
for ourselves if we dont let them know we are out here

poland held municipal elections may 27 to create 
independent local governments free of communist party control here 
is an account of problems one town encountered as its new council 
began restoring democratic rule 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
marek lach knew the treasury was 
empty when he won a council seat but another truth awaited him 
the mayor had bought cars for himself and four other people with 
the towns money 
mayor zbigniew jarzebski a communist party holdover walked out 
june 12 when lach began reading a report about the cars at the 
second meeting of the new freely elected council in podkowa lesna 
16 miles west of warsaw 
lachs voice rose as he described how six months earlier 
jarzebski approved the purchase of cars for himself the director 
of a local museum and three physicians in the town 
jarzebski will be removed as soon as a new mayor can be found 
the council postponed a decision on what to do about the cars 
the 2323 councils chosen may 27 by polands first fully 
democratic elections in 50 years are supposed to restore autonomy 
to local government which has been an arm of the 
communistcontrolled central administration 
like the 9monthold national government led by solidarity the 
new councils find empty coffers and a mountain of problems left 
behind by the old regimes 
podkowa lesna is a relatively affluent suburb of warsaw 
population about 2500 but many of its streets are unpaved 
residents live in brick houses set amongst pine birch and oak 
trees there is a small food store a pharmacy and a news stand 
but little other commerce and no high school 
voters in podkowa lesna elected the solidarity citizens 
committee candidates and the new council of 15 members took office 
june 6 it chose committees on finance planning and social 
services and appointed several members to investigate the towns 
situation 
as its first fiscal act the council appropriated 800000 zlotys 
84 to send eight poor children to summer camp 
the council has yet to determine how much money it has how much 
it will need or how much warsaw will provide under the new rules 
most funds for local government must be raised by the communities 
themselves 
well need to find a gold mine or an oil well to pay all the 
towns bills said joanna walc editor of gazeta podkowianska 
the biweekly newspaper 
marek kobosko head of the councils economic committee hopes 
podkowa lesna will be able to form companies and make money by 
operating them but acknowledges taxes will have to be raised 
where the money will come from may be a problem but the council 
is fairly clear on how it should be spent 
adequate police protection is a major priority 
the three police officers who staff the towns tworoom station 
go home at the end of the day leaving podkowa lesna unprotected 
overnight 
breakins and other theft have increased 105 percent this year 
from 1989 police say one reason is loss of income under the 
freemarket economic reform plan put into effect by the national 
government jan 1 
jan jedzrejewski the local commander wants to increase the 
number of officers but the size of the force is determined by the 
interior ministry based on population residents say the town 
needs more police because it is spread out 
where to put the station is the most immediate problem it now 
is in a private home the communists expropriated in 1948 but the 
original owners are reclaiming the property as have the owners of 
another house in which the post office is located 
the council may move the police to the municipal building which 
is expected to have extra space when unneeded bureaucrats are 
dismissed 
podkowa as residents call the town also needs money to run its 
elementary school improve the sewers and expand the telephone 
system about 600 people without telephones want them and there 
are not enough repairmen to keep the existing lines in working 
order 
lach said the council will examine land sales and distribution 
under former town governments to make sure friends of officials did 
not benefit from special deals 
there also is the matter of a building and repair business that 
is run by the town administration and has more people working in 
its offices than in production 
the last 40 years changed the whole structure and values of 
the town and now we have to create them anew said councilman 
kazimierz glowacki

half a dozen town councilors stared at 
a threestory apartment block and debated whether a residents 
television satellite dish was unsightly 
fifteen poles in britain to learn how to run a democracy 
stared in disbelief 
we dont pay attention to such small things but maybe here 
they dont have such big things said maria komarnicka a 
professor of finance at the university of wroclaw 
satellite dishes have been an issue in poland because the 
communist government banned private ones in an attempt to keep 
western influence out 
now those restrictions are gone but in the tough new economic 
regime that has replaced communism most poles cant afford dishes 
britons can but need permission from local authorities charged 
with preserving the landscape 
these are the kind of issues the poles came to study ms 
komarnickas group is the first to undergo a twoweek course in 
local government in leicester a town in central england 
it is part of prime minister margaret thatchers aid program for 
europes new democracies built on a knowhow fund for poland 
and hungary of 75 million pounds 128 million 
other east european governments also may get funds for programs 
ranging from how to operate a small business to managing large 
commercial enterprises and running city government 
most of the poles are academics who will train 52000 officials 
elected may 27 in polands first free local elections in half a 
century 
we have no tradition of local government it died 50 years 
ago said chris mularczyk deputy director of the warsawbased 
foundation for local democracy which oversees the training 
programs 
in britain there is an ethos of local democracy and even if 
you are a new councilor you instinctively have an idea of what to 
do 
mularczyk said those elected in poland however all of a 
sudden realize im a councilor but what does that mean 
at leicester they learned that detail is a major part of local 
democracy 
one exercise simulated a dispute between a group of gardeners 
and a property developer with the local council mediating 
these people are much more hardnosed and more concerned with 
principles than the british students who usually take the class 
but this is small beer compared to a revolution said the 
exercise leader lynton robins 
the dispute was resolved by having the developer pay off the 
gardeners then the visitors joined the charnwood borough council 
in a large green bus for a tour 
they visited an attractive historic stone house the owner wants 
to extend 
charnwood councilors mulled it over standing in the treelined 
street course member grzegorz walendzik of the town council in 
starachowice put a hand to his head 
we havent enough schools or flats for people in 
starachowice he said there is no time to visit individual 
houses 
witold kalinowski a professor at the polish academy of science 
looked at the satellite dish earlier and said it is now proved 
for me that the words community and communism have the same 
etymological root in poland we may be in disarray and shambles 
but we dont have people deciding if we can have a satellite dish 
john greenwood director of the leicester polytechnic program 
replied local democracy boils down to smaller things as boring 
as many of these things are we have to go through the procedures 
because were taking about peoples rights

seventeen centuries after teaching the 
world how to make love india is relearning its own lesson 
the rise of a westernized middle class has brought a sexual 
revolution and formerly taboo subjects are coming into the open 
movies books singles magazines and hospitals treat sex with a 
clarity that rivals the worlds best howto sex manual indias own 
kama sutra from the 3rd century 
in june a doctor published indias first study of orgasm 
bombay friend the countrys first magazine for homosexuals began 
publishing in may 
late in 1989 a psychoanalyst brought out the first book on 
indian sexuality indias only singles magazine which publishes 
twice a year began a monthly supplement in june 
even the conservative rural population is not immune a survey 
in june indicated condom sales in the countryside rose 200 percent 
between 1985 and 1989 doctors say an increasing number of farmers 
seek treatment for sexual problems 
movies a repository of indias vivid fantasy life are 
exploring a womans sexual needs for the first time 
rape scenes previously a must for a successful movie are less 
frequent and indian leading men are starting to woo women instead 
of yanking their pony tails like latterday cavemen 
in a movie called truth a woman even makes the first move 
unbuttoning her lovers shirt sunday magazine called that a 
cinematic first for india 
in my husband belongs to me a woman accused of being a 
mans mistress defies society by moving into his house 
on the darker side aids is believed to be spreading rapidly 
studies of bombay prostitutes indicate the number testing positive 
for the aids virus has jumped 500 percent in three years to about 
10000 
we are undergoing a revolution in consciousness said sudhir 
kakar the psychoanalyst who wrote intimate relations the 
first study of indian sexuality right now we are at the talking 
phase 
most of indias 880 million people still live by hindu 
tradition which puts the extended family above the individual sex 
takes a back seat to harmony and the central family relationship 
is not wife to husband but motherinlaw to wife 
about 90 percent of indian marriages are arranged and sexual 
affairs when they occur often happen within the family according 
to a 1984 study at a new delhi hospital half the men in a group of 
1000 had their first sexual experience with the wife of an elder 
brother 
sexual taboos remain so strong in many hindu communities that 
women often do not have a word for their genitals kakar wrote in 
intimate relations women commonly refer to sex as working 
he said many indian men believe ejaculation is a sign of 
weakness and that women by nature are impure or wild beings 
in india kakar said in the study sex has become a zone of 
genital combat where mens fantasies are filled with fear and 
dread and womens longings weighed down with anger and 
disappointment 
change is under way 
teenage dating was almost unheard of in the 1970s now coffee 
shops and restaurants in major cities fill with couples when night 
falls 
a survey of 2800 people last year by the illustrated weekly 
one of indias most popular magazines found about 85 percent of 
students aged 16 to 25 approved of mixing freely with the 
opposite sex the figure for people over 25 was 70 percent 
even virginity a foundation of hinduisms concept of marriage 
has taken a beating experts say almost every man insisted his 
bride be a virgin 20 years ago but only slightly more than half of 
several thousand students questioned recently listed is as a 
requirement 
we are in the midst of great change said prakash kothari 
indias foremost sexologist and author of orgasm new 
dimensions indias first book on the subject 
women are now standing up for their rights to be sexually 
satisfied he said its just begun i would never even have 
dreamed of that 18 years ago when i started my practice 
husbands are becoming more cooperative he said by telephone 
from his office in bombay they are making efforts to satisfy 
their wives that i think is a first 
indians approach the idea of sexual revolution with a certain 
irony this is the country after all that produced the lush 
eroticism of the kama sutra and the unihibited physical celebration 
of the khajuraho temple carvings 
in some ways it is simply a process of remembering longsilent 
traditions kothari said we have to engage in an excavation of 
our subconscious 
the change appears to be coming more from the west than from 
indias past years of relatively strong economic growth have 
created a middle class estimated at about 150 million that looks 
to the west for inspiration 
indias new yuppies exude selfconfidence and a willingness to 
experiment with new lifestyles 
we are a broadminded moslem couple says an ad soliciting 
adventurous couples and ladies in the singles magazine 
bombayite there is no word no in our vocabulary

almost four years after his mother died 
onyebuchim onyeanusi yearns to give her a honorable burial that 
might lift a curse against him and his family 
the curse rooted in african tribal beliefs has been blamed for 
all sorts of woe in his native nigerian village dismal yam 
harvests a canceled wedding and an epidemic that killed chickens 
goats and sheep 
the bad things started after his mother was buried in shame 
after he says her body was mishandled and misplaced for eight 
days while being shipped from the united states 
because he was responsible for the funeral onyeanusi says he 
was cursed by the gods of his native ibo tribe as were 98 family 
members 
onyeanusi hoped to set things right the western way he and the 
relatives filed suit against pan american world airways which 
shipped her body home but a federal judge ruled against him last 
month and his efforts to avenge his mothers spirit now hinge on 
appeals 
the war is not over onyeanusi said this was only a 
battle 
onyeanusis saga underscores the challenges of africans emerging 
in the modern world but still rooted in traditional beliefs 
it began oct 1 1986 when his mother olamma died of 
pneumonia while visiting onyeanusi who lives on visa status with 
his american wife and their four children in philadelphia the 
mother was about 90 when she died although her age was unknown 
because of uncertain birth records 
pan am shipped his mothers body while onyeanusi flew to 
southeastern nigeria to arrange the funeral the body was supposed 
to go to paris then home via nigeria airways 
according to tribal custom all business stops until the honored 
person is buried the family bears all expenses and onyeanusi 
pledged the familys 155acre plantation to feed the 20000 
villagers who gathered for the feast honoring his mother 
we believe people should rejoice in death the highest honor 
you can give someone is at death there is singing feasting the 
shooting of guns onyeanusi said 
but the villagers waited and waited and waited each day for 
eight days a frustrated and bewildered onyeanusi made the twohour 
drive to the airport 
the funeral tab eventually came to about 24000 but that was 
the least of the familys woes 
the videon funeral home of broomall pa embalmed olamma 
onyeanusis body and dressed it in a blue sarong blue turban and 
white gloves she was placed in a sheet metal case which in turn 
was put into an air tray made of corrugated paper 
the body left new yorks john f kennedy international airport 
on oct 15 
but a pan am memo dated oct 20 from the director of cargo at 
roissy airport in paris said shipment received with a crate 
surrounding the coffin damaged nigerian airways refused to accept 
transfer and we had to call the pompes funebres french funeral 
home to repair that crate 
when the body arrived in port harcourt nigeria the family said 
it had decayed and somewhere along the line olamma onyeanusi had 
been wrapped in burlap and turned upside down tribal taboos that 
show someone committed suicide or was an evil person 
these are regarded as the greatest abuse to be given a 
corpse onyeausi said we knew from the smell the body had 
spoiled she was decomposed decaying the skin was peeling off 
at the funeral the family burned heavy incense to mask the 
smell before burying her in disgrace 
the family offered sacrifices of yams money and english wine to 
appease the gods but tribe members say they have seen the womans 
spirit roaming despite placing chains on her grave to hold her 
down 
if anything happens the family is blamed for it said 
onyeanusi my mother was treated as if she were nothing my 
mother is not at peace she is angry 
one relative obioha onyeanusi was a prominent farmer but was 
ruined by a poor harvest of yams an ibo delicacy an epidemic 
blamed on the curse also killed 2500 chickens 95 goats and 89 
sheep 
the womans daughter nnalu earned a degree at cheyney 
university in pennsylvania and went home in 1986 to marry a man she 
had known for 10 years but he called off the wedding because of 
the curse 
business deals also went sour the family says 
it was as if the family had been shunned nobody wanted 
anything to do with them said john beavers onyeanusis lawyer 
the family sued in 1988 to recover costs for mental anguish 
emotional distress and breach of contract but us district court 
judge edmund ludwig threw the case out june 13 without saying 
anything about the curse 
ludwig ruled the case was covered by the warsaw convention an 
international treaty that limits liability on shipments to about 
18 per pound with a maximum damage claim of 75000 
the treaty also requires damage claims be filed within 21 days 
onyeanusi didnt notify pan am for 60 days so his claim was 
invalid the judge said 
thomas bracaglia pan ams attorney denied the airline 
mishandled the corpse but refused to comment on specific 
allegations but he said the issues themselves are 
fascinating 
onyeanusi has asked the judge to reconsider and failing that 
will seek relief from the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
it goes against the grain of not only nigerian thinking but 
american thinking that human remains are just goods that can be 
lost like luggage beavers said 
were not trying to prove to an american jury these curses are 
real all we want to do is convince them the family believes its 
true and theyve suffered consequences he said 
onyeanusi who is about 50 was a captain in the losing biafran 
army during nigerias 196770 civil war africas bloodiest tribal 
conflict in which 1 million people were killed 
he left his native village of uzuakoli and the land of the ibo 
the fourthlargest ethnic group in his homeland to study in 
america he earned a bachelors degree at philadelphia college of 
textiles and science a masters degree at temple university and a 
doctorate in vocational education at temple 
experts on african beliefs say onyeanusi might not be able to 
offset the curse even if he wins the appeal but its his only 
chance to regain respect 
the gravity of a curse like this is such that one lives with 
it forever said emeke akaezuwa an ibo who is executive director 
of the african academy of arts science and technology in north 
brunswick nj if you lose respect in the ibo culture no one 
takes you seriously you are as good as dead 
onyeanusi can only ask the gods for mercy 
if this had been done to us by an individual my whole tribe 
would have gone to war onyeanusi said if i win the case it 
would be like bringing back someones head it would prove im a 
warrior a strong man it will show the gods i have done something 
against someone who shamed my mother

in the 1950s james stewart turned mean 
romantic comedies were out thrillers and westerns were in the 
boynextdoor got nasty in bend of the river spied on his 
neighbors in rear window and almost lost his mind in 
vertigo and the naked spur 
but at the start of the decade at the same time he starred in 
the tough western winchester 73 stewart gave the public one 
more look at mr nice guy elwood p dowd in harvey 
elwood is in his early 40s and shares a house with his older 
sister veta and niece myrtle mae he is the most considerate of 
men forever holding doors open and offering invitations for 
dinner a penchant for martinis his only vice 
why is he so happy according to elwood he was walking down the 
street one evening when he encountered a large white rabbit leaning 
against a lamppost and the two became instant soulmates 
elwood has no job a large inheritance took care of that and 
no girl but always has a wonderful time thanks to the towering 
and invisible presence of his dear friend harvey 
is he alone veta is asked well theres two schools of 
thought sir she responds 
now elwood wants everybody to meet harvey much to the 
unhappiness of his relatives why cant we live like other 
people complains myrtle mae who seeks a man but wont bring 
anyone to the house fearing the inevitable introduction to the 
unseen rabbit 
veta is more sympathetic but when she invites wealthy aunt 
ethel for an afternoon tea party elwood quickly clears the room as 
he brings his special friend around to meet the guests 
and thats the last straw veta attempts to have elwood placed 
in a sanitarium but the psychiatrist mistakenly believes she is 
the crazy one and has her carried off to a soundproof chamber 
boasts elwood ive wrestled with reality for 35 years doctor 
and im happy to say ive finally won it 
everything works out fine of course veta is released myrtle 
mae gets a bpyfriend the psychiatrist falls for his nurse and 
elwood who makes believers out of almost everybody strolls 
amiably into the sunset harvey by his side 
elwood is one of the actors most popular roles stewart first 
portrayed him on stage as a summer replacement for frank fay in 
1947 and was offered the part for the film version of mary chases 
pulitzer prizewinning play 
harvey brought him an academy award nomination josephine 
hull won an oscar for best supporting actress as veta and stewart 
would continue to play elwood in theater revivals but the film 
and its gentle message about whos sane and whos not has aged 
badly home viewers may be interested however in stewarts 
observations given in a special introduction to the black and white 
video 
in this world you must be oh so smart or oh so pleasant 
elwood says of his unflappable geniality and that sums up this 
sweet bland comedy even stewart has said his portrayal was too 
nice he brought out more haunting aspects in later appearances 
including a 1972 television production

a jenny lind recital northeastern elizabeth parcells 
soprano james winn piano robert honeysucker baritone 
 
in 1850 jenny lind the worldrenowned swedish nightingale 
conquered the united states in particularly hysterical fashion 
befitting her promoter pt barnum his centurys combination of 
our donalds king trump and kirschner linds triumphal tour plays 
no small part in the nations music history 
northeastern an admirable small recording company based in 
saxonville mass devoted to american music has tried to bring 
lind back to life parcells reproduces on disc a typical concert 
that lind might have given during the tour 
she sings with complete security a clean sound excellent 
diction and tight vibrato but there is a certain inflexibility in 
her phrasing particularly in mozarts queen of the night aria from 
the magic flute that lind probably didnt have by all 
contemporary accounts technically though parcells is impeccable 
and she does evoke what one imagines to be the nordic purity and 
songbird brilliance of her predecessor 
the program the notes tell us is typically lind on the 
opening oratorio number on mighty pens from haydns 
creation here operatic showpieces such as ma la sola 
ohime son io from bellinis beatrice di tenda a comic duet 
with baritone from rossinis il turco in italia a piano 
interlude and popular songs 
lind often ended her programs with home sweet home and 
parcells offers a lovely version sung with appealing simplicity 
the real praise should go to northeastern for producing such an 
imaginative disc and so many other highly worthwhile projects in 
recent years

any kind of lie rca marti jones 
 
john hiatt elvis costello marshall crenshaw janis ian the 
list of songwriters ohio singer marti jones has tapped in her 
career is long and impressive 
on her new album the popcountry singer and her husband don 
dixon decide to do most of the writing the results coming off of 
1988s hidden gem used guitars lp are disappointing 
jones has a pillowsoft voice that wraps itself lovingly around 
a melody most of the melodies on any kind of lie are lifeless 
the song structures too similar and simple some songs suffer from 
arrangements that are too harsh jones should never have to fight 
to make herself heard above a snare drum 
oddly anyone persistent enough to stick with this disc until 
the end will be rewarded the last three songs are the best one 
shade darker features some lovely accordion by fats kaplin 
its a crime with a whiny country chorus is the best rocker 
on the album loudon wainwright iiis old friend brings the 
album to a melancholic close 
dropped by aampm because of poor record sales this promising 
artist was snapped up by rca for this album lets hope this record 
company is rewarded for its patience

john eliot gardiner has such a high opinion of 
mozarts opera idomeneo that he decided not to put it on stage 
this summer 
i didnt want to be distracted quite honestly by the dangers 
of a producer who had a completely different idea of the score from 
mine because there is so much musical richness and explicitness in 
the score gardiner said 
instead he led three concert performances of idomeneo at 
the south bank center last month to kick off a sixyear 
sevenopera mozart recording project for the english baroque 
soloists and monteverdi choir 
it was an electrifying beginning gardiners high dramatic 
immaculately detailed reading was supported by silken performances 
on original instruments and a solid vocal cast featuring anthony 
rolfejohnson in the title role anne sofie von otter as his son 
idamante and the american soprano sylvia mcnair as ilia 
idamantes beloved 
idomeneo was paired with mozarts rarely performed last 
opera la clemenza di tito and both were recorded by deutsche 
grammophones archiv label 
idomeneo is scheduled for release next year still to come 
are fully staged productions in paris lisbon and amsterdam of 
the magic flute the marriage of figaro cosi fan 
tutte abduction from the seraglio and don giovanni 
compact disc and videotape recordings are planned 
the concert version of idomeneo was impeccably authentic 
the last performance of the opera in mozarts lifetime was a 
private concert directed by the composer in vienna in 1789 
according to constanze mozart idomeneo was her husbands 
favorite she recalled some years after his death that he had burst 
into tears during a private performance of the quartet in act 3 in 
which idamante sets off on my wanderings alone seeking death 
elsewhere until i find it 
idomeneo in gardiners estimation is the most 
passionately engaged of all the mozart operas unfailing in its 
inventiveness 
there is not a superfluous note or a gratuitous aria in it 
he said 
the conductor approaches mozart from nearly two centuries 
earlier through performances and recordings of works such as 
claudio monteverdis 1607 opera la favola dorfeo 
more recently the english baroque soloists recorded mozarts 
late symphonies and with malcolm bilson the piano concertos 
so we have done our apprenticeship as it were in mozarts 
instrumental and operatic style gardiner said during a break 
from rehearsing clemenza 
and the revelations are extraordinary from the moment you use 
these instruments because its not simply that the timbre of the 
individual instruments is so different from their modern 
equivalents but the sound is more visceral its more physical in 
a way and you feel that they are much more individual voices the 
instruments have a personality very very sharply defined so the 
mixing in with the voices is a fascinating process 
did they have to forget monteverdi to play mozart 
not a bit what you have to do is forget everything that you 
learned of later music music that comes after mozart gardiner 
said 
thats where the whole false performing tradition has grown 
up its seeing mozart as a precursor of the great operatic events 
of the 19th century where i feel we have gone wrong over mozart 
he said 
instead he regards mozart as the culmination of the baroque 
tradition from monteverdi through handel purcell and rameau 
gardiner made one surprising break with mozart tradition using 
a piano instead of a harpsichord with the recitatives mozart used 
a piano in opera certainly after 1782 gardiner says but thats a 
year after the premiere of idomeneo in munich 
in gardiners judgment a harpsichord simply sounds wrong it 
makes too abrupt a change from the orchestral playing 
he also parts company with some of the early instruments 
community on the matter of mozarts pupil franz xaver suessmayr 
so often maligned for his contributions to la clemenza di tito 
and the completion of the requiem 
the requiem especially has been drastically revised by modern 
editors but gardiner stuck with suessmayr for this summers 
performances of clemenza and the requiem 
i think he was not a very talented composer but he has the 
huge advantage of being a composer writing in the 1790s at the 
time when mozart was dying or dead and he is far closer to 
mozarts style than an awful lot of the editors and bigwigs who set 
themselves up as being neomozartean scholars gardiner said 
i have yet to come across an edition of the mozart requiem 
that is actually materially more convincing than that of suessmayr 
which certainly has its gaucheries and infelicities 
well we tidy up a little bit of it but some of the published 
versions that are now flaunted around even in the socalled 
authentic world are really a disgrace in terms of mozartean 
style

its 11 am an ungodly hour for most musicians 
but just right for eric clapton a good time for cigarettes 
coffee and quiet conversation 
he leans back in a green easy chair in his manhattan hotel room 
his right ankle resting on the opposite knee his face is deeply 
tanned the beard trim his wavy brown hair brushed back a black 
tshirt and bluejeans hang loosely from his rock starskinny body 
but its the eyes you really notice the unwavering stare how 
the lids cut downwards at sharp angles the way his brows form a 
crease above his nose as he concentrates on whats being said and 
considers his response 
for a man who looks so reserved on stage clapton is in person 
surprisingly a man of many words he disapproves of asking 
questions bad manners he says observing is more his style but 
answers easily spinning stories of the blues and the business 
he talks about guitarists early heroes such as elmore james and 
buddy guy his alltime favorite contemporaries jimi hendrix and 
duane allman and young performers such as robert cray a featured 
player on claptons most recent album journeyman 
when you meet another guitarist the first thing you do is 
compare notes clapton 45 explains you find out who he 
likes do you like robert johnson its a selfish kind of thing 
you always tend to like being around people who like the same 
things you do 
it was clear to me that cray was a real dyedinthe wool blues 
musician hes also very very quiet very aware very sensitive 
theres a good example of the clapton approach in the chuck 
berry concert film hail hail rock n roll invited by 
organizer keith richards clapton takes it slow checking out 
berry considering what he wants to sing he eventually settles on 
a rare berry blues wee wee hours and gives a typically 
dignified performance 
my attitudes always been to just tread carefully be seen and 
not heard he says when i used to see my heroes as a kid i 
would just watch and listen its the same thing when i got to know 
them like buddy guy i just watch him and i can see that hes 
doing the same thing 
he says every time he sees someone playing he learns 
something which is great 
for much of his career clapton has preferred to be heard and 
not seen he makes videos but reluctantly insisting he has no 
interest in acting those eyes of an eagle were meant for checking 
out other guitarists not working cameras 
in concert he doesnt fall to his knees or bump and grind or 
run from one end of the stage to the other when walking is so much 
easier its just not dignified not how a gentleman would behave 
theres a line on the layla album do you want to see me 
crawl across the floor to you clapton says referring to bell 
bottom blues 
some people could do that crawl across the floor on stage i 
couldnt do that i wouldnt be able to watch myself on tv if i 
played like that that would be embarrassing to me 
clapton was born in 1945 in ripley a small town outside of 
london he became interested in music after seeing jerry lee lewis 
perform on television and received an acoustic guitar for his 14th 
birthday 
in the early 1960s he began spending time in london 
coffeehouses listening to such england blues performers as alexis 
korner cyril davis and long john baldry he joined his first 
blues band the roosters in 1963 
clapton earned a wide following in the mid60s with john 
mayalls bluesbreakers and became an international star with cream 
toward the end of the decade 
on originals such as layla and i cant stand it or 
covers of bobby blands further on up the road and johnsons 
ramblin on my mind clapton sings of gentlemen pushed to the 
limit down on the floor their dignity tested by love lies and 
their own jealous hearts 
lately ive been running on faith what else can a poor boy 
do he asks on running on faith from his journeyman 
album sadness cant prevail he sings on pretending 
everybody knows that strong love cant fail 
his greatest songs have been about despair and renewal of 
lonely years and the presence of the lord a walk with the devils 
music for a man who once inspired clapton is god graffiti on 
walls around london 
in 1970 the loss of faith pushed him to the extremes of 
layla with its fivealarm guitar riff and vocals that sound 
like a man going down in flames 
it pushed him to an anguished cover of chuck willis its too 
late the original was gentle the singer sadly resigned to 
losing his girl for clapton its much worse hes in tears as if 
life itself is slipping away his fate confirmed by background 
yells of oh shes gone 
despair almost finished him in real life as well layla 
flopped when it was first released and when he tried to record an 
album with the same musicians the following year the band fell 
apart clapton developed a serious heroin addiction that forced him 
into virtual seclusion for 2 years 
the most horrible i sound is when ive been burned out and in 
a bad state of mind and bad state of health clapton says you 
have to live with it if you can be happy with it when youre old 
youve got a much more contented life 
a gentleman clapton observed is a spiritual soul and faith 
regained brings out his more spiritual side let it grow from 
his 1974 album 461 ocean boulevard sounds like one long sigh 
of relief an offer of thanks for his own survival on anything 
for your love off journeyman he sings of love as salvation 
his guitar lifting the song right off the ground 
theres a yearning quality to it he says a spiritual 
striving there that all musicians attain to its just inherent in 
what you to trying to achieve that which you couldnt really 
achieve 
muddy waters the great bluesman with whom clapton became close 
in the late 1970s once spoke of the importance of being a 
gentleman and not the kind with a hat and cane you dont have 
to have a white face to be a gentleman and up to date with what 
youre doing you can be black brown or any other color but 
youve got to carry yourself in a way that people know that youre 
it 
they might say i cant play or i cant sing but damn it 
theyll say i was a gentleman 
clapton agreed explaining the challenges of compressing a 
lifetime of thoughts and feelings into five restless fingers 
i think it has something to do with grace being graceful in 
your life as much as you can be what happens is that no matter 
what you play its a reflection of what you are 
so if you live in a state of grace and dignity itll come out 
in what youre playing im starting to realize what im doing now 
has to be good enough to be happy with in 20 years time

here sits maggie the cat in a gray blouse and 
blue dress the real maggie the one tennessee williams had in mind 
when he wrote cat on a hot tin roof 
in her long speeches she has the vocal tricks of a priest 
delivering a liturgical chant williams writes of the plays 
feisty heroine the lines are almost sung always continuing a 
little beyond her breath so she has to gasp for another 
and lady st just the playwrights close friend for 35 years 
does speak quickly excitedly but in the polished throaty tones 
of british aristocracy not the drawl of the mississippi delta 
five oclock angel 2495 knopf is a collection of 
letters received from williams the title is the playwrights 
nickname for her with her own commentary woven throughout 
she was quick to criticize him whether dumping his memoirs in 
the garbage or scolding him for daydreaming too often but when it 
comes to defending tennessee williams no one is more determined 
than lady st just 
writing was his life she explained in an interview at her 
hotel suite in manhattan thats why people found him so 
difficult he was up there half the time he worked terribly hard 
look how prolific he was writing was his passion and he was my 
passion 
the daughter of a prominent surgeon she was born maria britneva 
in leningrad and moved to britain when she was still young she 
trained first for the ballet and then appeared in several plays for 
sir john gielguds production company in 1956 she married peter 
grenfell lord st just and had two daughters lord st just died 
in 1985 
she met williams in 1948 at a small party in london given by 
gielgud whose guests included laurence olivier vivien leigh and 
noel coward lady st just was 18 at the time and remembered 
spotting a shy little man one sock blue and the other red sitting 
nervously on the couch 
you felt this great sort of wave of fear she recalled of 
williams who had recently completed a streetcar named desire 
and would win the pulitzer prize for cat on a hot tin roof 
which was revived last year on broadway starring charles durning 
and kathleen turner 
i thought i must speak to him i thought he was an 
understudy i asked him if he would like a drink 
he seemed surprised i paid attention to him he looked up 
blushed and asked who brought you up my grandmother i said 
and he said my grandmother brought me up too only tennessee 
would ask a question like that 
so thanks appropriately to the kindness of a stranger their 
friendship began williams wrote her a month later and the letters 
continued until the last few months of his troubled life 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
lady st justs memories of williams who died in 1983 at age 
71 are of panicky opening nights long drives in rome visits with 
her family in england and the day when the playwright tossed her a 
finished script and told her to read it 
he said ive written the play about you he just flung the 
script at me i said tennessee how wonderful and then with 
mounting fury i read this play i said this is outrageous thats 
not me im from russia i want wolves i want carriages 
he said im writing about your spirituality your vitality 
you are life you know my children saw it and they kept laughing 
they said mommy youre just like that 
here are highlights from lady st justs discussion on the 
prizewinning play 
q in cat on a hot tin roof maggie says to brick her 
husband oh you weak beautiful people who give up with such 
grace is that how tennessee williams felt about himself 
a he never thought of himself as being weak not at all he was 
fragile not weak he was extremely strong and very determined and 
very positive theres this picture of tennessee as this kind of 
delicate person im trying to change that 
q but he was sensitive easily hurt 
a very but then he gave idiotic interviews himself i used to 
say if i write my memoirs i would call them oh do shut up 
tennessee i used to give him signals when he was doing 
interviews he used to just blab on and on and he would say things 
that were unnecessary and could be misinterpretated 
q in the mid1950s his letters make more and more references 
to his being depressed is that when you first noticed his problems 
a i think he always had problems but even when he was at his 
lowest he said en avant go forward he was so masculine you 
see he made decisions and took over he was incrdibly large in his 
attitude to me and he supported his sister his grandfather his 
mother his maiden aunt and many young writers and poets 
q flannery oconnor once wrote of one of her characters that 
she would have been a good person if she had somebody to hit her 
over the head all the time did williams value you for that 
a he needed somebody who was very truthful and terribly honest 
to a fault he knew i would never lie to him he taught me how not 
to lie but i was always very careful what i said about his plays 
and his poems i would step so far 
q what was the happiest you ever saw him 
a the happiest i ever saw him was when we were both doubled up 
in laughter playing the fools we shared the same sense of the 
ridiculous we would take a taxi on our way to the opening of a 
play and he was so nervous i would make him sing sing and do 
imitations he sung very very badly but he loved it 
q he didnt seem to trust many people 
a he was the most suspicious paranoid person it was a 
nightmare tennessee no one is looking at you 
we were on this plane once and we had this perfectly ordinary 
stewardess and he decided she was a murderess he wouldnt eat 
anything because he thought she had poisoned it he asked for a 
glass of water and ill never forget tenmnesee took a sip from 
the glass held it to me and said does this taste like water to 
you 
q in cat on a hot tin roof brick is always drinking and 
talks about getting the click in his head get the click and 
everything will be all right is that how williams felt 
a i think the click in his head was the click of the 
typewriter if he really got into a beautiful poem or a beautiful 
line that would be the click for him tennessee felt exactly the 
same way about his typewriter as brick did about his bottle

steve earle weaves back and forth between rock 
n roll and country the soul of his voice in one world and the 
wail of his guitars in another 
earle broke through with the album guitar town in 1986 after 
one false start and a decade of paying his dues in nashville they 
called his brand of hardbitten countryrock power twang and 
compared his stories of losers and lovers in the smalltown south 
to bruce springsteens jersey ballads and john mellencamps midwest 
it aint your typical country a character in a country song 
gets drunk on a bad day earles antiheroes split for mexico pull 
a holdup or like the title character in billy austin get 
executed 
thats been done before but johnny cash didnt back his stories 
up with doublelead rock riffs and a big drum sound to go with 
heavy doses of mandolin and pedal steel earle used the irish band 
the pogues on his last album in the hard way his fourth lp 
and latest with mca he did one song with the christ missionary 
baptist church choir of memphis tenn 
earle who lives outside nashville and has another home in los 
angeles will tell you hes earned the right to be different a 
childhood in rural texas on the road as a musician by age 16 
married at 19 and in nashville by 20 digging swimming pools and 
looking for a break it almost happened the next year a deal for 
elvis to record one of his songs the king didnt show up 
but earle was selling a few songs and eight years later in 
1983 he signed a deal with cbs he didnt like the four singles 
that came out of it and an album they made wasnt distributed but 
three years later he signed a sevenalbum deal with mca hes 
since had some top10 country success and the title song off his 
last record copperhead road was a rock crossover 
in a recent new york promotional stop for the new record he 
conceded the experimentation with a rock sound may disappoint some 
country fans earle says what matters is the spirit of the music 
there are some purer forms of country music maybe by 
definition through the use of electric guitars and certain 
electric guitar sounds and drum sounds he said but this is 
the 1990s and nothing stays that pure and when you attempt to keep 
anything that pure thats tantamount to inbreeding it tends to 
weaken the strain not strengthen it 
the central character in many of earles songs is the 
stereotypical workingclass southern man known in those parts as a 
bubba thats whos talking when earle sings from good old 
boy on his first album 
i got a job but it aint nearly enough a 20000 pickup 
truck belongs to me and the bank and a funnytalkin man from 
iran 
earles own views are a bit more complex hes against imports 
and gun control but hes also against the death penalty and loudly 
supports causes at variance with his country fans 
a lot of people decided that i was a hyperredneck from 
hearing songs like good old boy but bubba is a composite of a 
lot of people that i grew up with and i dont have anything in 
common with him and i think some of my fans were probably shocked 
at how leftwing my politics are he said 
earle 35 grew up in a small town north of houston not far 
from the state prison at huntsville after he left home his mother 
used to call him on nights when an execution was scheduled because 
she couldnt sleep 
you became very aware when you lived in that part of the world 
that kids were going out there and sitting on the tailgates of 
their trucks waiting to hear the announcement theres this whole 
circus atmosphere around it 
in the song billy austin the title character contemplates 
his death sentence for killing a gas station attendant 
as the final hour drags by i aint about to tell you that i 
dont deserve to die but theres 27 men here mostly black brown 
and poor most of em are guilty who are you to say for sure 
earle hopes his rockstyle arrangements will make his message 
songs palatable to younger fans many of their elders particularly 
at a major country shrine such as the grand ole opry in nashville 
arent ready no matter how the guitars sound 
earle would love to play there but theyve never let him 
its an older audience at the opry he said you know the 
old joke what has 30 arms 30 legs and six teeth the first row 
at the grand ole opry

charles mingus was a composer bass player and 
pianist he also was something of a jazz historian and keeper of 
the flame infusing his compositions with the structures and 
innovations of others such as duke ellington and fats waller 
mingus died on jan 5 1979 of lou gehrigs disease a decade 
later a 30year project culminated with a twohour concert at 
lincoln centers alice tully hall epitaph was an orchestral 
masterwork 
columbia records made a live recording of the concert and it is 
now available as a doublecd it is a rich translation mirroring 
all the tempestuous thunder of mingus composition as well as its 
sweet melodies and contradicting harmonies

oilman and investor t boone pickens expects to 
lose his battle with koito manufacturing co ltd at thursdays 
annual shareholder meeting 
the war however will go on 
as long as you can hold out remain on the right side of the 
issue youll eventually prevail pickens said in a recent 
interview in his downtown dallas office 
pickens whose request for a seat on the companys board of 
directors was denied last year is asking for four seats on the 
board at this years annual meeting 
pickens says his fight with koito which makes automobile 
headlights chiefly for toyota motor corp is about open investment 
in japan the companys refusal to put him on its board pickens 
says is an example of japanese unwillingness to allow outside 
investors into the country 
this is about the long term this is about the future of trade 
relations between japan and the united states about the future of 
the japanese shareholder consumer and working family pickens 
said at the foreign correspondents press club today in tokyo 
he has sought help from trade representative carla hills and 
congress with little visible impact 
it has nothing to do with trade issues hamilton loeb 
koitos american lawyer said in a telephone interview from tokyo 
loeb represented unocal corp when the oil company fought off 
pickens advances in 1985 
koito has rebuffed pickens by saying he is after greenmail 
having the company buy back its stock at a premium to avoid a 
takeover attempt the company also has suggested he is simply the 
front man for kitaro watanabe whom the company also brands as a 
greenmailer 
the latest salvo in the battle came monday koito issued a 
statement saying pickens really is not the companys biggest 
stockholder as he claims a charge pickens quickly denied 
pickens bought his koito shares from watanabe described by 
koito president takao matsuura as an infamous japanese 
greenmailer 
we are confident there is a secret agreement the terms of it 
we can only speculate about loeb said 
pickens repeatedly has said he is not after greenmail but is a 
longterm investor in koito the company says his investment does 
not make financial sense 
although he is a multimillionaire pickens 1 billion 
investment in koito is sizable even for him but he refuses to tell 
how he financed his purchases of the stock 
it isnt managements option to question that he said 
if he were doing this in the united states loeb said he 
would be obligated to make disclosures of any agreement he had with 
anybody about the stock 
if pickens owns the 26 percent of the stock he claims toyota 
would be the secondlargest shareholder 
pickens contends toyota leads a keiretsu or business alliance 
and forces koito to sell its auto parts at depressed prices to the 
advantage of toyota profits and the detriment of koito shareholders 
im a geologist not an economist but i do know that whatever 
you call it a cartel a trust a monopoly a keiretsu or a 
zaibatsu its wrong pickens said in tokyo today 
since being denied a board seat at last years shareholder 
meeting pickens has sought to inspect koitos books and increase 
its dividend 
koito last year agreed to increase the dividend but only by 
about half what pickens sought 
aside from seeking four seats on the 20member board pickens 
has proposed an antigreenmail resolution an annual statement on 
whether koito has been forced to engage in anticompetitive 
activities an annual shareholder vote on salary and retirement 
benefits of board members an annual report on pricing policies a 
further increase in the dividend and an accounting of the 
shitofumeikin fund which pickens suggests amounts to an 
illegal slush fund

ibm today launched its second assault on the 
home computer market a drive to tap the millions of americans it 
says want a home machine but have been scared by the technology 
the computers will be priced as low as 999 and in a departure 
for the worlds largest computer company will be sold at 
mainstream retailers such as sears roebuck and co dillards 
department stores and daytons department stores 
the machines were designed for people who have gained some 
knowledge of computers through their work but dont want to learn 
all the technical terms and concepts associated with them 
international business machines corp believes the potential 
audience is huge said skip gladfelter marketing manager for the 
new line 
we think there are millions of families sitting on the 
sidelines he said in an interview monday 
the computers called the personal system1 line will go on 
sale today in stores in the chicago dallasfort worth and 
minneapolisst paul areas ibm said the national rollout will 
come in september 
ibms first assault on the home market turned into a bitter 
failure production of the machines dubbed the pcjr was halted 
about a year and a half after they were launched in 1983 
pcjr was criticized for a toylike keyboard limited memory and a 
toosteep price 
this time around ibm executives say they plan to succeed their 
first step was to determine what went wrong with pcjr 
we all got phds in pcjr said robert amezcua product 
manager for the new ps1 line 
then a group of about 50 ibm employees in lexington ky began 
trying to figure out what consumers wanted gladfelter said 
since the fall of 1988 about 3000 consumers had a say in the 
new lines design through interviews and participation in focus 
groups he said 
among the features requested was ease of use a low price 
sufficient computing power to handle popular officecomputer 
software and availability at noncomputer stores he said 
like the more expensive macintosh from apple computer inc the 
ps1 line can be set up in minutes also like the mac the 
computers feature graphics and a handheld device called a mouse 
which manipulates an arrow onscreen to let users to chose the 
function they want to run 
the computers are built around the intel corp 80286 
microprocessor used in millions of office computers they also use 
the popular dos operating system making them compatible with 
thousands of applications programs for home and office use 
each machine contains a builtin modem which allows computers 
to hook up to distant computers or data services via phone lines 
one such service jointly owned by ibm and sears is prodigy it 
provides such things as home banking shopping and airline 
reservations the ps1 line contains a builtin program that 
provides an automatic linkup to prodigy 
the computers also include a popular software package from 
microsoft corp that combines a word processor a spreadsheet a 
database program and a communications program to run the modem 
the two cheapest ps1s lack a hard disc which is used to store 
many of the programs on the two highend models that means users 
of these models must insert a diskette containing the software 
after they turn on the machine on the more expensive models the 
programs automatically are pulled off the hard disc when the 
computers are turned on 
two of the models have blackandwhite screens while the other 
two offer color the most expensive model with a suggested retail 
price of 1999 has more memory in addition to the hard disc and 
color monitor 
all four machines feature fullsize keyboards but none has a 
printer which computer industry consultant sam albert said could 
be a drawback for some potential purchasers 
industry analysts say that although many families may want a 
home computer it may compete on a wish list with other expensive 
electronics devices such as camcorders laser disc players and 
largescreen tvs 
analysts also say ibm may have a rough time marketing the 
computers as consumer spending is declining due to economic 
uncertainty 
albert a former ibm executive said ibm may have solved the 
easeofuse problem but it still needs to show consumers why they 
need a home computer besides keeping up with the joneses

the sluggish economy continued to dampen the 
automobile market as sales of north americanmade cars and trucks 
fell 36 percent in midjune from the same period last year 
and once again the big three automakers bore the full brunt of 
the slowdown as transplant vehicles made in us plants by 
japanese companies snapped up whatever sales gains were to be 
found 
continuing incentive programs failed to stem the weak sales 
trend at general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp 
said automotive analyst joseph phillippi of shearson lehman hutton 
we are still unable to bloody the nose of the imports he 
said 
overall domestic automakers said they sold vehicles at an 
average daily rate of 37962 during the june 1120 period compared 
with an average of 39392 a day during the same period last year 
car sales trailed by 45 percent and light truck sales lagged 
22 percent 
gm ford and chrysler said their combined midjune sales dropped 
68 percent to an average daily rate of 34655 from 37192 last 
year 
sales of usmade cars with japanese nameplates jumped 547 
percent to an average daily rate of 2854 honda and toyota paced 
the japanese makers with increases of more than 60 percent 
for the year through june 20 north americanmade car and truck 
sales ran 44 percent behind last years with car sales trailing 
57 percent and light truck sales down 21 percent 
the decline was despite a 404 percent rise in transplant car 
sales 
im hearing more people starting to use the r word 
meaning recession with respect to the fact that the economy is 
just sort of muddling along phillippi said not a bad one but 
just modestly in that gray area of being in a recession 
chrysler reported the sharpest drop with midjune vehicle sales 
155 percent behind last years pace car sales dropped 183 
percent sales of light trucks including the minivans that provide 
much of the companys profits dropped 129 percent 
for the year chryslers car and light truck sales trailed last 
years pace by 132 percent with car sales down 18 percent and 
truck sales down 85 percent 
gm said combined midjune car and truck sales were off 62 
percent car sales were down 78 percent and light trucks sales 
were down 29 percent 
for the year gm said it sold 48 percent fewer vehicles than a 
year earlier car sales were down 75 percent and truck sales were 
up 06 percent 
ford reported a 28 percent midjune drop in car and truck 
sales car sales lagged 74 percent while truck sales were up 4 
percent

sales of sony corps new digital audio tape 
decks are off to a strong start but not everybodys happy 
songwriters fear the machines which allow consumers to make 
nearperfect pirate copies of compact disks will rob them of 
royalties 
we will seek court relief from the equipment being brought 
into this country said edward murphy president of the national 
music publishers association in new york 
a version of the dat recorder has been sold in japan and some 
parts of europe since 1987 and has been available through 
unofficial channels in the united states 
but manufacturers held back from launching the machines openly 
in this country because of a dispute over copying in a concession 
to record companies the manufacturers agreed to offer machines 
that can make only copies of cds not copies of copies 
sony became the first to offer popular priced recorders to 
american consumers friday matsushita electric industrial co the 
japanese firm that produces the panasonic technics and quasar 
brands hopes to have a competitively priced dat recorder in us 
stores by september a spokesman said 
sonys dtc75es priced at 950 includes circuitry that 
flags digital tapes copied from compact disc to prevent the 
tapes from being copied including that technology was part of an 
agreement between manufacturers and the recording industry that 
seemed to remove the threat of lawsuits from record companies 
but the accord and bills in the house and senate that would 
write the agreement into law did not resolve the festering issue 
of royalty payments for home taping 
george david weiss representing the copyright coalition told a 
senate subcommittee two weeks ago that the senate bill forces 
songwriters to give away copies of our music without payment of any 
kind 
murphy said his group was collecting information on the models 
available or soon to hit the us market to prepare for legal 
action 
we have several legal options we will pursue some form of 
legal remedy murphy said without elaborating 
the debate apparently didnt hamper sales in the first weekend 
i dont think people stormed the doors but it was generally 
very successful said shari haber spokeswoman for sony in park

international lease finance corp 
the biggest us aircraft leaser has agreed to a 13 billion 
buyout by american international group inc to gain the financial 
backing of the insurance giant 
aig the largest us underwriter of commercial and industrial 
insurance also will provide ilfc with 125 million in financing as 
part of the deal 
analysts and spokesmen for the companies said the deal gives 
ilfc financial muscle at a time when it must borrow heavily to 
complete an ambitious expansion 
theyve found someone with lots of cash low cost of funds 
and willing to take some greater risk in return for greater 
rewards said daniel a hersch a securities analyst with bateman 
eichler hill richards inc in los angeles 
ilfc has grown strongly in recent years as airlines have relied 
more on leasing because of the high cost of and long wait for new 
aircraft purchases 
the company owns 98 jetliners worth more than 3 billion and 
averaging only three years of age 
it also has placed 10 billion worth of firm orders for planes 
to be delivered over 10 years and has another 4 billion in 
options that means ilfc which has had to borrow heavily and issue 
new stock to finance past deals will need much more capital at a 
time when it is harder to come by 
i think that having a strategic alliance with a backer of the 
stature and creditworthiness of aig should instill a greater 
confidence in the financial markets jay jacobsen a spokesman 
for ilfc said in a telephone interview from new york 
aigs triplea debt rating the highest possible will enable 
ilfc to borrow funds more cheaply to finance new aircraft 
purchases said maurice r greeberg chairman and chief executive 
officer of the new yorkbased insurer thats important with the 
pricetag for planes reaching as high as 125 million for boeings 
new 747400 he said 
the deal also helps aig increase its business in financial 
services other than insurance greenberg said 
its a perfect fit he said 
aig had operating income of about 150 million in financial 
services other than insurance last year out of total operating 
income of nearly 2 billion greenberg said the company hopes to 
boost that figure to close to 500 million in the next couple of 
years he said 
the buyout price of 3250 a share is about 15 or 16 times 
expected earnings for this year at the top of the recent trading 
range for ilfc stock hersch said 
the stock closed at 2687 in overthecounter trading monday 
it had sunk as low as 1937 in the past year 
jacobsen said the stock had been undervalued because of investor 
worries over debt despite the fact that ilfcs purchase agreements 
for boeing and other planes are at extremely good prices 
the asset values were substantially above the stock price 
he said 
ilfcs management will be unchanged and the company will 
continue to be based in beverly hills operating as a wholly owned 
aig subsidiary it is 53 percent owned by three men all of whom 
have approved the merger leslie l gonda the board chairman 
steven f udvarhazy president and chief executive and louis l 
gonda executive vice president 
the definitive agreement has been approved by aigs executive 
committee by ilfcs directors and by a special committee of 
ilfcs independent directors the companies said in a joint news 
statement 
under the deal ilfc shareholders can receive 3250 a share in 
cash or 50 cents a share plus 03 shares of aig common stock the 
amount of aig stock to be exchanged can be adjusted depending on 
aigs share price at the time the deal closes 
ilfcs three controlling owners have agreed to accept aig stock 
for their holdings jacobsen said

three consumer groups are accusing chrysler 
corp of withholding evidence of rollover problems in 300000 jeep 
cjs but the company and the government say the safety advocates 
have nothing new 
brandishing a 3inchthick pile of internal chrysler and 
american motors documents the auto safety advocates filed a 
petition monday for a fullscale federal investigation into the cj 
and chryslers actions 
the institute for injury reduction the center for auto safety 
and public citizen turned over the documents which they said prove 
that amc and chrysler knew of problems with the cj5 and cj7 the 
papers came from court cases against the cj 
tim hurd spokesman for the national highway traffic safety 
administration said the government already had all the material in 
its inquiry into the safety of jeep cjs built by american motors 
between 1971 and 1986 chrysler took over amc in 1987 
we are very well acquainted with this vehicle and we are 
reviewing any information which comes to us hurd said 
the agency conducted a safety analysis of the cjs a decade ago 
and has turned down two previous requests to reopen the 
investigation or to conduct a new one hurd said 
benjamin kelley of the institute for injury reduction said the 
cj epitomizes the worst in both vehicle safety and manufacturer 
indifference joan claybrook of public citizen called the cjs 
deathtraps 
representatives of the three consumer groups appeared at a news 
conference with a 42yearold electrician who said he had been 
crippled in a jeep rollover 
i went from a productive member of society to what you see 
said ed keller of hughesville md who struggled to the podium on 
forearm crutches keller said a 1981 rollover in a jeep cj5 broke 
his back 
the groups cited problems with a shackle pin on the cj that 
could induce or aggravate the likelihood of rollover shackle 
pins connect the jeep body to its suspension system they also said 
the vehicles rollbars are inadequate to protect drivers in a 
rollover 
ms claybrook who formerly headed nhtsa said the cj5s high 
center of gravity and narrow track give it little resistance to 
rolling over 
she said 203 people died in cj accidents last year 75 percent 
of them in rollovers a study cited at the news conference 
maintained that the cj5 is 20 times more likely to roll over than 
an average car and that the cj7 is 12 times more likely 
a videotape played for reporters showed a cj5 rolling over as 
it swerved at 32 miles per hour on a flat dry roadway 
chrysler responded that the cj is a safe vehicle always has 
been and still is and that the groups charges are hardly worth 
responding to again 
these organizations which derive significant support from 
plaintiffs attorneys are simply trying to generate more business 
for these supporters the company said in a statement distributed 
outside the hotel conference room where the groups announced the 
petition

savings and loan regulators are considering 
publicly releasing administrative charges against thrift officers 
including one of president bushs sons before the cases are judged 
timothy ryan director of the treasury departments office of 
thrift supervision told reporters monday that in the next week or 
two he expected to decide on a policy governing when and if the 
agency publicizes such charges 
house democrats last week called on him to release 
conflictofinterest charges concerning neil bush and silverado 
banking savings and loan association of denver but ryan said he 
preferred to set a broad policy rather than decide the matter on 
one case 
separately ryans agency issued rules aimed at making hundreds 
of struggling sampls a more attractive investment such thrifts will 
now be permitted to pay some earnings to stockholders on a sliding 
scale depending on their condition 
healthy thrifts can distribute earnings without restriction 
while clearly weak institutions would be barred from paying 
dividends without special permission 
regulators allege that neil bushs interests as an oil and gas 
developer in colorado conflicted with his duties on silverados 
board silverado made loans which were not repaid to bushs 
business associates bush has denied wrongdoing but the ots is 
pursuing administrative actions against him 
currently the agency publicizes administrative penalties after 
they are imposed however it rarely releases the charges while an 
accused executive is contesting them hearings on charges before 
administrative law judges are almost always private 
ryan said the new policy could spell out when charges would be 
released and hearings conducted in public 
historically regulators have been reluctant to release charges 
before they are decided for fear of scaring depositors he said 
but in the case of an institution already closed by the government 
such as silverado there presumably would be less impact on 
depositors ryan said 
the new dividend regulation aims to strike a balance between 
struggling institutions need to pay dividends to attract capital 
from new investors and their need to retain earnings to build 
capital 
under the rule 1185 thrifts that already meet tough new 
capital standards taking effect in 1994 could freely distribute 
earnings to shareholders while 716 that fail current capital 
requirements would be barred from paying dividends unless the ots 
approved a special application 
an additional 612 thrifts that comply with the current standard 
but not the future standard could distribute 25 percent to 75 
percent of their income depending on how close they are to meeting 
the 1994 rules 
ryan announced the policy to the us league of savings 
institutions the thrift industrys chief trade group it was his 
first public speech since taking office april 9

temperatures for the midwest during the period july 15 
the nws forecast and similar projections by private 
meteorologists reduced fears of an extended heat wave that helped

president bush has decided to impose long 
delays in offshore oil leasing off california and florida 
according to an administration official the white house was 
preparing an announcement later today 
the delay in granting new leases for offshore oil drilling would 
apply to one large area off south florida one region off southern 
california and one off northern california the offical said 
moratoriums of up to a decade would be imposed in most of the 
area under consideration said the official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
administration sources said earlier that bush wanted to 
forestall new oil drilling in those areas pending more study on 
potential impact to the environment 
the area covered by the decision includes a 67millionacre 
section of ocean off southern california 12 million acres off 
northern california and 13 million acres in the gulf of mexico 
near the florida everglades 
officials have said bush was leaning toward imposing the longest 
waiting period off the florida keys until the year 2002 or beyond 
bush named a task force last year headed by interior secretary 
manuel lujan to work with the national academy of sciences in 
studying the environmental impact of opening the three areas to new 
leasing 
the task force concluded that more study of the environmental 
effects was needed bush has repeatedly stated his wish to protect 
environmentally sensitive areas but also has said the nation 
should not have to depend on foreign oil 
bush postponed announcing a decision in the wake of a recent 
massive tanker spill off galveston texas a norwegian tanker was 
rocked by an explosion june 8 spilling 39 million gallons of oil 
it created a 30mile oil slick some 18 miles offshore most of it 
was skimmed off burned or evapaorated 
the entire florida congressional delegation and most of the 
california delegation have urged delays in new leasing republicans 
were especially sensitive to political fallout likely from any 
decision to open new oildrilling regions in an election year

president bush said today that tax revenue 
increases must be included in any deficitreduction package that 
the white house works out with congressional negotiators 
bushs initial statement did not provide specifics on taxes but 
democrats immediately hailed it as presidential acceptance for a 
tax increase 
the president has concluded that tax increases are necessary 
and we share the presidents view said senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine who along with other congressional 
leaders met with the president 
we are not willing to give it any definition white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said of bushs statement thats a 
matter for the negotiators 
no decision has been made with respect to any specific 
measures mitchell agreed 
the president issued the statement as he met at the white house 
with top congressional leaders to review the sluggish negotiations 
on a plan to reduce the deficit 
bush also called for cuts in spending for federal benefits as 
well as other domestic and defense programs and said congressional 
leaders agreed with him 
fitzwater and congressional leaders said the talks would resume 
wednesday with the hope that they might be completed by the time 
lawmakers take their august recess 
deficit estimates have increased substantially since bush 
unveiled his proposed 1991 budget in january and red ink may total 
more than 200 billion in the next fiscal year 
until now when asked whether the president would accept higher 
taxes bush and his aides have repeatedly said that they have 
stopped using bushs campaign pledge of no new taxes 
at a news conference congressional democratic leaders refused 
to say whether they thought he had broken his campaign pledge 
however they also made clear they thought the political 
landscape had changed 
someone who is complaining about taxes being raised in the 
budget summit will have to complain against both parties and the 
president if they wish to make that kind of complaint said house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash 
other elements that bush said must be included in a 
deficitreduction plan were cuts in federal benefit programs other 
domestic initiatives and defense reforms in the federal budget 
process and growth incentives 
the term growth incentives is often used to describe a reduction 
in the capital gains tax which bush has fought for since taking 
office last year the president says such a cut would stimulate 
economic growth while opponents say it would simply be a gift to 
the wealthy who own most of the real estate and other property 
that would qualify for the reduction 
rep dan rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means 
committee called bushs statement an important step in the right 
direction 
it is clear to me that any program comprehensive enough to 
make a significant dent in the deficit will have to include both 
spending cuts and tax increases said rostenkowski dill who 
did not attend the meeting with bush i am pleased that the 
president shares that view 
the fiscal 1991 budget bush unveiled in january contained 197 
billion in new taxes user fees and other revenues some 
congressional leaders have complained throughout seven weeks of 
budget negotiations that that amount is insufficient to take a 
serious bite out of the deficit 
the grammrudman law will trigger widespread spending cuts on 
oct 1 the start of fiscal 1991 unless the gap is kept to 74 
billion or less 
in his statement bush also said he agreed that orderly 
reductions in defense expenditures were needed but he did not 
specify the amount of cuts he would favor 
bush has proposed reducing defense spending next year by 3 
billion below what it have grown to if it kept pace with inflation 
congressional democrats would like the cut to be about 10 billion 
or more 
bush held a morning meeting at the white house with house 
speaker thomas foley dwash senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine house majority leader richard gephardt dmo 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan and house minority leader 
robert michel rill 
a budget bargaining session between white house and 
congressional representatives set for monday was canceled no 
further meetings were scheduled 
the cancellation came four days after the last negotiating 
session which ended with democrats rejecting the administrations 
51 billion deficitreduction proposal for next year as inadequate

us and japanese negotiators tackled japanese 
pricing mechanisms and american shortfalls in savings and 
investment today as talks on structural trade problems moved into 
their second day 
although the talks originally were scheduled to end today they 
were continuing into the night and appeared likely to extend 
through wednesday 
us trade representative carla hills said in a speech monday to 
a washington trade conference sponsored by the institute for 
international economics it may be necessary to hold another round 
of talks on broad reforms to reduce japans 49 billion surplus in 
trade with the united states 
we will continue to talk until the job is done if there needs 
to be another meeting so be it she said 
hills warned there could be a backlash against japanese imports 
in the united states if the trade talks fail to expand foreign 
business opportunities in japan 
japan isnt open and until we get that parity of opportunity 
we will have an enormous buildup of antagonism that creates a 
backdrop for very bad public policy she said 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said the talks were 
very intensive and he welcomed comments monday by us 
officials that the talks had been friendly and cooperative 
this underlines that our response has been very positive 
watanabe said 
nonetheless the two sides had failed to agree on the level to 
which japan would increase spending on public works 
watanabe said tuesdays session opened with a discussion of why 
japan tends to have higher prices than the united states on similar 
products 
in the afternoon he said the negotiators covered such problems 
on the us side as the government budget deficit low savings and 
investment rates excessive consumption low competitiveness of 
us products and poor training of us workers 
our position is that the us side also has some tasks he 
said 
such basic factors in the two countries economic systems are 
among many topics in the socalled structural impediments 
initiative talks launched last september japanese and us 
negotiators agreed on an interim report in april that both sides 
hailed as a strong step toward a final pact 
but since then washington has said tokyo was not following 
through fully on a pledge to increase public works spending and on 
tuesday japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto reportedly 
said washington apparently was ducking the problem of the huge us 
government budget deficit 
kyodo news service said hashimoto told reporters after a cabinet 
meeting that the united states had said in the interim report it 
would eliminate its budget deficit by 1993 but the pledge did not 
appear in washingtons draft of the final report 
later senior us officials said they had told the japanese 
side washington wants to look beyond eliminating the budget deficit 
by 1993 and to envision a budget surplus 
speaking on condition of anonymity they said there had been a 
good exchange of views tuesday but did not indicate whether 
agreements had been reached on any of the areas under discussion 
the us budget deficit is regarded as a spur to us 
consumption that increases demand for japanese imports and thus 
contributes to the trade imbalance at the same time us savings 
and investment levels are lower than japans that means greater 
modernization for japanese industry increasing its advantage in 
efficiency 
an increase in japanese public spending is expected to boost 
imports and soak up some savings the two countries disagreed over 
how high the increase should be with the americans asking for 500 
trillion yen or 322 trillion over the next 10 years japanese 
officials indicated they favored spending between 400 trillion and 
415 trillion yen or 258 trillion to 268 trillion 
among other things japan has agreed to ease restrictions on 
opening large retail stores revise land use policies to curb high 
land prices speed up processing of patent applications crack down 
on allegedly unfair business practices by corporate groups and 
open complicated pricing mechanisms all the measures are thought 
likely to increase foreign opportunities for trade and investment 
in japan

trans world airlines inc plans to sell four 
jets by the end of the month cut back its flight schedule and end 
service to seven cities by oct 1 a top official told the 
airlines pilots 
in a letter to the members of the twa branch of the air line 
pilots association twa chief operating officer william hoar said 
the company cannot and will not allow twa to bleed to death 
left with no choice we can no longer delay our decision to 
either grow or downsize he said 
twa owner carl icahn has said in recent months he would shrink 
or dismantle the airline unless the pilots agreed to pay cuts and 
other concessions icahn has said he would modernize and expand the 
airline if the pilots agreed 
icahn has said that 10 percent pay cuts and other concessions 
would save the airline 80 million a year 
hoar said the moves were being forced by pilots resistance he 
said union leaders kent scott and bill compton had made misleading 
statements about twas financial condition to create panic in the 
ranks and build support for an employee buyout 
these ambitious pilots have decided that they want to control 
twa and will go to almost any length to attain that goal he 
wrote in the letter dated friday 
scott on tuesday called hoars comments ridiculous its 
pure fantasy and an obvious divisive tactic he said the pilots 
union had never been interested in buying the airline in its 
current financial situation 
twa whose hub is in st louis lost 2985 million last year 
largely because of burdensome interest payments on its 27 billion 
in debt the airline lost 143 million in the first three months of 
1990 
hoars letter said twa would end service to seven cities and 
reduce its flight schedule by 7 percent on oct 1 the seven cities 
have not yet been identified but scott said they probably would 
include nassau and freeport in the bahamas and syracuse ny 
hoar also said the airline would sell four jets two boeing 
747s one lockheed l1011 and one boeing 727 by the end of june 
at least four more boeing 727s will be sold in the next quarter he 
said 
twa previously had announced it was eliminating the two 747s and 
the l1011 from its fleet but didnt say when the 727s are among 
a group of 20 that the airline put on the market earlier this month 
hoar said twa still was trying to find buyers for the other 15 
727s he also confirmed that the airline was negotiating to sell 
gates and operating slots at laguardia airport in new york and 
national airport in washington dc 
twa will not need all of its gates and slots at those airports 
after it cuts back its flight operation in october he said 
this is not the direction i want to see twa going and more 
importantly it is not what has to be hoar wrote we can 
stabilize and grow this company together 
hoar said the company planned to obtain new jets to replace its 
old ones if the union would help reduce overhead and improve 
efficiency 
twa which is based in mount kisco ny has been negotiating 
for several months to acquire 70 airbus industrie a320s but will 
not complete the deal without concessions hoar said 
twa also has talked with mcdonnell douglas corp and several 
leasing companies about adding more md80s to its fleet and has 
determined that some jets will be available within a few months he 
said 
hoar also said twa was looking at other possibilities for 
strengthening its competitive position including building or 
buying a hub in the eastern united states merging with another 
airline or buying another airline adding domestic and 
international flights from st louis and expanding into the soviet 
union eastern europe and the pacific

president bush today barred new oil leasing 
off much of california and florida the north atlantic coast 
washington and oregon until after the year 2000 
further steps to protect the environment are needed he said 
bush also canceled planned government oil lease sales in an area 
stretching south from san francisco to monterey bay and said he 
would permanently block any drilling in a 2200squaremile 
proposed marine sanctuary that lies within that region 
however bush said tracts in the santa maria basin and santa 
barbara channel of southern california would be available for 
leasing consideration at the beginning of 1996 if studies show the 
environment can be protected there 
southern california is the only area involved in bushs decision 
today where oil drilling is now going on 
the combined effect of these decisions is that the coast of 
southwest florida and more than 99 percent of the california coast 
will be off limits to oil and gas leasing and development until 
after the year 2000 bush said 
lisa speer senior staff scientist for the natural resources 
defense council called bushs decision a major step in the right 
direction but she said it falls short in several crucial 
respects 
environmentalists want a permanent ban imposed on offshore 
drilling spear complained that bush did not address some areas 
where lease sales are upcoming including the midatlantic coast 
north carolina new jersey alaskas bristol bay and northern 
florida 
in the case of florida where the government already has sold 73 
leases to oil firms in an area off the florida keys bush said he 
is directing interior secretary manuel lujan to begin a process 
that may lead to the buyback and cancellation of existing 
leases 
further he said any development after the year 2000 would be 
pursued only if it appears viable based on the guiding principles 
of environmental protection energy needs and significant potential 
for oil production 
we will work with the state of florida to buy back existing 
leases in the eastern gulf of mexico off the southern tip of 
floria said lujan 
barry a williamson director of the departments minerals 
management service estimated the lease buybacks would cost between 
100 million and 200 million 
republican gov bob martinez of florida previously has rejected 
any state responsibility to buy back leases sold by the federal 
government 
along the new england coast bush announced a delay that 
administration officials already had signaled he said a sale of 
leases in the georges bank area east of cape cod mass will be 
canceled until at least 2000 
this will allow time for additional studies to determine the 
resource potential of the area and address the environmental and 
scientific concerns which have been raised bush said in his 
statement 
georges bank an underwater plateau that is about 175 miles long 
and lies 50 to 150 miles east of cape cod is one of the worlds 
richest fisheries congress has protected the region from oil 
drilling for the past several years by imposing moratoriums 
earlier this year representatives of washington and oregon 
federal agencies and indian tribes negotiated an agreement that 
would cancel a northwestern lease sale planned for 1992 and call 
for about seven years of environmental studies 
they submitted the agreement to lujan the administration had 
not formally responded before today 
in california bushs longawaited decision calls for canceling 
all planned government sales in northern california and in 
southern california south of the santa barbara channel so new 
oceanographic and scocioeconomic studies can be conducted these 
areas could not be considered for new leases until after 2000 
the decision closely follows the recommendation of a task force 
bush appointed to study the oil exploration question last year it 
recommended that more studies be conducted in california and 
florida before new oilproducing activity be allowed 
bush said he had received the report of the interagency outer 
continental shelf task force on leasing and development off the 
coasts of florida and califronia and had accepted its 
recommendation that futher steps to protect the environment are 
needed 
although the task force was not charged with studying oregon and 
washington and the georges bank the administration expanded the 
decision to include those regions 
the interior department estimated the total potential oil 
resources for the areas affected by the decision at 82 million 
barrels with proven reserves of 26 million barrels 
bush also announced he will revise the process by which the 
government conducts offshore leasing to 
more carefully target areas with truly promising resource 
potential 
ensure environmental protection where oil drilling is allowed 
take into account the concerns and needs of local areas 
affected by offshore development 
the administration will propose congressional legislation to 
give local communities more of a voice in the plans for oil 
development off their coasts and to provide them with a greater 
share of the financial benefits of new development 
bush postponed announcing a decision on oilleasing in the wake 
of a recent massive tanker spill off galveston texas a norwegian 
tanker was rocked by an explosion june 8 spilling 39 million 
gallons of oil it created a 30mile oil slick some 18 miles 
offshore most of it was skimmed off burned or evapaorated 
the entire florida congressional delegation and most of the 
california delegation have urged delays in new leasing republicans 
were especially sensitive to political fallout likely from any 
decision to open new oildrilling regions in an election year

some 50 shareholders in t boone pickens private 
investment firm arrived tuesday to join the texas oilman and 
takeover strategist in his battle with the japanese business 
establishment 
officially the fight is for managerial control of koito 
manufacturing co an auto parts company affiliated with japans 
largest automaker toyota motor corp 
pickens firm boone co owns the largest share in koito and 
pickens has been demanding among other things a corresponding 
share of seats on its board of directors 
pickens and 52 other americans own 26 percent of koitos 16036 
million outstanding shares they will face their japanese 
counterparts thursday in an annual shareholders meeting at koitos 
headquarters in central tokyo 
the fight has come to symbolize to some americans the trials 
faced by investors in japan at a time when many japanese companies 
are buying us businesses and property 
the clash also reflects fundamental differences in how americans 
and japanese conduct business and accumulate wealth it is one of 
the cases raised by some us officials in urging japan to reform 
its economic policies to encourage more foreign trade and 
investment 
in current talks on reforms in both economies japan has 
promised to crack down on collusive business practices conducted by 
keiretsu 
keiretsu are corporate families bound by mutual shareholdings 
and other financial ties and by cooperative business strategies 
many japanese believe that keiretsu are crucial to japans entire 
justintime system of production and supply in which parts are 
delivered as needed not stockpiled into costly inventories 
koito belongs to the keiretsu surrounding toyota the auto 
company is its second largest shareholder after boone co with 
about 20 percent of koitos shares it also buys about half the 
auto lighting equipment koito sells 
critics such as pickens say the keiretsu tend to exclude 
outsiders especially foreigners they also say the bigname 
companies at the top of the manufacturing pyramid squeeze their 
smaller subcontractors mercilessly and deprive shareholders of 
their fair share of profits 
while americans have acquired a taste for many japanese 
products keiretsu is one thing we will never accept pickens 
told reporters tuesday 
of course there are people who claim that keiretsu are a 
major part of japanese culture and that the rest of the world 
should just accept it he said i disagree a keiretsu is a 
cartel is a cartel is a cartel whatever you call it its wrong 
pickens says he resorted to a public campaign against koitos 
management after top executives of koito toyota and other major 
japanese firms refused to meet with him or accept his proposals 
give me a chance is that an unusual request he said 
take me to the backroom i cant get into the backroom he 
added responding to suggestions that he take a less 
confrontational approach in dealing with japanese business 
koito officials accuse pickens of acting as a front for japanese 
investor kitaro watanabe who they say has twice tried to greenmail 
them 
greenmailers buy large amounts of a companys stock in an effort 
to force the company to buy the shares back at a premium to 
maintain control 
pickens does not deny he may have a relationship with watanabe 
but he refuses to disclose any details of the financing involved in 
his purchase of the koito shares from watanabe 
shareholders on thursday will vote on pickens request for four 
seats on koitos 20member board and his proposals for an 
antigreenmail resolution an annual statement on whether koito has 
engaged in anticompetitive activities an annual shareholder vote 
on salary and retirement benefits of board members an annual 
report on pricing policies a further increase in the dividend and 
an accounting of what pickens suggests amounts to an illegal slush 
fund 
pickens said he had received proxies from more than half of 
individual koito shareholders who hold a total of about 4 million 
shares in the company indicating support for his proposals 
koitos board has rejected all pickens proposals as unnecessary

as the clock winds down on donald trumps immediate 
financial problems the flamboyant landlord and developer faces a 
possibly much more lasting problem how to win back japanese 
investors 
japanese doctors businessmen even wellpaid stewardesses flush 
with savings and land riches from skyhigh japanese real estate 
prices led a wave of investment in condominiums and other small 
properties in the united states during recent years 
trump was one of many who exploited the trend attracting 
japanese funds to help finance his purchases of apartment 
buildings hotels and casinos he also has cashed in on the 
notorious japanese preference for brandname goods 
but tokyo real estate agents say an increasing number of 
investors are repelled by trumps highly publicized financial and 
marital troubles his disparaging comments about japan and most 
of all high prices for trump condomiums in the depressed new york 
market 
the value of trump is going down said wataru iwamura a 
sales representative for overseas projects at haseko corp the firm 
is a japanese developer and seller of condominiums and a sales 
agent for trump properties 
i think it started from the divorce thing now they are 
talking about bankruptcy he said besides trump is not saying 
good things about japan that does not help at all 
not all agents agree some say japanese will continue to buy his 
properties for their prime locations regardless of what happens to 
his family life and personal fortune 
trump has touted his properties in japan in person in print and 
on the water in addition to taking out japaneselanguage print 
advertising he appeared in person at a tokyo hotel to promote his 
properties and sent his plush yacht the trump princess cruising 
for a buyer through japanese waters the yacht left without taking 
down its forsale sign 
trump also has tapped japanese banks for financing a report in 
the nippon keizai shimbun japans premier financial newspaper 
claimed trump owed a third of his debts to japanese banks 
it was not only relentless selfpromotion that drew japanese 
investors to trumps properties some agents say 
when he built trump tower at the same time japanese were 
putting their money into condominiums and trump had good 
condominiums said seishi matsuo general manager of the 
international marketing department of kyodo advertising co the 
company is publisher of a magazine for investors in overseas 
property 
japanese are looking for location at the trump tower the 
trump parc the location is very good said hisao yamamoto vice 
president of house port seiyo a brokerage that handles trump 
properties 
brokers said the slump in the new york real estate market 
rather than trumps problems has sent wouldbe japanese buyers 
looking for more promising buys in other parts of the united 
states such as seattle and california 
interest in europe also is growing with the approach of german 
unification the 1992 common market consolidation and the 1992 
olympics in barcelona spain 
but even if the new york real estate market recovers some 
japanese buyers will not be interested in the trump brand name at 
current prices trump palace condominums start at 350000 for a 
studio or about the same price as a one or twobedroom apartment 
in some other manhattan buildings 
the japanese are studying the us real estate they learned 
that trump property is quite expensive compared to other 
property said masayuki kusunoki of nomura real estate 
development co 
but there is a bright side for wouldbe investors 
hes in a bad position now so maybe investors could take 
advantage of it iwamura said

japanese and us officials agreed to extend trade 
talks after failing tuesday to reach final agreement on substantial 
economic changes aimed at narrowing the trade imbalance between the 
countries 
the meetings originally were scheduled to end tuesday were 
extended as negotiators struggled to resolve differences over 
specific strategies to dismantle structural trade barriers 
we would have to be extremely efficient to finish the talks 
wednesday a senior japanese official said speaking anonymously 
we have received many comments from the us side on the contents 
of our report and will have to work on it 
on tuesday second day of the talks us and japanese 
negotiators discussed japanese pricing mechanisms and american 
shortfalls in savings and investment that hurt the competitiveness 
of us industries 
us officials at the talks said they explained efforts to 
tackle the us federal budget deficit which is seen as one reason 
for a shortfall in investment in us industry 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said they 
told the japanese that washington wants to look beyond eliminating 
the budget deficit by 1993 and to envision a budget surplus 
officials on both sides described the discussions as cooperative 
nonetheless at the end of two days of intensive talks the two 
sides failed to reach agreement on any of the areas under 
discussion including the level of japans spending on public 
works officials said 
public spending and other basic economic policies are among many 
topics in the socalled structural impediments initiative talks 
launched last year 
japanese and us negotiators agreed on an interim report in 
april that both sides said represented major progress they have 
since been finetuning a final report on the talks 
on tuesday officials first discussed reasons why japan tends to 
have higher prices than the united states on similar products 
they later dealt with problems on the us side including the 
budget deficit low savings and investment rates excessive 
consumption low competitiveness of us products and poor training 
of us workers 
our position is that the us side also has some tasks 
foreign ministry spokesman taizo watanabe said 
officials said they were still debating japans proposals on 
easing restrictions on opening large retail stores revising land 
use policies to curb high real estate prices speeding up 
processing of patent applications cracking down on allegedly 
unfair business practices by corporate groups and simplifying 
complicated pricing mechanisms all the measures are thought likely 
to increase foreign opportunities for trade and investment in japan 
the most difficult issue however was expected to be tokyos 
plan to boost spending on public infrastructure such as roads 
parks and sewers an increase in such spending is expected to boost 
imports of construction products and counter japans high savings 
rate 
the two countries disagreed over how high the increase should 
be with the americans asking for 500 trillion yen or 322 
trillion over the next 10 years japanese officials indicated they 
favored spending between 400 trillion and 415 trillion yen or 
258 trillion to 268 trillion 
last year japanese sales in the united states exceeded us 
sales in japan by 49 billion

sell heavily 
the contract for august delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude oil dropped 24 cents to 1714 a 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange it had lost 8

pattern with activity winding down before the fourth of july 
holiday 
it sort of drifted lower out of neglect tagler said

closed tuesday the report was expected to show a bearish buildup 
in stocks combined with a modest drawdown 
speculation about what might occur at a possible emergency 
meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting countries on 
july 5 made traders reluctant to sell heavily the possibility that 
the cartel might undertake measures to lift the slumping oil market

motorola inc said tuesday it plans to build a 
satellitebased cellular phone system that will connect users with 
telephones anywhere in the world 
the system could supplement conventional phone service in 
nations where it is poor such as in eastern europe and provide 
mobile phone service in rural areas where it is not offered 
motorola officials said 
target users include traveling business people passengers of 
ships and aircraft disasterrelief workers and residents of 
underdeveloped nations 
the system called iridium would use a network of 77 satellites 
that would receive calls from handheld telephones resembling 
todays cellular phones the phones would cost as low as 3000 
compared with about 400 for todays cheapest cellular phones 
motorola said 
the electronics company said it would launch test satellites in 
1992 and expected full service to be available as soon as 1996 
we see the potential of iridium as nothing short of 
revolutionary john f mitchell a motorola vice chairman told 
reporters at a news conference 
but the system faces several obstacles motorola needs 
regulatory approval to operate the satellites from various 
government groups worldwide it also must come up with the 23 
billion it says it will cost to build the system 
motorola says it wants to take on four or five partners that 
each would provide funding in exchange for a stake in the venture 
in addition it is envisioned that several of these partners would 
be satellite operators that already have the necessary government 
operating authority 
the partners have not been selected but motorola said it has 
signed agreements with three satellite operators to explore 
constructing the system american mobile satellite corp of 
washington dc international maritime satellite organization of 
london and telesat mobile inc of canada 
these three satellite groups may become partners in iridium 
said durrell w hillis a motorola vice president who heads the 
satellite effort 
motorola also said it is negotiating with other potential 
partners including great britains principal phone company 
british telecommunications plc and organizations in australia 
hong kong and japan 
iridium would be connected to existing phone networks however 
customers probably would not want to use iridium phones to make 
local cellular calls in areas served by existing groundbased 
systems because the cost per iridium call would be much greater 
hillis said 
in addition iridium phones would not be compatible with 
existing or planned groundbased cellular phone networks so users 
could not tap into these networks directly by bypassing the 
expensive satellite system 
as a result iridium customers probably would need to carry two 
cellular phones while traveling that could provide a huge 
potential new market for motorola which already is the worlds 
largest maker of cellular phones 
the schaumburg illbased company also would make the 
communications gear for the satellites and the computerized control 
sytstems that would operate them 
hillis said motorola knows of no other similar system in the 
works 
john pemberton an analyst with the research firm gartner group 
of stamford conn said american telephone amp telegraph co is 
believed to be working on plans for a satellitebased cellular 
phone system that would use two giant satellites fixed in position 
over the earth the iridium satellites would orbit the planet 
pemberton said he was impressed with motorolas plans and called 
them achievable however he said he believed the system would need 
more than 77 satellites to provide sufficient capacity 
the iridium system under development since late 1987 would 
operate like a cellular phone network in the sky passing calls 
from one to the other as do the transmission towers located in each 
cell of a groundbased cellular phone network 
the satellites would be located 413 nautical miles above the 
earth considered a low orbit for satellites the low orbit would 
allow the use of small handheld phones with tiny antennas rather 
than the satellite dishes required to beam signals to existing 
satellites 
the satellites would pass a call around the globe to the 
intended recipient if the recipient has an iridium phone he would 
receive the call directly otherwise the call would connect with a 
conventional landbased phone system to be completed 
each iridium user would be given a personal telephone number 
for someone to reach a user they would simply dial the number and 
would not have to know the users location motorola said 
iridium named after the 77th element on the periodic table 
would not have the capacity to replace conventional cellular phone 
systems in urban areas hillis said 
motorola has extensive experience in satellite and outerspace 
communications it made the communications equipment for every us 
space mission hillis said

in the second such request to a network this 
month continental cablevision inc asked cbs on tuesday if it 
could become the first cable affiliate in cbs history and serve 
concord nh 
cbs has no comment on the request said cbs spokeswoman 
susan tick in los angeles where the networks top executives are 
attending the annual cbs affiliates convention this week 
last week telecommunications inc the nations largest cable 
system operator asked nbc to let its systems become nbc affiliates 
in some cities that have no nbcaffiliated broadcast station 
however that cable company didnt specify which cities it had 
in mind nbc cable and business development president thomas s 
rogers said nbc didnt think tcis request was serious a tci 
official said it was 
frank anthony senior vicepresident for continental the 
nations fourthlargest cable operation said his companys cbs 
proposal wasnt prompted by tcis earlier action but it helped 
us crystallize our thinking 
our proposal is much more specific he added were 
talking about a distinct market which does not have a cbs affiliate 
in it 
new hampshire is among states with a higherthanaverage number 
of cable households according to ac nielsen co estimates 62 
percent of its 410000 television households have cable 
cbs broadcasts received in concord now come from cbs affiliates 
whdhtv in boston and wgmetv in portland me anthony said 
concord briefly had a cbsaffiliated uhf station in 1988 but that 
outlet went out of business he said 
he said his bostonbased company asked to become cbs affiliate 
in concord because of the networks strength its solid news 
operation and because cbs had already recognized the concord 
market as being somewhat underserved 
if its request were granted continental wouldnt drop the 
boston and portland affiliate signals from its concord cable 
operation he said 
but as a local cbs affiliate that operation deriving its 
income from local advertising and cable subscriptions would 
function as does as an overtheair cbs affiliate 
that includes payments from cbs for carrying the networks 
shows anthony said 
although cbs officials declined comment on continentals 
request it is doubtful they would grant it 
among other things they have repeatedly said their company has 
no interest in cable and that cbs core business is broadcasting 
anthony who said continental has yet to receive a reply from 
cbs said network affiliation requests from cable companies could 
become commonplace 
i think they could he said but i think for cbs or 
anybody else to consider them they need to be serious proposals 
to serve markets that dont now have networkaffiliated stations of 
their own

with july at 285 a bushel wheat futures were cent to 3 cents

traders took their cues largely from the national weather 
services latest sixto10day outlook which predicts normal

during the first half of next week 
those conditions would be ideal for crop development after 
farmers complete their soybean planting in the hot dry weather

mostly dry 90plusdegree weather headed for the midwest this week

standard amp poors corp on tuesday downgraded 
its ratings of several types of debt of chase manhattan corp the 
nations secondlargest banking company 
two weeks ago moodys investors service inc the other major 
creditrating agency downgraded chases debt ratings other major 
banks including citicorp the nations largest also have seen 
their credit ratings downgraded in recent weeks due to concern over 
the softening economy 
in the latest action sampp said it downgraded about 75 billion 
worth of chase debt securities and preferred stock including 
senior debt subordinated debt and commercial paper the action 
involves securities issued by chase itself and several subsidiaries 
a lower credit rating can force a bank to pay more interest on 
its securities increasing its cost of borrowing 
the downgrades reflect sampps expectation that loan quality 
particularly in the real estate areas will deteriorate 
significantly sampp said in a statement moodys also cited 
concern over real estate debt for its downgradings 
sampp said chases profitability has been weak due to low business 
volume in wholesale banking although the recently announced plan 
to cut 300 million of expenses should go a long way toward 
remedying the problem 
it also said chases reserves for domestic loans are thin 
thus while the company has successfully navigated through 
ldcrelated difficulties it is not as well prepared to deal with a 
new wave of problems domestically it said referring to third 
world debt 
it said the concerns are partially offset by chases addition of 
1 billion in capital since september through an equity issue and 
dividend reinvestment plan the banks highly profitable consumer 
banking operations also provide some stability it said 
chase spokesman steve rautenberg said were disappointed 
particularly in light of our capitalbuilding activities over the 
past two quarters

president bush on tuesday blocked new oil 
drilling off the coasts of much of california florida washington 
oregon and new england until at least the year 2000 
in addition he permanently blocked any drilling in a proposed 
marine sanctuary in californias monterey bay and ordered a 
moratorium on new leases until 1996 for one section off southern 
california where drilling already is under way 
my desire is to achieve a balance between the need to provide 
energy for the american people and the need to protect unique and 
sensitive coastal and marine environments bush said in a written 
statement announcing his longpending decision 
the president called for more environmental studies to settle 
the question of whether leases might be offered after 2000 
the electionyear ban was likely to come as a relief to 
republican candidates in both california and florida who were 
concerned about possible negative voter reaction to new drilling in 
a year that has seen a steady parade of oil spill news stories 
but the announcement fell somewhat short of what 
environmentalists were hoping for a permanent ban on offshore 
drilling they contend is the only way to protect sensitive 
environmental regions and beaches 
based in large part on the recommendations of an interagency 
task force he appointed to study the california and florida coastal 
drilling prospects bush announced he is suspending until at least 
2000 any new leases to oil companies in federal waters off 
northern california 11 million acres off mendocino and 
humboldt counties 
southern california 67 million acres south of the santa 
barbara channel to the mexican border not included are the santa 
barbara channel and the santa maria basin where drilling is under 
way bush said he would delay new leases until at least 1996 
pending further study in those areas 
central california from san francisco south to monterey bay 
originally scheduled for a lease auction next march bush further 
permanently barred oil exploration in the monterey bay national 
marine sanctuary 
southern florida 14 million acres off collier monroe and dade 
counties in the gulf of mexico 
new england 128 million acres of georges bank off cape cod 
an important fishing ground vigorously defended by massachusetts 
officials and believed to far more likely to contain natural gas 
than oil 
washington and oregon where state and federal agencies 
recently agreed that further environmental studies are needed 
the white house said that the moratorium could be suspended in 
the event of external events such as supply disruptions 
prompting environmental groups to complain that a loophole had been 
built in 
but white house spokesman steve hart said that the intention was 
only to protect against a dramatic interruption in the nations oil 
supply like the 1973 embargo by arab producers 
we dont anticipate theres going to be any gas lines and we 
dont anticipate just scrapping the whole thing i believe that we 
can handle it interior secretary manuel lujan told reporters 
the california and florida areas probably contain 13 billion 
barrels to 28 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 75 to 160 days 
of consumption and 22 trillion cubic feet of gas about a 42day 
supply according to a white house fact sheet figures were not 
given for the other areas 
in the florida area oil companies already have purchased 73 
leases that could not be worked while bush was studying the issue 
it may cost 200 million to buy them back officials have said 
the president announced that he is directing lujan to begin 
discussions with the state for a joint federalstate repurchase 
effort 
in a statement in san francisco chevron oil co said initial 
reports of bushs decision indicated the presidents actions seem 
to go too far 
but we certainly realize there is great concern by the 
american public over this issue and were anxious to see the 
various parties to the offshore development controversy work 
together to find longterm solutions that will 
need for a sound us energy policy and for protection of the 
environment the company said 
bush said he believes there are significant offshore areas 
where we casatisfy both then and must go forward with resource development 
he did not say what areas he was referring to but his 
administration has indicated it will go forward in alaska and the 
longproductive gulf of mexico where bush himself pioneered 
offshore drilling many years ago 
bush also said he is implementing an overhaul of the leasing 
system to include rigorous scrutiny of potential oil yields 
before any leasing occurs assurance that drilling and exploration 
practices will not pose a risk to unique natural resources 
priority for development in the regions with the highest potential 
yield and a study of national security needs 
members of congress from new york and new jersey complained that 
the atlantitruth and were all now going to 
have to pay the price for that dukakis said in boston 
democratic party chairman ron brown said bushs statement was 
candid and sober and gives no one comfort its no time for 
partisan gloating 
budget talks are scheduled to resume wednesday and the white 
house expressed hope for a final agreement by the august 
congressional recess 
bush issued his statement after a breakfast session with top 
congressional leaders and following a weekend of meetings between 
democrats and white house budget negotiators 
it is clear to me bush said that both the size of the 
deficit problem and the need for a package that can be enacted 
require all of the following 
he listed tax revenue increases cuts in spending for 
federal benefits as well as reductions in other domestic and 
defense programs reform of the budget process and growth 
incentives a term often used to describe a cut in the capital 
gains tax rate 
bush asked about his statement as he left a photo session said 
the written statement speaks for itself and declined to 
specifically address reporters questions about his position 
i want to see this economy grow he said i want jobs i 
want to see the deficit down and this bipartisan statement speaks 
for itself now were going on to some serious negotiation 
he hailed congressional democrats for the good faith spirit 
of the budget talks and said it was essential that these talks 
get moving 
from the outset of the budget talks bush had said that 
everything was on the table for negotiation 
until now however he had refused to say explicitly that tax 
increases must be included in the deficitreduction formula 
the white house refused to acknowledge that bush had scrapped 
his nonewtaxes pledge 
are you crazy fitzwater goodnaturedly asked reporters 
however fitzwater said bushs statement amounted to a 
refinement of his earlier remarks 
weve got to deal realistically with this problem he said 
on the other hand fitzwater said i dont think that it 
bushs statement is that big a change were still a long way 
from the final details of a settlement 
there is a general consensus among budget negotiators that they 
need to reduce the deficit by 45 billion to 60 billion in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 and about 400 billion to 600 billion 
over the next five years 
technically the grammrudman deficit reduction law would 
require far deeper cuts based on current revenue and spending 
projections by law the government will be forced to absorb deep 
acrosstheboard spending cuts unless the deficit is kept to 74 
billion in fiscal 1991

a house subcommittee voted tuesday to give 
federal judges more discretion to dismiss as frivolous some civil 
suits under the nations antiracketeering laws 
on a unanimous vote the judiciary committees 10member 
subcommittee on crime approved legislation that would narrow the 
definition of racketeering in civil suits to exclude ordinary 
commercial disputes and contract cases 
ordinary businessmen are being branded as racketeers simply 
because they have become embroiled in a commercial dispute said 
rep frederick boucher dva the bills chief sponsor 
the bill would revise the 1970 racketeer influence and corrupt 
organizations act rico to effectively deny plaintiffs in many 
civil suits the ability to recover triple they amount of damages 
they incurred 
under the legislation a judge would be required to dismiss a 
civil rico suit if a defendant had not been convicted of criminal 
racketeering or if the judge could not find that triple damages 
were warranted because of the magnitude of the injuries 
boucher called the current statute one of the most abused 
provisions of federal law having made its way into domestic 
disputes between spouses inheritance disputs among family members 
disagreements among church members and litigation involving 
landlords and tenants 
the bill would apply the new proposed gatekeeper provisions 
retroactively to some 1500 currently pending civil suits on a 64 
vote the committee defeated an amendment by rep john conyers 
dmich to deny retroactivity 
supporters of the failed amendment said it was needed to 
preserve the rico suit of some 23000 bondholders who lost 200 
million in the parent company of lincoln savings and loan 
association against the thrifts owner phoenix financier charles 
h keating jr and his associates 
given the inherent ambiguities in the gatekeeper provision 
there is no assurance that a judge will not later on deprive my 
clients of a meritorious verdict the bondholders attorney 
william lerach said in a letter to the subcommittee 
to give charles keating and ferdinand marcos another bite of 
the apple is ridiculous said subcommittee member chuck douglas 
rnh referring to another suit now pending against the estate of 
the deceased former dictator of the philippines 
making the changes retroactive also was opposed by the state 
attorneys general and state insurance commissioners 
the senate judiciary committee last january removed a 
retroactivity provision from a similar bill written by sen dennis 
deconcini dariz one of five senators under investigation by the 
senate ethics committees over their involvement with keating 
rather than give judges more discretion to dismiss civil rico 
suits the senate bill would simply eliminate triple damages except 
in cases brought by the government

the former chairman and three top executives 
of midwest federal savings and loan were indicted tuesday on 
federal fraud and conspiracy charges involving financial losses 
sustained by the failed thrift 
us attorney general dick thornburgh announced the 40count 
indictment returned by a federal grand jury 
this indictment is a further demonstration of our 
determination to pursue serious allegations against savings and 
loan ripoff artists across the united states thornburgh said 
midwest federal which had assets of 35 billion is being 
liquidated by the government at an expected cost of 1 billion the 
thrift was about 1 billion in debt when it was seized by 
regulators in february 1989 
indicted were chairman harold w greenwood jr charlotte e 
masica former executive vice president and managing officer 
donald j snede former senior vice president and chief financial 
officer and robert a mampel former executive assistant to the 
chairman 
resolution trust corp the federal agency created to bail out 
the nations failing thrifts put midwest up for sale in april the 
sampl has 30 branches in minnesota nine in iowa eight in oklahoma 
and two in california 
greenwood mampel masica and greenwoods daughter former 
midwest federal vice president susan greenwood olson were ousted 
when the savings and loan was declared insolvent and seized by 
regulators 
greenwood olson was indicted in march on 10 fraud counts 
involving 15 million in loans to the jockey club marina and resort 
in miami prosecutors allege the loans far exceeded the value of 
the resort and that false documents were drafted to hide mdwest 
federals shaky financial condition 
much of tuesdays indictment centered on midwest federals ties 
with green tree acceptance inc a st paulbased company that 
finances mobile homes 
in early 1987 greenwood masica and snede hid from regulators a 
47 million shortfall in finance income expected from a 15 
billion portfolio of mobile home loans the indictment alleges 
midwest had purchased the loan service rights to the portfolio from 
green tree for 188 million 
the executives also inflated the thrifts net worth and made 
unsound loans to delinquent borrowers to avoid writeoffs so as to 
preserve their bonuses the indictment said 
the indictment also charges the four with misapplying funds to 
pay for personal airline flights and club memberships and to pay 
excessive levels of compensation to themselves and lend 
themselves money without proper approval 
regulators say deposits at midwest federal have dropped 10 
percent since the takeover as of may 31 the thrifts retail 
deposits were about 19 billion 
gov rudy perpich has tried to distance himself from greenwood 
who was one of perpichs biggest campaign contributors before the 
sampl collapsed the democratic governor was granted use of midwests 
corporate jet and perpich had appointed greenwood to the 
metropolitan airports commission and the greater minnesota corp 
board 
perpich said monday he had no business dealings with midwest and 
that the state does not regulate savings and loans 
william mauzy attorney for greenwood said the indictment was 
a republican prosecutors attempt to blame a high profile 
democrat he said greenwoods actions were never fraudulent
