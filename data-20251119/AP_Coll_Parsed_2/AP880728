syndicated columnist carl t rowan will face 
weapons possession charges after shooting a teenager who had taken 
an unauthorized predawn dip in rowans backyard swimming pool the 
washington post reported thursday night 
the post said in its friday editions that rowan was charged with 
possession of an unregistered handgun and unregistered ammunition 
in district of columbia superior court on wednesday 
mary layton director of communications for the dc government 
told the associated press that officials refused to comment on the 
the case until friday when a statement will be issued 
rowan 62 was cleared of assault charges in the case on june 23 
after an investigation by the us attorneys office 
us attorney jay stephens said at the time that he believed 
rowan should be prosecuted for possessing an unregistered handgun 
but stephens deferred that decision to the city which normally 
decides whether to prosecute such cases 
rowan who has frequently written columns calling for strict 
restrictions on handgun use was out of town and unavailable for 
comment 
his wife vivian said the couple had no knowledge of the 
charges against rowan 
the post said it had been told by beverly burke a spokeswoman 
for the dc office of corporation counsel which under local law 
has the authority to prosecute cases involving unregistered 
firearms that rowan was charged on wednesday 
the shooting renewed debate on handgun restrictions as progun 
groups accused rowan of hypocrisy for owning a gun after publicly 
opposing the practice rowan said he obtained the weapon after 
receiving death threats 
if convicted on the charges the columnist faces a maximum 
penalty of two years in jail and a 2000 fine in connection with 
the june 14 incident at his northwest washington home 
the district of columbias 1976 handgun ordinance requires that 
all weapons be registered but rowan told authorities that the gun 
had belonged to his son carl jr a former fbi agent rowan 
claimed that his son was told he did not have to register the 
weapon after leaving the fbi 
rowan told authorities that he shot benjamin smith 18 of chevy 
chase md after hearing noises in his back yard calling police 
and discovering smith and three other youths by his pool 
rowan said he shot smith after the teenager lunged at him 
smith disputed that saying he did not threaten the columnist and 
was shot while trying to flee 
smith who was wounded in the wrist was treated and released 
the same day from georgetown university hospital he and and a 
companion were each charged with one count of unlawful entry 
stemming from their foray onto rowans property but prosecutors 
dropped the misdemeanor charges in exchange for 40 hours of 
community service work from both

george bush stepped up his search for a vice presidential 
running mate wednesday inviting former rival jack kemp and other 
prominent republicans o submit detailed background information 
democratic candidate michael dukakis burnished his lawandorder 
credentials 
several other republicans who figure prominently in vice 
presidential speculation have not yet received questionnaires from 
bush according to their spokesmen 
bush who has about three weeks left to pick a running mate for 
the fall campaign also disclosed plans to testify before the 
republican platform committee when it meets the week before the 
partys convention in new orleans early next month 
republican sources said a request for background information had 
gone out to sen pete domenici of new mexico as well as to kemp 
and new hampshire gov john sununu said he had received a 
questionnaire from bush campaign officials 
an aide for kemp said the congressman met with robert kimmitt a 
washington attorney who is helping the bush campaign filter 
possible running mates the aide marci robinson said the new york 
congressman would return the material to the bush campaign within a 
week 
meanwhile dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
lambasted the republican for opposing the equal rights amendment 
and other womens concerns 
the reaganbush administration opposes the era they ripped 
it out of the republican platform he told the national 
federation of business and professional women meeting in 
albuquerque nm he said that despite bushs call last week for 
tax credits for day care the administration fought every step of 
the way against a 50 million spending proposal with the same 
goal 
dukakis boosted by his own partys convention drew his biggest 
lead of the presidential campaign 18 points over bush in the 
latest nbc newswall street journal poll 
dukakis spent his day in boston ostensibly tending to 
massachusetts statehouse duties but staging a billsigning ceremony 
for legislation to add about 1000 beds to state prisons and to 
restore child pornography legislation that was struck down by the 
state supreme court 
he also announced distribution of 78 million in state and 
federal grants to assist the victims of crime and said his state 
is a national leader in increasing sensitivity and awareness of 
what it is like to be a victim of crime dukakis also cited a 13 
percent drop in crime in his state in the past four years 
dukakis public events during the day seemed designed to counter 
the republican charge that he is soft on crime particularly in 
view of his onetime support for a prison furlough program that 
permitted some firstdegree murderers to receive passes one such 
prisoner raped a maryland woman while on furlough 
dukakis also signed a 124 million spending plan to close the 
books on the fiscal year that ended june 30 the money was largely 
for underfunded entitlement programs such as medicaid and aid to 
families with dependent children 
aides to bush meanwhile have said he is conducting polling in 
several key states to gauge the impact of several potential running 
mates in addition to kemp the names mentioned most frequently in 
the speculation include senate republican leader bob dole and 
california gov george deukmejian several womens names also crop 
up periodically including sen nancy kassebaum of kansas and 
doles wife elizabeth a former secretary of transportation 
aides to sen dole deukmejian former tennessee gov lamar 
alexander rep lynn martin of illinois and sens richard lugar of 
indiana and alan simpson of wyoming all said they had not received 
questionnaires 
bush campaign officials declined to say how seriously candidates 
such as sununu and domenici were being taken although there was 
speculation that at least some names were being made public to mask 
the true deliberations as well as to give the officials involved 
additional stature in their states 
one man not mentioned in the speculation sen gordon humphrey 
of new hampshire held a news conference in washington to announce 
an effort designed to pressure bush into picking a conservative 
running mate 
humphrey said the coalition for a winning ticket would not be a 
stalking horse for any one candidate but a rallying point for 
conservatives who hope to persuade the vice president to choose 
someone from the conservative majority wing of the party 
as for bush campaign spokeswoman alixe glen said the vice 
president would travel to the convention city of new orleans on 
aug 8 to address the platform committee and put his stamp of 
approval on the platform the vice president isnt expected to 
return until aug 17 the day he is formally nominated as the 
partys candidate for president 
in other developments the republican national committee 
disclosed it is conducting a multimillion dollar advertising 
campaign leading up to the convention 
the three 30second commercials do not mention bush by name 
but tout seven years of jobs peace and economic growth brought 
to you by the republicans 
one commercial evokes images of the high inflation and long gas 
lines of jimmy carters presidency as the announcer says the 
republicans have worked very hard to make sure youll never have to 
see it again 
in the latest poll a telephone survey of 1770 registered 
voters conducted saturday through monday dukakis received 50 
percent support to 32 percent for bush dukakis had led by 10 
points 4636 in a preconvention nbcjournal poll 
other recent surveys have found a jump in dukakis support 
common for presidential nominees following their party conventions 
two gallup polls done after the convention had dukakis ahead by 17 
points and he led by 10 points in one poll and by 12 in another 
conducted during the convention 
the latest poll found women providing a major component of 
dukakis support a continuation of the gender gap suffered by 
bush dukakis led by 30 points among women 5424 compared to a 
sixpoint lead among men 
the survey had a margin of error of three points 
among the democrats an aide to jesse jackson said the runnerup 
to dukakis in the primary campaign is fired up and ready to 
begin active campaigning for the partys ticket a spokesman at the 
secret service said jackson would continue to receive security 
protection while a decision is made on whether to grant protection 
for the entire fall campaign 
in chicago jackson met briefly wednesday with democratic 
national committee chairman paul kirk to discuss jacksons role in 
the campaign but neither side would give details 
its part of a series of meetings to ensure ongoing 
communication with all parts of the party and to make certain 
everyone gets involved committee spokeswoman julie anbender said 
in washington 
also wednesday bush told a group of young inventors this 
election is really about you saying they and other young people 
hold the key to the 21st century 
education is the engine that drives our inventive spirit 
the vice president said reiterating his frequently sounded theme 
that he wants to be the education president

cardinal john j oconnor breaking with fellow 
peace pilgrim mayor edward i koch said wednesday that britain 
should remove its occupying forces from northern ireland 
within a reasonable time 
i cannot imagine there will be lasting peace until all 
british troops have withdrawn he told reporters as he left 
ireland after a sixday peace pilgrimage 
oconnor had said at the start of the pilgrimage that hed come 
to pray not to talk politics but the cardinal broke his silence 
after koch his pilgrimage companion reversed himself and endorsed 
the british presence in ulster 
oconnor who returned wednesday afternoon to john f kennedy 
airport called on british officials to announce a phased 
withdrawal one the cardinal said was supported by most people 
in the province 
asked if it should begin immediately oconnor replied thats 
not for me to say 
before leaving dublin on tuesday koch said a day in northern 
ireland had convinced him the british do not deserve the 
castigation that many of us myself included have heaped upon 
them the british army is not an occupation force but rather a 
guardian of peace 
the british army has patrolled northern ireland since the early 
1970s when a catholic civil rights movement came under attack by 
protestant police and paramilitary groups 
but the protestant violence also revitalized the irish 
republican army since then the primary opponents have been the 
british and the ira which wants to unite the island 
in recent years many british troops have been withdrawn and 
their duties assumed by members of ulsters army reserve 
about twothirds of northern irelands population is protestant 
and surveys indicate that a majority of the provinces residents 
including many catholics favor union with britain 
oconnor said his own 24 hours in ulster convinced him there is 
an environment of increasing understanding between catholics 
and protestants and that an overwhelming number of both want 
the troops out 
although oconnor said he based his conclusion on talks with 
protestants he did not meet with militants in either community 
during his visit 
the mayors comments drew a heated response from irishamerican 
politicians including nassau county comptroller peter king who 
called the remarks senseless and ridiculous 
oconnor was more circumspect he said he was not angry with 
koch and felt that because koch did not grow up as an 
irishamerican he failed to realize the british have been calling 
themselves peacemakers in northern ireland for centuries

the threeyear contract increases average teacher pay for the 
upcoming academic year 28 percent to 33066 more than 5000

school systems have talked about programs like this but we did 
something about it

scores of small quakes have rattled an 
aleut fishing village during the past 17 days and geologists say 
they are keeping a wary eye on the possible source a volcano 
thats been dormant for centuries 
king cove village is only nine miles from mount duttons 
4834foot peak about 1000 people live in the village during the 
summer 700 stay through winter 
aside from the earthquakes that have been jolting the community 
625 miles southwest of anchorage there have been no other signs of 
an imminent eruption said betsy yount a us geological survey 
geologist here 
theres no melting back of snow around the summit no 
steamtype vents sher said wednesday were still assessing 
the seismic activity to determine whether its related to volcanic 
activity or not 
geologists are unsure when mount dutton last erupted 
theres no historical records of its erupting that means in 
the past 200 or so years said john davies state seismologist 
and coordinating scientist for the newly formed alaska volcano 
observatory it may have erupted 500 years ago but we have no 
date clearly its erupted in the last 10000 years or so 
john taber a geologist with columbia universitys lamont 
doherty geological observatory at palisades ny said 
seismographs first picked up earthquake activity near mount dutton 
on july 11 some of the 18 instruments installed by the institute 
to monitor aleutian arc volcanic activity indicated the first 
temblors were centered 10 to 15 miles southeast of the peak he 
said 
in the last three or four days its been dying off taber 
said from the institutes sand point office theres no cause for 
concern at this point at all there was a sequence of earthquakes 
in 1984 they were smaller but they went on for about four months 
its not even unusual to have them there 
scores of quakes ranging from 10 to 36 on the richter scale 
have struck in this round the peak activity occurred friday when 
127 were recorded taber said on monday there were 25 he said 
the epicenters moved slowly toward the mount dutton and in the 
last few days the centers have been underneath the volcanos south 
flank taber said 
the temblors have jolted the nearby village regularly weve 
felt four or five in a day thats probably the most but theres 
no other sign of activity at all said cynthia samuelson city 
clerk the village on the alaska peninsula people are concerned 
but no ones leaving 
alaska division of emergency services officials had been 
scheduled to travel to king cove in september but went this week 
because of the earthquakes said jim sey the agencys chief of 
operations and planning 
the main purpose was just to answer questions make people 
aware and bring them up to date on whats happening and explain 
different things they could do if there were an eruption sey 
said 
a telephone line is being installed so that the geophysical 
institute at the university of alaskafairbanks can monitor tabers 
seismographs plus one davies recently installed on the mountains 
flank taber has been in alaska servicing his observatorys 
seismographs and plans to leave this week davies said 
the link will allow scientists in fairbanks to check the 
volcanos pulse virtually around the clock he said 
were going to monitor it as closely as we can he said

cambodias prime minister was quoted 
thursday as saying khmer rouge guerrilla delegates tried to 
obstruct agreements at talks on ending cambodias civil war 
the jakarta post quoted prime minister hun sen of the 
vietnameseinstalled government as saying he would hold a third 
round of separate peace talks with resistance leader prince norodom 
sihanouk in paris in october 
sihanouks forces are allied with the communist khmer rouge and 
son sanns khmer peoples national liberation front in a coalition 
fighting vietnamese troops that invaded cambodia in late 1978 
hun sen the guerrilla groups vietnam laos and the sixmember 
association of southeast asian nations on thursday began their 
fourth day of informal peace talks in bogor 
the jakarta post reported that hun sen said khieu samphan the 
khmer rouge representative was not forthcoming to the point of 
acting obstructive when it came to nailing down some specific 
points of agreement 
on wednesday sihanouk urged all factions to agree on a plan for 
ending the miseries and humiliations that have afflicted 
cambodia since the indochina war ended in 1975 
the enduringly popular leader who ruled cambodia until 1970 
made the remarks in jakarta where he has tried to influence 
developments in a meeting of the four factions at bogor about 40 
miles south of the capital all factions agree that sihanouk 65 
should have a central role in the future leadership 
i ask you not to leave indonesia without having signed 
together a joint communique which shall tell our people and the 
world that the four cambodian factions are at least capable to 
understand each other on certain essential points leading us 
towards the end of a long and dark tunnel sihanouk said 
evoking the glories of cambodian history he said allow me to 
recall that you all pretend to be the dignified descendants of the 
very glorious builders of the world famous monuments of angkor 
if like dignified descendants of the builders of angkor our 
four factions wish to rapidly get rid of the last vietnamese units 
from our soil they will only succeed to do so by achieving 
national reconciliation and unity 
angkor in northwestern cambodia was the capital of the khmer 
empire from the 9th century to the 15th its most imposing 
monuments are angkor wat a temple complex built in the 12th 
century by king suryavariman ii and angkor thom built about 1200 
by king jayavarman vii 
sihanouk said speaking in english that it is handy to blame 
vietnam for all cambodias troubles but it is not less true that 
some khmer cambodian factions are equally heavily responsible for 
these miseries and humilations 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 and ousted the khmer 
rouge regime of pol pot which gained control at the end of the war 
and had killed hundreds of thousands of cambodians 
more than 100000 vietnamese soldiers remain in cambodia 
fighting the resistance coalition sihanouk formerly led hanoi has 
said it will withdraw all its troops by early 1990 
the prince called for an interim government of the four factions 
under a collegial system perfectly equal and proposed that 
fighting units be kept intact under a general staff representing 
all factions each government department would have four 
coministers 
an international conference convened under the auspices of the 
un secretarygeneral would supervise withdrawal of foreign 
forces guarantee the nations neutrality and help organize free 
elections 
sihanouk resigned earlier this month as head of the resistance 
coalition and is in jakarta as a guest of president suharto which 
allows him to participate in the peace talks indirectly 
hun sen presented his own peace plan at bogor on monday and 
sihanouk said his proposals include some of its points 
i think my proposal is the most realistic he said the 
very solution is in my proposals not those of the charming hun 
sen i have to reject all other proposals in favor of mine 
he and hun sen negotiated in paris last december and january 
without finding a formula for peace 
son sann said he supported sihanouks plan but the other 
participants were not available for comment foreign minister 
nguyen co thach of vietnam told a news conference wednesday that 
working groups would be formed to prepare for further negotiations 
no conclusive agreement had been expected from the bogor 
conference which was considered a success for merely taking place

back in 1936 republican alf landon campaigned 
against franklin d roosevelt and his new deal by telling voters 
i believe that a man can be a liberal without being a 
spendthrift 
how times have changed 
the republicans wouldnt dare call themselves liberals in this 
presidential campaign and president reagan says the democrats 
wont either 
youll never hear that l word liberal from them the 
president said in his radio address last weekend 
some liberals and academics agree with the president although 
they say the issues underlying the question of liberalism will 
still be part of the campaign just as they have been since new deal 
days 
landons claim to being a liberal didnt do him much good 
roosevelt was reelected in the biggest electoral landslide in the 
history of us presidential elections 
after that the political landscape shifted and by 1964 
presidential nominee barry goldwater was telling fellow 
republicans extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and 
moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue 
goldwater fared little better than landon as voters gave a 
green light to lyndon b johnsons great society 
not all of johnsons programs turned out as their backers hoped 
however and as resistance to the vietnam war deepened liberalism 
took on a new face one which drew the scorn of the thengovernor 
of california ronald reagan among others 
the word liberal came to be associated with costly 
government activities which didnt eradicate the problems for which 
they were intended said stephen j wayne professor of political 
science and public affairs at the george washington university 
secondly the word liberal got a bad connotation because of 
the protests over the war in vietnam i think the word liberal 
started getting a real bad rap during the period from 1968 to 1972 
culminating in the george mcgovern candidacy 
marc a pearl director of the liberal organization americans 
for democratic action conceded there is a recognition on the 
part of many liberals of many democrats that to admit to being a 
liberal somehow is a detriment is a negative 
richard moe a former aide to 1984 democratic nominee walter f 
mondale said he doesnt think it makes much difference what the 
republicans or the democrats call each other 
all of these labels take on different meanings in different 
contexts at different times said moe there is an ebb and flow 
to american history i dont attach much significance to labels or 
what people say about labels i think the election is going to be 
fought out on a different ground 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis suggested one 
ground when he said in his acceptance speech that this election 
is not about ideology its about competence 
if that becomes the case it would be the first one in modern 
political history that was able to achieve that said the adas 
pearl 
instead suggested pearl they are all going to be fighting 
for the center as it were because thats where the decisions are 
going to be made 
wayne put it this way i think the new democratic position is 
to be conservative on economic issues and liberal on social 
issues 
sounds a lot like alf landon doesnt it

planned for sometime next year at the mansion

really considered marriage since his 1958 divorce from his first 
wife 
i am doing it as much for myself as for her he said it 
is going to make the relationship better that security that 
continuity that reaffirmation 
ms conrad who met hefner last summer during a photo shooting

nearly half the 37 cars vans and light trucks 
that have been crash tested by the government this year would 
likely cause severe head injuries or death to their drivers in a 35 
mph collision 
the national highway traffic safety administration on wednesday 
released its final report on 1988 crash tests with results showing 
drivers of vans and light trucks were at high risk of severe head 
injuries in a crash 
drivers of compact cars were least likely to have severe head 
injuries the agencys figures showed 
nhtsa reported the likelihood of injury as an index called the 
headinjury criterion the agency derived the index from monitoring 
dummies strapped into vehicles that were crashed into a fixed 
barrier at 35 mph 
seventeen of the 1988 vehicles tested produced a headinjury 
criterion above 1000 levels that show a high chance of severe 
head injury or death 
nhtsa cautioned it tested only one vehicle of each model and 
additional tests could produce varying results due to slight 
differences in the way vehicles are manufactured and equipped or 
due to slight variations in test conditions 
small differences in the test results should not be considered 
significant nhtsa said 
the chevrolet g20 van showed the greatest likelihood of head 
injury to the driver with an index of 3665 the mazda 929 4door 
car a large and midsize model showed the least likelihood with 
an index of 273 
tests of nine subcompact cars found five with an index of more 
than 1000 the average for the nine vehicles was 966 
subcompact cars showing the greatest chance of head injury and 
the criteria reported by nhtsa were the dodge colt 4door station 
wagon 1354 nissan pulsar nx 2door hatchback 1134 volkswagen 
fox 2door 1114 ford festiva 2door 1014 and the toyota 
tercel 2door hatchback 1005 
two of the nine compact cars tested produced headinjury 
criteria exceeding 1000 the average headinjury criterion for 
that class of car was 887 
compact cars most likely to cause head injury were the peugeot 
505 gls 4door 1701 and the nissan sentra 4door wagon 1047 
the tests found three out of nine large and midsize cars with 
criteria above 1000 the average headinjury criterion for larger 
and midsize cars was 921 
large and midsize cars with headinjury criteria exceeding 
1000 were the renault medallion 4door 1656 buick park avenue 
4door 1467 and the chrysler new yorker 1362 
the agency tested 10 vans and small trucks and found seven with 
headinjury criteria exceeding 1000 the average index for the 
vehicles was 1491 
trucks and vans showing the greatest likelihood of head injury 
were the chevrolet g20 van 3665 isuzu spacecab pickup 1873 
chevrolet astro van 1603 nissan nl lev pickup 1528 mitsubishi 
montero 4x4 1320 volkswagen vanagon 1320 and the ford f150 
pickup 1074 
nhtsas 35 mph crashtest program is not used in the agencys 
regulation of the automakers but is intended solely as a guide to 
consumers the agency said 
for regulatory purposes each manufacturer crash tests its own 
vehicles at 30 mph before the modelyear begins the results are 
usually kept secret for competitive reasons 
vehicles that test with headinjury criteria exceeding 1000 
must be redesigned before being placed on the market 
also nhtsa conducts random testing at 30 mph to check results 
certified by the automakers 
a 35 mph crash is onethird more severe than a 30 mph crash

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen is fending off questions about differences with 
running mate michael dukakis and working to point up his 
differences with republican standardbearer george bush 
youre going to see diversity in both parties he told 
reporters pressing him to answer bushs charge that they had more 
in common than bentsen and dukakis he also brushed aside gop 
statements that the democrats had effectively created a threeman 
ticket that includes jesse jackson 
i dont think theres anything to it he said 
bentsen said he still might vote for new aid to the nicaraguan 
contras despite dukakis opposition 
as for dukakis opposing bentsens plan to impose an import oil 
fee he joked i havent been able to convince george bush 
either 
bentsens comments came following a speech in albuquerque to a 
businesswomens convention in which he tied bush to reagan 
administration policies opposed by feminists bentsen supports the 
equal rights amendment and several other initiatives supported by 
the womens group 
the campaign stop in albuquerque was at the start of a fourday 
crosscountry campaign swing which continues with speeches today 
in san francisco and reno nev the campaign will then travel to 
los angeles amarillo texas and a finale in either lousiana or 
mississippi 
events will be designed to highlight some of bentsens 
differences with the gop and not with dukakis such as the 
senators work on the trade and plantclosing notification bills 
and of energy independence programs 
bentsens speech to the national federation of business and 
professional women came just three days after bush unveiled a 22 
billion child care plan before the same group 
its interestng to me that its taken eight years for the 
republicans to discover day care said bentsen just last year 
he said the white house fought every step of the way against 
just 50 million proposed for child care for poor women 
bentsen himself has not endorsed a 25 billion democratic day 
care proposal which won the approval wednesday of the senate labor 
and human resources committee 
but bentsen told the group that the gender gap the pattern 
of women supporting democrats in greater proportions than men was 
a direct result of the gop record on issues including the equal 
rights amendment equal pay and the law banning discrimination by 
institutions receiving federal money 
the reaganbush administration opposes the era they ripped 
it out of the republican platform he said they oppose the 
study that will provide the legal foundation for women who are 
discriminated against to bring their case to court and win 
bentsen said reagans veto of the bill overriding the grove city 
ruling of the supreme court which weakened federal antibias 
rules showed this administration tried to compromise equality 
but we overrode that veto and we scored a major victory for 
equality and opportunity in america 
the gender gap wasnt created by accident he said 
at the end of his speech bentsen was presented with a red 
purse the groups symbol of how women make less money for 
comparable work 
by the end of the dukakisbentsen administration he 
promised this purse will be black he received a standing 
ovation from the 2000 women in the convention hall several of 
whom held up dukakisbentsen campaign signs 
bentsen supports pay equity legislation in congress but not the 
more ambitious comparable worth legislation he told reporters 
after his speech he wanted to go one step at a time he also said 
he had not yet endorsed maternal leave legislation and has not had 
time to study it 
the businesswomens group founded in 1919 has 125000 members 
nationwide of which 51 percent list themselves as republicans 47 
percent democrats and the rest independent according to executive 
director linda dorian 
there was a lot of enthusiasm for sen bentsen and what he had 
to say said ms dorian the group was conducting a straw poll 
and planned to release the results today

score one for the environmentalists in their 
protracted battle with treecutters in americas largest national 
forest 
by a lopsided 36147 vote the house on wednesday approved 
legislation to scrap the 1980 law that groups like the wilderness 
society say is responsible for overharvesting and big treasury 
losses in the tongass forest in alaska 
the bill moved over to the senate where alaskas two members 
could have more success in blocking it in the final weeks of the 
1988 session than its lone representative republican don young 
had in the house 
the legislation would scrap a 1980 law that guarantees the us 
forest service at least 40 million a year to support commercial 
timber sales in the tongass the continents last large temperate 
rain forest 
supporters of the bill say the guarantee unique for us 
national forests has not only led to destruction of ancient trees 
but also produced red ink as tongass timber sales posted a deficit 
of 254 million from 1982 through 1987 
young argued unsuccessfully that the the bill repudiates a deal 
made in 1980 with environmentalists when congress put huge portions 
of alaskas vast acreage offlimits to development 
he said that in return for allowing 85 million of the forests 
17 million acres to be declared wilderness alaska lawmakers won 
the spending guarantee and another requiring the forest service to 
make an average of 450 million board feet of tongass timber 
available for sale each year 
the leisure lobby now wants to go back on its word said 
young who argued that the guarantees are necessary to preserve 
some 6000 timberrelated jobs in southeast alaska 
its a matter of jobs young said there are peoples 
livelihoods at stake 
but backers of the legislation argued that the tongass region 
should be looking to tourism and commercial fishing for economic 
growth they said overharvesting the tongass hurts both tourism and 
fisheries 
besides getting rid of the guarantees the overhaul bill 
sponsored principally by rep robert mrazek dny would put 
another 17 million tongass acres offlimits to timber cutting for 
five years 
much of the tongass timber is sold to two large corporations 
louisiana pacificketchikan and the japaneseowned alaska lumber 
and pulp co which turn it into pulp chiefly for export to japan 
the bill would require the forest service to renegotiate the 
50year contracts it entered into with these companies in the 1950s 
rep george miller dcalif the bills floor manager said new 
contracts are needed to encourage competition in tongass timbering 
prevent excessive cutting of oldgrowth stands and ensure that the 
companies pay more for tongass trees 
miller said a mature sitka spruce from tongass now sells for 
148 compared to 2 for a map of the national forest

former army general sein lwin was elected 
president wednesday one day after being named party leader and 
rioting broke out in a northern city in which one person was 
reported killed and five wounded 
the official news agency burma said a curfew was imposed in 
myede 220 miles north of rangoon after hundreds of rioters on 
tuesday destroyed buildings and attacked police who fired their 
guns to disperse the crowd 
sources in the area said one person was killed and five wounded 
it was not immediately known if the violence was related to this 
weeks leadership changes which included the naming wednesday of 
active or retired military officers to all but two of the cabinets 
22 posts 
western diplomats had said the rise of sein lwin a 64yearold 
hardliner known for his ruthless supression of dissidents could 
lead to more of the antigovernment protests that have broken out 
three times since october 
travelers returning from rangoon said leaflets have appeared in 
recent days urging continued antigovernment agitation 
a oneday emergency session of parliament elected sein lwin 
president on tuesday he assumed the nations most powerful 
position chairman of the burma socialist program party at a 
special party congress 
the parliament elected the former deputy prime minister tun 
tin as prime minister vice president aye ko remained in his post 
defense minister kyaw htin moved to the no 3 government 
position as head of the council of state part of a realignment 
that saw changes in eight of the 22 major government positions 
only two civilians were included in the new lineup attorney 
general maung maung and education minister kyaw sein the rest are 
retired or active duty military officers 
the selections appeared to represent a continuation of the 
hardline oneparty system instituted 26 years ago by ne win who 
resigned saturday as president and party chairman 
however a number of liberal economic reforms were endorsed and 
some balance within the top echelons appears to have been reached 
by the promotions of kyaw htin and tun tin both are regarded as 
relatively liberal on issues of economic reform and dealing with 
dissent in the country kyaw htin also moved up to a top party post 
sein lwin a close associate of ne win commanded forces that 
brutally put down student riots in march in which dozens of people 
died 
several other officials were reprimanded or fired including 
former prime minister maung maung kha for their handling of the 
march 18 unrest in rangoon but sein lwin escaped officially 
unscathed by the incident 
the government has admitted that 43 people died 41 of them 
suffocating in a crowded police van while being taken to prison 
unofficial reports said more than 100 people were killed 
sein lwin who formerly ranked no 4 in the party hierarchy 
also commanded the fourth burma rifles a unit that opened fire on 
about 2000 antigovernment demonstrators at rangoon university on 
july 7 1962 unofficial casualties were put at more than 100 and 
the following day authorities blew up the universitys student 
union building 
sein lwin was also involved in putting down demonstrations in 
1974 when students and buddhist monks angry at a shoddy 
government funeral for former un secretarygeneral u thant 
snatched his coffin and brought it to rangoon university troops 
firing rifles later stormed the campus 
ne win cited his age and the recent unrest when he resigned in 
his resignation speech he raised hopes that major changes were in 
store for burma in an unprecedented move he called for a 
referendum to decide whether the country wished to continue with 
oneparty rule or opt for a multiparty system 
the congress turned down the referendum proposal 
ne wins resignation followed three periods of studentled 
rioting there also is mounting discontent over deteriorating 
economic conditions that have made burma one of the worlds 10 
poorest nations despite its abundance of natural resources 
the congress promised a package of liberal economic reforms 
including allowing joint ventures between private foreign and local 
investors and loosening control on a number of sectors including 
agriculture and forestry there was initial skepticism among 
diplomats about how far these will go and whether the current 
leaders can implement them 
several diplomats said that the new lineup lacks the expertise 
in dealing with anything but a statecontrolled system which has 
led to plummeting industrial production food shortages a foreign 
debt of about 4 million and meager social services 
that the country has gone from bad to worse 26 years after 
the seizure of power is evident to anyone not living in a fools 
paradise aung gyi a respected government critic wrote to ne 
win on may 12 the country has plunged to the bottom politically 
economically and socially the moral decay is the most deplorable 
aung gyi resigned from ne wins government in 1963 his letter 
has been widely circulated underground in rangoon ne win is 
believed to hold his old comradeinarms in some respect but there 
has been speculation the government would move to silence him

chen wenbao doesnt consider himself 
religious but each night he puts a stick of incense outside the 
door of his house and prays for rain 
theres no other way i have to rely on heaven chen said 
this week in this village in northern hubei province 
chen his wife three children and mother live in the heart of 
chinas drought country stricken this year with its worst blight 
in 50 years 
beginning as early as february in some parts of central and 
eastern china the drought has hit eight out of chinas 30 
provinces 
officials in hubei say about half of the provinces rice crop 
and 70 percent of its peanut and sesame crops will be affected in 
addition they worry about starvation in some areas like laohekou 
the chinese news media have cited similar figures for grain and 
vegetable production in other provinces officials said other 
provinces also faced the possibility of starvation 
laohekou has been hit particularly hard by the drought the 
villages reservoir is bone dry for the first time since it opened 
in 1958 wells for drinking water contain only mud trucks carrying 
potable water from the nearest town xiangfan are few 
draft animals have been dying some because of the heat which 
has hovered around 104 degrees for weeks others because of thirst 
chen 33 said hes concerned for his family 
this spring he planted about 2 acres of land in a good year 
with the rich hubei soil chen said he could clear 540 profit from 
his fields well above the average farmers annual income of 125 
but this year the fields are barren 
my mungbeans are burned my cotton should be up to my chest 
but it only hits my ankle so it will be worthless my tobacco is 
dead chen said pausing to spit in the dust outside his brick 
house well have no vegetables this year and no money 
under chinas recent agricultural reforms peasants sign a 
contract with the government promising to produce a certain amount 
of grain that grain is then sold to the state at a fixed price 
well below what it would get on the free market 
anything extra can be sold for market value in addition all 
vegetables and cash crops can be sold on the market 
but without a harvest of vegetables or cash crops chen will 
have no money 
chen said he and his family will live on the winter wheat he 
harvested earlier this year but after fulfilling his contract with 
the state only 3000 pounds remained chinese officials say one 
person needs at least 550 pounds of grain a year to survive so 
chens family of six has come up short 
chen has pulled up some cotton and planted sweet potatoes to try 
and fill the gap 
thats why im asking heaven for rain he said but if 
theres no rain then things wont be good at all 
chen said that if the rains dont come hell probably take a job 
in a nearby rock quarry with other villagers making 160 a day 
it will help to feed my family because no one here wants to 
beg he said but really i dont want to leave the land

people victimized by erroneous drug test 
results frequently face loss of their jobs and few are in a 
position to defend themselves adequately congress has been told 
mark l waple a fayetteville nc attorney who has handled 
more than 500 drug test cases in the past six years said wednesday 
that such a person loses the presumption of innocence and is 
instead burdened with a presumption of guilt 
waple said that in at least 75 percent of his cases there was 
a significant legal or scientific irregularity which substantially 
affected the reliability of the ultimate conclusion that the 
individual had in fact used a controlled substance 
he said his clients have faced threats of incarceration loss of 
security clearances and hospital credentials as well as loss of 
employment rank and position 
waple told the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations that the combination of the 
presumption of guilt and complex legal and scientific issues 
makes it very difficult for a person to defend against the positive 
test result 
very few individuals who test positive for controlled 
substances will have a proper background either through experience 
or education to know where to begin to defend themselves he 
said drug testing laboratories guard their scientific data 
their test results their mathematical computations and their 
standard operating procedures very carefully 
he called for complete and total disclosure of all of the data 
supporting a positive test result

lowincome rural homeowners who receive 
federal mortgage subsidies have excellent repayment records and 
benefit from a more stable family life a private study of 894 
households has found 
the study by the nonprofit housing assistance council also said 
the farmers home administrations lowincome home ownership program 
is costeffective and should be expanded 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas said the study released 
wednesday proves the program has succeeded in the very toughest 
hardscrabble places and that the poor are neither lazy nor 
irresponsible and hopeless 
after all of the attacks on housing assistance programs this 
study shows what really happens with subsidized homeownership 
programs these programs work said gonzalez chairman of a 
house subcommittee on housing 
subsidies to participants in the program declined over a 
fiveyear period as their incomes increased and the number of 
children living below the poverty level decreased the study said 
the council tracked 894 sample families nationwide who obtained 
subsizied mortgages in 1981 and concluded the rural homeownership 
program represents a costeffective strategy to provide decent 
shelter to lowincome households and to assist them in overcoming 
the burden of poverty 
the study financed with a grant from the ford foundation also 
found homeownership had indirect benefits particularly on 
children such as stabilizing family life 
in 1986 when most borrowers had five years experience with the 
program the study found most were ahead in their payments only 7 
percent were as much as three months behind 5 percent had returned 
their homes to the fmha and only 13 percent had lost their homes 
to foreclosure 
povertylevel borrowers were less likely than others to be 
delinquent and more likely to be ahead in payments the study 
showed at the same time subsidies to the families declined 
steadily 
the decline in the subsidy was in part a reflection of upward 
economic mobility and this was most evident among young families 
with children the study said 
the washingtonbased council advises lowincome and minority 
groups seeking federal assistance for improving rural housing and 
studies and makes recommendations for state and local housing 
policies 
gonzalez said the program has been cut from 29 billion in 1979 
to 11 billion last year if anything the need has grown he 
said 
he and sen alfonse damato rny said they are pressing 
congress to expand the program

foreign investment in american companies real 
estate and other assets has increased dramatically in recent years 
and is likely to keep climbing through the year 2000 according to 
a new study 
the private study released wednesday by the congressional 
economic leadership institute said direct foreign investment in 
the united states has jumped by more than 215 percent since 1980 
while american investment abroad increased by only onefifth that 
rate 
and the study said the pace of foreign investment is expected to 
accelerate with foreign buyouts in 1988 expected to make up as 
much as 20 percent of all us acquisitions up from 5 percent in 
1987 
however the report said that in absolute terms foreign 
investments still account for only 5 percent to 6 percent of total 
us assets 
the study said seven nations account for nearly 85 percent of

dartmouth college says bullying tactics 
aimed at a black professor by staffers of a stridently conservative 
student publication led to suspensions that are now the subject of 
two lawsuits 
the dartmouth reviews lawsuits accuse the college of reverse 
discrimination against white students and of violating free speech 
rights for suspending three of its staffers 
the review staffers were suspended following a confrontation in 
a college classroom with a black music professor who earlier had 
been harshly criticized in the independent offcampus newspaper 
review attorney harvey d myerson said the facts clearly 
indicate that the students would not have been given such draconian 
penalties if they were black students criticizing a white 
professor 
but officials at the private liberal arts college in hanover 
nh said wednesday the disciplinary action against the students 
was taken to preserve the integrity of the classroom 
described by its critics as antiminority antiwomen and 
antihomosexual the review often has been the center of 
controversy since it was founded in 1980 
in march of this year dartmouth president david freedman 
blasted the paper calling its staff ideological provocateurs 
posing as journalists 
the faculty censured it in 1982 as racist and sexist after a 
critique of dartmouths affirmative action programs written in 
what was intended to be black dialect and headlined dis sho 
aint no jive bro 
in 1984 a review reporter secretly taperecorded a gay students 
association meeting and published excerpts and the names of group 
leaders 
a dartmouth disciplinary panel ruled in march that the three 
review staffers were guilty of disorderly conduct for failing to 
leave professor william coles classroom after being asked to do 
so the paper earlier had described coles music class as one of 
dartmouths most academically deficient courses 
the papers attorneys who filed suits in federal and state 
courts in new hampshire announced the action at a capitol hill 
news conference wednesday with support from three conservative 
lawmakers 
sen gordon humphrey rnh called the disciplinary actions 
nothing less than a crude assault on freedom of expression and 
political diversity on campus 
the elite ivy league academics constantly proclaim themselves 
the champions of free speech and diversity of opinion yet here 
when a small band of students express a viewpoint offensive to the 
prevailing orthodoxy the college comes squarely down on the side 
of suppression and harsh persecution 
humphrey was joined at the news conference by sen william 
armstrong rcolo and rep bob smith rnh 
a state suit filed in new hampshire superior court addresses the 
free speech issue while a federal suit filed in us district 
court focuses on the reverse discrimination charge 
dartmouth spokesman alex huppe who attended the news 
conference said the disciplinary action had nothing to do with 
first amendment rights 
the sanctity of a classroom is what this is all about huppe 
said dartmouth college has got to protect the integrity of a 
classroom they went in there to disrupt his classroom 
huppe accused the students of using bullying tactics in 
their confrontation with the professor and their refusal to leave 
after the classroom incident freedman the college president 
said the paper had been irresponsible meanspirited cruel and 
ugly and that it was trying to poison the intellectual 
environment of the campus

the democraticcontrolled house has given the 
reagan administration what amounts to a vote of no confidence for 
its handling of americas network of national parks 
the action came wednesday as the chamber voted 248130 for 
democratic legislation to strip political appointees in the 
interior deparment of their daytoday power over the national park 
service 
the vote capped nearly eight years of friction over a variety of 
parks and federal landuse issues between the republican 
administration and democrats on the house interior committee 
the bill faces an uncertain future in the senate in the waning 
weeks of the 100th congress and if it reaches president reagans 
desk it will be vetoed says rep robert lagomarsino rcalif 
the proposal sponsored principally by rep bruce vento 
dminn would make the national park service director a 
presidential appointee who would be confirmed by the senate for a 
fiveyear term 
the director now serves at the pleasure of the white house and 
the interior secretary and can be removed at any time for any 
reason the bill would require a president to show cause before 
firing a parks director 
the legislation would strip the interior secretary and assistant 
secretaries of any authority over the park service except for its 
budget a matter on which congress has the final word 
the measure also would create a threemember park system review 
board appointed by the president and confirmed by the senate to 
advise the director and congress on how to improve the national 
parks 
vento who leveled no criticism against parks director william 
penn mott said the changes are necessary because professionals in 
the national park service have been supplanted by political 
decisionmaking 
the director of the park service has consistently been ordered 
by superiors to give political testimony vento said the 
director ought to be free to act but he is undercut and undermined 
constantly by political appointees 
he said that political appointees have forced resignations and 
transfers of park superintendents they didnt like changed 
performance ratings for parks personnel and required park officials 
to obtain clearance for testimony before congressional committees 
its time to put a stop to this said vento who chairs the 
interior national parks and public lands subcommittee 
subcommittee member richard lehman dcalif said that 
political expediency overrules professional judgment this occurs 
because the secretary of the interior holds the reins 
lehman said that the secretary cannot serve as the nations 
chief park ranger when his other duties also make him the 
chief miner chief oildriller chief cattle grazer and chief water 
developer 
lagomarsino said the plan is unconstitutional completely 
unworkable and a dangerous precedent because it creates a 
virtually independent entity within a cabinet department 
rep larry craig ridaho said that this legislation is the 
worst kind of micromanagement the country does not need a law 
creating a new bureaucracy

apartment tenants need not fret for 
fear their bawling babies will prompt legal action by angry 
neighbors a renters group says 
but the groups guidelines do strongly advise against letting 
youngsters ride up and down apartment house elevators just for the 
fun of it 
the german tenants association which released its guidelines 
to tenants on wednesday said childrens laughter and crying are 
not legally justified grounds for complaints by other renters 
the same goes for noise from normal play activities inside 
the childrens own apartment the colognebased group said 
behavior outside the apartment is another matter though the 
group advised keeping thrillseeking children out of elevators and 
off roller skates and bicycles around stairwells and in basements

for the first time in the soviet bloc a 
1956 speech in which nikita khrushchev denounced josef stalins 
brutal policies has been made public in a communist party newspaper 
the speech khrushchev delivered three years after the death of 
stalin his predecessor marked the formal break with stalinism in 
the soviet union it was leaked to western reporters in 1956 
the 400000circulation party weekly polityka devoted four 
full pages to the speech in its july 30 edition which went on sale 
to the public wednesday the paper also carried a halfpage 
commentary by two of its journalists 
this is not the first time that it turns out that something 
that is known to everybody must be said aloud sooner or later 
the polish weekly said 
the publication comes as the soviet union under mikhail 
gorbachevs leadership carries out a campaign to discredit stalin 
and shed light on dark pages of soviet history polish leader 
wojciech jaruzelski and the polish party have been strong 
supporters of gorbachevs moves toward glasnost or openness 
khrushchevs speech delivered at a closed meeting at the 20th 
congress of the soviet communist party on feb 25 1956 condemned 
stalins cult of personality 
khrushchev who led the soviet union from 1958 to 1964 said 
soviet founder vladimir i lenin warned that stalin could be cruel 
the speech blamed stalin who came to power in 1941 for 
executions and deportations of people after show trials 
about 20 million soviets were killed in political purges carried 
out under stalin and in the drive to collectivize agriculture 
according to estimates by western historians 
 
polityka said that since 1956 it kept a copy numbered 2094 of a 
polish reprint of the speech which had been brought back from 
moscow by polish guests to the soviet congress 
leaders of the polish united workers party the countrys ruling 
communist party at the time authorized reprinting the secret 
speech for internal party use 
khrushchev did a great thing but the leadership of the polish 
party has done a great thing also the polish text of the report is 
the only official version until today polityka said 
a spokeswoman for polityka said wednesday that no editors 
authorized to comment on the publication were available 
a spokesman for the censors office in warsaw who identified 
himself only as mr osiek said he could only comment generally 
that today the range of freedoms to publish various information 
is so broad and getting broader day by day

a mayor who told police officers to shoot 
youngsters to stop them from brawling with sticks in a city park 
rescinded the order wednesday saying he simply wanted to get the 
attention of the hoodlums 
mayor ba johnson said he issued the order to shoot from the 
waist down because youths from wadley and nearby towns were 
turning the 12acre hope williams memorial park into a fighting 
ring 
i had not intended for police to shoot them anyway it was 
issued temporarily i didnt think it would take very long for 
those young people to get the idea we meant business johnson 
said 
it is merely to warn and to threaten and to let them know they 
are not going to take over the city 
he said hed learned some of my people are embarrassed by 
the order all and all it is a thing that will fade away he 
added 
johnson who once ordered police to shoot burglars and also 
ordered them to shoot stray dogs said as part of the attempt to 
stop brawls in the park the fine for fighting was going to be 
increased from 7150 to 125

a preliminary review by the agriculture 
department says that many banks serving farmers were in much better 
shape going into this summers devastating drought than they would 
have been a few years ago 
the figures which are far from conclusive were compiled by the 
departments economic research service only through june 11 but 
economists were able to make some general observations based upon 
the situation leading up to and including the early months of the 
1988 drought 
because changes in agricultural banking conditions tend to lag 
changes in the farm economy banks will not feel the full effects 
of this years drought until 1989 the agency said 
overall the agency reports in a forthcoming issue of 
agricultural outlook magazine agricultural commercial banks 
those with aboveaverage concentrations of farm loans were 
rebounding as farmers entered the spring planting season 
farm banks are better poised to deal with losses from 
agricultural loans than they were a few years ago the report 
said their delinquent farm loans have been falling since 
mid1986 and the drop in real farmland values has bottomed out in 
most parts of the country 
even so 20 percent of 543 agricultural banks classified as 
vulnerable at the beginning of this year are located in the 
worst drought counties the report said and a banks strength and 
performance in 1987 are important in judging how well it could 
withstand droughtrelated losses 
the report which was prepared by agency economist gregory 
gajewski said that forecasts before the drought indicated 40 to 60 
agricultural banks might fail this year fewer than the 75 failures 
in 1987 which was a postdepression high 
farm income nationally is expected to be little affected by the 
drought but farmers in the droughthit areas will suffer while 
others outside of those areas are expected to benefit from higher 
commodity prices 
the farmers hit hardest will be unable to meet expenses this 
year including repaying their local banks for farm credit used to 
put in this years aborted crop the report said banks in the 
parched counties will take unexpected hits unless federal programs 
rescue the farmers 
legislation providing emergency drought relief for farmers is 
currently working its way through congress 
about 80 percent of the nations agricultural banks in drought 
counties with aboveaverage probabilities of failure are in the 
northcentral drought region the report said agricultural 
banks in the regions drought counties had a lower return on equity 
and a higher proportion of delinquent loans than did banks in 
nearby counties not hit by the drought

a proposal by the agriculture department would 
require foreign countries selling meat and poultry to the united 
states to be certified annually that their programs to control drug 
contamination meet us standards 
the proposal responds to the requirements of the 1985 farm 
law said lester m crawford administrator of the departments 
food safety and inspection service or fsis 
under the plan the agency would certify that each country 34 
now are eligible to ship meat and poultry into the united states 
use reliable analytical methods to determine whether products 
contain residues of drugs or other chemicals that are within us 
limits 
for many years we have required foreign countries that export 
meat and poultry to the united states to have a system of 
inspection that is equal to our domestic inspection system 
crawford said wednesday 
he added in recent years the legal requirements governing 
how we regulate imported meat and poultry have become increasingly 
strict especially with respect to oversight of residuecontrol 
programs 
the proposal would provide that if a countrys program was not 
certified the country would lose its eligibility to ship meat and 
poultry to the united states 
public comments on the proposal can be sent through sept 26 to

hungarian communist party leader karoly grosz 
is ending his groundbreaking visit to washington today calling it 
symbolic of the new era of detente and expressing hope that it 
will produce economic benefits for his country 
at a news conference wednesday night grosz called the visit 
the first by a hungarian leader in 42 years an outstanding 
event in our relations 
grosz spoke a few hours after a meeting with president reagan 
who said he was encouraged by the hungarian leaders recognition 
that his economic reform program cannot succeed unless 
accompanied by political reforms as well 
reagan also praised grosz for his openness to new ideas 
grosz was to leave this morning aboard a us presidential 
aircraft for niagara falls ny during his us stay he also 
visited illinois california and new york city 
he described the current era of detente as much richer and 
much deeper than the comparable period of the 1970s 
at 57 grosz is from the same generation as soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev and his reform program has many similarities 
to the soviet experiment 
speaking through a translator at the hungarian embassy grosz 
said the accommodating atmosphere between east and west provides 
not only the superpowers but the small and mediumsized powers with 
the opportunity to participate in a dialogue 
the visit was the first ever by a hungarian party leader since 
the country came under communist rule 40 years ago grosz became 
premier a year ago and was named party chief in may 
during his visit the administration agreed to allow hungary to 
open a trade office on the west coast and promised to study the 
possibility of improving the access of hungarian products to 
american markets grosz said 
reflecting hungarys greater willingness to accept foreign 
private investment grosz took part in a ceremony last week at 
which an illinois glass manufacturer and a hungarian enterprise 
agreed to undertake a 115 million joint venture 
he said a number of other us firms expressed interest in 
investing in hungary as well 
administration officials have said hungary still cannot receive 
high technoloy us products because the country is a member of the 
sovietled warsaw pact military alliance 
on human rights the officials have praised the freedom with 
which hungary allows its citizens to travel abroad but said there 
are still sharp restrictions on protest demonstrations and other 
forms of dissent

government through the freedom of information act said the plane

in the realm of national politics where flash 
and style hold sway quiet nancy kassebaum has made it onto the 
list of republican vice presidential prospects through dogged study 
and subtle strengths 
the secondterm kansas senator dismisses talk of herself as a 
running mate for george bush in the fall campaign saying she 
doesnt think she offers the proper balance in personality 
that bush will want on the ticket 
but it is her strengths cultivated over nearly a decade in the 
senate that apparently have brought the diminutive former wichita 
housewife and businesswoman to the attention of bushs advisers 
on issues she chooses to dig into including foreign policy 
national defense the budget transportation and agriculture 
kassebaum spends long hours marshaling facts and mulling over 
arguments before taking a position once taken those positions are 
unshakable as the reagan administration has occasionally come to 
learn 
testifying this past spring before the gop platform committee in 
kansas city mo she spoke out firmly for the need to consider tax 
increases as a weapon along with spending cuts in the fight 
against the federal deficit that puts her potentially at odds with 
bush who has vowed never to raise personal income taxes 
there is no way that we can cut 150 billion to 200 billion 
out of the federal budget she stated with unusual bluntness 
to promise to do so is to engage in fantasy 
despite such principled stands kassebaum has few political 
enemies she has an unassuming personal charm and an explosive 
smile that disarm opponents and she eschews political gamesmanship 
and gimmicks designed to gain publicity a determination which has 
gained her respect among colleagues while keeping her out of the 
limelight 
bush strategists may see in kassebaum a way of offsetting a 
potential weakness for their candidate what some pollsters have 
referred to as bushs gender gap kassebaum comes in for almost 
automatic consideration as the only republican woman in the senate 
and one of a handful of gop women with national standing 
while sympathetic to socalled womens issues kassebaum 
supports womens right to have an abortion and was a proponent of 
the equal rights amendment she is uncomfortable leading the 
charge on those matters 
weighing against her selection as the vice presidential 
candidate are the small size of her home state kansas has just 
seven electoral votes and a lack of identification beyond the 
states borders political observers doubt kassebaum could bring to 
the ticket a midwest regional appeal based on farm and rural 
interests in the same way her kansas colleague senate minority 
leader bob dole did as gerald fords running mate in 1976 
another potential minus is her softspoken undynamic style a 
drawback she has conceded seldom a participant in senate floor 
debates she prefers to play to her strength oneonone dealings 
with colleagues 
the idea of kassebaum on the short list for the no 2 spot is 
taken seriously enough by the republican right wing that it was 
blasted as highstakes skirt chasing in the conservative 
weekly human events 
the article attacked her prochoice stand on abortion and warned 
that she would alienate the partys conservative wing which 
already has doubts about bushs claim to the reagan legacy 
kassebaums lifetime 52 percent rating from the american 
conservative union puts her in the bottom onefourth of gop 
senators it noted 
during a spring visit to california to campaign for the 
reelection of sen pete wilson kassebaum was greeted by 
bushkassebaum bumper stickers while flattered she later brushed 
the gesture aside 
there is a bumper sticker in washington somewhere that says 
honk if george bush has asked you to be vice president she 
said 
i dont anticipate it being offered to me i dont think its 
the right balance and i think i tend to have pretty good political 
instincts

if joel brandon spends a lot of time puckering 
up its only natural after all whistlings his work 
what some professional whistlers dont find natural though is 
the way brandon whistles he inhales rather than exhales to 
produce his tones 
i also sort of pop the notes off with my tongue a lot of the 
time to get a more staccato effect than most whistlers use 
brandon said wednesday he does bach and handel pieces and jazz 
improvisation and will perform with the houston symphony next year 
brandon 40 won the 10th international whistleoff contest in 
carson city nev earlier this year and won the championship of 
the national whistlers convention in louisburg nc for a second 
year in a row 
he says he learned his unusual inhalation technique by accident 
while walking on the street on chicagos south side when he was 7 
or 8 years old 
i was whistling and i inhaled and made a sound id never made 
before he said 
for a long time brandon studied flute at the american 
conservatory of music but finally realized there were a lot of 
flute players and only one master inhalewhistler 
so for the past 10 years he has made his living strictly by 
whistling

a tulsa womans sour experience with import 
quotas finally turned into a sweet deal but it was only a 
coincidence 
a convention of cake bakers is coming to town next month and 
june melendy tried to pick up some special sugar syrup and 
molasses shipped by two british decorators but us customs 
officials at tulsas international airport stopped the pick up 
saying sugar imports were over their quotas 
theyre artists ms melendy said of cake decorating experts 
elaine macgregor and nicolas lodge of sussex england who had 
shipped the supplies in preparation for the aug 1114 convention 
expected to draw 1500 cake decorators 
they use a very fine extrarefined sugar they dont like our 
sugar theyre just like a sculptor or painter they prefer using 
their own equipment 
art finally prevailed wednesday even though the us department 
of agriculture said it was strictly business the department 
decided to relax sugar import quotas in a decision unrelated to ms 
melendys dilemma said charles conroy spokesman for the customs 
service in houston 
conroy said officials determined that more sugar could be 
imported this year without injury to the domestic market it just 
happened to work out to her advantage that way he said 
ms melendy a spokeswoman for the international cake 
exploration societys convention and cake show said she was going 
to move fast retrieving the 88pound box held since july 19 
im going to run back out there and get my sugar before they 
change their minds she said wednesday

some of the most droughtparched areas of the 
country received a good dousing last week the national weather 
service said in a generally optimistic assessment of conditions 
rainfall for the past week was substantial in the driest 
areas the weather service said wednesday in its latest drought 
advisory the report said more than one inch of rainfall from west 
virginia westward into missouri had fallen and said it has been the 
most beneficial precipitation since early april 
but the report said extreme conditions still prevail in the 
west the northern plains and the rockies 
some locations received more than eight inches of rain with a 
few areas having the equivalent of two months of normal rainfall 
the advisory said 
the fiveday forecast through aug 1 calls for some heavy rain 
across florida and along the gulf coast with widely scattered 
thundershowers along the east coast 
but the agency said generally hot and dry conditions will spread 
to the midwest and great lakes regions 
normal rainfall is forecast for the second week in august in the 
lower mississippi valley and the southeast with near normal or 
below normal temperatures but above normal temperatures were 
predicted for the northeast and the ohio valley 
rainfall caused the level of creeks streams and rivers 
throughout the ohio valley the middle and lower mississippi valley 
and the northeast to rise temporarily 
but streamflows across the rest of the country were still very 
low according to the hydrological services division of the agency 
some reservoirs reported increased storage levels the report 
said and wateruse restrictions remained in effect in some parts 
of the country 
temperatures across the great plains dropped from three degrees 
to six degrees below normal although temperatures remained as much 
as nine degrees above normal along the west coast 
record high temperatures were still being reported in the 
pacific northwest and from montana to minnesota the service said 
extreme dry conditions continued to increase the danger of fire 
in the far west and the northern plains and the rockies the 
service added 
the report said 12 percent of the country slipped into the 
extreme drought category between midjune and midjuly with about 
45 percent of the country affected by july 16 
the nations worst recorded drought was in 1934 when 61 percent 
of the country was put in the extreme category

the food and drug administration is allowing 
use of a nocalorie sweetener as a table sugar substitute and 
ingredient in some food products 
the substance acesulfame potassium was developed in west 
germany and is used in 20 other countries as an additive in various 
pharmaceutical products some baked goods and candies the food and 
drug administration said wednesday 
regulations permitting use of the sweetener to be marketed in 
the united states as sunette take effect upon publication in 
the federal register today 
the fda is allowing its use in chewing gum dry beverage mixes 
instant coffee instant tea gelatins puddings and nondairy 
creamers 
however the center for science in the public interest a 
consumer interest group told the fda it was concerned that the 
sweetener may have caused tumors found in laboratory animals 
but the fda said the tumors were what could routinely be 
expected and not due to feeding with sunette 
sunette is a product of the hoechst celanese corp of 
somerville nj a subsidiary of hoechst ag of frankfurt west 
germany the company did not seek fda approval to use sunette in 
soft drinks 
the fda deferred action on the companys request to use the 
sweetener in candies and other confections in the united states 
in the past the agency has interpreted the food drug and 
cosmetic act as barring the use of nonnutritive sweeteners in 
candies

fbi files have turned up documents stolen from a 
television reporter who has accused us officials in a nicaraguan 
political bombing but the agency denies knowing the material was 
taken illegally 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the fbi oversight 
committee in congress said he will look promptly into how the 
agency obtained the stolen documents from tony avirgan a 
freelance cameraman who worked for cbstv 
weve been looking into over 100 breakins over a period of 
several years edwards said wednesday they all have a central 
american angle all relating to salvador in some cases nicaragua 
the fbi confirmed a report in the boston globe on wednesday that 
the agency received memos and notes taken in costa rica in 1985 and 
1986 from avirgan who was investigating a political bombing in 
nicaragua that killed eight people and left him slightly injured 
avirgan and his wife martha honey later filed a 24 million 
damage suit in miami federal court accusing us and nicaraguan 
contra officials of responsibility for the bombing the suit was 
dismissed last month for insufficient evidence 
the fbi obtained avirgans files from someone reporting on 
people who allegedly supported terrorist operations in central 
america according to a statement released through washington fbi 
spokeswoman sue schnitzer 
this individual gave no indication that the documents were 
obtained through illegal means the statement said 
schnitzer said the fbi routinely inquires if such material is 
stolen but refused to say if that was done in the avirgan case 
she also refused to identify the source 
the fbi will cooperate with an investigation by appropriate 
oversight committees ms schnitzer said 
the 39 pages stolen from avirgan included memos to cbs and 
avirgans handwritten notes about the bombing said lanny sinkin 
an attorney for the liberal washingtonbased christic institute 
which represents avirgan in the miami lawsuit 
it suggests that the breakin was targeted to find out what he 
knew said sinkin 
the subject of many of the stolen memos and later avirgans 
damage lawsuit was the may 1984 bombing of a news conference held 
by maverick contra commander eden pastora in la penca nicaragua 
just across the costa rican border 
three journalists and five pastora supporters died in the 
explosion although pastora was only slightly injured avirgan and 
later the christic institute blamed it on us and contra leaders 
who objected to pastoras independent stance in the fight against 
nicaraguas leftist government 
edwards said the documents indicate that the fbi could have 
been getting the fruits of political burglaries and breakins 
also wednesday chris wood a montpelier vt political 
activist who has been involved in the vermont central america 
nonintervention network said he has been the target of three 
breakins in three weeks that he suspects involved the fbi 
ray mcelhaney another fbi spokesman in washington said i 
dont think there have been any breakins involving the fbi i 
have no statement regarding the allegations of this person in 
montpelier vermont 
last month the globe reported that the fbi has conducted at 
least four investigations of opponents of the reagan 
administrations central american policies including cispes the 
committee in solidarity with the people of el salvador 
the thefts at avirgans home in 1985 and about a year later were 
reported to costa rican police at the time but no one was ever 
arrested sinkin said 
during preparations for the lawsuit attorneys routinely asked 
for any documents the fbi washington office might have on avirgan 
and the agency responded last month 
as we went through them it became clear they were stolen from 
tonys home sinkin said 
avirgan filed his lawsuit here in 1986 but last month chief 
us district judge james lawrence king threw the case out saying 
there was insufficient evidence 
avirgan and the institute last week gave notice they would 
appeal kings ruling to the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta

operation but droughtbeleaguered iowans say theyre honored to 
help the worlds most famous rodent celebrate his 60th birthday 
with a cornfield seeded in his image 
the birthday card devised by walt disney productions is a 
520acre field in north central iowa planted in corn and oats in a 
profile of the cartoon legend thats visible from 30000 feet in 
the air 
the presentation is scheduled for aug 67 and the celebration 
is the latest in a series of events surrounding the farm field art 
that has brought cheer to some iowa communities struggling under 
the farm crisis of the 1980s and lately the drought 
this time it also may bring in some cash for economic 
development and community groups 
walt disney productions characters mickey and minnie mouse as 
well as donald duck and goofy all are scheduled to appear at the 
fair in sheffield along with ear force one a 12storyhigh hot 
air balloon in the shape of mickeys head and featuring a birthday 
hat 
organizers say the celebration could attract more than 40000 
people providing an economic lift to the seven small communities 
known as the area community commonwealth that surround the field 
with the distressed economic environment and this years 
drought this is bringing smiles to peoples faces says 
sheffield banker keith lazer this is one ray of hope 
last fall as mickeys 60th birthday approached the disney 
organization began working in iowa to locate a field to plant in 
the shape of his head preferably one beneath a welltraveled route 
of commercial airliners 
with the help of iowa state university searchers found a farm 
that fit the bill property rented by richard pitzenberger and his 
sons joe ted and rick 
using a design developed with the help of a surveyor joe 
pitzenberger planted corn in the shape of mickeys head surrounded 
by oats in a day and a half last spring he said it took just three 
hours longer than usual to plant the field which has been kept 
alive by rain that has eluded some other areas of the state 
the design consists of 65 million corn plants surrounded by 300 
acres of oats and its 11 miles from the tip of mickeys nose to 
the end of his ear said disneyland spokeswoman louanne cappiello 
its been great said joe pitzenberger of the attention his 
work has achieved although he admits that the famous field mouse 
also is making the pitzenbergers the butt of some goodnatured 
jokes around town 
mickey mouse operation is the one we hear the most said 
pitzenberger i tell em ive heard it before 
lazar said the fair will have the usual food booths games and 
concessions and will also feature a parade a chance to have 
pictures taken with disney characters and helicopter rides to view 
the fields 
in addition the disney organization is providing buttons and 
balloons and organizers hope to sell thousands of souvenirs with 
hats priced at 5 and tshirts at 7 lazar said

us war veterans driving 20 vehicles 
loaded with food clothing and medical supplies have arrived in 
nicaragua on the final leg of a journey their government resisted 
the veterans peace convoy comprised of 44 people crossed the 
border from honduras late wednesday don reasoner a leading member 
of the committee of us citizens living in nicaragua said in a 
telephone interview 
the committee opposes president reagans policies in central 
america 
the us government blocked the convoy from leaving the united 
states at least three times saying plans to leave the trucks in 
nicaragua violated a 3yearold trade embargo against the leftist 
sandinista government 
washington has backed the contra rebels who have been fighting 
the sandinistas 
eight of the veterans groups members were arrested july 9 when 
they refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a rio 
grande bridge crossing in laredo texas 
the group finally crossed the mexican border at nuevo laredo on 
july 14 
the presentation of the food and medical supplies carried by the 
veterans is to take place friday in the capital 
the us treasury department accepted that the food and medical 
supplies carried by the group qualified as humanitarian aid exempt 
from the 1985 embargo but it said the vehicles were barred from 
remaining in nicaragua 
the us customs service said the trucks must return to the 
united states within 30 days or convoy members will face fines of 
up to 50000 and 10 years in prison convoy members refused to 
sign forms promising they would return the trucks 
in june the original convoy of 38 vehicles was stopped by us 
customs officials from crossing into mexico about 100 participants 
in the convoy drove to washington dc to rally against customs 
decision circling around the white house and in front of the state 
department in three days of protest

the air force is scaling back its expectations 
for the b1b bomber after concluding it will probably be able to 
only half the job it was designed for the director of testing for 
the defense department says 
john e krings told a meeting of two house armed services 
subcommittees that the new plane already behind schedule has 
problems in the electronic equipment that enables it to fly close 
to the ground and avoid or confuse enemy radar 
it will accomplish about 50 percent in terms of the gross 
assessment of what it was supposed to do he testified on 
wednesday 
because of the problems combatting radar the air force is 
focusing on a narrower range of threats for the 100 b1bs it is 
buying hoping to develop reliable performance against enemy 
antiaircraft weapons he said its better to have success in a 
limited area than no success in a large area he told the panels

improvements in the weather forecasting system are made at the 
kennedy center weather will loom larger as a threat to a

a prominent proplo leader from the occupied 
territories called for direct talks with israeli representatives 
and said he would even speak with hardline prime minister yitzhak 
shamir 
in a rare dialogue with israeli peace activists faisal husseini 
said the palestinians dream is to have israel as well as the 
occupied lands but they are willing to compromise and split the 
land to end the nightmares 
as a palestinian my problem is with the israelis so i must 
speak with them husseini said wednesday so were willing to 
speak with shamir not because he is a a man of peace but 
because we know this man was chosen by israel to represent them 
as he spoke dozens of antiarab demonstrators stood outside and 
protested against the forum sponsored by the broadbased israeli 
peace movement peace now the palestine liberation organization is 
banned in israel and the protesters held signs saying peace now 
is a knife in the back 
the plo refuses to recognize israel but a recent document drawn 
up by plo spokesman bassam abu sharif called for direct talks with 
israel under the auspices of an international conference 
the document was criticized by extremist factions of the plo 
husseini is a popular figure among residents of the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip and israeli defense minister yitzhak 
rabin once called him the leading plo representative in the areas 
he seemed to back abu sharifs policy 
israeli listeners asked him whether palestinians will be 
satisfied with a state alongside israel and not try to conquer the 
jewish state itself 
indeed i do have a dream he said 
but i am not willing to impose my dreams upon my fellow men 
he said we will have to give up a lot of dreams but also a lot 
of nightmares 
the statements were greeted with loud applause 
husseini director of the east jerusalembased arab studies 
institute was released in july from an israeli jail where he had 
been held without trial for nine months 
before the antioccupation uprising began dec 8 he was 
involved in clandestine talks with moshe amirav a former member of 
the rightwing likud party likud which is fiercely opposed to the 
plo kicked amirav out of the party over the meetings 
amirav leftist parliamentarian yair tzaban and palestinian 
journalist redwan abu ayash who was also released from jail 
without trial recently addressed the unusual gathering with 
husseini 
it was the first public dialogue between israelis and 
palestinians in israel since the uprising started 
tzaban of the small socialist mapam party called on israel to 
acknowledge palestinian nationalism and negotiate with palestinian 
representatives he lashed out at labor party leader shimon peres 
for speaking as though israel could simply return the territories 
to jordan 
israel seized the west bank from jordan in the 1967 middle east 
war 
in recent weeks peres has indicated israel will speak to the 
palestinians if jordans king hussein is not willing to come to the 
negotiating table 
israel doesnt even need peace with jordan tzaban said 
israel needs peace with the palestinians and you cant get that 
by negotiating with swedes americans norwegians or jordanians 
only by negotiating with the palestinians

lawmakers are stuffing their 69 billion 
droughtrelief bill full of electionyear goodies for the folks 
back home and some of the handouts dont even have anything to do 
with the drought 
one provision would provide 24 million to cotton growers in the 
district of rep larry combest rtexas whose crops were damaged 
by hail in 1987 
now rep virginia smith rneb is saying it would be wrong to 
confine 1987 hail payments to texas cotton 
in my district it would be very unfair to the dry edible bean 
people to the sugar beet people to the potato people she said 
wednesday she wants to expand the benefits to 40 million 
agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza dtexas 
says the same kind of scramble would have occurred even if there 
were no elections coming up in november 
every year is basically an election year in this place he 
said it happens all the time every time you have a bill like 
this every member becomes provincial and protective of his 
interests 
lawmakers say fiscal watchdogs have nothing to complain about as 
long as the aid does not exceed the 75 billion in farm program 
savings that economists believe will be generated by the drought 
the bills major provision would furnish farmers with payments 
equal to 65 percent of earnings lost because of damage to crops in 
excess of 35 percent of expected yield it also would provide 
expanded government feed benefits to dairy and livestock producers 
but that only scratches the surface 
under heavy debate is a provision to increase the dairy price 
support level by 50 cents for each hundred pounds of milk this 
boon for milk producers and dairy cooperatives is the brainchild of 
rep jim jeffords rvt who is running for the senate from a 
state that is a major source of the east coasts milk supply 
jeffords says the action which would raise consumer prices by a 
few cents a gallon is needed for avert milk shortages 
critics scoff at that claim citing government forecasts of 
ample milk but jeffords stands his ground 
it is our duty to assure an adequate supply of milk he 
declares 
if his plan falters an alternative that would make the increase 
temporary is being sponsored by reps steve gunderson rwis and 
tim penny dminn 
the senate pushing its own version has incorporated a 
provision that would aid manufacturers of ethanol the alcohol fuel 
made in part from corn 
it would allow ethanol makers to buy government surplus corn at 
110 percent of the price the agriculture department paid much of 
the surplus was acquired long before drought sent prices zooming 
the provision could mean a government subsidy of as much as 2 
million a month for domestic ethanol manufacturers including the 
archer daniels midland co of decatur ill which makes the lions 
share of domestic ethanol 
but sen tom daschle dsd the sponsor says the idea is to 
provide corn to a variety of small ethanol companies in danger of 
going broke 
adm doesnt even want this amendment daschle said he said 
a 2 million benefit would represent a small fraction of what 
their capacity is to produce 
he said junking the plan could actually help adm which is a 
hefty contributor to campaigns of agriculture committee members 
daschle included 
you know what theyd get if they dont get this said 
daschle as i understand it if all these small plants closed 
theyd adm get all the business 
when the house was first drafting its bill a few weeks ago rep 
harley o staggers jr dwva tacked on a provision to allow the 
secretary of agriculture on a discretionary basis to pay half of 
seeding costs for droughtburned pastures 
but as the agriculture committee was putting finishing touches 
on the bill rep claude harris dala won approval of a change 
that would flatly require the government to pay half of the bills 
the measure also could prove a boon to the fertilizer industry 
because 50 percent of fertilizer costs would be paid under the 
harris amendment de la garza called for junking the plan after 
staff economists estimated a 12 billion price tag 
meanwhile rep bill schuette rmich is planning an amendment 
that would provide federal loan guarantees for droughtstricken 
farmers he says he is still unsure of the price tag 
would it cover peach orchards would it cover apple 
orchards rep delbert latta rohio asked at wednesdays rules 
committee session 
that there is something for almost everything in the bill became 
clear when de la garza was asked exactly which types of livestock 
would be covered by the measures feed provisions he thought for a 
moment and then smiling broadly said 
cows to catfish and anything in between

congress is speeding 69 billion in drought 
assistance toward president reagans desk with agriculture 
secretary richard lyng calling on lawmakers to jettison a 300 
million benefit for milk producers 
we strongly object to the provision which would increase the 
price support level for milk and urge the house to strike this 
provision from the bill on the floor lyng said wednesday 
in a letter to house agriculture committee chairman e kika 
de la garza dtexas the secretary dismissed dairy industry claims 
that the price boost is needed to head off a looming milk shortage 
and he placed the cost of the increase at 300 million more than 
double the house estimate 
we do not expect milk shortages next year lyng said as both 
the house and senate prepared to act on their versions of the 
measure to provide aid to farmers hard hit by the drought 
farm lawmakers plan to meet in a housesenate conference 
committee next week to fashion the final product and send it to 
reagan before aug 11 when congress flees washingtons summer heat 
at the core of both versions is a payment program that would 
provide droughtstricken farmers with compensation equal to 65 
percent of crop losses beyond 35 percent of their expected harvest 
the plan also would streamline and expand federal feed benefits for 
dairy and livestock producers 
under heavy fire from the reagan administration and a host of 
rival farm and business groups is a house provision that would 
increase the dairy price support level on oct 1 by 50 cents for 
each 100 pounds of milk to 1110 
both bills would cancel a 50cent cut in the pricesupport level 
that otherwise would be automatic under the farm program 
rep james jeffords rvt sponsor of the increase and rep 
charles stenholm dtexas have been urging the idea as a way of 
heading off a milk shortage next year 
anticipating an intense fight over the jeffords provision dairy 
supporters have readied a fallback provision that would put in 
place a temporary pricesupport increase the plan sponsored by 
reps steve gunderson rwis and tim penny dminn was 
reportedly gaining steam in the house 
meanwhile rep charles schumer dny a persistent critic of 
excess spending on agricultural programs called for barring 
farmers with 1 million in revenue from receiving drought benefits 
provided by the legislation 
im suggesting that if they are that successful they probably 
dont need a subsidy the brooklyn lawmaker said schumer said 
his amendment would deny benefits to farmers if their gross 
revenues totaled 1 million even if their net earnings were far 
less 
under the relief bill payments would be made for losses of a 
wide variety of crops including an estimated 150 million for 
tobacco 
tobaccostate lawmakers acknowledged that it thus represented a 
step away from the 1983 compromise between farm lawmakers and 
antismoking forces under which the tobacco pricesupport system is 
supposed to have no net cost to the taxpayer 
its because of the special situation of the drought said 
rep charles rose dnc chairman of the house tobacco and 
peanuts subcommittee 
to be providing 150 million because a crop that kills people 
is damaged and spending less than 1 percent of that on educating 
people about the hazards of tobacco is really an example of having 
priorities upside down said john f banzhaf ii director of 
action on smoking and health one of the nations major 
antismoking organizations

questioned him about the march 16 disappearance 
ms jones said she would prove elmore and his wife argued and 
then drove to the exmouth naval pier 500 miles north of perth 
where somehow she just fell and rolled off the pier into the 
water 
instead of going to help her elmore went home and went to 
bed jones said he figured his wife could swim back to the end 
of the pier and walk the 10 miles back home 
ms jones said she would produce 38 witnesses and evidence about 
marital problems including testimony that elmore after drinking 
was overheard to say he would like to cut up his wife and throw her 
to the sharks 
it is something he had been planning ever since he decided he 
was sorry he married her ms jones said this was a 
premeditated murder of his wife a wife he had grown tired of 
jones said that because of elmores work as a boatswains mate 
he knew about tides in the area and that the waters were 
sharkinfested 
that is why he was so sure he would never see bella again 
she said 
the case is continuing

a newlywed says she and her husband were 
blinded by love 3 months ago when they disappeared from 
chicago sparking a manhunt after their deserted car was found 
ransacked with its engine running 
scott swanson 23 and his wife carolyn 22 said they dashed 
off to san diego shortly after they eloped because some relatives 
apparently disapproved of their skipping a traditional marriage 
ceremony they also said they just wanted to spend time together 
call it shortsighted or call it what you want to but love is 
blind and i know that sounds trite ms swanson said at a news 
conference after being reunited with her parents jim and kathy 
maclean of haddonfield nj 
so much has come out of it that has been great but then to 
see the look on my mothers face and my dads face i mean 
i cant stand the hurt that ive caused she said tearfully 
the newlyweds vanished april 2 without telling relatives or 
classmates at a suburban evangelical college 
during a resulting threestate police investigation friends at 
wheaton college held prayer vigils put up posters and questioned 
people at roadside restaurants and gas stations 
we are tremendously sorry for the hurt and the pain weve 
caused to our families to our friends and loved ones and 
relatives swanson said we never realized that the story would 
have the ramifications it has 
the couple left their car near a police station with the keys 
under the mat and their identification cards swanson said we 
didnt want to be traced 
the bmw was found ransacked in an alley its motor running 
police eventually determined that the couple had planned to 
vanish but families and friends feared foul play 
the macleans said they followed the uproar over their 
disappearance through frontpage stories in chicago newspapers at a 
university library meanwhile they both got jobs at a suburban la 
jolla delicatessen 
they were not seen or heard from until they sent letters to 
their parents and contacted the macleans by telephone tuesday 
we hoped to let things die down a bit to let the 
investigation settle then we could slip in unnoticed swanson 
said 
we were afraid to come back and we felt we had done the right 
thing to begin with we needed to wait on our decision until the 
right time within ourselves to come back he said 
swanson said his familys reaction to the wedding was in part 
responsible for their decision he said they eloped simply for 
the spiritualness of it and not for the wedding the large 
production of it 
we werent clearminded why we did what we did but in the 
time of what we did it seemed the best thing to do 
his wife said were so in love and we wanted to get away from 
the adornment and the material world and develop our relationship 
together apart from that and we did that and were so much 
stronger as a result of it 
her parents arrived in san diego on wednesday afternoon swanson 
said he had contacted his parents who were vacationing 
obviously were excited and thrilled to be here together 
said maclean standing beside his wife daughter and soninlaw 
asked if he was upset with his daughter and soninlaw maclean 
said im a father i dont think they ran from us 
chicago police cmdr ettore divito who headed the 
investigation said police may try to recover the costs of their 
efforts 
we are disheartened that wed expended so many manhours he 
said but added as far as i know there is no criminal activity 
involved in the case 
swanson said he will bear responsibility for all that has 
happened 
the couple said they werent sure whether they would return to 
chicago swanson had been scheduled to graduate in may ms 
swanson a junior was set to graduate in december 
in chicago news of the couples reappearance shocked but 
delighted their friends and those who took part in the police 
search which encompassed parts of illinois michigan and indiana 
randy brandt said he handed out leaflets in chicago that sought 
leads on the disappearance he said he wasnt bitter just baffled 
thats not the approach i would have taken brandt said 
its definitely unique though

an investigation of an unusual genetic 
mutation that changes the pigmentation of mice could offer insights 
into the development of a deadly form of skin cancer in humans a 
researcher says 
murray brilliant a geneticist at the jackson laboratory in bar 
harbor said wednesday the technique he developed to study the 
mutation in mice also could be used to study genetic mutations in 
humans 
its a way to get at many mutations of potential medical 
importance to humans said brilliant 
the mutation in mice affects the pigmentation of cells called 
melanocytes studies of the mutation may help explain how 
melanocytes develop normally he said 
you have to know how this works normally to know what goes 
wrong in cancer said brilliant who did the research in 
connection with eva eicher another geneticist at jackson 
laboratory 
when the growth of melanocytes goes awry in humans the result 
is melanoma a skin cancer that is often fatal 
furthermore brilliant said the study of the mutation in the 
melanocyte pigmentation gene could help researchers understand 
other genetic defects 
the information from this line of research is being applied to 
gain access to a closely linked gene which when mutated causes 
cleft palate in mice brilliant said whether that will help 
explain the occurrence of cleft palate in humans is not known 
brilliant said 
the mutation brilliant studied in mice is called the pink 
unstable mutation it has the highest mutation rate of any gene 
known in mammals 
up to one in 10 of the offspring of a parent with the pink 
unstable mutation will suffer a new mutation of the gene brilliant 
said 
the gene is related to pigmentation in the mice when the gene 
is normal mice are black when the gene is mutated the mice are 
creamcolored with pink eyes 
but one in 10 to one in 40 of the offspring of the 
creamcolored pinkeyed mice will have black patches of fur 
brilliant said as the gene mutates again reverting back to its 
original form 
if such mottled mice are bred again some of their offspring 
will be black as the gene further reverts to its normal form 
melanoma is caused by mutations in genes that affect the 
development of pigmentcarrying cells and thus these mouse studies 
may someday help doctors understand how melanoma arises brilliant 
said 
brilliant studied the mutation using a new technique he 
developed in which he looks for variations in repeating pieces of 
genetic material that are scattered throughout the mouses genes 
similar examination of repeating pieces of genetic material in 
human genes can be used to find genetic mutations in humans he 
said

concern about aids has not decreased sexual 
activity among unmarried women since 1982 but has helped increased 
their use of condoms a nationwide survey suggests 
seventysix percent of unmarried women ages 18 to 44 were 
sexually active last year compared with 71 percent in 1982 the 
survey estimates 
the study was conducted by jacqueline darroch forrest of the 
alan guttmacher institute which studies fertility issues and 
richard fordyce of ortho pharmaceutical corp of raritan nj 
it appears in the current issue of the institutes publication 
family planning perspectives 
the paper says the estimates should be accurate within 2 
percentage points but forrest said that estimates of sexual 
activity may be low 
the researchers compared 1982 and 1987 nationwide surveys 
commissioned by ortho the surveys asked a variety of questions 
about contraception and included married and unmarried women 
for 1987 questionnaires were completed by 60 percent of 
unmarried women who received them giving data from 2465 women 
researchers estimated that for unmarried women ages 18 to 44 15 
percent have never had sex and 9 percent have had only infrequent 
sex leaving 76 percent considered sexually active forrest said 
the same kind of calculation yielded the 71 percent for 1982 she 
said 
increases in sexual activity may mean young adults believe they 
can avoid getting acquired immune deficiency syndrome through 
sexual contact that they can judge a persons health by appearance 
and that they are protecting themselves by choosing only apparently 
healthy people as partners researchers said 
the study also found that condoms were used by 16 percent of 
unmarried women ages 18 to 44 and at risk for unintended pregnancy 
an increase from 9 percent researchers cited publicity about the 
condoms effectiveness in preventing spread of sexually transmitted 
diseasese especially aids 
susan kegeles a research psychologist at the university of 
california san francisco said wednesday she is not surprised by 
the reported levels of sexual activity 
i think heterosexuals are just not feeling terribly at risk 
for aids she said 
she called the reported increase in condom use terrific and 
said the trend must continue men and women should feel they can 
tell a partner they insist on condoms as a routine matter she said 
forrest said despite the condom trend the 1987 level of use 
remains low 
susan tew spokeswoman for the guttmacher institute said the 
study focused on women because thats all we have data on

as an ivy league elitist 
bush the certain republican nominee told the editorial board 
of usa today that his family life has been something so private 
and so special that i havent felt like sharing it 
at this level of american politics i have to open up a little 
and share so at our convention you will see five bush children 
their five spouses and our 10 grandchildren bush said in the 
interview which took place wednesday 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis speaks 
spanish i wish i did bush said but i have three 
grandchildren my blood coursing through their veins who are half 
mexican ive never shared this 
he said the thoughts about his familys public role were raised 
by the recent democratic national convention where dukakis former 
contender jesse jackson and others spoke of family values and 
appeared publicly with relatives 
we saw a good show there in terms of family very good from 
the heart genuine bush said i havent felt too comfortable

bush represented the united states government last week at a 
united nations security council meeting on the us downing of an 
iranian commercial airliner carrying 290 people iran has since 
said it will recognize a un resolution calling for a cease fire

prime minister margaret thatcher said she wont 
see a united states of europe and hopes it will never come to pass 
and she rejected calls for uniform taxes and a central bank for the 
12nation european economic community 
mrs thatcher in a radio interview wednesday said officials 
proposing a federal government for western europe spend far too 
much time talking about these airyfairy ideas 
they say lets have european union i say what do you mean 
because i cant see any of you dissolving your own countries into a 
united states of europe mrs thatcher said 
the 62yearold prime minister said a united states of europe 
would never come in my lifetime and i hope never at all 
it was her most outspoken criticism yet of what she regards as 
impractical overenthusiasm for a european federation she spoke on 
the british broadcasting corps jimmy young show a mixture of 
chatty interviews and popular music aimed mainly at housewives 
jacques delors president of the european economic communitys 
brusselsbased executive commission refused to comment on the 
interview 
delors in a speech to the european parliament on july 6 
predicted that within 10 years 80 percent of social and economic 
legislation in the eec area would be passed on a europewide basis 
rather than in the national parliaments of the member states 
but mrs thatcher long accused of an insular attitude toward 
the rest of europe said in the wednesday radio interview i 
think he was wrong i think he went over the top i dont think he 
should have said it 
last week the prime minister replaced britains eec 
commissioner lord cockfield who was masterminding an alignment of 
sales taxes throughout the trading bloc a move mrs thatcher 
opposed 
alignment of taxes is part of preparations for 1992 when the 
eec is due to become a single market without trade barriers 
as for an eec central bank she said that would mean 
surrendering fundamental economic decisions to another country 
that i will not do 
mrs thatcher argued she is simply being practical about the 
limits of a european union which she said could never function 
like the united states 
the whole history of the two places is entirely different 
she said it is not possible to have a united states of europe 
what is possible is for the 12 countries of europe steadily to work 
more closely together on things we do better together so that we 
can trade better together 
opinion polls show british voters are less enthusiastic about 
closer ties within the eec than for example the west germans or 
the french

the house banking committee early today ended 
a grueling 16hour session by approving a farreaching bill 
described as the most significant change in banking law since the 
depression 
the bill if adopted by the full congress and signed into law by 
president reagan would allow bank holding companies to underwrite 
virtually every type of security except corporate stock 
however the legislation includes a laundry list of other 
provisions banks strongly oppose including new obligations to 
serve poor people 
and because of the electionshortened legislative calendar and 
the jurisdictional rules of the house the bill faces an uncertain 
future 
the committee voted for the final measure 3020 with all but 
three democrats in favor and all but three republicans opposed 
from the banking committee it goes to the energy and commerce 
committee chaired by rep john d dingell dmich who has 
expressed skepticism of banks entering the securities business 
depending on what kind of deadline house speaker jim wright 
dtexas sets dingell could kill the bill through delay or exact 
concessions by threatening delay 
after aug 12 congress plans to be in session only from sept 6 
to oct 5 leaving little time for a banking bill to pass the full 
house and be reconciled with legislation that passed the senate 
942 on march 30 
banks long have sought to reenter the securities business from 
which they have been barred by the depressionera glasssteagall 
act for more than 50 years 
as originally drafted by the committee chairman rep fernand j 
st germain dri the bill would not have permitted bank holding 
companies to underwrite mutual funds or corporate bonds later 
convertible to stock 
however those provisions were added by 3514 and 2723 votes 
respectively 
other securities activities permitted by the bill include the 
underwriting of corporate bonds commercial paper municipal 
revenue bonds and securities backed by mortgages and other consumer 
debt such as auto loans 
rep chalmers wylie of ohio the ranking republican on the 
committee failed in an attempt to persuade the committee to move 
more slowly 
this bill will have a greater impact than any other piece of 
legislation since the reforms passed nearly 60 years ago wylie 
said i believe the changes should be made cautiously and not all 
at once 
he also sought to kill provisions described as proconsumer that 
banks would be required to accept in exchange for the new powers 
he argued that the requirements would hurt the soundness of the 
banking system and ultimately cost consumers 
republican opposition to the consumer sections threatened 
committee passage of the bill until an hourlong negotiating 
session behind closed doors after midnight 
democrats agreed to accept some watering down of the consumer 
provisions and in exchange three republicans steve bartlett of 
texas john hiler of indiana and thomas ridge of pennsylvania 
voted in favor of the bill 
it requires banks to serve poor people by providing lowcost 
lifeline checking services for accounts between 25 and 1000 
and it requires banks to open special accounts for the cashing of 
government checks such as social security and welfare checks with 
a cashing charge of no more than 2 
it also requires banks to show a good record of serving poor 
communities in their lending area before getting permission from 
the federal reserve board to exercise new powers 
however in an exemption sought by the republicans agricultural 
banks with less than 50 million in assets about 2600 of the 
nations 14000 commercial banks would be exempted from the last 
requirement 
also the limit on the size of government checks that banks 
would be required to cash was lowered from 3000 to 1500 
other provisions opposed by banking interests include a twoyear 
moratorium on further bank expansion into the real estate business 
a ban on banks moving into insurance underwriting and severe limits 
on the number of banks that can sell insurance underwritten by 
other companies 
edward yingling chief lobbyist for the american bankers 
association said it was too soon to say if the banking industry 
will support the legislation 
the bill improved considerably during the committee session 
but it still has a number of major problems including some 
very burdensome consumer provisions he said 
toward the end of the long session which began at 10 am 
wednesday and ended at 230 am thursday several committee 
members dozed in their chairs the final compromise on the consumer 
provisions left committee members blearyeyed and a bit giddy 
when the committee defeated an amendment that would have 
required banks to offer special savings accounts for children one 
member shouted its a good thing the little devils are all in 
bed 
st germain after the final committee vote exclaimed 
hallelujah

the first international chess master to be 
beaten by a computer says he wants a rematch before the machines 
become invincible against humans 
id like to try for revenge while i can the way theyre 
improving one has the feeling that in a few years they will be 
much better penn state university math professor edward formanek 
said wednesday 
the no 1 seed in the tournament was defeated here sunday for 
the pennsylvania state chess association championship by hitech a 
carnegie mellon university creation that played its first game in 
may 1985 
hitech was the first machine to become a senior master the top 
national title before international ranking according to the 
tournament director 
it played some flashy moves in the end game thats where it 
played like a human said formanek who has played chess 28 years 
the computer appeared to dally for 10 or 15 moves then committed 
itself to a tactic that seemed questionable but proved to be a 
winner he said 
i can see why it waited formanek said 
carnegie mellon computer researcher hans berliner faculty 
adviser to hitechs team of student handlers said the machine 
played beautifully against formanek 
i wasnt real impressed with its play i thought it could have 
played a little more interesting types of games it grinds them 
out said tournament director thomas magar a chess master 
there are times when it makes moves that i have to shake my 
head at magar said sometimes theyre just dull moves other 
times it plays some positions that human players would say thats 
too risky 
hitechs new rating of 2405 points makes it a senior master it 
is the first computer to earn the title and the first to defeat an 
international master in tournament play magar said 
the computer which finished in a tie for first place in the 
1987 state championship is unlikely to gain international status 
because the world chess federation isnt real happy about 
computers playing chess magar said 
the us chess federation which sanctioned the state 
tournament recognizes the machines in its standings but also 
accommodates tournaments whose organizers ban the electronic 
players he said 
berliner claims hitech is superior to other chess computers 
because it can recognize patterns among various clusters of pieces 
on the board 
together with its blinding speed that accounts for its 
success he said 
hitech reviews the possibilities for moving its pieces each 
turn the computer can consider about 160000 possibilities every 
second and may consider 20 million different moves before dictating 
on a printer the next move said berliner who moved the pieces in 
the state tournament 
the machine is a university project in artificial intelligence 
but hitech is far from being able to reason and to learn 
thats too hard berliner said to be able to learn you 
have to be able to conceptualize and all that

president corazon aquinos executive 
secretary confirmed today that ferdinand marcos offered to pay 5 
billion to return home but said her staff recommended that the 
offer be rejected 
executive secretary catalino macaraig told reporters he believed 
the offer was a ploy by the deposed president to avoid criminal 
indictment in the united states 
we saw it for what it was macaraig said it was just a 
ploy to get his us indictment against him suspended i 
recommended the rejection of the five billion dollar offer 
macaraig did not say whether mrs aquino accepted the advice on 
wednesday she told reporters marcos should send the money first 
and then well talk 
mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos and his family to return 
from hawaii where they fled after a february 1986 popular uprising 
toppled his 20year administration 
her government alleges that he stole about 10 billion from the 
phillipines treasury 
in new york the village voice reported this month that us 
attorney rudolph giuliani had recommended that marcos and his wife 
imelda be indicted on fraud and conspiracy charges in connection 
with acquisition of real estate in new york 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed later that the 
white house had asked to be consulted before the justice department 
sought any indictment against marcos 
in a statement tuesday from hawaii marcos said negotiations 
about his return were taking place but denied he had offered to 
pay the money in exchange for permission to return to the 
philippines with immunity from prosecution 
but macaraig said the offer by the ousted president was relayed 
earlier this month by emmanuel pelaez philippine ambassador to 
washington 
macaraig said pelaez told him he had been approached by two 
americans about the marcos offer and relayed it to manila macaraig 
identified one of them as james mcgregor a political science 
professor at the university of california at los angeles 
macaraig said he could not remember the other americans name 
on wednesday boston university professor allen weinstein said 
the 5 billion offer was in a proposal brought to him by a marcos 
representative and was part of the substance of a letter to him 
from marcos 
i was approached last month in washington by a representative 
of former president marcos with a list of proposed agreement 
points for an arrangement which would allow his return to the 
philippines said weinstein 
the points were conditioned by an offer on his part to accept 
the legitimacy of the aquino government stay out of politics 
throw his support behind aquino and provide her government with 5 
billion weinstein added 
weinstein identified the marcos emissary as jay hoffman a 
california advertising man 
weinstein declined to comment on marcos denial a source close 
to the discussions with marcos insisting on anonymity said the 
ousted presidents statement appeared worded to provide him 
deniability 
weinstein is president of the washingtonbased center for 
democracy a nonpartisan us organization promoting democracy 
abroad and was a member of the us observer team to the 1986 
philippine elections 
hoffman returned on july 13 with two letters signed by marcos 
one addressed to president aquino and one addressed to weinstein 
which outlined what i view as mr marcos personal petition to 
the philippine government said weinstein 
i sent president aquinos letter to manila assured that it 
would reach her along with the substance including the 5 billion 
figure of what was contained in the letter to me weinstein said 
a source knowledgeable of the weinsteinhoffman contacts said 
the 5 billion was explicitly mentioned in marcos letter to 
weinstein but not in the one to president aquino

investors who jumped into the agricultural 
commodity markets when the midwestern drought became apparent last 
spring have been scrambling for the exit doors since the weather 
changed for the wetter analysts say 
with crop conditions either static or improving prices for 
future delivery of grains and soybeans have dropped off sharply 
this is not a good market for speculators anymore said 
katharina zimmer grain market analyst for merrill lynch capital 
markets inc 
the drop in crop futures prices has spilled over into the 
livestock and sugar futures markets prompting some economists to 
lower their monthold projections for 1989 food inflation from 
about 7 percent to 6 percent or less 
that may be good news for consumers but its not much 
consolation for the speculators who bet on rising crop prices and 
failed to collect when the markets peaked late last month and early 
this month 
the ensuing decline accelerated last week into a tailspin that 
ended tuesday with soybeans for august delivery at 755 a bushel 
a 31 percent drop from the contracts high of 1093 reached june 
23 the value of a 5000bushel soybean contract plunged nearly 
17000 during the period 
august corn settled tuesday at 287 a bushel down 21 percent 
from its high of 364 on july 5 
the reason for the collapse rain 
after 2 months of unseasonable heat and little water in the 
corn belt the midwestern weather suddenly turned friendly to the 
struggling crops about two weeks ago five days of scattered 
showers were followed by cool temperatures more rain and more cool 
weather 
the change turned this market on a dime said rich feltes 
chief grain market analyst for refco inc a large chicagobased 
speculative trading firm 
trees dont grow to the sky and this certainly is a reminder 
of that old trading adage feltes said things dont go up 
forever 
soybean futures best illustrate the rise and fall of the 
agricultural commodities because the nations relatively small 
soybean stockpile has made that market extremely sensitive to 
changing weather patterns during the growing season 
speculative interest in soybeans began mounting in april after 
the agriculture department predicted us soybean inventories would 
total about 290 million bushels when the new marketing year begins 
sept 1 down from 436 million bushels a year earlier 
on april 4 august soybean futures settled at 680 a bushel on 
the chicago board of trade speculators who bought in at that price 
and sold just before the market peaked realized enormous profits 
they could sell today and still come out ahead 
analysts say the biggest losers were speculators who bought into 
the soybean market at about 9 a bushel in midjune and were 
determined not to sell until prices topped 11 
soybeans never went that high and by the second week in july 
those investors were losing money on paper many have been forced 
to sell at a loss 
people bought on emotion rather than on supply and demand and 
lo and behold those speculators are out now said steve bruce 
an analyst with gelderman inc a chicago trading firm that caters 
to commercial processors of grain

main engines 
we got behind in the schedule and never made up the time 
lisa malone a spokeswoman for the national aeronautics and space 
administration said wednesday we wanted to be sure we were 
clean when we went into the tanking 
the tanking refers to the loading of half a million gallons of 
propellant into discoverys external fuel tank during the first of 
a twopart countdown leading to the testfiring 
the fueling was rescheduled for tonight with the countdown then 
set to move down to 10 seconds before a mock liftoff on friday 
morning at that point a simulated problem is to force a 
launch postponement and the launch team is to empty the fuel 
tank start a new countdown refill the tank and aim for the engine 
firing at 730 am monday 
the 20second ignition will test modifications made to the 
engines since the explosion of shuttle challenger on jan 28 1986 
and is considered essential to certifying discovery for the first 
postchallenger shuttle flight 
nasa is moving ahead with the testfiring while still attempting 
to fix a small gas leak in a vent line associated with a steering 
engine that is separate from the main engines 
engineers hope to be able to make a repair without taking 
discovery off the pad and into a hangar a move that could delay 
the launch now officially set for early september as much as two 
months 
officials concede that even if the leak can be fixed on the pad 
the launch likely will slip into the second half of september 
several onpad repair approaches have been tested and the 
engineers appear to be favoring one in which a 20squareinch hole 
is cut in the rear wall of discoverys cargo bay 
cutting the hole would enable them to reach the 
otherwiseinaccessible leak which is in an engine compartment 
they could either tighten the fitting or enclose the leak with a 
clamshell device filled with an epoxy sealant 
specialists still are testing a method in which a device 
resembling a badminton shuttlecock would be pushed into the 
27footlong vent line trailing a sealing agent 
nasa could select one of the methods as a prime candidate as 
early as today but no decision on whether or not to roll discovery 
off the pad will be made until after the main engine firing

new teamsters president william j mccarthy 
said in a 1984 conversation that he needed permission from a 
reputed organized crime boss before he could advance in the union 
the los angeles times reported today 
in addition mccarthys name was mentioned at a meeting between 
reputed new york mobster anthony fat tony salerno and alleged 
cleveland mob figure john peanuts tronolone in a discussion 
secretly monitored by the fbi the newspaper said 
the report was the first public indication of any links between 
organized crime and mccarthy who was chosen a few weeks ago by the 
unions executive board to succeed jackie presser as president 
presser died this month while under indictment on payroll padding 
charges 
mccarthy had told presser he wanted to be general 
secretarytreasurer of the union but needed the approval and 
backing of raymond ls patriarca the late reputed head of the new 
england mob according to an fbi memo obtained by the times 
the april 19 1984 memo was addressed to oliver b revell 
thenassistant director in charge of the fbis criminal 
investigative division it said that presser an informant on mob 
matters for 10 years had told fbi agents that he had the 
conversation with mccarthy in early april 1984 
mccarthy has declined to comment about the matter a spokesman 
duke zeller said wednesday that mccarthy may have a statement this 
week 
the fbi memo has remained secret since it was drafted but is

cambodias vietnaminstalled government 
and delegates of the khmer rouge guerrillas clashed at peace talks 
that ended today and a settlement of the 9yearold civil war 
remained elusive participants said 
one participant foreign minister suppiah dhanabalan of 
singapore said the four cambodian factions remained quite far 
apart after four days of informal talks 
the talks brought together vietnam the nominal coalition of 
three guerrilla groups opposing its occupation of cambodia the 
phnom penh government and vietnams close ally laos 
also attending were representatives of the association of 
southeast asian nations which backs the guerrillas thailand 
singapore indonesia malaysia the philippines and brunei 
working groups of senior officials of all the parties are to be 
set up to discuss specific issues by years end the groups are to 
make recommendations on holding another round of talks 
the guerrilla leaders were khieu samphan of the communist khmer 
rouge son sann of the noncommunist khmer peoples national 
liberation front and prince norodom ranariddh representing his 
father former cambodian monarch prince nordom sihanouk 
vietnam maintains more than 100000 troops in cambodia to fight 
the guerrillas but has pledged a total pullout by early 1990 that 
led to the bogor talks and an anxious search for a political 
solution to prevent a bloodier civil war 
vietnams delegate foreign minister nguyen co thach said he 
was half happy with the talks we are determined to have a 
political solution before the end of 1990 he said 
a closing statement by the host indonesian foreign minister ali 
alatas said all participants agreed on the urgent need for a 
political settlement leading to a neutral and nonaligned cambodia 
it said they also agreed on withdrawing vietnamese forces 
preventing the recurrence of genocidal policies and practices 
of the khmer rouge regime and ending foreign arms supplies to the 
warring parties 
the participants also agreed on the need for definite timetables 
and an international presence to supervise these processes the 
statement said 
but khieu samphan said in a statement that it was a shameless 
lie to claim the groups agreed on a wide range of issues 
his statement also appeared to reject any linkage between the 
pullout of vietnamese troops and steps to prevent the khmer rouge 
from returning to power although it said the khmer rouge agreed 
that no single faction should have power it said vietnam must 
withdraw from cambodia unconditionally 
the khmer rouge killed at least a million people in its attempt 
to impose radical agrarian communism when they ruled cambodia from 
1975 until vietnam invaded in late 1978 to end bloody khmer rouge 
attacks on its western border the group is the strongest of the 
three guerrilla groups and reportedly is storing arms for an 
offensive in 1990 
alatas and dhanabalan called the talks a very important 
psychological breakthrough the first time all the parties 
talked facetoface 
however dhanabalan added the points were made with smiles 
with soft words and very diplomatically but if i look at 
the substance i am less sanguine i think more effort is needed 
he said at least two cambodian factions are still quite far 
apart they basically reiterated old positions 
unless there is a genuine attempt on the part of the cambodian 
factions especially two of the factions to compromise on the 
issues and be ready and willing to share in the power structure of 
a future cambodia it will be difficult to make progess 
dhanabalan did not name the two parties but hun sen prime 
minister of the phnom penh government told a news conference of 
his strong disagreements with the khmer rouge 
my party son sann and prince ranariddh have made efforts to 
find common ground he said it was a pity that the khmer rouge 
rejected our proposal 
we proposed a national reconciliation council with sihanouk in 
charge but the khmer rouge rejected it he said we accept 
political participation of the khmer rouge in any political 
solution but not the participation of their army 
in a peace plan presented monday the first day of talks hun 
sen called for elimination of the khmer rouge leadership and 
dissolution of its armed forces 
hun sen also announced today he would meet sihanouk in paris in 
october for a third round of separate talks no significant 
progress was made at their meetings in france last december and 
january and sihanouk later canceled a third round scheduled for 
april in pyongyang north korea 
sihanouk who is considered central in any future cambodian 
government resigned july 10 and refused to attend the bogor talks 
but he met wednesday in jakarta with his guerrilla partners and hun 
sen and issued another peace plan which hun sen said he would give 
due consideration

an army private infected with the 
aids virus was acquitted of aggravated assault charges for having 
sex with three other soldiers but was sentenced to two months 
confinement on two lesser counts 
pvt adrian g morris jr 28 of caseyville ill was found 
guilty wednesday by a military judge of one count of conduct 
bringing discredit upon the army for having sex after his superiors 
counseled him against it 
the judge also found him guilty of one count of sodomy with 
another male private 
he had been accused of threatening the lives of three soldiers 
including two women by having unprotected sex with them although 
he had tested positive for the aids virus 
im glad its over said morris who in march 1987 became 
the first member of the military to be charged with aidsrelated 
offenses 
he said he had anticipated a harsh sentence if convicted 
because of the emotion surrounding the case and the disease 
itself 
but the judge army col raymond d cole deliberated less than 
20 minutes before acquitting morris on three counts of aggravated 
assault and two counts of conduct bringing discredit on the 
military 
i am convinced the accused never intended to harm any of his 
sexual partners cole saidby gods good grace and blind luck 
no one was infected 
cole sentenced morris to two months confinement at fort 
huachuca where he has been restricted for the last 15 months 
ordered him to forfeit 1200 in pay over three months gave him a 
badconduct discharge and ordered him not to have unprotected sex 
col harry c beans iii whose office prosecuted morris said he 
was trying to figure out the judges logic with our failure to 
prove an aggravated assault quite frankly i thought we did it i 
thought we made our case 
but beans added that he wasnt down on the verdict were 
talking about a human being a young soldier here and it really is 
a tragedy 
cole said the governments theory about aggravated assault of a 
sexual partner was revolutionary but not well established 
the judge found morris innocent of aggravated assault involving 
his former fiancee specialist patricia pruitt a soldier 
identified pseudonymously as pfc jane doe and thenpfc anthony 
l baldwin along with conduct charges involving the latter two 
soldiers 
the judge indicated that when morris had sexual contact with 
jane doe and baldwin in late 1986 he was not aware that aids could 
be transmitted through exchange of bodily fluids 
but cole found morris guilty of the single conduct charge for 
resuming unprotected sex with pruitt in january 1987 even though 
he had been given detailed counseling for soldiers who have tested 
positive to the human immunodeficiency virus that causes acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome 
before sentencing morris through a statement read by a defense 
lawyer apologized to his parents for all the embarrassment i 
have brought to the family and to all i have hurt 
he added i never meant to harm anyone 
morris said that on learning of being hivpositive in 1986 my 
first decision was to be celibate but i soon realized this was not 
realistic 
before the sentencing two sergeants testified on morris 
behalf praising his work and character 
legal issues delayed his trial and military courts have tried 
other aidsrelated cases in the interim

iran said its soldiers today crushed a 
force of iraqis and iraqibacked iranian rebels in two days of 
fighting it said left 4000 invaders dead or wounded 
the combatants of islam were able to inflict heavy blows on 
the aggressive enemy and mercenaries of world arrogance said an 
islamic republic news agency dispatch monitored in cyprus 
it said the fighting around the western city of eslamabad 60 
miles from the iraqi border continued against remnants of the 
enemy troops who were surrounded by iranian combatants 
the iranian rebel group the national liberation army earlier 
said in communiques released in baghdad that its fighters seized 
eslamabad and the city of karand killing or wounding 30000 
iranian troops 
the claims could not be verified because foreign reporters are 
allowed into battle areas only on rare guided tours 
in new york iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz met with un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and continued to insist 
on direct negotiations with iran for a ceasefire in the nearly 
8yearold war 
aziz said before the meeting with perez de cuellar that iraq 
shall not be stampeded into making a hasty step 
iran agreed last week to a yearold un ceasefire resolution 
already supported by iraq 
irna said irans air force jet fighters and helicopters today 
heavily pounded the invaders whom it called iraqi troops and 
the outlawed munafiqeen khalq members 
that was a reference to the mujahedeen khalq baghdadbased 
iranian rebels opposed to ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis islamic 
fundamentalist government in a play on words the staterun 
iranian media often refer to them as the munafiqeen the farsi 
word for hypocrite 
the agency gave the casualty figure and reported that 1500 
iraqi troops were killed or wounded in fighting wednesday near the 
southern port city of khorramshahr 
ali riza jafer zada spokesman for the mujahedeen khalq rebels 
based in iraq said wednesday in baghdad that its fighters shot 
down two iranian warplanes and a helicopter gunship in the central 
sector of the warfront 
during previous actions said to involve the mujahedeen khalq 
iran has declared that iraqi soldiers fought the battles and 
allowed the rebels to take the credit no independent observers 
have seen the battles 
the rebel offensive emerged monday from an iraqi invasion that 
began on friday but the rebels apparently advanced while iraqi 
troops were withdrawing 
tehran radio said earlier wednesday that iraqi troops 
entered eslamabad in the morning 
the battle in the region is continuing with utmost intensity 
and the initiative lies with the combatants of islam it said 
iraq which says it is leaving all iranian territory it occupies 
did not comment 
iraq said its jet fighters on wednesday flew 205 sorties 
including an attack on a hawk missile battery east of the karun 
river in southern iran and helicopter gunships flew 73 sorties 
a baghdad military communique said 15 armed iranian boats tried 
to approach an iraqi naval ship and three were sunk in the ensuing 
battle but it did not say where the encounter took place 
iraqi warships are not known to have operated in the gulf for 
years 
irna said iraqi warplanes dropped chemical bombs near bakhtaran 
a provincial capital in the central region 
the iranians frequently accuse iraq of using chemical weapons 
which are banned under the 1925 geneva convention iraq has 
acknowledged their use but claims iran introduced chemical weapons 
to the war

the government today 
temporarily suspended regulations that would require some 
journalists to register or face penalties that include imprisonment 
the regulations which were to take effect sunday drew heavy 
criticism from media groups here and abroad that accused the white 
minority government of making further inroads against press freedom 
stoffel botha minister of home affairs said the registration 
of journalists remains a matter of grave concern for the 
government but that the regulations had been temporarily 
suspended for practical considerations 
he said the regulations would be reviewed but gave no 
indication when he would make a final decision 
the broadly worded strictures say anyone carrying out 
newsagency business must register with the government or face 
a 10year prison term or a 8500 fine 
lawyers say the definition of a news agency is so broad that 
major commerical papers that exchange stories church and political 
groups that publish newsletters and businesses that issue regular 
press statements on their operations could be included if the 
government so desired 
south africas largest news agency the south african press 
association and all major international agencies including the 
associated press were exempted from the regulations 
but local journalists who supply news on a parttime basis to 
some of the worlds major news organizations would be required to 
register if they work for more than one employer which many do 
under the regulations botha would be able to remove journalists 
from the registration list and prevent those people from working in 
the profession if he objects to their reporting 
botha already has broad censorship powers that allow him to 
close down publications and expel foreign journalists 
the latest regulations appear aimed at the small local news 
agencies around the country but most news organizations operating 
in south africa receive reports from the local agencies and would 
be affected as well 
botha has accused the local agencies of endangering public 
safety by reporting unfavorably on police activities forced 
removals of poor blacks and labor disputes in rural areas that are 
not covered regularly by any other news organizations 
the foreign correspondents association of south africa has said 
that even journalists not required to register would be 
compromised because they would be seen as having favored status 
with the government 
stateofemergency regulations already in force restrict 
reporting about unrest security force actions treatment of 
detainees some forms of protest and a broad range of statement the 
government considers subversive 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services

it

the mayor who directed police to 
shoottostop fighting in a park has rescinded the order 
saying it was a scare tactic to prevent hoodlums from taking over 
the city 
i was going to lift the order anyway mayor ba johnson 
said wednesday i just did it a day early i think we got our 
point across 
after a sunday brawl among youths using sticks as weapons 
johnson told police officers to shoot from the waist down 
anyone caught fighting in the park 
he said he issued the order to get the attention of hoodlums 
from the wadley area who were making a fighting ring of the 12acre 
hope williams memorial park in this eastcentral georgia city of 
2500 residents 
johnson who once ordered police to shoot burglars and also 
ordered them to shoot stray dogs said as part of the attempt to 
stop brawls in the park the fine for fighting was going to be 
increased from 7150 to 125 
certainly they police did not plan to shoot anybody 
johnson said wednesday i had not intended to shoot them anyway 
it was issued temporarily i didnt think it would take very long 
for those young people to get the idea we meant business 
it is merely to warn and to threaten and to let them know they 
are not going to take over the city

the united states and vietnam appear 
ready to intensify efforts to search together and account for 1761 
americans still missing from the vietnam war the us embassy said 
today 
an embassy statement said experts from both countries meeting 
over the past four days discussed plans to work on concerted 
efforts within the next three months to make significant progress 
to resolve the divisive issue 
the two sides which met in hanoi reviewed arrangements for 
joint investigative survey and excavation activities during the 
period 
the statement described the meetings as quite productive and 
we look forward to greatly expanded cooperation in coming months 
members of the us team which returned from hanoi today will 
discuss implementation of the joint searches in washington the 
statement said 
the vietnam war ended in april 1975 with a communist victory 
over the usbacked south vietnamese government 
in recent months vietnam has made significant moves to resolve 
the mia issue it said this month that it would try to resolve 70 
priority cases this year and welcome more joint excavations of 
warplane crash sites 
facing a ruinous economy and shunned by the noncommunist world 
for its invasion of cambodia hanoi has been making efforts at 
building some bridges to the united states and other western and 
asian nations 
hanoi has withdrawn some of its forces from cambodia and 
participated in the indonesiansponsored talks to find a political 
solution to the cambodian conflict 
the us technical team to the hanoi talks was led by lt col 
joe harvey of the joint casualty resolution center and was joined 
by representatives of the us central identification laboratory 
both units are based in hawaii 
the talks were agreed upon during a meeting at the united 
nations june 8 between foreign minister nguyen co thach of vietnam 
and retired gen john w vessey who last august reached an 
agreement with hanoi for an accelerated search for mias especially 
the 70 on washingtons priority list 
the united states in turn promised to consider vietnams 
humanitarian problems 
the priority cases are those the united states considers most 
easily resolvable because it says the vietnamese have information 
on them these include cases where there are photographs of airmen 
taken after their capture during the war 
since the vessey agreement hanoi has on five occasions turned 
over to the united states remains it identified as those of us 
servicemen killed in the war the last turnover involving 25 
remains was on july 13 
since the war ended vietnam has returned more than 150 sets of 
remains that the army laboratory confirmed as those of americans 
vietnam says it has returned the remains of 241 americans and 
information on 45 others whose remains were determined to be no 
longer in existence 
vietnam has denied charges by some american private citizens 
that it is holding live americans as prisoners

the secretarygeneral said he was very 
sober on prospects for securing a truce in the iraniraq war 
after the first day of peace talks javier perez de cuellar also 
pressed iran on the issue of western hostages held in lebanon 
iran said its soldiers today crushed a force of iraqis and 
iraqibacked iranian rebels in two days of fighting it said 4000 
enemy soldiers were killed or wounded 
the islamic republic news agency said the fighting around the 
western city of eslamabad 60 miles from the iraqi border 
continued against remnants of the enemy troops who were 
surrounded by iranian combatants 
in his first full day of separate truce talks with the 
belligerents foreign ministers perez de cuellar met for two hours 
wednesday with both tariq aziz of iraq and ali akbar velayati of 
iran 
aziz said iraq which has continued attacks on iran despite 
tehrans acceptance last week of a yearold un ceasefire 
resolution still wants facetoface talks with iran and will not 
be stampeded into a settlement 
iraq announced that it would honor resolution 598 almost 
immediately after the security council passed it last summer 
perez de cuellar said he raised with velayati on wednesday the 
issue of the 18 foreign hostages half of them american believed 
held by proiranian shiite moslem militants in lebanon 
this is a question on which one has to be very discreet he 
told reporters afterwards i raised it very very specifically 
he did not disclose the iranian envoys response and velayati 
did not answer questions about the hostages 
earlier wednesday the un chief told reporters he thought the 
iranians might assert their possible influence in order to have 
this problem out of the way for humanitarian and political 
reasons 
the peruvian said he presented to both sides wednesday the same 
ideas for implementing a ceasefire in the 8yearold war and was 
very sober in his assessment of progress no formal meetings 
were scheduled for today 
perez de cuellar said he could not require direct talks if iran 
objects iran has refused facetoface negotiations but has left 
the door open to a request by the secretarygeneral 
aziz said that if iran does not accept direct talks that means 
that they are not sincere about peace 
some diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said iraqs 
stubbornness its continuing military offensive and its alleged use 
of outlawed chemical warfare were hampering negotiations 
they noted that aziz described his official visit with the 
secretarygeneral as a courtesy call while un officials said 
it was substantive 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati charged that iraq 
was procrastinating and sabotaging un peace efforts he said iraq 
was using chemical warfare and he lodged a protest with the 
security council 
how can we take the iraqis seriously when they are using 
chemical weapons mahallati told reporters 
the iranians frequently accuse iraq of using chemical weapons 
which are banned under the 1925 geneva convention iraq has 
acknowledged their use but contends iran introduced chemical 
weapons to the war 
hashemi rafsanjani irans parliament speaker and military 
commander offered on tuesday to help get the nine american 
hostages freed if the united states releases iranian assets frozen 
since 1979 
the white house said no deals 
us ambassador vernon a walters said wednesday he believed the 
secretarygenerals good offices could help things are 
changing 
asked about rafsanjanis statement and the us response 
walters said we maintain the policy that we do not pay blackmail 
walters said he has visited syria five times to discuss the 
matter and the important thing for us is to liberate the hostages 
in such a way that they wont be replaced by another group of 
hostages 
the longest held hostage is terry a anderson 40 chief middle 
east correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped in 
beirut on march 16 1985 
after a string of military setbacks iran announced on july 18 
that it would accept resolution 598 which the 15member security 
council passed unanimously on july 20 1987 
the resolution calls for a truce withdrawal to recognized 
borders prisoner exchange peace negotiations and an investigation 
to determine which side started the war 
iraq invaded iraq in september 1980 after several border 
skirmishes

the government said today it was canceling 
a 13 billion development plan for the israelioccupied west bank 
which was part of jordan before 1967 
the move followed reports in regional newspapers that king 
hussein was dissociating himself from the palestinian question 
staterun radio jordan said the kingdom also decided to 
dissolve all development and tender committees for this plan 
the fiveyear west bank development plan was set up in 1986 by 
joint agreement between the jordanian government and the plo it 
was to provide schools water and agriculture projects and welfare 
the west bank was under jordanian rule until israel captured it 
during the 1967 arabisraeli war however jordan continued to pay 
the salaries and pensions of many goverment employees there and 
west bank representatives sit in the kingdoms parliament 
the uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and 
gaza strip which began dec 8 has given new international 
prominence to the palestinian issue 
on wednesday the saudi arabian newspaper alsharq alawsat 
quoted jordanian prime minister zaid rifai as saying decisive 
developments in jordanianpalestinian relations were coming up 
rifai was quoted as saying the measures planned would be in 
response to the wishes of the palestine liberation organization and 
the arabs and sprang from jordans desire to give greater 
responsibility to the palestinians 
on the same day the kuwaiti newspaper alqabas said royal court 
minister marwan qassem was the strongest candidate to head a new 
jordanian cabinet at the start of radical changes in the jordanian 
administration 
the comprehensive changes in jordan would be made in light of a 
decision by hussein to dissociate himself from the palestinian 
question and let the plo shoulder the responsibility said the 
newspaper which is usually wellinformed on jordan 
alqabas in its ammandated dispatch said the changes could 
include the appointment of rifai the prime minister as personal 
representative for the jordanian monarch 
the newspaper in line with earlier reports in the arab news 
media reported that hussein would dissolve the two houses of 
parliament the 60member upper house includes 30 members from the 
west bank

the drug and racketeering case against reputed 
mobster gene gotti ended in a mistrial for the second time after

wednesday in the case against the 41yearold brother of reputed

im fairly well satisfied that we have reached the rubicon 
the time has come to declare a mistrial the judge said the 
trial began 10 weeks ago 
the jury foreman said jurors were troubled by a defense claim 
that tape recordings made from an fbi bug placed in the kitchen of 
one of the defendants angelo ruggiero might have been tampered 
with to fit the case 
the jurors identities were not released for their own 
protection 
the jurors finally indicated their problem with the evidence 
is in fact tampering said jeffrey hoffman ruggieros lawyer 
we only hope the court system will recognize this situation 
and correct it by dismissing the case so these defendants do not 
once again have to undergo criminal proceedings 
assistant us attorney robert larusso denied there was any 
tampering 
the first trial ended in a mistrial in january nine months 
into the case with prosecutors accusing the defendants of jury 
tampering prosecutors said there would be a third trial

right hand in a fall from a horse during a polo lesson has accepted 
a 63 million settlement 
dr andrew glassman 37 agreed to the terms tuesday as his suit 
against the operators of los angeles equestrian center was to be 
heard by a jury attorney tom girardi said glassman can no longer 
practice surgery 
glassman was taking a private polo lesson in 1984 when he fell 
off his rented horse in the suit he claimed that the center was 
negligent because a saddle strap snapped and the saddle loosened as 
he tried to hit the ball 
the strap that broke had been repaired earlier with a staple 
instead of stitching the suit charged 
glassmans right hand suffered so much nerve damage that he can 
no longer grasp anything without pain girardi said 
patrick hast an attorney for equestrian centers of america

accountant were ready to testify that glassman would have earned 7 
million to 8 million during his lifetime if not for the injury

the house over the protests of two 
subcommittee chairmen has given its blessing to a land deal that 
would bring taxpayers 108000 acres of florida swampland for a 
valuable piece of downtown phoenix 
sent to the senate on wednesday was legislation to authorize the 
exchange which was negotiated initially by the interior department 
and redrawn by arizona lawmakers to bring their state a slice of 
the action 
the deal could cost the treasury some 100 million according to 
reps sidney yates dill chairman of the appropriations interior 
subcommitee and george miller dcalif chairman of the interior 
water and power resources subcommittee 
miller and yates came up on the losing end of the 281125 vote 
that approved the legislation sponsored principally by interior 
committee chairman morris udall dariz normally allied with 
miller on committee issues 
the bill would authorize the interior department to complete a 
complex deal to dispose of the 111acre site of the phoenix indian 
school which the reagan administration wants to close because of 
declining enrollments 
the general accounting office the investigative wing of 
congress has described the phoenix land as perhaps the most 
valuable undeveloped piece of urban real estate in the west 
under the plan the collier family interests of florida would 
get 684 acres of the phoenix property in exchange for the florida 
acreage and a cash payment of at least 349 million 
the transaction also calls for the veterans administration to 
get 115 acres of the school property to expand its phoenix 
hospital phoenix to get 20 acres for a park and arizona to get 
45 acres for a veterans home the rest of the land is tied up in 
road rightsofway 
the money paid by the colliers would be placed into a trust fund 
for the education of indians in arizona 
yates and miller argued that taxpayers would get a better deal 
if the property were sold on the open market 
they said at least one appraiser has set the value of the 
phoenix land at 100 million more than the value attached to it in 
the proposed exchange 
this is a sweetheart deal between the colliers and the federal 
government miller said were being asked to ratify a great 
deal for the colliers and a terrible deal for us taxpayers 
miller argued that while the florida land is environmentally 
sensitive and a good federal acquisition it already is protected 
from any damaging development by federal law 
this is a cushy cozy deal for the colliers said yates 
if it were not mo udalls bill it would be laughed off the 
floor its a very bad bill 
the bill would give the colliers three years to decide whether 
to exercise an option on the phoenix property if they did other 
developers would have 90 days to submit bids which the colliers 
would be allowed to top 
miller and yates argued that this procedure favors the colliers 
because competitors would not be able to come up with the 
development plans and financing within a short time 
they tried to convince the house to send the bill back to the 
interior committee with instructions to revise it to include an 
open competitive bidding process their recommittal motion lost 
279133 
in the senate the indian affairs and energy and natural 
resources committees took testimony on the issue on monday but have 
not drafted legislation of their own 
the florida property is in collier county in southwest florida 
the bulk of the 108000 acres lies immediately north of the big 
cypress national preserve which borders everglades national park 
on the parks northwest side 
another parcel of 5000 acres is adjacent to the fakahatchee 
strand state preserve known home to perhaps a fifth of the 30 to 
50 florida panthers believed left in the wilderness the state 
preserve is west of the national preserve 
and 19620 acres is next to the states cape romanoten thousand 
islands aquatic preserve on the gulf coast south of naples and 
west of everglades city

the miami herald says it wont run cartoons of 
attorney general edwin meese iii while he decides on a newspaper 
merger proposed by its parent company 
the herald decided words are better than cartoons in commenting 
on meese while he considers the application from the heralds 
parent knightridder inc and gannett co to combine business 
operations at their detroit papers 
jim hampton editor of the herald said wednesday he decided not 
to run meese drawings by jim morin because a cartoon cant say 
on the other hand 
hampton noted that the herald has frequently run editorials 
about meese and that a july 8 editorial informed readers of the 
touchy situation the discomfiture in which this matter places 
the herald is self evident he wrote 
under a proposed agreement the advertising operations of the 
detroit papers knightridders free press and gannetts detroit 
news would merge newsgathering would remain independent 
the decision fell to meese when the newspaper groups appealed an 
administrative law judges refusal to grant the merger 
under the newspaper preservation act the attorney general has 
the power to grant antitrust exemptions to failing newspapers 
free press editor joe stroud rejected three meese cartoons by 
cartoonist bill day executive editor heath meriwether formerly of 
the herald later assigned a reporter to explain the situation and 
published it with the rejected cartoons

amnesty international today urged 
burmas leaders to investigate alleged brutality by authorities who 
quelled riots in which scores of people died 
these investigations should lead to the bringing to justice of 
those responsible for human rights violations the londonbased 
human rights organization said in response to a query by the 
associated press 
amnesty international said it was concerned about allegations of 
human rights violations of demonstrators and prisoners during 
unrest in burma this year 
in recent months several minor quarrels have turned into major 
and bloody antigovernment riots 
western and burmese sources say riot police in the bloodiest 
demonstration in march were commanded by sein lwin who this week 
was named president of burma and head of its sole political party 
he replaced ne win who resigned saturday after 26 years of 
authoritarian rule 
they riot police and other security or lawenforcement 
personnel have been repeatedly accused of excessive use of force 
and acts of criminal negligence resulting in unnecessary deaths and 
injury to as many as 200 protesters and prisoners the 
organization said in a telex 
the government said that 43 people died in march unrest 
including 41 who suffocated in a packed police van as they were 
being driven to prison unofficial reports put the death toll at 
more than 100 
amnesty international said steps taken to investigate abuses 
have so far proved inadequate 
the organization which investigates human rights abuses around 
the world and won the nobel peace prize in 1977 said it has 
repeatedly expressed concern about evidence of a consistent 
pattern of political killing torture and arbitrary detention by 
burmese security forces operating in ethnic minority areas 
the organization said that still limited information available 
includes evidence that the army and police in karen mon kachin 
shan and arakan states committed severe violations of human 
rights 
the burmese government is waging a decadesold war against 
ethnic minority groups 
a number of western diplomats and burmese emigre groups fear 
that the ascension of sein lwin who has a long record of ruthless 
suppression of dissent will lead to further unrest and tough 
reprisals by authorities 
there are reasons for us to be concerned where civil 
disobedience has augured sein lwin was on the spot and the result 
was killing maiming and prisoners said ye kyaw thu general 
secretary of the committee for the restoration of democracy in 
burma in an interview from washington dc 
we are very concerned that the students will not be able to 
hold back their frustration agony and anguish he said 
sein lwin commanded troops who put down student unrests in 1962 
and 1974 and was involved in purges of government officials in the 
mid1970s

abortionrights advocates hailed the senates 
lopsided vote to extend medicaid funding to abortions for rape and 
incest victims as a breakthrough but the plan still faces 
skepticism in the house and hostility from the white house 
the senates 7319 vote wednesday marked the first departure by 
either chamber from the restrictive abortion policies of the past 
seven years 
current law in effect since 1981 limits payments to abortions 
in which the life of the mother is endangered 
sen lowell weicker rconn sponsor of the expansion said the 
vote wednesday represented a clear change from recent tradition 
what is terribly important is just to break that chain of 
restrictive regulations he said its a first small start 
the abortion provision was part of a 140 billion appropriations 
bill passed 8016 wednesday evening after a day of frenzied votes 
and shifting tactics on abortion family planning and aids issues 
the bill will keep the departments of labor health and human 
services and education in business during fiscal 1989 beginning 
oct 1 its highlights include 71 billion for employment and 
training 12 billion for aids research treatment prevention and 
education and 42 billion for tutoring and other services to 
disadvantaged students 
in a june 28 statement the office of management and budget 
urged the senate to strike its medicaid abortion provision saying 
it diverges from longstanding policy on this issue the 
presidents senior advisers would recommend that he veto this bill 
solely based on the inclusion of this language provision 
the abortion provision adopted by the senate is more restrictive 
than the simple extension weicker sponsored during the committee 
process federal money would only be available in promptly reported 
rape or incest cases and states could retain the existing more 
limited eligibility if they so desire 
sen james exon dneb sponsor of the modified version said 
it reflects the middle ground on a difficult issue weicker 
said it had a better shot at surviving negotiations with house 
members who did not include a medicaid expansion in their version 
of the appropriations bill 
asked about the possibility of a veto weicker replied 
considering everything else thats in the bill and that its an 
election year it could be overridden 
but doug johnson legislative director of the national right to 
life committee said he was confident the final product would not 
contain the medicaid abortion expansion 
the house is strongly committed to the current law so is the 
president said johnson in any case he said his group 
considers the exon amendment a very good outcome because it 
gives states some leeway and eliminates the possibility of rape 
claims six months into a pregnancy 
there was little controversy over money allocations in the bill 
which was drawn up in accordance with the budget framework agreed 
to last year by congress and the reagan administration but there 
were enough aids abortion and family planning amendments to 
prolong debate for three days 
in a confusing series of events senators three times rejected 
attempts by sen jesse helms to renew an expiring ban on federal 
funds for aids education materials that promote or encourage 
homosexuality 
instead they adopted an amendment described by its sponsor sen 
alan cranston dcalif as a preemptive strike against the helms 
ban while it bans federal funds for materials that directly 
promote or encourage homosexuality at the same time it says the 
materials must provide accurate information on how to avoid getting 
and transmitting aids 
some senators disavowed their votes last year in favor of the 
helms restrictions saying they wrongly believed the restrictions 
were toothless 
it is a fact that effective materials have been shelved and 
vital proposals have been tabled because of the fear of what this 
amendment might do said sen edward kennedy dmass chairman 
of the senate labor and human resources committee 
nevertheless after embracing the cranston amendment 6137 the 
senate later passed another amendment this one containing the 
helms restrictions as well as a phrase saying federally funded aids 
materials cannot use words stating that homosexuality is 
normal natural or healthy 
the senate voted 4845 to kill a helms amendment banning federal 
money to schoolbased clinics that distribute contraceptives or 
provide abortion counseling or referral services 
later lawmakers by voice vote approved a more limited version of 
the same amendment one which dropped the contraceptives section 
but retained the ban relating to abortion services 
schoolbased clinics are set up by local school boards to 
provide health services that sometimes include family planning 
some receive medicaid funds and money from block grants funneled 
through states

a town north of rangoon was under curfew 
today after mobs destroyed moslemowned tea shops and attacked 
police with stones and catapults leaving one person dead and five 
wounded sources said 
it was not certain whether the violence was related to this 
weeks national leadership changes in which hardline former army 
general sein lwin assumed the positions of president and head of 
the only political party 
also today amnesty international urged burmas leaders to 
investigate alleged brutality by authorities who quelled riots in 
which scores of people died 
the government said 43 people died in march unrest including 41 
who suffocated in a packed police van as they were being driven to 
prison unofficial reports put the death toll at more than 100 
these investigations should lead to the bringing to justice of 
those responsible for human rights violations the londonbased 
human rights organization said in response to a query by the 
associated press 
the government news agency said wednesday that the curfew was 
imposed and all demonstrations banned tuesday in myede 220 miles 
north of rangoon after rioters attacked police with catapults and 
stones 
the official news agency burma said police had to shoot to 
disperse the crowd and order was restored after several hundred 
rioters destroyed two tea shops and a third building 
the mob first set upon the moslemowned tea shops and then went 
on a looting spree said the sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity the sources believed the incident was a spillover of 
riots in nearby prome 
prome has been under martial law since july 22 after six days 
of mob violence that reportedly started with an argument between a 
buddhist customer and a moslem tea shop owner most burmese are 
buddhist 
in recent months several minor quarrels have turned into major 
and bloody antigovernment riots including one last march in 
rangoon in which more than 100 people were reported killed that 
riot also began with a tea shop quarrel 
some analysts believe that the outbursts reflect popular 
resentment of the government and dissatisfaction with deteriorating 
economic conditions tea shops are popular informal gathering 
places for the burmese 
sein lwin who ruthlessly suppressed dissidents over the last 26 
years on tuesday became chairman of the burma socialist program 
party and on wednesday became the nations president 
western diplomats said his rise could fan the fires of political 
protest that have erupted three times since last october leaving 
dozens dead universities closed and student resentment at a 
boiling point 
leaflets have appeared in rangoon in recent days urging 
continued antigovernment agitation 
in addition to naming sein lwin president wednesdays oneday 
emergency session of also elected former deputy prime minister tun 
tin to the post of prime minister vice president aye ko remained 
in his post 
defense minister kyaw htin moved to the no 3 government 
position as head of the council of state in all eight of the 22 
major government positions were changed 
the changes appeared to herald a continuation of the hardline 
oneparty system begun by strongman ne win 26 years ago although a 
number of liberal economic reforms were endorsed 
ne win 77 said he was retiring but doubt remains among 
western and burmese analysts over whether he will fade away or 
remain a behindthescenes director of events 
kya htin and tun tin however both are regarded as relatively 
liberal on issues of economic reform and dealing with dissent in 
the country kyaw htin also moved up to a top party post

alaska officials have begun regulating 
harvests of an icy crop icebergs that are finding their way into 
japanese beverages as gourmet ice cubes at about 3 a pound 
the department of natural resources plans to issue permits 
friday for tim dimond of juneau to collect ice in southeastern 
alaska dimond contacted state officials to ask whether he needed 
permits 
later he said he wanted the permits as a way to reinforce for 
overseas buyers the legitimacy of his icegathering business said 
andy pekovich the departments acting land and water manager for 
southeastern alaska 
he initiated this pekovich said adding that a permit is 
to everyones advantage and anyone else in the icecollecting 
business will be expected to get one 
the permits are intended to protect wildlife and marine 
recreation pekovich said 
calls to dimond were not returned 
dimond gathers icebergs with a crane on a 200foot barge and 
breaks the ice into chunks for shipment in freezer vans bound for 
seattle akpacific inc further breaks down the ice packs it in 
onekilogram sacks and ships it to japan where a bag sells for 
about 680 
in japan glacial ice is enjoyed for its novelty and durability 
it lasts about twice as long as an ice cube from a refrigerator 
and has no trace of chlorine or other additives said jim harper 
vice president of akpacific 
its a gourmet type of product that complements the perrier 
mineral water situation he said 
the permits limit dimonds proximity to campsites used primarily 
by kayakers and specify icecollection hours to prevent harvesting 
when sightseeing ships are in the area 
to protect hauling grounds for seals he cannot collect ice 
within 10 miles of a glacier the permits will allow dimond to 
collect 1000 tons a week 
southeast alaska conservation council officials oppose the 
harvests 
this is a new incompatible conflicting use of areas set 
aside for their natural features their solitude their pristine 
nature bart koehler executive director said wednesday

a former us hostage urged the united states 
today to consider releasing iranian assets in exchange for the 
release of the nine americans held captive in lebanon 
it can be done aboveboard it can be done legally and openly 
and the americans i think would approve of that said the rev 
lawrence jenco a roman catholic priest who was held in lebanon 
from january 1985 to june 1986 
jenco interviewed from portland ore on abctvs good 
morning america said i absolutely believe we should listen to 
the iranians were talking about the assets of iran and im 
talking about the national assets of america which are nine 
americans who are there 
irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani said on tuesday 
that iran would use its influence to try to free american hostages 
in lebanon if washington releases assets frozen in the united 
states 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united states 
will make no deals with iran over release of the hostages state 
department officials said they believe the assets referred to by 
rafsanjani are military equipment owned by iran which president 
carter refused to release after the islamic revolution toppled the 
late shah reza pahlavi in 1979 and 52 americans were taken hostage 
for 444 days

an insect that attacks the buds of maple 
trees has defoliated or stunted onesixth of vermonts forests 
threatening its 15 millionayear maple syrup industry and its 
eyepopping foliage officials say 
this is serious this is something we dont know very much 
about and this is something we have to learn as much as we can 
about as fast as possible to prevent a reoccurence gov 
madeleine kunin said wednesday 
kunin said she would seek about 200000 in state and federal 
funding for a research and management program to combat the 
insects called pear thrips she said the insect has attacked 
466000 acres in every county in vermont 
western massachusetts new hampshire and new york have also 
reported thrips damage but conrad motyka vermont director of 
forests said vermont has been hit the hardest 
the infestation is so severe in some of vermonts southern 
counties that experts may recommend that sugarmakers leave some 
maple trees untapped next year 
maple in vermont is the most prominent tree that we have 
motyka said it could tremendously affect not just our industry 
but our very way of life if you took all the maples away it would 
look very different in vermont 
state officials said they have no estimate of the damage to the 
timber industry or to tourism vermonts brilliant fall foliage 
draws thousands of tourists 
in the past thrips were only known to attack fruit trees but 
in the last decade they have started defoliating trees of the 
forest 
i think there is national and international concern that this 
may be part of the death of some of our forests and that weve got 
to put all our resources that we have to work kunin said 
kunin said she would ask the states emergency board to allocate 
93950 to research the thrips damage the board includes kunin and 
leaders of the legislature and handles some financial matters while 
lawmakers are out of session 
kunin said she would also ask for a 60000 federal grant as 
well as 46500 from other sources

fire today gutted the home of winnie 
mandela and jailed black guerrilla leader nelson mandela and 
police said it was set by a group of black teenagers 
no one was home when the blaze broke out at about noon and 
there were no injuries police and witnesses said 
mrs mandela arrived by car about an hour later but remained in 
her vehicle and drove to her nearby office without making any 
statements 
the fourroom home in the black township of soweto outside 
johannesburg was charred and all the contents were destroyed in 
the fire officials said 
mrs mandela a social worker and antiapartheid activist 
shared the modest home with her daughter zindzi 27 and two 
grandchildren the house belonged to nelson mandela before the 
couple was married 30 years ago 
police capt ruben bloomberg said in pretoria that a group of 
black high school students stoned the mandela home then doused it 
with gasoline and set it alight 
he said he did not know how many youths were involved nor the 
motive for the attack no arrests have been made he said 
teenage boys known as comrades who regularly guard the 
house pushed journalists away from mrs mandelas office after the 
fire and one threatened to burn a photographers car 
the teenagers blamed the fire on students from a high school in 
soweto they refused to say anything more about the incident 
neighbors and black journalists said mrs mandelas young 
supporters were involved in a dispute with a rival group in the 
dube section of soweto on wednesday and that the attack was a 
response to the quarrel 
attorney amrichand soma told reporters gathered in front of a 
gate blocked by the youths that mandela was contacted by telephone 
at pollsmoor prison in cape town and had no public comment on the 
fire mandela is serving a life term for sabotage and plotting the 
overthrow of the government 
aubrey mokoena a friend of the family and head of the release 
mandela campaign said the community must band together and put 
an end to this anyone who would think of attacking mandelas house 
represents the forces of darkness it is time for the community to 
stand up and stamp this out 
when he arrived at the gate to the office building mokoena 
greeted the comrades by saying the war is really on now 
mandela a leader of the outlawed african national congress the 
countrys main guerrilla group has been imprisoned for 26 years 
there are many black political factions in south africa and 
some oppose mandela and the anc

an irish republican army man 
was buried today in a ceremony tinged with remorse over a series of 
ira blunders that have killed 17 people since november 
the latest victims a protestant couple and their 6yearold 
son blown up in their car were buried later in their hometown of 
hillsborough outside belfast 
the first of the days two funerals was that of 33yearold 
brendan davison shot to death on his doorstep monday by the ulster 
volunteer force an outlawed protestant group 
davison whom the ira claimed as one of its own was widely 
believed to have been killed in reprisal for the death of 
contractor robin hanna his wife maureen and their son david 
the ira admitted triggering the bomb that killed the hannas as 
they drove across the border from ireland to northern ireland on 
saturday after a vacation it says its intended victim was a 
belfast catholic judge ian higgins 
police guarded the approaches to belfasts catholic milltown 
cemetery but kept their distance from the funeral the ceremony 
passed peacefully with none of the ira ceremonials that have 
sparked clashes with security forces in the past 
danny morrison secondincommand of the outlawed iras legal 
political wing sinn fein delivered the eulogy 
for the past number of months we have come through very very 
bleak conditions it has been a very very bad time when it seems 
as if everything the ira has touched has turned to tragedy and it 
has been very very rough for many people morrison told several 
hundred mourners standing in the rain 
sending condolences to the hannas two surviving teenage 
children he said we share in their tragedy what happened was 
terrible it was regrettable we want to see all deaths end 
including the deaths of our enemies in uniform we want to see 
peace in this country 
at the hannas funeral bishop gordon mcmullan of the church of 
ireland pleaded with the killers on both sides of the conflict to 
recognize what this cult of violence is doing to your own moral 
and spiritual condition 
responding to the iras condolences he said the spokesmen 
who represent the killers have made their excuses and expressed 
their regret but the fact is that robin maureen and david hanna 
are dead the plotters planned death and death was what ensued 
davisons coffin was draped in the irish tricolor and the ira 
said in a statement tuesday night that it had paid its final 
tribute by firing a volley of shots over a nationalist mural in 
catholic west belfast 
it was the first ira funeral since march 19 when catholics 
following the cortege of a slain guerrilla attacked two british 
soldiers who reportedly blundered into the procession 
the soldiers were dragged from their car severely beaten and 
shot by ira gunmen 
security forces had stayed away from that funeral at the request 
of church and political leaders 
the ira says it is conducting an inquiry into why five recent 
operations have been botched starting with a bomb in november that 
was meant to hit soldiers but killed 11 protestant civilians at a 
war memorial service in enniskillen 
other blunders have since included a bomb on a schoolbus that 
injured a dozen teenagers a bomb at a belfast swimming pool that 
killed two catholics and the shooting of a protestant woman in 
all cases the ira has apologized saying the intended targets were 
security forces or judicial personnel 
the ira said the hannas were victims of a wronged 
description of the judges car judge higgins his wife bridget 
and daughter cait were returning from dublin on the same road

pakistans foreign minister today allayed 
concerns that the soviet union was reneging on its pledge to 
withdraw the red army from afghanistan 
this impression has just been dispelled sahabzada yaqub 
khan said after a meeting with secretary of state george p shultz 
our position and that of the united states in regard to the 
withdrawal is no longer divergent 
the pace of the pullout and us hopes for fair elections in 
pakistan were topics for discussion during the foreign ministers 
visit 
there are an estimated 115000 soviet troops in afghanistan 
half are supposed to be withdrawn by aug 15 pakistani president 
mohamnad zia alhaq raised concerns last week that the soviets were 
replenishing them with new troops 
but yaqub khan said the soviets are carrying out the 
withdrawal 
through pakistan the united states armed afghan rebels fighting 
the red army and the prosoviet government in kabul 
us officials said this week that moscow had sent new 
assurances that the soviets would fulfill their commitment in the 
geneva accords of last may to withdraw half the troops by aug 15 
the report that they would be replaced was traced to the soviet 
military commander in kabul who apparently did not have the 
backing of his superiors in moscow 
shultz defense secretary frank c carlucci and yaqub khan are 
comparing notes on how to monitor the soviet withdrawal and on 
afghanistans future after the troops are gone one question is 
whether the rebels then would be able to bring down president 
najibullah another is the kind of government that would follow 
several of the rebel leaders would like to install a 
fundamentalist moslem regime akin to the government in neighboring 
iran 
it is extremely important we look beyond afghanistan and 
continue close cooperation with the united states in the interest 
of peace and security in the region yaqub khan said 
the united states has close ties to pakistan which gave refuge 
to millions of afghan refugees besides funneling covert us 
support to the rebels 
us officials are hoping the elections zia has set for nov 16 
will be fair but there is a question how much pressure shultz 
might try to apply 
we will stress that elections should be free and fair but it 
is not up to the us government to prescribe how they should be 
held said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
zia dismissed his civilian government in may but did not call 
for elections within the 90 days prescribed by the pakistani 
constitution 
he also barred candidates from running with party labels zia 
took the position that partybased elections could mislead the 
voters 
critics say this will focus attention on local issues and work 
against zias main national opposition the pakistan peoples 
party it is headed by benazir bhutto whose father was ousted in 
1977 in a coup led by zia and executed 
on another touchy issue president reagan must certify in 
october that pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive device 
in order for us aid to continue reagan will see yaqub khan 
briefly on friday 
the reagan administration last year fought off a drive in 
congress to shelve us military aid to pakistan amid indications 
the country was trying to develop a nuclear bomb 
pakistan has denied making such an attempt it is receiving 260 
million in military aid this year and 380 million in us economic 
assistance

interior secretary donald p hodel just back 
from touring firescorched yellowstone national park said today 
firefighters are now fighting all new outbreaks but one official 
said its still possible that some new fires might be left to burn 
yellowstone is not in danger were not going to let 
yellowstone be damaged by this hodel said on abctvs good 
morning america program 
fighting all new outbreaks has always been a possibility in the 
usual let it burn policy of the national park service chief 
ranger walt dabney said afterward 
both dabney and the secretary defended the post1972 policy of 
fighting only fires that threaten developed areas or that could 
spread out of the park into timbering operations on adjacent forest 
service lands 
the forest service and the bureau of land management follow 
similar policies in their wildnerness areas because fires are 
important in generating healthy ecosystems 
the fact is that yellowstone has about 3 percent currently 
burning but theyve had a sufficient area under their 
firemanagement plan that their policy now is to fight new fires 
that break out hodel said 
dabney said in an interview the secretary was right in his 
facts and all recent outbreaks had been attacked with a view of 
keeping the fires small but the policy was unchanged decisions 
will be made case by case and the action taken will depend on 
where the fire is and what is threatened how many firefighters are 
available and how dangerous it would be to commit them 
a few firefighters can knock down a small blaze that might be 
impossible to control if left alone he noted 
any fire that breaks out in remote areas might well be left 
alone now he said any fire near the park boundaries probably 
would be attacked 
crews have begun using flame throwers to start backfires against 
fires that have so far scorched some 109000 of the parks 22 
million acres the fires had moved to within six miles of old 
faithful and forced the closing of one of the parks main entrances 
in yellowstone specifically were fighting probably six or 
eight large fire areas right now dabney said 
hodel flew over some of the damaged forest land wednesday and 
voiced confidence afterwards in the policy of allowing remote areas 
to burn in his comments today the interior secretary said the 
flames had gone far enough 
what they tell me is weve got standing timber that is as dry 
or drier than kilndried lumber that makes it just take off like 
crazy when you have a fire he said in these conditions 
theres very little control we can have over these fires 
dabney said the damage could even help naturalists learn more 
about the forest by providing a close look at how largescale fires 
clear old brush for new wildlife habitat 
what were looking at probably occurred naturally in the 
yellowstone area every 200 to 400 years he said weve never 
really had the chance to see wildfire on this scale in the 
yellowstone ecosystem so were going to look at it very closely 
from a research standpoint and know a lot more specifically about 
the benefits of whats going on there now 
about 80 percent of yellowstone is lodgepole pine in a 
firedependent ecology he said natural fires are very 
important to keep species diversified many wildlife species will 
leave an area thats too thick and stagnant 
new trees and a wealth of wildlifeattracting vegetation grow in 
the open areas created by fires whose ashes act as a natural 
fertilizer he said

contribute both to greater confidence and to the negotiation of 
related provisions of a convention banning the production 
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons 
the geneva conference has been negotiating such a convention for 
20 years this years summer session began july 7 
the declaration we are making today is unprecedented 
friedersdorf told the 40nation conference 
we urge other countries that possess chemical weapons 
production facilities to declare the locations of their facilities 
and to outline how the facilities would be destroyed he said 
he said no other conference member had provided information on 
chemical weapons production facilities the united states and 
soviet union are the only two members of the conference who have 
acknowledged possessing chemical weapons 
the united states has said it believes about 15 nations possess 
such weapons but it has refused to name them 
the production facilities declared by the united states are 
rocky mountain arsenal in colorado the pine bluff arsenal in 
arkansas muscle shoals in alabama newport army ammunition depot 
in indiana and aberdeen proving ground in maryland 
the soviet union has declared the amount of its stockpiles but 
not their location nor the location of production sites 
the soviet union said in december that its chemical weapons 
stocks total 50000 tons but western experts have estimated that 
the actual total is much higher 
the united states also submitted to the conference ideas for 
ways to destroy chemical weapons under an eventual ban 
delegates have drafted many parts of a chemical weapons ban the 
main unresolved issue is how to guard against cheating

president reagan said today the nation is 
regaining its religious and moral bearings but must do more to 
overcome promiscuity drug use pornography and a drifting away 
from church and family values 
an overwhelming nine out of 10 americans pray reagan said 
audiences for religious books are growing the modern 
communications media are being used for evangelism 
in a speech to the student congress on evangelism at the 
washington convention center the president said his administration 
has worked hard to reflect this return to basic values 
reagan ticked off a host of steps in recent years including 
enactment by congress of the equal access act of 1984 giving 
voluntary religious groups the right to meet after school on the 
same basis as other groups he also cited longstanding 
administration positions in support of returning prayer to the 
classroom and reversing the supreme court decision that legalized 
abortions 
reagan seldom goes to church but has said he prays frequently 
in his speech today he said that i am not going to preach a 
sermon 
at another point the president talked to the young men and 
women about the pressures teenagers feel to have sex out of 
wedlock 
im sure that each of you believes that someday youll find 
someone to fall in love with and you will he said sometimes 
you may get frustrated and yes finding the right one may take 
longer than you thought 
but dont worry it will happen reagan said and thats 
why its so important for you not to pay any attention at all to 
those who say that promiscuity is somehow stylish and rewarding 
no the right thing to do is to wait for that one special person 
beginning now 
reagan said that we must admit that in recent years america 
did seem to lose some of her religious and moral bearings 
he said pornography spread unchecked and was available 
virtually on every magazine rack in every drugstore or shop in the 
land 
reagan said drug abuse spread through the nation like a fever 
attracting children as well as adults and involving drugs that were 
once unheard of drugs like lsd and pcp 
while the president said those problems remain i believe 
theres been a change 
now although we americans have done much to put our national 
life back on the firm foundation of traditional values there is 
still a great deal to be done he said and so today i want to 
challenge you young people to see that our nation does still more 
still more to return to the lifegiving values of faith and 
family

his youth then sentenced a man convicted of murdering a candy 
store owner to life in prison 
douglas county district judge james murphy on wednesday 
sentenced christopher bazer 19 bazer could have been sentenced to 
death for the feb 18 shooting death of mary jirsak 78 
bazer pleaded guilty to firstdegree murder in june saying he 
shot miss jirsak in the head during a robbery at her store two 
other men convicted in the killing are awaiting sentencing 
when i first heard about this case i thought back to the 
time that i was 6 or 7 years old in those days they had a candy 
store almost next to every school murphy said before the 
sentencing 
in the fall october id stop in a candy store the sun would 
come in that window light from the sun the polished glass would 
light up my whole world 
murphy shook his head stood and strode out of the courtroom 
bazer sat in silence with the lawyers and spectators until the 
judge returned three minutes later

happened to mary jirsak murphy said without mentioning his 
absence 
he then left the bench to embrace karen kojdecki miss jirsaks 
niece 
karen judges care so much he told her 
returning to the bench murphy addressed bazer 
i think what you did was deplorable especially because of the 
kind of person who was killed the judge said 
bazer told the judge im sorry about what happened and if i 
could change it i would 
the prosecutor and defense lawyer said they had never seen a 
judge show such emotion in court 
it was magnificent wasnt it asked deputy douglas county 
attorney gerald moran 
the emotion was obvious defense lawyer alan stoler said 
i felt for the judge as much as i felt sorry for the family

government critics on thursday hailed 
political leaders for nominating an elected official as prime 
minister but the nominee said parliaments many factions will make 
thailand difficult to govern 
chatichai choonhavan a conservative former army general and 
millionaire formally announced his nomination as prime minister 
thursday 
chatichai 66 a member of parliament and an acting deputy prime 
minister reluctantly accepted the nomination wednesday after prem 
tinsulanonda refused another term for unspecified personal reasons 
prem has served for eight years 
the five political parties that will form the coalition 
government have agreed to support the leader of the largest party 
and as that partys leader i am pleased to accept the 
nomination chatichai told reporters thursday 
however before he accepted the nomination to a fouryear term 
as prime minister chatichai said on wednesday if i were prime 
minster im afraid it the government wont last more than three 
months 
chatichai was nominated by the leaders of five political parties 
that hastily formed a coalition headed by prem after no single 
party won a plurality in sundays parliamentary election 
prem a 67yearold former army commander called the elections 
24 months early after dissolving parliament disbanding his 
factionridden coalition government and nullifying a noconfidence 
motion from the opposition 
chatichais thai nation party received the most votes in 
sundays general election the other four parties in the coalition 
are the democrat party the social action party the rassadorn 
party and the united democracy party 
although chatichais party and the coalition partners hold 215 
of the 357 seats in the lower house of parliament more lobbying 
may take place before his name is submitted for approval to 
constitutional monarch bhumibol adulyadej 
in the past thailands powerful military and senior bureaucrats 
also were said to have been involved in the final choice of the 
countrys leader 
under thai law after elections the major parties select a prime 
ministerial candidate who does not have to be a member of 
parliament prem for instance does not hold an elective office 
the coalition that backed prems last government virtually the 
same one that nominated chatichai was plagued by many divisions 
before his nomination chatichai also was not widely regarded as 
a likely choice and has not enjoyed close ties with the powerful 
military as prem did 
however chatichai said thursday he met with the army chief 
gen chavalit yongchaiyudh and got military support for his 
nomination 
chatichais nomination was welcomed by students and other 
government critics because he unlike prem was an elected 
official after the nomination the students said they would end 
protests they held before the nomination 
chatichai represents the people who voted him into the 
government and we respect that student leader mana treelayatewat 
said thursday 
mana a leader of the 100000member students federation of 
thailand said this is the first time in 10 years that democracy 
can be developed and mature in thailand we have reached our goal 
premiership from direct elections 
chatichai is a retired army major general and wealthy 
businessman who has held the foreign affairs and industry 
portfolios in earlier governments 
commissioned as an army officer in 1940 chatichai served in 
thailands brief war in indochina in 194041 in world war ii and 
in the korean war to which thailand sent troops to fight with the 
united nations command he also served as ambassador to argentina 
austria turkey switzerland and yugoslavia 
if chatichai succeeds prem he is expected to follow a 
conservative prowestern policy and emphasize economic development

it was a sweet decision indeed that will 
enable two british cake decorators to show their talents their own 
way at a convention here 
june melendy on wednesday picked up an 88pound box of specially 
milled powdered sugar and other supplies from federal officials 
its in the back of my car and im not going to let it out of my 
sight she said 
authorities who on july 19 blocked importation of powdered 
sugar syrup and molasses said the shipment violated the us sugar 
import quota of 106 million tons 
it seems like a relatively small thing said charles conroy 
spokesman for the us customs department in houston but we have 
to protect us sugar manufacturers and employees if we allow 
this then someone will want to ship in say a couple of tons 
then the us industry would be in jeopardy 
but officials later determined that more sugar could be imported 
this year without harm to the domestic industry and the us 
department of agriculture gave ms melendy the supplies conroy 
said 
ms melendy a spokeswoman for the international cake 
exploration societys convention and cake show scheduled in tulsa 
next month was trying to help british confectioners prepare their 
demonstration at the convention when she originally ran afoul of 
the law 
elaine macgregor and nicolas lodge of sussex england shipped 
their supplies for the convention expected to draw 1500 cake 
decorators aug 1114 ms melendy said 
theyre artists ms melendy said they use a very fine 
extrarefined sugar they dont like our sugar theyre just like a 
sculptor or painter they prefer using their own equipment

violet pastel blue and yellow to go with outfits in different 
dazzling tones

royal blue or amethyst with a rust belt and toque for instance 
there were a few pants for daytime or evening more often than 
not dressed up with neat matador boleros and spanish grandee hats

frequent were the satin dresses with sashes in tones like pink and 
raspberry or emerald and magenta

the government raised the base prices of its best 
cigarettes and liquors thursday in an effort to break up a thriving 
black market and it allowed staterun stores to set the retail 
prices for the first time 
store managers said that on friday they will raise the prices 
even higher 
the cost of a pack of a popular brand of cigarettes went up 
nearly 400 percent and the price of a fifth of a bottle of spirits 
shot up 750 percent but consumers were used to paying at least 
that much anyway 
the black market holds a virtual monopoly on topquality 
cigarettes and liquor in china private sellers bribe store 
managers to sell them the goods wholesale and then resell them to 
the public at inflated prices 
on thursday brandname cigarettes and liquors surfaced in 
stores for the first time in about 15 years business was brisk 
at the xidan market in west beijing manager liu dajiang said he 
sold 1500 cartons of cigarettes in two hours during the morning 
we could have sold more but were saving them for tomorrow to 
see what price theyll fetch he said 
china the worlds largest producer and consumer of tobacco has 
300 million smokers 
across town at the guandong market manager zhen ciping said 
wines and cigarettes had been selling fast 
today were experimenting seeing which brands the masses 
like she said tomorrow well raise the prices of the popular 
ones 
customers complained the prices were too high but they bought 
anyway 
the prices are the same as you can get from the private 
sellers and thats too high said customer zhang zhiping holding 
four cartons of popular zhonghua cigarettes at the xidan market 
the cigarettes went up almost 400 percent from 49 cents to 190 
a pack 
thursdays price increases mainly affected 13 namebrand 
cigarettes and 13 famousbrand spirits although the costs of some 
bgrade items also jumped 
china is experiencing its highest inflation since 1949 consumer 
prices last month were 19 percent higher than in june 1987 last 
year the previous high inflation hit 72 percent 
in may the government raised the prices of vegetables pork 
sugar and eggs as part of a farreaching economic reform program to 
end state controls of prices economists hope to increase 
production and raise the standard of living 
in announcing the increases monday the state council or 
cabinet said it would let the price of the 26 brands be determined 
by the market 
managers in staterun stores said that meant they could set 
prices and reap a profit from their sales something unheard of a 
few years ago 
according to the managers the government set a base price if a 
store is able to sell the items for more it can keep the 
difference 
at guandong market manager zhen said she planned to let the 
workers share the profit at xidan liu said it would be invested 
in the store

attorneys for james messer jr turned to the 
us supreme court after a federal appeals court refused to block 
his execution tonight for the beating and stabbing death of his 
8yearold niece 
the application for a stay of execution was filed today with 
justice anthony kennedy 
the georgia board of pardons and paroles also considered a 
clemency appeal 
messer 34 was scheduled to die in the electric chair at 7 pm 
for the 1979 slaying of rhonda joan tanner 
prosecutors said he abducted his niece from school by telling 
officials her father had been hurt in a construction accident then 
attempted to molest her he attacked the girl when she fought him 
and left her to bleed to death 
messer would be the 13th person executed in georgias electric 
chair since the state resumed executions in 1983 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals earlier today refused to 
stop the execution 
messers lawyers have contended that he is mentally incompetent 
and thus under a us supreme court ruling cannot be put to death 
officials at the georgia diagnostic and classification center 
near here moved messer to a holding cell next to to the death 
chamber wednesday afternoon said john siler spokesman for the 
corrections department 
messer came within 15 hours of execution two years ago but won a

a city patrolman with a heart says he has 
been writing one or two bogus traffic tickets a week in the names 
of nonexistent motorists for about 18 months 
i just could not bring myself to write tickets said 
patrolman michael ghrist i started seeing the human beings 
behind the drivers wheels 
ghrist 36 a 17year veteran has been suspended for 25 days 
police chief richard dotson concluded that ghrist wrote 
fictitious tickets to maintain high enforcement statistics 
chief jefferson district judge donald smalley said this week 
that a computer listing of all the tickets ghrist has written since 
1981 shows that more than 1000 are in the names of people for whom 
state transportation employees could not find kentucky drivers 
licenses 
we have to assume that almost all of them are fictitious 
smalley said 
however the official letter from dotson to safety director 
thomas kuster recommending ghrists suspension says only what 
ghrist has admitted that he wrote one or two phony tickets per 
week over a year and a half 
kuster said wednesday that he was unaware that more than 1000 
questionable tickets had been written 
and lt col john aubrey said the police internal affairs units 
investigation of ghrist would be reopened because of that 
information 
each person who gets a traffic ticket is sent a letter by 
district court notifying him of his court date if the person fails 
to show up a second letter is sent 
if two court appearances are missed the court sends the ticket 
to the state transportation cabinet that agency sends the ticketed 
driver a letter warning he will lose his license if the ticket 
isnt resolved within 20 days said cabinet spokesman mark mcdaniel 
this year for the first time the cabinet began sending tickets 
that dont match drivers licenses back to district court smalley 
said 
in a batch of about 50 returned by the state in march clerks 
discovered that ghrist had written 29 police maj hank rausch then 
asked them to do a more extensive check smalley said 
checking tickets that ghrist wrote since 1981 for people whose 
names began with the letters a through c the clerks found about 
250 for which the state had been unable to locate drivers 
licenses smalley said 
he said the clerks made another check of tickets that ghrist had 
written that were never resolved and found 1050 
ghrist said he admitted writing the fictitious tickets when 
called to dotsons office a few weeks ago he said he also wrote 
legitimate tickets 
in his letter dotson said he considered recommending that 
ghrist be fired but decided to be more lenient because ghrist was 
not motivated by greed for example he did not receive special pay 
given to officers for court appearances 
rather officer ghrist seems to have been motivated by a 
selfimposed peer pressure to maintain high enforcement 
statistics dotson wrote 
assistant city law director paul guagliardo said ghrist may have 
violated state law however guagliardo said he never determined 
which statute ghrist could have violated because district court 
officials told dotson they didnt wish to prosecute 
since january ghrist has been assigned to drive a vehicle that 
cruises expressways to help stranded motorists

in the dusty days of summer when 
temperatures hover above 100 degrees for days on end new delhi 
rejoices at the coming of the monsoon and its cooling rains 
in the west the rains are depressing in india they are a 
time of great joy release beauty and romance says khushwant 
singh a noted author and journalist 
as the rains come the dust settles parched gardens suddenly 
turn green temperatures come soothingly down and so do tempers 
but the monsoon has its sad side 
the rains that started early in july ended two years of drought 
in northern india promising good crops at last but they also 
unleashed floods that three weeks later had left at least 370 
people dead around the country of drowning or disease spread by 
contaminated water the death toll in new delhi from contaminated 
water approached 100 a city official said more than 7100 others 
had been treated in hospitals for cholera or gastroenteritis 
for new delhi the downpour broke the stifling heat but 
telephones went dead potholes multiplied or grew deeper and 
disease became a danger as tainted water seeped into pipes and 
wells 
at the first delicious moment of the monsoon though the 
nourishing rain kept such troubles distant 
the monsoon for most indians is not only the source of 
life but also their most exciting contact with nature says 
authorjournalist singh 
when the clouds first burst open over new delhi dozens of 
halfnaked children danced gleefully in the downpour and splashed 
in puddles in one impoverished neighborhood along the yamuna river 
its always like this said gulab an elderly woman watching 
the fun the children love to play in the rain but they 
invariably get sick 
more than 5300 people have been treated this year for 
gastroenteritis and cholera in new delhi at least 182 have died 
most of them children 
maya rao a university teacher who has lived in new delhi for 
many years described new delhis monsoon this way 
there is muck and mud all over mosquitoes attack you in 
hordes diseases spread like vice its impossible to get to places 
on time given the state of the roads and calling people on the 
phone is such a nuisance half the phones are dead 
then she added theres the humidity 
the moment the rain stops you sweat to death 
even so ms rao went on she cant imagine life without the 
monsoon 
what could be more delightful than eating bhutta roasted 
cornonthecob on your terrace as the greypurple skies melt into 
rain 
one city official who insisted on anonymity said he could do 
no work during the monsoon 
its too beautiful just to relax sit and watch the rain he 
said as he sat watching the rain stream down his office window

the government has announced a new scheme to help 
finance its car licensing department the sale of vanity plates 
the hottest item says transport secretary paul channon may be 
d1 ana which would appeal to fans of princess diana wife of the 
heir to the throne 
other likely attractions are dav 1d f1 rst chr 1s f111 jet 
and f1 del 
because such plates must have at least one digit zeroes pass 
for the letter o 1 for i and 5 for s 
channon told parliament on wednesday the plates will go on 
auction in an effort to cut 17 million per year from vehicle 
registration costs 
unlike american motorists who for a fee can order the license 
plate lettering of their choice british drivers now depend on the 
computer to churn out lucky combinations of letters and digits 
some of the plates slip through the system however and 70000 
change hands each year some fetching thousands of dollars private 
dealers advertise the socalled cherished plates in newspapers

the chairman and senior republican on the 
senate intelligence committee today accused the white house of 
trying to set up congress to make it appear a news leak about a 
covert action plan for panama began on capitol hill 
in fact said sens david boren dokla and william cohen 
rmaine they were receiving inquiries from reporters on tuesday 
even before the cia briefing on the plan got under way 
i think the matter was handled in such a way as to set up 
members of congress to make them appear the source of the leak 
said cohen i am offended by it 
cohen said he suspected the tactic may have been designed to 
damage chances for legislation opposed by the administration to 
require notification of the house and senate intelligence 
committees within 48 hours of any covert action plan signed by the 
president 
the bill stemmed from last years irancontra investigation and 
is designed to tighten current law which requires only that 
unspecified timely notice be given to congressional overseers 
boren said he also believed the leak could have been designed to 
give the appearance that the reagan administration is doing 
something about the situation in panama which has become a 
political liability for gop presidential candidate george bush 
both sen alfonse damato rny and rep patricia schroeder 
dcolo suggested wednesday that the administration may have 
leaked the purported plan to the news media to create the illusion 
of a steppedup campaign against noriega 
the reported plan was first disclosed by the washington post and 
the los angeles times but neither newspaper provided details 
president reagan and administration spokesmen were uniformly silent 
wednesday when asked about it by reporters 
informed comment about the alleged plan was scarce and even 
damato and schroeder admitted their remarks were speculative 
because they had not received an official briefing 
published and broadcast reports said the activities fall short 
of a paramilitary operation such as kidnaping noriega to bring him 
to the united states where he faces drug charges 
damato suggested that news leak came from the white house 
during this political season to create the impression that the 
administration is doing something about noriega and drug 
trafficking in panama 
schroeder also said reagan authorized the activity to give the 
appearance of stepping up the campaign against noriega 
its politically motivated she said 
ambassador juan b sosa who broke with the noriegaled 
government in february said in an interview he is pleased that the 
administration has maintained a nonegotiations policy toward 
noriega since the collapse of a us bid in may to encourage him to 
surrender power 
but sosa who shares the administration view that ousted 
panamanian president eric arturo delvalle is the legitimate leader 
in panama said he had not been briefed on the reported covert 
action plan this contradicted a source quoted in the washington 
post 
sosa also said he doubted widespread reports that president 
reagan had informed delvalle of the plan during a telephone 
conversation on july 15 
as far as i know the conversation did not touch on that 
said sosa who continues to serve at panamas embassy here in 
defiance of the panamanian governments efforts to appoint its own 
envoy 
the administration has frozen panamanian government assets in 
the united states as part of broad policy of economic denial 
against panama at one point the administration was considering 
dropping the drug charges against noriega if he would leave panama 
but talks with the military strongman broke down in may 
the administration then withdrew its proposals and said it would 
not take part in further negotiations 
offers by guatemalan president vinicio cerezo and former 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez to start up an alternate 
negotiating process have not borne fruit 
noriega has refused to discuss panamas political future since 
the collapse of the us initiative 
the administration had hoped to negotiate noriegas surrender of 
power by aug 12 the fifth anniversary of his ascension as 
commander of the defense forces 
asked what he expects noriega to do on that day sosa said the 
panamanian leader will either do nothing or he will step down and 
announce his candidacy for presidential elections set for next may 
any such elections sosa said obviously will be a farce if 
they are under noriegas control

the audience cheered the singers 
and musicians but booed the director after the premier of a 
modernistic version of richard wagners ring cycle that opened 
the bayreuth wagner festival 
after the performance wednesday night an international cast of 
singers and musicians under the direction of paris orchestra 
conductor daniel barenboim received enthusiastic applause for the 
first time this year the orchestra includes 11 musicians from 
communist east germany 
but east german director harry kupfer who attempted to turn the 
old german myths into a symbolic depiction of the modern world 
drew boos 
kupfer according to the hamburgbased weekly stern magazine is 
seeking to present the wagnerian tragedies as a portrayal of 
present times by showing aspects of our threatened world 
the audience should learn something the magazine quoted 
kupfer as saying they must not just close their eyes and enjoy 
the beautiful music they should reflect on the meaning 
kupfer set his production in modern times and on a modern 
street which he says is part of the traveled road in human 
history 
stage settings are built of bits and pieces of ordinary 
everyday materials 
a dragons cave where the stolen rhine gold is stashed is made 
from an old piece of sewer piping valhalla the home of the gods 
is presented as a cube of neon lights suspended above a 
smokecovered stage floor 
the gods travel to and from their valhalla home in a 
rainbowcolored glassenclosed elevator 
modern social themes were also woven into kopfers presentation 
the three goddesses of fate are portrayed as bedouin gypsy 
women weaving their threads of fortune from 42 television antennas 
kupfer said the use of trenchcoats and other types of overcoats 
for costumes is intended to depict the cold discomfort of the 
homeless 
the opening performance marked the 600th presentation of the 
ring cycle at the bayreuth festival and the second attempt at 
bringing the wagnerian tragedies into a modern setting 
in 1976 french director patrice chereau directed a production 
of the opera set in the 19th century which like kupfers 
offering was booed by the audience and received negative reviews 
wagners ring cycle will be performed three times at this 
years festival which ends august 29 tickets for all of the 
festival performances have been sold out since november

republican george bush said today the guessing game about his 
vice presidential running mate is inevitable and he hopes it wont 
demean anyone involved democrat michael dukakis speaking on 
ethics said bush should have been calling for edwin meeses 
resignation since last spring 
dukakis in a speech in secaucus nj also referred in 
dismissive fashion to bushs statement tuesday that he would create 
a white house ethics office headed by a senior counselor 
in a dukakis white house the ethics office will be in the 
oval office not someplace down the hall the democratic 
presidential nominee said 
meese has announced his resignation and said he will soon leave 
his post as attorney general but dukakis said bush the republican 
vice president should have been demanding meeses ouster last 
april after top justice department officials resigned 
bush has begun sending out questionnaires seeking background 
information from potential running mates including former rival 
jack kemp 
the vice president in comments to reporters outside his white 
house office today named no names 
he said the process is going along in an orderly fashion 
hopefully it wont be demeaning to anyone 
as for the growing list of republicans believed to be among 
potential candidates bush said you cant avoid speculation 
dukakis arrived in newark nj at midmorning and was to visit 
a day care center in secaucus later in the day before heading for 
cleveland he will return to boston saturday night after visiting 
seven states 
before leaving the statehouse on wednesday dukakis continued 
his duties as massachusetts governor by signing a number of bills 
including crime legislation and the final piece of a plan to 
balance the 1988 budget 
dukakis dismissed bushs repeated criticism of a massachusetts 
furlough program that allowed passes to firstdegree murderers the 
program was later amended but not until after one of the prisoners 
escaped from a furlough and raped a maryland woman 
ive got a record dukakis said referring to statistics 
showing his states crime rate had dropped 13 percent in the past 
four years i dont know what the vice presidents record is 
he was riding a postconvention wave of enthusiasm with the 
latest nbc newswall street journal poll giving him an 18point 
lead over bush 
running mate lloyd bentsen was in san francisco after telling a 
business womens group in albuquerque nm that the gender gap 
wasnt created by accident 
he told the national federation of business and professional 
women which bush had addressed sunday that the gop record on the 
equal rights amendment equal pay and other issues pushed women 
into the democratic camp 
bush the certain nominee at the republican national convention 
in new orleans aug 15 remained in washington while more feelers 
went out for prospective running mates 
kemp the new york congressman and sen pete domenici of new 
mexico were among those receiving requests for background 
information republican sources said 
kemp aide marci robinson said the congressman met with robert 
kimmitt a washington attorney who is helping screen possible 
running mates and would provide the material to the bush campaign 
within a week 
new hampshire gov john sununu has said he received a 
questionnaire from bush campaign officials 
in addition to kemp the names mentioned most frequently in the 
speculation include senate republican leader bob dole and 
california gov george deukmejian several womens names also crop 
up including sen nancy kassebaum of kansas and doles wife 
elizabeth a former secretary of transportation 
aides to sen dole deukmejian former tennessee gov lamar 
alexander rep lynn martin of illinois sens richard lugar of 
indiana and alan simpson of wyoming and illinois gov james 
thompson all said they had not received questionnaires 
jesse jackson meanwhile met briefly with democratic national 
committee chairman paul kirk in chicago to discuss jacksons role 
in campaigning for the partys presidential and local candidates 
neither side would give details on what was discussed 
the former presidential candidate said late wednesday he has 
been trying to meet with the foreign minister of iran in an attempt 
to discuss the possible release of americans being held in lebanon 
no meetings have been set but i have been making appeals 
through diplomats to set up a meeting jackson said in a 
telephone interview from his chicago home 
today however he said in an interview that no meeting has 
been set and no meeting has been sought 
in an interview published today in usa today bush said of a 
possible jackson role as an unofficial envoy it shouldnt 
happen were talking about very sensitive foreign policy the 
administration is empowered to conduct those negotiations at the 
united nations we dont need any loose cannons rolling around the 
deck 
jacksons reaction my moral appeals and humanitarian pleas to 
gain the release of american hostages is a consistent one in some 
sense i have never stopped trying to get hostages free and george 
bush has never started 
we should not lower the dignity of this effort to gain the 
freedom of americans held hostage with name calling jackson 
added when asked about bushs comments if he wants to operate in 
that level thats his judgment 
jackson has said he will campaign for dukakis but details have 
not yet been worked out 
surveys have been suggesting dukakis got a boost following last 
weeks convention in the latest poll a telephone survey of 1770 
registered voters conducted saturday through monday dukakis 
received 50 percent support to 32 percent for bush dukakis had led 
by 10 points 4636 in a preconvention nbcjournal poll 
the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points

an undercover drug agent said today that one 
of the federal governments most significant cocaine investigations 
ended prematurely when word of the operation appeared in the news 
media days after the cia said it would leak the material to expose 
nicaraguan government drug smuggling 
appearing behind a screen to conceal his identity drug 
enforcement administration agent ernest jacobsen said the 1984 leak 
ended one of the most significant cocaine investigations in dea 
history which he said could have led to the arrest of the entire 
leadership of colombias cocaine cartel the cartel was operating 
inside nicaragua at the time jacobsen said 
the hearing was the first in a series by the house judiciary 
subcommittee on crime into whether reagan administration officials 
condoned drug smuggling and other criminal activities to further 
its central america policy especially winning aid for the contra 
rebels 
the panel also is studying whether administration officials 
obstructed law enforcement operations as may have occurred in the 
1984 operation 
jacobsen told the subcommittee that convicted drug pilot barry 
seal was working for the dea in the sting operation the agent 
described seals extensive contact with the colombian cartel and 
with federico vaughn identified by jacobsen as an official of the 
nicaraguan interior ministry 
according to jacobsen the cia placed cameras in an airplane 
that seal flew to nicaragua in 1984 to film the loading of cocaine 
at a military airstrip 
he said the pictures had been developed at cia headquarters near 
washington and then taken to the white house 
the cia wanted to release them to the press to show the 
sandinistas were dealing in cocaine jacobsen said 
the agent said dea officials initially convinced the cia to 
change its mind but shortly afterwards a story on the operation 
appeared in the washington times 
he said that story ended the operation and the dea frantically 
began to make all the arrests possible at that point 
the subcommittee chairman william j hughes dnj said the 
motive of the planned leak on the sandinistas appeared designed to 
influence congress to approve aid to the contras 
hughes said a cia witness was invited to testify on the agencys 
role in the operation but he notified the committee he would 
refuse to cooperate on fifth amendment grounds of 
selfincrimination 
more than 100 subpoenas have been issued for witness testimony 
and the production of documents hughes said judicial grants of 
immunity have been obtained to compel testimony of six persons who 
refused to cooperate invoking their fifth amendment privilege 
no immunity grant has been issued for the cia witness and 
hughes said there has been no decision on pursuing the agencys 
testimony 
seal in february 1986 was assassinated in a baton rouge la 
machine gun attack as he pulled up in his cadillac at a salvation 
army halfway house he was confined there parttime on a sixmonth 
sentence for narcotics and bank fraud convictions 
in an interview wednesday hughes said were looking at 
whether an obstruction of justice caused the end of the seal 
operation the whole operation was aborted because of leaks to 
the media 
seal had contacts with the colombian drug cartel and came in 
contact with at least one sandinista hughes said 
in october 1985 seal told a presidential organized crime 
commission that he quit his job as an airline pilot because 
smuggling was so simple so lucrative he said he easily eluded 
detection to fly tons of cocaine into the united states for a top 
fee of 15 million 
i have landed clandestinely in probably every south american 
country there is seal said there is no problem if you have 
the necessary contacts and dollars with you 
seal told panelists how flyforhire pilots take off and land 
without interference from authorities in colombia nicaragua and 
other latin american nations 
seal said he transported cocaine into the united states while 
working for an illicit drug cartel he said was as sophisticated 
as any fortune 500 company 
he displayed nightvision goggles telephone encryption devices 
and hightechnology messagesending units i dont believe 
theres any paramilitary group better equipped than my former 
associates he said

miss twomey had apparently slipped onto the uss conyngham while 
it was on a courtesy call in cork harbor and was discovered aboard 
the guided missile destroyer saturday when it returned to norfolk 
va after a 10day crossing 
she was found in a 2footwide 15footlong 3foothigh 
compartment above a refrigeration unit that she shared with 
electrical wiring and pipes 
five sailors accused of helping her stowaway were jailed at the 
norfolk naval base if charged and convicted they could receive up 
to five years in prison and a 2000 fine for aiding an illegal 
entry into the united states 
there are no options but for her to return to ireland said 
daire ocriodain a spokesman at the irish embassy in washington 
ocriodain said miss twomey is a minor and has no passport

limbo as quickly as possible and get her home 
miss twomey was released wednesday from rex hospital after being 
treated for an undisclosed ailment she was being taken to atlanta 
for a return flight when she became ill forcing an emergency

missing according to the spokesman 
mrs twomey told the cork examiner newspaper it was a pure 
disgrace that her daughter was able to slip through security and

aboard the destroyer and be undetected for so long said lt cmdr

the us postal service began a 16month 
700000 quest thursday to lick the problem of stamps that dont 
stay stuck urging industry to produce an adhesive to serve as a 
seat belt for a stamp 
gordon c morison a senior assistant postmaster general made 
it clear during a daylong conference at battelle memorial institute 
that the post office was serious about development of a superior 
wateractivated adhesive 
unfortunately the news that we have made in the last few days 
is that were spending a lot of money on something the press 
perceives as insignificant morison told about 100 adhesive 
industry executives and technical experts 
he said the postal service would spend nearly 90 million this 
year for stamps sales of which would generate about 8 billion 
i dont believe there is a private company including those 
that publish newspapers or sell their wares over the airwaves that 
would hesitate to invest 700000 to lower the cost of their 
product while making it perform better that is exactly what we are 
doing morison said 
we take it seriously because we know how important that stamp 
is to every american consumer he told reporters during a break 
in the conference we really believe that we have to have a stamp 
that operates very well 
adhesive now used by stamp manufacturers performs well when mail 
is sorted manually or mechanically but the arrival of highspeed 
automated processing in which stamps are coated with a compound 
that activates processing equipment has generated a need for a 
stronger adhesive that will keep a stamp on an envelope 
the mail is moving very quickly through our system in doing 
that you are again putting a great deal of stress on the stamp 
morison said 
he compared it to a speeding car running into a brick wall 
sending a passenger without a seat belt into the windshield 
you have the same thing in sorting mail the letter is moving 
down the processing stream and all of a sudden it stops as soon 
as it stops its that same kind of force as the car hitting the 
brick wall morison said what we are doing is developing an 
adhesive that will serve as a seat belt for a stamp 
the postal service has heard from customers whose letters were 
destroyed or returned because the stamps fell off he said 
the problem hasnt reached major proportions but it is 
clear that it will as the speed of mail processing continues to 
increase as it must the time to act is now and we are turning to 
the adhesive industry for help morison told the conference 
dr vincent mcginniss the program project manager at battelle 
said industries will develop potential new adhesives and supply 
samples to the institute for extensive testing and evaluation 
ultimately we will print real stamps that we will put 
into the mail stream well take them back out find out if they 
stuck and if they stayed on then do the evaluations a lot more 
testing mcginniss said in an interview 
battelle a notforprofit multinational research and 
development organization will write adhesive specifications which 
the postal service can use in buying the product from suppliers 
although the research should produce stickier stamps no change 
in taste is anticipated 
taste is a very personal thing what weve always sought in 
taste and where we think we are is neutral and bland and wed 
like to stay neutral and bland morison said taste is in the 
tongue of the users and this contract really has nothing to do 
with that

astronauts flying a jet 
modified to act like a space shuttle make steep 19degree dives 
toward the desert floor mondays through fridays flashing at 230 
mph 20 feet above a runway of packed white gypsum 
each time they have to deal with a malfunctioning computer 
broken landing gear a nonworking radio or some other problem 
generated by a sophisticated computer aboard the grumman gulfstream 
ii jet 
in addition to all their other shuttle training astronauts also 
must practice for a possible landing at the alternative runway in 
the desert at white sands 
it would be terrible if you had a good mission and messed it 
up with a bad landing said alex paczynski the national 
aeronautics and space administrations project manager at white 
sands space harbor 
shuttle commanders rick hauck and shuttle pilot dick covey 
practiced landings wednesday in the modified jet 
theres a humongous computer on board that takes the flight 
characteristics of the shuttle and the flight characteristics of 
the airplane and matches them together paczynski said 
the computer can simulate a shuttle bringing back a heavy 
payload or a stiff wind or a system malfunction or a combination 
of problems 
hauck and covey are scheduled to go up on the next shuttle 
flight aboard discovery in september or october 
a simulated countdown leading to a test firing of the shuttles 
main engines ran into a snag wednesday and was delayed 24 hours 
nasa engineers hope to fix a small gas leak in a vent line 
associated with a steering engine without taking discovery off the 
pad and into a hangar a move that could delay the launch as much 
as two months 
the shuttles primary landing site is edwards air force base in 
california a dry lake bed with plenty of room to make up for a 
lessthanperfect landing 
but if it rains at edwards hauck and covey could end up gliding 
down to one of the two dazzlingly white crisscross runways at the 
white sands dry lake bed 
if they land at white sands on a dry lake bed between the san 
andreas mountains and white sands national monument they will use 
a runway that has been leveled out a little better since jack r 
lousma landed the shuttle columbia there on march 30 1982 
engineers used lasers to check the smoothness of the runways 
paczynski said wednesday as he led reporters on a tour of the 
100squaremile complex in the middle of white sands missile range 
they also leveled and flattened the surface 300 feet wide on 
either side of the 300footwide landing strip in effect making 
the runway 900 feet wide at 35000 feet long the landing strips 
are about three times as long as those at commercial airports 
july august and september are the rainy months at white sands 
when half of the annual 12 inches of rain falls the dry lake 
bed was decidedly wet wednesday because threequarters of an inch 
of rain had fallen the night before but it was still firm 
notice how the bus wont get bogged down when it comes to this 
wet spot paczynski told reporters as their bus approached a 
50yardlong puddle theres a very hard mantle here 2 inches 
under the topsoil thats why you could land an orbiter here even 
if the strip were underwater they wouldnt but they could 
when the shuttle lands on the gypsum flats its as if it were 
landing on a milethick 7milelong piece of sheetrock the panels 
used for interior walls 
prevailing southwesterly wind carries gypsum crystals from the 
lake bed to the famous dunes shimmering in the distance 
the wind and the sharp gypsum crystals created havoc the one 
time a shuttle landed here 
the deservice and mating area where the astronauts disembark 
and where the shuttle is hoisted aboard a boeing 747 for the flight 
back to florida was so dusty that officials feared for the 
vessels safety so theyve moved the area to a less dusty spot in 
the lee of the mountains paczynski said

pentagon officials on thursday defended the 
use of prescribed stimulants to air force pilots on long solo 
flights and said no recent crash has been linked to drug use 
none of the crashes in germany was linked to drug use said 
pentagon spokesman fred hoffman no crashes anywhere have been 
related to drug use 
a west german television network reported wednesday that us 
air force pilots there take dexedrine to stay alert in flight and 
take the sedative seconal to sleep afterwards 
concern has grown in europe following the crashes of five f16 
jet fighters in west germany within three months this year 
the west german network ard quoted an unidentified us air 
force officer as saying that pilots take dexedrine so that they 
are able to fly when they havent gotten enough sleep or dont feel 
fit enough 
consumer advocate sidney wolfe of public citizen appearing on 
the abctv program good morning america said his group was 
concerned about a military that has to depend upon using uppers 
and downers to perform well 
wolfe said if commercial pilots used such drugs they would be 
fired or grounded 
imagine the scenario of a fighter pilot flying one of these 
planes having an hallucination and pressing the wrong button 
particularly if there is a bomb on board he said 
hoffman and other officials said us military pilots use such 
stimulants on long flights across the atlantic and pacific oceans 
and not on exercises over populated areas 
the air force does not routinely prescribe medication to air 
crew members but on long flights where pilot fatigue could present 
a significant safety risk stimulant and sedative medications may 
be authorized by the major command surgeon general said hoffman 
dispensing of these medications is rigidly controlled routine 
use of these medications is never advised the individual crew 
member makes the decision to take or not to take the medication 
he said 
such use he said was confined almost exclusively to long 
flights dexedrine seconal and temazepam a stimulant are 
prescribed almost exclusively for transoceanic solo missions in 
singleseat aircraft 
the air force was not considering any changes in the practice 
which has been standard for as long as 30 years spokesmen said 
none of the other services the army navy or marine corps 
prescribe such drugs for pilots hoffman said 
and the navy medical command issued a statement saying that it 
neither prescribed nor permitted the use of such drugs on flights 
by navy pilots 
the missions and environments in which navy and air force 
pilots fly are different the navy statement said navy pilots 
seldom fly long uninterrupted flights in single or twoseater 
aircraft which air force pilots do regularly in deploying aircraft 
across the ocean on training exercises 
as a matter of policy naval aviators are not given 
prescription stimulants or depressants for use during or after 
flight the navy statement said 
only caffeine in the form of coffee and triptophan in the form 
of warm milk are permitted for these purposes the navy statement 
said 
col russell b raymond chief of the aerospace medical 
consultants division of the air force surgeon generals office 
said in an interview on abctv that the service does on occasion 
prescribe medication to our pilots but these are under very 
special circumstances 
raymond said he did not know how often the drugs are taken but 
said they have been used for 25 to 30 years probably longer

jordan canceled a 13 billion development 
plan in the israelioccupied lands thursday as part of what 
officials called a plan to give the plo responsibility for the 15 
million palestinians living there 
jordan state radio said the announcement was made after a 
cabinet meeting led by prime minister zaid rifai the radio said 
jordan would continue its national role as a confronation state 
and a prime party in the arabisraeli conflict 
a rebellion among the 15 million palestinians in the occupied 
territories began dec 8 and has come largely under plo direction 
more than 230 palestinians and four israelis have been killed 
a senior jordanian official confirmed reports in the arab press 
that king hussein is making broad changes in jordans relationship 
with the palestinians but the radio quoted rifai as saying the new 
measures will not harm the national unity among palestinians and 
jordanians in the kingdom 
the fiveyear west bank development plan was established in 
1986 by agreement with the palestine liberation organization to 
finance health education housing and cultural and islamic 
affairs projects in the west bank and gaza strip 
the west bank was under jordanian rule until israel captured it 
in the 1967 arabisraeli war israel captured the gaza strip from 
egypt 
although israel occupied the west bank jordan continued paying 
salaries and pensions of many goverment employees there and west 
bank representatives sit in the jordanian parliament the 60member 
upper house now includes 30 from the west bank 
twothirds of jordans 35 million people are of palestinian 
origin including the entire population of the west bank 
a senior jordanian official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said of thursdays action 
this is part of king husseins decision to free himself from 
representation of the palestinian people and leaves the doors open 
for the plo to shoulder responsibility on its own the kings 
decision also reflects the plos wish to take over all palestinian 
affairs in the west bank and gaza strip 
according to the radio jordan will urge friendly and 
brotherly countries to continue their support and financial 
assistance to the palestinian uprising in the occupied 
territories 
on wednesday the saudi newspaper alsharq alawsat quoted rifai 
as saying decisive developments were planned to give 
palestinians greater responsibility as an entity 
alqabas a kuwaiti newspaper predicted wednesday that hussein 
would dissolve parliament and change the government with marwan 
qassem the royal court minister the strongest candidate to 
succeed rifai 
it said hussein had decided to dissociate himself from the 
palestinian question and let the plo take the responsibility 
alqabas which usually is wellinformed on jordanian affairs said 
rifai would become husseins personal representative 
israeli leaders said they expected no major change in jordans 
policy 
prime minster yitzhak shamir said we still see the jordanians 
as a partner in direct peace negotiations this doesnt change 
anything as far as were concerned 
foreign minister shimon peres who has encouraged jordan to form 
a joint negotiating delegation with moderate palestinians said of 
husseins action what hes doing is not a change in policy but a 
purely technical move 
peres said it would have no effect as long as the king does 
not declare war on us and does not close the jordan bridges or 
prevent palestinians from holding jordanian passports

two factions in cambodias civil war 
exchanged sharp words thursday indicating that major hurdles 
remain on the road to peace after four days of unprecented talks 
despite the differences the informal talks resulted in a broad 
convergence of views on key issues and on the urgent need for a 
political settlement said a closing statement from indonesian 
foreign minister ali alatas who hosted the gathering 
participating were vietnam its ally laos the vietnambacked 
cambodian government the three guerrilla groups fighting vietnams 
occupation and the proguerrilla association of southeast asian 
nations thailand malaysia indonesia the philippines singapore 
and brunei 
their representatives gathered at the old presidential palace in 
bogor 40 miles outside jakarta 
khieu samphan leader of the khmer rouge guerrilla faction 
called vietnams contention that the cambodian meeting had reached 
broad agreement a shameless lie aimed at perpetuating its 
occupation of cambodia forever through its puppet regime 
he accused vietnams foreign minister nguyen co thach of 
rejecting all guerrilla peace proposals at the talks vietnam he 
said must unconditionally withdraw from cambodia instead of 
linking a pullout to demands that steps be taken to insure the 
khmer rouge does not return to power 
thachs statements to reporters were aimed at deceiving the 
international community he added 
meanwhile hun sen the cambodian leader told a news conference 
that his party and the guerrilla resistance have made efforts to 
find common ground it was a pity that the khmer rouge rejected our 
proposal 
he said they proposed a national reconciliation council with the 
former guerrilla alliance leader prince norodom sihanouk in 
charge that would include political but not military participation 
by the khmer rouge 
vietnam invaded cambodia in december 1978 to halt bloody attacks 
on its western border by the khmer rouge who had killed hundreds 
of thousands of people in trying to transform cambodia into a 
primitive agrarian society during its 197579 rule 
the communist khmer rouge is now allied in a guerrilla coalition 
with the forces of sihanouk cambodias former monarch and son 
sann of the noncommunist khmer peoples national liberation front 
thach said wednesday the talks had resolved the most difficult 
problems and there was agreement in general terms though not on 
details one agreement was the need for steps to prevent a khmer 
rouge return he said 
on thursday thach said he was halfhappy with the talks and 
declared vietnam was determined to have a political solution 
before 1990 its selfimposed deadline for withdrawing its more 
than 100000 occupation troops 
a desire to avoid a post1990 civil war led the conflicting 
parties to the bogor talks 
the participants agreed to form working groups of senior 
officials of all sides to study issues of contention and by years 
end make recommendations for another round of talks 
even singapores hardline foreign minister suppiah dhanabalan 
called the talks a very important psychological breakthrough 
as the first meeting among all the warring parties 
meanwhile hun sen head of the phnom phen government confirmed 
he would meet with sihanouk in paris in october for a third round 
of talks they met in france in december and january and sihanouk 
canceled a planned third round 
sihanouk who ruled cambodia from 194170 and is widely 
considered essential to a future government recently resigned as 
president of the resistance coalition saying the khmer rouge was 
killing his men 
sihanouk refused to go to bogor where the talks were held but 
he reclaimed center stage by meeting wednesday in jakarta with his 
guerrilla partners and hun sen his son prince norodom ranariddh 
represented sihanouk at bogor 
the statement issued by alatas the host said participants 
agreed the two key issues of the cambodian problem are the 
withdrawal of vietnamese forces from kampuchea to be carried out 
within the context of an overall political solution and the 
prevention of the recurrence of genocidal policies and practices of 
the pol pot khmer rouge regime and to ensure the cessation of all 
foreign interference and external arms supplies to the opposing 
kampuchean forces they also agreed on the need for definite 
timetables and an international presence to supervise these 
processes it said 
alatas said no official communique was issued because the talks 
were informal diplomatic sources said singapore and thailand the 
two hardestline states on the issue were upset by what they saw 
as vietnam besting the others and led opposition to a communique

sen edward kennedy said thursday he finds 
acting deputy attorney general harold christensens optimistic 
assessment of justice department morale somewhat incredible and 
said he is concerned christensen is going over there with 
blinders on 
christensen was the third justice department nominee in two days 
to reject testimony by former deputy attorney general arnold burns 
that the department had been gripped in a deep malaise when he 
resigned march 29 to protest attorney general edwin meese iiis 
continued tenure 
at his confirmation hearing before the senate judiciary 
committee christensen said that when he came to the justice 
department early last month he quickly saw that its operations were 
running effectively 
i think morale is high christensen testified 
kennedy dmass questioned christensens portrayal twice 
during the hearing and repeatedly asked the nominee why he hadnt 
met with burns and former criminal division chief william weld 
about their protest resignations stemming from meeses refusal to 
step down in the face of an ongoing criminal investigation 
weld said he quit because he felt meese had committed ethical 
violations and probably commited crimes as well 
christensen said he found it inappropriate to inquire since he 
might be in a position at some point of having to make judgments of 
his own 
kennedy said that should have prompted christensen to ask more 
questions not fewer 
christensen said he enjoys a close working relationship with 
meese meeting with him usually two or three times a day and that 
he has formed no judgments of his own about ethical or legal 
questions regarding the attorney general 
hours after independent counsel james mckay sent an 814page 
report on meeses activities to a panel of judges on july 5 meese 
announced he would resign and he plans to leave next month 
mckay conducted a 14month inquiry into meeses actions at the 
request of attorney e bob wallach on behalf of scandalplagued 
wedtech corp and a 1 billion iraqi pipeline project plus meeses 
tax filings and his stock holdings in bell telephone companies 
mckay concluded meese probably broke two tax laws and twice 
violated a federal conflictofinterest statute but mckay decided 
not to indict the attorney general meese sharply criticized the 
findings and said he had been exonerated 
kennedy said he found christensens comments somewhat 
incredible and added that he is concerned the nominee is going 
over there with blinders on 
the acting deputy attorney general replied i dont think so 
senator 
the justice departments office of professional responsibility 
is conducting an ethics inquiry of meeses activities in the wake 
of the report by mckay who decided against seeking an indictment 
of the attorney general 
the office could issue a highly critical report of the attorney 
generals ethics 
i would expect that office to discharge its responsibility 
christensen said i would certainly not interfere with that 
office discharging its responsibility at another point in the 
hearing he said i would support what they are obligated to do 
if confirmed as deputy attorney general the 62yearold salt 
lake city attorney almost certainly will be serving under richard 
thornburgh the former pennsylvania gop governor whose nomination 
for attorney general has been widely praised by republicans and 
democrats thornburghs confirmation hearing is set for aug 5 
christensen who became acting deputy attorney general june 1 
his first government job was president of the utah state bar in 
197576 
at their confirmation hearing wednesday for permanent positions 
francis a keating ii and edward sg dennis jr said the 
department was running well in the final days of meese

a millionaire businessman who promised to bankroll 
a new life for a welfare mother of five faces criminal charges and 
a 14 million judgment in a bank fraud and is not free to spend 
his money attorneys said today 
james gisclair had offered to buy a house for anita hunter and 
her family and provide her with a job a college education a car 
and a nurse to care for the children 
but court records show that a subsidiary of capital bank won a 
civil judgment against him after alleging in state court that 
gisclair defrauded the lender out of 13 million the judgment 
includes interest on that amount 
the criminal charges stem from the civil case according to 
chief assistant us attorney richard gregorie who filed charges 
against gisclair two weeks ago in federal court accusing him of 
making a false statement to a bank 
capitals attorney hugh culverhouse jr said today that he 
understands gisclair must satisfy any outstanding judgments before 
he can freely spend his money 
the attorney added that in a deposition filed after the 
judgment gisclair said his businesses were worthless 
gisclair did not immediately return calls to this boca raton 
office today 
he said wednesday that he made his promise to hunter because he 
felt like nobody was doing more than lip service to make a 
difference about poverty 
i kept driving by and seeing the homeless he said it 
started to really bother me i honestly became consumed by the 
urge to do something about it 
 
 
for 28yearold anita hunter struggling to raise her children 
including a monthold son in a drugridden innercity miami 
neighborhood dubbed the hole his offer is a fairy tale 
come true 
i cant believe this is happening to me she said its 
just a miracle from god ive struggled and hoped for so long to 
get my children out of this neighborhood and into a safe 
environment 
gisclair a 43yearold new orleans native and principal owner 
of six boca raton enterprises including a real estate management 
company and a restaurant found the family through livia garcia of 
miamis community development department he told her he wanted to 
help real people he could see and talk to 
my idea is to see exactly where my money is going and be able 
to measure its success said gisclair who has four children 
the idea is to get anita to become selfsufficient to the point 
where she can pay her own rent on the house pay her own bills and 
do everything on her own someday i plan to pay for everything 
until she reaches that point 
he said he would find a home for the family in boca raton 
delray beach or deerfield beach about 100 miles north of miami 
ms hunter would work during the day and attend florida atlantic 
university at night so she could pursue her goal of becoming an 
accountant 
its not the first time gisclair has tried the idea 
an earlier effort to help a welfare mother with four children 
failed because she was totally unwilling to participate 
gisclair said 
and then one day she asked me to pay half of her rent because 
her exhusband didnt come through with the money i volunteered to 
pay it directly to her landlord but she said no send it to me 
that was enough for me to realize i was being connned 
thats why gisclairs has attached some conditions 
i just want anita to be honest with me he said i want

research into chemical and biological weapons 
could be dangerous to surrounding communities according to a 
safety review but the pentagon said thursday its safety 
precautions are enough to protect against accidents 
the pentagon has stringent and necessary safety precautions 
for its chemical weapons program said thomas j welch deputy 
assistant secretary of defense for chemical weapons 
welch defended the pentagons safety standards in an appearance 
before the senate governmental affairs oversight subcommittee 
which has been investigating the safety of the two programs 
a subcommittee staff report earlier this year found that the 
pentagon lacked firm safety regulations for research into 
biological weapons and outlined safety lapses in both chemical and 
biological programs 
the pentagon last year began building chemical weapons for the 
first time since 1969 and research is conducted at government and 
private laboratories in about 150 locations throughout the country 
according to the subcommittee 
the united states has formally renounced the use of biological 
warfare since 1969 but the pentagon spends an increasing amount of 
money to develop defenses for a variety of types of germ warfare 
that might be used against us forces 
spending for biological and chemical research has increased 
sharply since president reagan took office in 1981 in fiscal 1980 
the total research was 635 million compared with the 348 
million figure for fiscal 1986 
the general accounting office in a report presented to the 
committee said there are a number of potential dangers among the 
chemical and biological research sites scattered around the united 
states 
dr neil h levitt a former microbologist at fort detrick md 
told the panel that in 1981 the army lost about two quarts of a 
potentially dangerous virus used as a vaccine against a highly 
infectious disease and has not been able to account satisfactorily 
for the missing virus since then 
military officials dispute dr levitts contentions and said the 
virus vaccine had been sterilized by a technician 
welch said the pentagon in its chemical weapons program 
applies stringent safety storage maintenance use and 
accounting requirements for all internal and contractor facilities 
that use chemical agents 
those requirements included unannounced inspections and 
rehearsals for hypothetical accidents he said 
in geneva switzerland on thursday max friedersdorf the us 
delegate to the conference on disarmament named officially for the 
first time the location of five chemical weapons production 
facilities in the united states 
they are located at the rocky mountain arsenal in colorado 
the pine bluff arsenal in arkansas muscle shoals in alabama 
newport army ammunition depot in indiana and aberdeen proving 
ground in maryland 
however an army spokesman in washington lt col john chapla 
said chemical weapons currently are only produced or stored at pine 
bluff and muscle shoals 
these are locations which are at present or were at one time 
involved in the production of chemical weapons chapla said of 
the five sites named by friedersdorf at rocky mountain and 
newport there is no chemical weapon production testing or storage 
going on 
aberdeen is used to test some components of the current 
generation of chemical weapons but is not used to produce store 
or test the binary or dual chemical weapons that the us military 
now uses chapla said 
our focus now is the production of binary chemical 
principally at pine bluffs chapla said 
some work is also done at muscle shoals on one of the chemicals 
used in the production of binary weapons but the weapon is not 
deadly until the two chemicals are combined he said 
the binary program is such that you never have a complete 
weapon stored in any one place the two chemicals are never kept 
together and they will not be mated until just before firing 
chapla said 
as for biological weapons the pentagon has proposed building a 
54 million biological aerosol test facility at the dugway proving 
ground in utah 
at thursdays hearing welch said that in response to the 
subcommittees report last may the pentagon will require that its 
biological research program comply with biosafety standards set by 
the federal centers for disease control and the national institutes 
of health previously that compliance was only a recommendation 
not a requirement 
the gao noted that in addition to pentagon requirements the 
programs also must meet local and state safety standards 
the defense department approaches safety for the programs in two 
different ways the study said 
for private companies doing research into chemical weapons the 
pentagon has developed and implemented a reasonably systemic and 
comprehensive approach for evaluating and managing risks the gao 
said but it recommended that the pentagon work harder at looking 
at potential accidents 
no pentagon safety requirements have been done for biological 
weapons research the gao said instead the pentagon relies on 
an existing safeguards system that was developed by the 
biomedical establishment 
biological defense research and development poses recognized 
health and safety risks thus adequate protective measures need to 
be implemented the gao warned 
the review noted that about 10 percent of the biological 
defense program contracts involve genetic engineering techniques to 
study disease processes the use of genetic engineering and 
recombinant dna molecules has been a subject of concern because of 
the risks associated with the possible creation of modified agents 
and their potential release into the environment 
for that reason the gao noted the pentagon requires the 
contractors to follow nih guidelines for research involving genetic 
engineering

federal judges in los angeles and bridgeport conn today 
refused to unseal search warrant information on the pentagon 
bribery probe saying release of the documents might compromise the 
investigation 
news organizations had requested the information which consists 
of affidavits filed by prosecutors in order to gain warrants to 
search defense contractors offices 
us district judge david v kenyon in los angeles reversed a 
ruling by us magistrate joseph reichmann earlier this month that 
the documents from the california portion of the investigation 
should be unsealed 
on balance kenyon said the publics interest in a 
complete and uninhibited investigation strongly outweighs its need 
for or right of access to the search warrant affidavits at this 
time 
the government has released minor portions of some documents but 
fought for secrecy on more important information 
earlier this month in los angeles the government released 30 
pages that showed federal agents wiretapped telephone conversations 
to gather information on northrop corp teledyne electronics and 
litton industries 
in bridgeport us district judge tf gilroy daly said the 
documents sought by the hartford courant are extremely detailed 
and contain information that would certainly endanger the ongoing 
grand jury proceedings 
the newspaper had sought documents on searches at connecticut 
offices of norden systems a united technologies corp subsidiary 
there is a right under the first amendment of access to court 
documents the judge said but at this early stage the right 
is a qualified and limited one 
the government agreed however to unseal very limited parts of 
the documents that describe the person who swore out the affidavit 
and the premises searched and the introductory section of the 
affidavit 
ralph elliot the courants attorney said the ruling was more 
limited than other judges have made and it is disappointing 
the pentagon investigation centers on allegations that defense 
contractors and consultants many of them former military men 
bribed pentagon officials for inside information useful in winning 
contracts worth billions of dollars 
norden is suspected of benefiting from inside information to 
build a battlefield communication system for the marines according 
to other documents already released in the investigation 
earlier this month norden withdrew from the bidding for the 
communications system citing the suspicions raised by the 
investigation 
us attorney stanley a twardy jr said today however that a 
norden program not disclosed so far is the only one under 
investigation he declined further comment 
norden officials did not immediately return telephone calls 
the courant last week asked for release of documents related to 
the june 14 search of norden offices in bridgeport trumbull and 
norwalk and a june 15 search of the shelton home of james e 
rapinac a senior vice president 
the information released today said federal agents searched the 
east norwalk office of bill kingston norden executive vice 
president and other areas of the building where his documents are 
stored and his secretary sits 
the documents also said agents went to norden offices occupied 
by jack richardson and vice president roger engle and other areas 
of the building where documents calendars files and other 
information they keep would be stored 
it wasnt known what position richardson holds

the reagan administration and key house 
democrats on thursday voiced opposition to any move at this time to 
establish us and vietnamese diplomatic interest sections in hanoi 
and washington 
but administration officials held out the promise of full 
diplomatic relations between the two former adversaries if 
vietnamese troops are withdrawn from cambodia 
principal support for establishing diplomatic interest sections 
in the two capitals came from a pair of republicans including sen 
john mccain of arizona who spent years as a war prisoner during 
the vietnamese war 
it is a modest step mccain told the house foreign affairs 
subcommittee on southeast asia 
its sole purpose is to speed progress in a number of issues 
including americans missing in action emigration of amerasians 
through the orderly departure program the release of vietnamese in 
reeducation camps and the continued vietnamese occupation of 
cambodia 
mccain and rep tom ridge rpa contended the time is ripe for 
such a step because the vietnamese have made it clear they will 
leave cambodia because the vietnamese economy is shattered 
because a new generation is taking power in hanoi and because an 
opportunity exists to woo the vietnamese away from the soviet union 
senator mccain and i agreed that the status quo was horribly 
unacceptable and unsatisfactory ridge said the parents of our 
mias still wait for word on their missing heroes 
an interest section is the lowest type of us diplomatic 
contact with another nation and does not involve the establishment 
of formal diplomatic relations of any kind officials of the two 
nations involved generally use office space in an embassy of a 
third nation 
gaston sigur assistant secretary of state for east asian and 
pacific affairs said the administration believes that establishing 
us and vietnamese interest sections now would harm us 
interests hand hanoi a major political victory and perhaps 
rekindle hanois determination to stay in cambodia 
we have refrained from establishing normal diplomatic 
relations with vietnam as a demonstration of our opposition to 
vietnams illegal occupation of cambodia sigur said were we 
now to agree to the establishment of interest sections in our 
respective capitals this would represent a fundamental change in 
our policy of supporting the diplomatic isolation of vietnam 
karl jackson deputy assistant secretary of defense for east 
asian affairs said that establishing a us diplomatic presence in 
hanoi now would encourage hardliners in vietnam who do not wish 
to leave cambodia by removing the pressure 
we must keep the pressure on because it is working he said 
we must maintain the policy of no aid no trade no 
normalization 
that policy will change eventually but for the time being the 
us position must be normalization yes fine but not now 
jackson said 
as thursdays hearing concluded rep stephen solarz dny 
the subcommittee chairman said he agreed that the time has not 
come to establish diplomatic ties of any kind 
i come away from the hearing even more convinced it would be 
potentially counterproductive to proceed with interest sections at 
this time solarz said i think the downside is very clear but 
the time will come and i hope it comes soon 
sigur said progress is being made toward ending the vietnamese 
occupation of cambodia and that a full dialogue is under way on 
humanitarian issues 
given the current level of cooperation we do not believe that 
more formal diplomatic structures are required he said 
but sigur said the us opposition to setting up interest 
sections now should not be seen as a sign that the administration 
remains implacably hostile toward vietnam 
we hold no malice toward vietnam as a result of the war in 
indochina he said 
in fact we look forward to the time when we will be able to 
enter into normal diplomatic and commercial relations with vietnam 
and have made it clear we are prepared to normalize if there is a 
complete vietnamese troop withdrawal from cambodia

secretary frank c carlucci for a final review 
i understand that adm fogarty is prepared to report to gen

then adm crowe and the secretary of defense and nothing ensues 
until that review process is completed we dont go public until 
the process is completed in short dont expect anything next 
week hoffman said 
pentagon officials have promised to release as soon as possible

attack on the uss stark by an iraqi fighter 
in the case of the stark investigation it was five months 
before the report was actually released wed like to do a better 
job of getting it to you earlier howard said

consumer spending increased in june at the 
fastest pace in 10 months the government said thursday fueling 
concern over inflation and whether the economy will have room for 
production of exports 
the commerce department said personal consumption spending 
which includes virtually everything except interest on debt shot 
up a seasonally adjusted 10 percent in june the steepest climb 
since a 13 percent gain in august two months before the october 
stock market crash 
the report was a disappointment to many economists who are 
looking for growth in consumer demand to slow in order to narrow 
the nations trade deficit 
excessive consumer demand implies that imports will grow and 
that factories will have difficulty increasing production of 
exports if they also have to step up manufacture of goods for 
domestic buyers this strain on factory capacity could add to 
inflation if buyers bid up the price of scarce goods 
in another economic report adding to inflation concerns the 
labor department said import prices one of the main inflationary 
threats facing the us economy because of the weaker dollar rose 
27 percent in the apriljune quarter the biggest increase in more 
than a year 
the climb followed a 12 percent increase in the januarymarch 
period and was the steepest since the 41 percent jump in the first 
three months of 1987 which was attributed almost entirely to 
rising crude oil prices 
most analysts were expecting consumer demand to slow after the 
october stock market crash but that has not happened 
theres some real danger here that we will end up with too 
much of a good thing warned david jones an economist with 
aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer in new york 
this consumer spending is so strong it probably will trigger 
at some point federal reserve actions to push interest rates 
higher he said adding that the move most likely will come after 
aug 16 when federal reserve policymakers next meet to consider 
monetary policy 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan appearing before 
a house banking subcommittee on thursday repeated a warning 
delivered to the senate two weeks ago that the fed was likely to 
err on the side of tightening the money supply rather than 
loosening 
greenspan said the 47percent inflation figure released 
wednesday as part of the report on the second quarter gross 
national product was somewhat larger than we would have 
expected 
however he said recent economic indicators have shown no 
evidence that would cause the federal reserve to radically change 
its policy 
there have been a lot of data but none has altered either 
my or as far as i can judge the boards general view as to where 
we are going and where we have been in a certain sense it has 
been a period in which there have been fewer surprises than 
normal he said 
the report on consumer spending also showed that americans 
personal income jumped a healthy 07 percent to 404 trillion in 
june the best showing in three months it followed a 05 percent 
rise in may a modest 02 percent increase in april and a 10 
percent jump in march 
the gain in income in part reflected healthy increases in 
employment in june the unemployment rate dropped to 53 percent 
last month a 14year low 
with spending rising a bit faster than income americans 
personal savings rate fell slightly to 43 percent compared with 
44 percent in may still the average savings rate for the first 
half of 1988 41 percent is up substantially from 32 percent in 
1987 
americans aftertax income increased a seasonally adjusted 08 
percent in june after shooting up 24 percent in may the 
department said tax payments declined in both may and june after 
higherthanaverage payments in april 
the department gave these details of spending 
on durable goods big ticket items expected to last three 
or more years spending rose 86 billion in june compared with an 
increase of 27 billion in may 
on nondurable goods spending rose 45 billion in june 
compared with 46 billion the month before 
on services spending rose 177 billion last month compared 
with 113 billion in may 
sandra shaber an economist with the futures group a washington 
consulting firm said the june increase in personal spending was 
not as alarming as it might have been because it was likely 
temporarily bolstered by heavy use of electrical power to run air 
conditioners 
the trend in consumer spending is about 2 percent annual 
growth certainly its not driving the economy she said

tamil rebels stabbed and hacked to 
death 14 sinhalese farmers on thursday the military said the 
killings occurred on the first anniversary of an accord aimed at 
ending the nations civil war 
the military accused a tamil rebel group called the liberation 
tigers for killing the cinnamon farmers near padaviya village in 
northeastern sri lanka

iraq demanded a formal peace treaty wih 
iran not just a ceasefire and asked the un security council on 
thursday to guarantee its enforcement 
in new york the iranian un mission said the policy of iraq 
is to put obstacles in the way of the secretarygenerals peace 
efforts this whole iraqi exercise is planned to sabotage the 
efforts upon which the international community is looking with 
hope 
both sides reported fighting at eslamabad 60 miles inside iran 
iraq which says it has withdrawn from iranian territory describes 
the invaders as iranian rebels but iran claims they are iraqi 
troops 
iraqi television said saadun hamadi the acting foreign 
minister summoned the ambassadors of the five permanent security 
council members united states soviet union china britain and 
france and insisted on a peace treaty 
this is the only way to secure a peaceful settlement of the 
8yearold war he was quoted as saying 
he added however that iraq is for an early immediate 
ceasefire as a means to end the war within the framework of a 
comprehensive peace settlement 
un negotiations are being conducted under security council 
resolution 598 the yearold proposal iran says it will accept it 
provides for a ceasefire followed by withdrawal to recognized 
borders prisoner exchange peace negotiations and an investigation 
of which side started the war 
javier perez de cuellar the un secretarygeneral said in new 
york that iran responded positively to his proposals for 
implementing the resolution and was awaiting iraqs reaction 
he has met with the foreign ministers of the two countries ali 
akbar velayati and tariq aziz hamadi is iraqs acting foreign 
minister while aziz is in new york 
perez de cuellar also said he hopes iran will consider at some 
stage holding direct talks with iraq which insists on them he 
said talks at the united nations were suspended for reflection 
thursday 
iraqi television quoted hamadi as telling the ambassadors 
lasting and comprehensive peace is the only way iran will not 
change its position in the future the peace treaty should be 
guaranteed by the security council member states 
a ceasefire would not end the state of war and instability in 
the region 
hamadi also restated iraqs position that it has no ambitions 
in iranian territory 
iran said its forces broke through the defenses of iraqi troops 
and iranian rebels at eslamabad inside the central border killing 
at least 4000 iraqis and mercenaries according to a dispatch 
of the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
cyprus 
spokesmen of the mujahedeen khalq an iranian rebel movement 
based in iraq said units of its national liberation army were 
holding eslamabad 
a communique from iraqs military said its warplanes were 
bombing iranian military airfields in the area indicating the 
iraqis at least were providing air support 
the rebels claim to have occupied eslamabad and nearby karand 
but iran says the invasion has been led by regular iraqi troops 
an iraqi communique read on television reported continuing 
fighting on the border front despite the claims that iraqs 
soldiers had withdrawn from iranian territory occupied over the 
past week 
it said said warplanes flew 173 sorties and attacked helicopter 
landing strips east of eslamabad the comminique also said the jets 
destroyed an iranian helicopter base in bakhtaran 30 miles from 
eslamabad 
tehran said iranian fighter bombers and helicopters flew 175 
sorties over the central and southern fronts 
dispatches from the official news agency said iranian forces had 
regained more than 150 square miles in the central sector and two 
northern peaks 
iranian television also monitored in nicosia showed what it 
said were iranian soldiers entering eslamabad dispatches from the 
news agency said the bodies of many iranian rebels were found 
including young women 
irna said the terrorists known as the munafiqeen 
hypocrites were also equipped with antichemical masks first 
aid kits iraqi cigarettes and alcoholic drinks brewed in iraq 
islam forbids the drinking of alcohol 
among other things found in the pockets of slain women 
terrorists were contraceptive pills which show the widespread 
promiscuity in the ranks of both the munafiqeen and the iraqis

polish foreign minister tadeusz olechowski met 
thursday with secretary of state george p shultz and said both 
sides are determined to work toward further improvements in 
polishamerican relations 
olechowski the first polish foreign minister to visit 
washington in nine years said he invited shultz to visit poland 
the response was one of general approval he said but no 
details were discussed 
polishamerican relations hit bottom after poland imposed 
martial law in 1981 and outlawed the independent trade union 
solidarity the reconciliation process began about two years ago 
highlighted by a visit to warsaw last october by vice president 
george bush and the lifting by last year of the economic sanctions 
that had been imposed by the united states 
we have normalized our relations olechowski told reporters 
after a twohour meeting with shultz and other senior officials 
from both sides 
although progress in bilateral relations has been made we 
certainly hope its not the end of the road olechowski said 
he said the ambitions the interests and the intentions of 
both countries are extensive and there is a determination on both 
ends to go ahead 
there is room for increased political contacts and economic and 
cultural cooperation he said in all areas there are 
possibilities 
one source of friction between the two countries is polands 
claim that the united states has been providing financial support 
to solidarity 
polish authorities also believe that the west has been too slow 
in extending credits that would enable poland to overcome its 
economic problems which include a 40 billion foreign debt the 
largest in eastern europe 
olechowskis visit was his first trip outside poland since he 
became foreign minister several weeks ago it occurred a day after 
hungarian communist party leader karoly grosz met with president 
reagan during an official visit 
groszs visit also was seen as a breakthrough because no 
hungarian leader of that rank had visited washington since hungary 
became communist 40 years ago 
both hungary and poland are members of the sovietled warsaw 
pact asked why he was visiting washington instead of moscow on his 
first foreign trip olechowski said the visit had been planned by 
his predecessor marian orzechowski

the price of imported goods one of the main 
inflationary yardsticks in the us economy rose 27 percent in 
the apriljune quarter the largest increase in more than a year 
the government reported thursday 
the labor department said the second quarter rise followed a 12 
percent increase in the januarymarch period and was the steepest 
since the 41 percent jump in the first three months of 1987 which 
was attributed almost entirely to rising crude oil prices 
higher oil prices were also a significant contributor to the 
second quarter gain this year imported fuel and related products 
jumped 67 percent from the first quarter however over the past 
year they were down 127 percent 
excluding the effects of the jump in imported oil second 
quarter prices rose 23 percent in line with the average quarterly 
increase over the last three years 
sharp rises in metals and natural rubber led the climb iron and 
steel prices soared 35 percent in the second quarter while other 
metals rose 165 percent the price of imported nickel a key 
ingredient in steel manufacturing shot up 558 percent for the 
quarter and more than doubled in price over the past year 
the price of natural rubber climbed 328 percent for the quarter 
and was up 60 percent from a year ago bill alterman a labor 
department analyst said the worldwide acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome epidemic is driving up natural rubber prices by increasing 
the demand for condoms and rubber gloves 
for the past year import prices were up 63 percent that 
compares with a 44 percent annual rate of inflation in overall 
consumer prices since the beginning of 1987 
the fall of the dollar from highs in early 1985 while improving 
the price competitiveness of us goods overseas and helping to 
lower the us trade deficit also has the effect of boosting the 
price of foreign goods in american markets 
however according to the report the dollar played a 
substantially smaller role in driving up import prices than in 
previous quarters the dollar declined in value against foreign 
currencies by only 02 percent in the second quarter compared with 
drops of 11 percent in the first quarter and 58 percent in last 
three months of 1987 
in recent weeks the value of the dollar has been rising 
on the export side prices of us goods sold overseas also rose 
27 percent the largest increase since the government began 
tracking the figures in september 1983 
rising metal costs as well as the first droughtcaused jumps in 
grain prices were responsible for much of the export rise in the 
second quarter 
the price of exported grain was up 93 percent in the apriljune 
period led by a 301 percent hike in wheat prices iron and steel 
prices rose 44 percent while other metals were up 72 percent

michael g gartner the new president of nbc 
news might have caused some palpitations among his subordinates 
thursday when he talked about his standards 
my favorite network is the bbc gartner said in a 
closedcircuit broadcast to nbc employees and affiliates and i 
think if we just had somebody standing there reading the news and 
could get rid of all this film and everything it would be far more 
palatable 
just kidding he added indicating that he had no plans to 
drastically change the look of nbcs nightly news 
i happen to think that in tom brokaw and in all the producers 
here we have the greatest news organization in the world so the 
answer is i like nbc gartner said 
gartner 49 was appointed wednesday to replace lawrence k 
grossman who stepped down after four years as head of the news 
division gartner a former editor of the des moines iowa 
register and the courierjournal of louisville ky was most 
recently editor and partowner of the ames iowa daily tribune and 
a general executive of gannett co inc

elderly smalltown mississippi blues 
singers are being tapped as historians by a new national public 
radio series in which they share their memories and music to help 
young blacks understand their rural roots 
blues is not entertainment only said walter liniger whose 
10 interviews with local blues lovers are woven together in the 
oral history and music series the original down home blues 
show 
blues players have often been compared to the griot in the 
african tribal system the griot was the storyteller singer and 
historian of the tribe liniger said 
in a sense the blues player once had a similar function 
heshe processed and voiced in hisher own way the emotional 
undertows of the black community said liniger of the blues 
archive at the university of mississippi 
syndicated by national public radio in january the program 
already has aired on 12 stations around the country said craig 
koon president of media productions international which covered 
the projects 23000 and provided technical assistance 
thirtyfour other stations are scheduled to begin broadcasting 
the series soon koon said his company based in memphis tenn 
is negotiating with an underwriter to fund additional interviews 
with aging blues men and women 
liniger a swissborn musician said he didnt interview any 
wellknown musicians he was interested in the everyday men and 
women ages 60 to 80 from the rural south 
if you go back to the early part of this century where the 
idiom of blues begins to sort of take shape then the blues 
records or peoples memories are the only thing we have to document 
a certain aspect of the black experience in this country liniger 
said 
i do believe that even if we read black intellectuals of the 
time they were concerned with other topics than the rural south 
they were much more concerned with the black experience in urban 
settings 
the feeling i got from talking with a lot of older black 
people is they are living in a social context that is not 
documented either by blacks or whites 
each program in the series features an interview with a single 
musician 
the musicians dont always perform but sometimes choose from 
the archives selection songs that they enjoyed in younger years 
liniger then talks with them about what life was like when that 
song was popular exploring the educational social religious and 
moral aspects of the day 
for example 70yearold ellen jefferies of holly springs 
describes in one program her grade school memories 
i went to the rag school to the bush hollow just some 
posts nailed in the ground with some limbs and things cut off of 
trees and piled up around em and also over the top of it the same 
way and thats what we went to school in the bush hollow we 
toted our water from the spring down at the bottom of the hill 
she says 
about 10 children would gather at the bush hollow for class 
unless they were needed in the fields or elsewhere to help the 
family get by jefferies said 
many rural black women of her day didnt have the luxury of a 
doctors or hospitals care when their children were born she said 
i never went to no hospital i had my children myself 
jefferies recalls i had a midwife to come see me once or twice 
but whenever theyd get there my childrens was born i aint lying 
i had my childrens my own self me and the good lord together i 
say it like that 
five of her seven children died jefferies said 
jefferies said shes particularly proud of her son who lives in 
chicago a much different world than her holly springs 
liniger said he hopes the radio programs use of blues tunes as 
historical benchmarkers will help the children of chicago and other 
urban areas better understand the lives of their grandparents 
in another interview liniger asked 76yearold lee andrew 
cotton howell of holly springs what does the blues offer you 
today 
howell replied it helps me along it brings up stories and 
memories with my friends wed be sittin and talkin you know 
aint that many left

sixteen senators including the energy 
committee chairman unveiled a comprehensive plan thursday to 
combat the global overheating that scientists say threatens the 
planet in the 21st century 
their legislation with proposals ranging from developing safer 
nuclear power to minimizing destruction of third world forests 
represents the broadest capitol hill response yet to warnings from 
scientists about the socalled greenhouse effect 
the greenhouse effect is the most significant economic 
political environmental and human problem facing the 21st 
century said sen tim wirth dcolo the principal author of 
package 
joining him at a news conference was bennett johnston dla 
the energy chairman who has over the years been identified more 
with energy development and production than with environmental 
protection 
johnston who recently held a hearing on the greenhouse effect 
said that the evidence of global warming is virtually undeniable 
it is so much more comprehensive dangerous and lifechanging than 
anything weve ever seen 
aides said that johnston has become convinced that global action 
is necessary to combat the production of carbon and other 
greenhouse gases that scientists say trap heat in the atmosphere 
threatening major changes in climate and higher ocean levels 
johnston who said he would hold more hearings in coming weeks 
stopped short of endorsing a key element of wirths proposal 
requiring new car fleets to average 55 miles per gallon by 2010 or 
double the 1985 fuel efficiency standard 
the legislation would force this country to reduce carbon 
dioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2000 scientists estimate that 
carbon dioxide coming mostly from fossil fuel combustion produces 
about half the greenhouse effect the united states is said to be 
responsible for 20 percent of the worlds carbon dioxide emissions 
the proposal would require administration officials to draft a 
national energy plan emphasizing leastcost ways of reducing fossil 
fuel use and increasing use of renewables such as solar energy 
the package would authorize about 1 billion through 1992 for 
research and development of nonfossil energy sources and a new 
generation of safer and cheaper nuclear reactors it also calls for 
greater reliance on cleanerburning natural gas for heating and 
transportation 
on the international front the secretary of state would be 
urged to hold an international meeting aimed at getting other 
nations to commit to a 50 percent cut in greenhouse gas production 
by 2015 
the legislation would authorize this country to spend more than 
15 billion in the early 1990s to provide birth control 
information in an effort to slow the demand for fossil fuels in 
burgeoning nations 
it also calls for the united states to work through 
international lending and development agencies to slow the 
destruction of forests which consume carbon dioxide when alive but 
which emit huge amounts when they are cut down 
johnston said that to slow pollution in the third world were 
going to have to pay for their nondevelopment in some way and 
its going to be expensive 
he said that in 1989 well have to begin the serious process 
of legislating well act as fast as the publics willing to 
support us 
johnston said that economic interests like automakers and coal 
producers must understand that this is not a passing fad that 
its not going to go away this will not change with 
administrations its not a democraticrepublican issue its not a 
liberalconservative issue and im not sure we can solve it 
joining as cosponsors were max baucus dmont jeff bingaman 
dnm dale bumpers dark john chafee rri john danforth 
rmo wyche fowler dga albert gore dtenn john heinz 
rpa daniel inouye dhawaii john melcher dmont claiborne 
pell dri spark matsunaga dhawaii terry sanford dnc and 
robert stafford rvt 
the package was introduced a day after stafford baucus chaffee 
and david durenberger rminn submitted legislation to end all 
us production and use of chlorofluorocarbons by 1999 these 
chemicals contribute to global warming as well as destroying the 
ozone layer that shields the earth from the suns cancercausing 
ultraviolet rays 
their bill would also force power plants to reduce emissions of 
the pollutants that cause acid rain and require new homes to 
contain the most efficient heating and cooling systems available

the house passed 36829 on thursday a 58 
billion relief package for droughtstricken farmers after scaling 
back a heavily debated pricesupport increase for the dairy 
industry 
hold on house agriculture committee chairman e kika de 
la garza dtexas declared as the house approved the measure 
help is coming in a sensible rational compassionate way 
approval came after dairystate lawmakers responded to a 
drumroll of criticism by compromising on a plan to increase the 
pricesupport level for milk the house adopted 217181 a 
scaledback version that still would leave the cost of the benefit 
above the 100 million level 
this offers stability for our dairy farmers rep steve 
gunderson rwis declared as the house approved his plan to 
impose a 50cent increase in the milk pricesupport level but only 
for three months 
the action resolved the most heavily debated issue in the house 
version of the drought aid package the senate was expected to rush 
the measure through with equal dispatch possibly before the night 
was out 
both house and senate were working on highly similar versions of 
the bill with an eye toward putting the bill before the president 
at least by aug 11 when lawmakers are set to flee washingtons 
summer heat 
this bill is the most generous disaster relief package ever 
considered by the senate agriculture committee chairman patrick 
j leahy dvt said as debate began in that chamber 
at the core of both bills is a provision that would pay 
droughtstricken farmers 65 percent of lost earnings from crop 
damage in excess of 35 percent of the harvest expected before 
blazing sun and a shortage of rainfall hammered the midwest 
key provisions also would streamline and expand government 
programs to aid livestock and dairy producers forced to pay 
escalating feed costs because the drought has burned away a 
substantial quantity of hay and feedgrains 
gunderson and penny offered their plan to scale back the dairy 
provision after the original version came under criticism from the 
reagan administration as excessively costly 
sponsored by rep jim jeffords rvt the original version 
would have imposed an increase in the dairy price support level of 
50 cents on oct 1 to 1110 for each 100 pounds of milk that 
would cost consumers at most a few cents per gallon in increased 
milk prices 
dairystate lawmakers said the cost to the government would be 
145 million while agriculture secretary richard lyng said in a 
letter to the house agriculture committee chairman e kika de 
la garza dtexas on wednesday night that the actual cost would be 
300 million 
lawmakers said that the gundersonpenny plan limiting the 
increase to a threemonth period from april through june next year 
would reduce costs by perhaps 30 million 
dairystate lawmakers have been saying that the increase is 
warranted to avert a milk shortage looming over the country next 
spring and because milk producers have faced greater feed costs 
while not receiving the disaster payments that the bill allocates 
for crop producers 
but the increase has come under fire not only from the reagan 
administration but from an array of business groups and even farm 
organizations that most often ally themselves with dairymen in 
matters involving farmsubsidy legislation 
this is a most dangerous and wrongheaded precedent rep pat 
roberts rkan told the house in urging it to slash any 
pricesupport increase from the legislation should those in the 
cattle business in the sheep and the poultry business be asked to 
pay the same high feed costs without some similar subsidy thats 
not fair 
before taking up the dairy issue the house approved an 
amendment sponsored by de la garza that would bring the estimate 
cost to 58 billion when the measure came to the floor the price 
tag was placed at 69 billion by the agriculture committee staff 
the reason was because of a provision that would have required 
the agriculture department to pay half of the cost of reseeding and 
other seeding of droughtburned pastures in 20 states the measure 
sponsored by rep claude harris dala was harnessed to the bill 
when the agriculture committee was racing to wrap up work and later 
estimated to have a 12 billion cost 
de la garzas amendment reduced the overall cost of the bill by 
shrinking the seeding provision 
even then house speaker jim wright dtexas acknowledged 
thursday morning that there was no way to be perfectly sure of 
exactly how much the drought bill would cost farm lawmakers have 
been saying that fiscal watchdogs worried about the spending level 
have nothing to complain about because it would be less than 
federal savings realized because of the drought 
but wright said there was no certainty 
the art of economics is not a precise one wright said

the next round is expected to include discussions on a timetable 
for the withdrawal of the estimated 50000 cuban forces from 
angola where south africa also has several thousand troops

their extensive military support for angolas marxist government 
in the talks starting sunday crocker is expected ask adamyshin 
about soviet willingness to encourage a final settlement in 
discussions over the past year the soviets have indicated a 
positive attitude toward the negotiations and cuba has been sending 
out similar signals

adamyshin also will discuss the situation in the horn of africa 
where there has been continued civil strife in ethiopia the sudan 
and somalia

a state law signed thursday requires most 
residents to separate their trash within three years making 
pennsylvania the largest state with a mandatory recycling program 
in a brief ceremony in the rose garden at the executive mansion 
gov robert p casey signed the trash bill before a handful of 
lawmakers and several representatives of groups who had worked for 
the bills passage 
the law mandates that 407 communities with 78 million people 
establish the recycling plans to help cope with a growing trash 
problem and dwindling landfill space 
all over our state and all over our nation its as plain as 
the eye can see or the nose can smell that we have to change our 
ways casey said 
the states remaining 77 landfills have a combined capacity of 
only three to five years he said pennsylvanians each year 
generate nine million tons of trash 95 percent of which goes into 
landfills casey said only 1 percent of the states trash is 
recycled 
whether it floats up on beaches or seeps out of landfills we 
can see that our garbage does not disappear casey said 
the governor said the recycling program would reduce the states 
volume of solid waste by 25 percent by 1997 
under the law municipalities with more than 10000 residents 
must set up curbside recycling programs within two years and those 
with 5000 or more face a threeyear deadline 
counties will choose three of eight materials to recycle 
including glass colored glass aluminum steel and bimetallic 
cans highgrade office paper newsprint corrugated paper and

the most comprehensive banking bill since the 
great depression cleared a house committee thursday after 16 
grueling hours of debate but it faces an uncertain future with 
little time left in congress legislative year 
the bill approved by the house banking committee on a 3020 
vote grants banks broad new securities powers but restricts their 
ability to enter real estate and insurance and imposes new 
obligations on them to serve the poor 
the bill now is headed for the house energy and commerce 
committee where the chairman rep john d dingell dmich is 
known to be skeptical of letting banks into the securities business 
depending on how long house speaker jim wright dtexas allows 
for dingells review the powerful michigan democrat could kill the 
bill through delay or exact concessions by threatening delay 
congress is preparing to leave town for its summer recess on 
aug 12 and wont be back until sept 6 then it plans only a 
monthlong session before adjourning for the fall election campaign 
theres a real question whether this bill is going to pass the 
house its a very controversial bill and there just isnt much 
time said edward yingling chief lobbyist for the american 
bankers association the industrys largest trade group 
aides to dingell who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
wright has not yet decided on a deadline for the energy and 
commerce committee but they indicated that dingell is not inclined 
to act quickly 
the banking committee after a session that began 10 am 
wednesday and ended 230 am thursday with only short breaks 
approved the measure with all but three democrats in favor and all 
but three republicans opposed 
the hodgepodge of compromises struck to get it through has 
created some odd political coalitions the banking industry and the 
securities industry normally bitter opponents are both opposing 
it for different reasons consumer groups are supporting it along 
with the real estate and insurance industries 
but the alignment could change with banks on one side and all 
of the other groups on the other if dingell as expected 
tightens the restrictions on how banks are permitted to exercise 
the new securities activities 
the likelihood of the bill being improved by the energy and 
commerce committee is very small yingling said 
rep edward j markey dmass whose energy and commerce 
subcommittee on finance gets first crack at the securities 
provisions said thursday his panel needed to make major 
changes in the bill 
there simply are not adequate safeguards for the banking 
system he said 
the bill would if enacted represent the first crack in the 
barrier between investment and commercial banking that was erected 
as part of the reforms stemming from the 1929 stock market crash 
it allows bank holding companies to underwrite virtually every type 
of security except corporate stock 
the securities industry had unsuccessfully sought to keep 
underwriting of corporate bonds mutual funds and corporate debt 
convertible to stock away from banks 
but the house bill includes those powers as well as the 
underwriting of commercial paper municipal revenue bonds and 
securities backed by mortgages and other consumer debt such as auto 
loans 
other sections require banks 
to serve poor people by providing lowcost lifeline 
checking services for accounts between 25 and 1000 
to offer special accounts for the cashing of government checks 
such as social security and welfare checks with a cashing charge 
of no more than 2 
to have a good record of serving poor communities in their 
lending area before getting permission from the federal reserve 
board to exercise new powers 
to cease further expansion into the real estate business for 
two years 
to stay out of insurance underwriting and to limit the number 
of additional institutions that can sell insurance underwritten by 
other companies 
the chairman of the banking committee rep fernand j st 
germain dri in a statement thursday hailed the bill as a 
major step forward in providing a sane restructuring of the 
financial industry and establishing a solid framework of 
protections for consumers 
republican opposition to the consumer sections had threatened 
committee passage of the bill until an hourlong negotiating 
session behind closed doors after midnight 
democrats agreed to accept some watering down of the consumer 
provisions and in exchange three republicans steve bartlett of 
texas john hiler of indiana and thomas ridge of pennsylvania 
voted in favor of the bill 
rep chalmers wylie of ohio the ranking republican on the 
committee had argued that the consumer provisions would in 
effect give the federal government the power to allocate credit 
also because of their expense they could impair the soundness of 
the banking system he said

inaccurate stories about her had also been carried by the media in 
general

can write in a magazine that i you know dont have my rib cage

abe fortas was tricked into taking a 
seat on the us supreme court and later was bluffed into becoming 
the first justice ever to resign in disgrace the author of a new 
book said thursday 
using records president lyndon johnson once ordered destroyed 
author bruce allen murphy also details fortas extensive role as an 
adviser in the presidents inner circle unprecedented for a 
sitting justice 
the book is like a murder mystery who killed abe fortas 
career said murphy whose research took him to libraries in 
boston philadelphia new york washington and new haven conn his 
book fortas the rise and ruin of a supreme court justice 
will be released friday 
johnson repeatedly asked fortas to accept the nomination for a 
seat on the supreme court but the prominent washington attorney 
each time turned down the offer 
lbj got fortas to accept the job in 1965 by saying the president 
needed his friends help drafting a statement to the press on a 
troop increase in vietnam 
while they rode the white house elevator to the east room to 
meet the press johnson told fortas that in a few minutes he would 
be announced as the nominee to the supreme court 
four years after he joined the supreme court fortas resigned 
for accepting a 20000ayear salary to work for a foundation set 
up by millionaire industrialist louis wolfson while he was a member 
of the court supreme court justices made 39500 at the time 
attorney general john mitchells justice department bluffed 
fortas into leaving the court by intimating it had more damaging 
evidence than the money from wolfson which had been returned 
murphy said 
murphy discovered photocopies of justice department documents in 
the papers of the late chief justice earl warren 
fortas who died in 1982 represents the turning point in the 
united state supreme court history in the 20th century said 
murphy 
without fortas liberal arthur goldberg would have remained on 
the bench and might have succeeded warren as chief justice during 
the johnson administration said murphy 36 a professor of 
political science at penn state university 
instead johnson persuaded goldberg to leave the court to become 
ambassador to the united nations to make room for fortas 
the senate rejected fortas nomination as chief justice and his 
1969 resignation allowed richard nixon to appoint two members of 
the court and making the court more conservative murphy said 
johnson ordered all his files on fortas destroyed during the 
tough senate confirmation hearings for fortas as chief justice 
murphy said 
aides disobeyed the order and sent the papers locked in a safe 
to the lyndon b johnson library in austin texas where murphy 
who spent six years researching his book found them 
fortas destroyed all his own personal and professional records 
even typed copies of speeched he delivered 
in the file at the johnson library murphy found records of 
white house meetings fortas attended on proposed legislation 
johnsons speeches and the vietnam war 
murphy who had only one interview with fortas before he died 
said fortas soft melodious voice sharp analytical mind and 
ability to convert complex legal issues into understandable terms 
caused his rise from poverty in memphis tenn to washingtons 
inner circles 
murphy also explored extrajudicial activities in the 
brandeisfrankfurter connection the secret political activities of 
two supreme court justices which was published in 1982

he would accept it if asked nesbit said 
sen pete v domenici rnm also confirmed on thursday that 
he had been approached by the vice president saying he was proud 
and honored to be on the list i know it will be a difficult 
decision for the vice president to make he said in a statement 
bush who says he will not make his final choice until the 
republican national convention next month has now all but 
completed calls to prospective candidates on his socalled long 
list said an aide who spoke only on the condition of anonymity 
hes only talking to people hes considering said the aide 
i would suspect that process is complete the aide said 
that doesnt preclude some new calls tomorrow or the next day 
the process is fluid and hes controlling it 
campaign sources said the vice president had earlier placed 
similar calls to or contacted personally his strongest 
primarycampaign rival sen bob dole rkans doles wife former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole and sens domenici alan 
simpson rwyo william l armstrong rcolo john danforth 
rmo and nancy l kassebaum rkans

one on the list bob dole wasnt acknowledging his call at 
least publicly he joked that he and his wife had been waiting 
for the phone to ring at home i cant get elizabeth to leave the 
house 
speaking at a fundraising breakfast the senate minority leader 
joked that he hoped bushs choice of a running mate would be 
narrowed to just him and his wife and i drop out 
however bush himself told reporters last week that bob dole 
would be on any list of potential running mates 
calls from the vice president were an early stage of the 
selection process bush had said he hoped to have a tentative list 
completed by weeks end 
washington attorney robert m kimmitt is overseeing the 
screening process including the distribution of questionnaires 
seeking financial and personal background information from 
prospective candidates 
the vice president told reporters outside his white house office 
on thursday that speculation over his running mate was inevitable 
you cant avoid speculation bush said 
the process is going along in an orderly fashion hopefully 
it wont be demeaning to anyone he said 
bush who had no public events scheduled on thursday was to 
visit a childcare center friday morning in a northern virginia 
suburb of washington 
he wanted to follow up on his childcare initiative said 
bush spokeswoman sheila tate 
bush on sunday proposed a 1000 tax credit for child care 
primarily aimed at lowincome working mothers 
meanwhile bush campaign manager lee atwater said that recent 
polls showing bush trailing michael dukakis by as much as 18 points 
coming out of the democratic national convention had been expected 
i figured it could go up to 20 points atwater said in an 
interview polls right after a convention dont mean anything 
as walter mondale said in l984 wheres the beef atwater 
said referring to the 1984 democratic presidential candidates use 
of a fastfood advertising slogan to refer to thenrival gary 
harts democratic primary theme of new ideas 
theres no substance whatsoever in dukakis campaign 
atwater said were going to point out over and over again that 
george bushs campaign is one of issues and substance

a us official made the first disclosure of the 
location of american production facilities for chemical weapons in 
an attempt thursday to speed talks aimed at banning the manufacture 
and use of such weapons 
in washington an army spokesman said chemical weapons were 
being produced or stored at only two of the five sites named by max 
friedersdorf chief us delegate to the 40nation conference on 
disarmament 
friedersdorf told the conference his announcement was an 
unprecedented step toward greater openness 
the united states previously declared the location of its 
stockpiles and the types of chemicals contained in them but not 
the amount or the location of the production facilities the soviet 
union has declared the amount of its stockpiles but not their 
location nor the location of production sites 
friedersdorf said his delegation hoped the declaration would 
contribute both to greater confidence and to the negotiation of 
related provisions of a convention banning the production 
stockpiling and use of chemical weapons 
the geneva conference has been negotiating such a convention for 
20 years this years summer session began july 7 
the declaration we are making today is unprecedented 
friedersdorf said adding that no other conference member had 
provided information on chemical weapons production facilities 
we urge other countries that possess chemical weapons 
production facilities to declare the locations of their facilities 
and to outline how the facilities would be destroyed he said 
the united states and soviet union are the only two members of 
the conference who have acknowledged possessing chemical weapons 
many conference members have declared that they do not possess 
chemical weapons but friedersdorf indicated in his speech that the 
united states does not believe some of them he declined to say 
which countries 
washington has said previously it believes about 15 nations 
possess such weapons but it consistently declines to identify them 
in december the soviet union said its chemical weapon stocks 
total 50000 tons but western experts have estimated the total is 
much higher the soviet union also said it had no stocks outside 
its borders a contention that also has been challenged by the 
united states 
the production facilities declared by the united states are 
rocky mountain arsenal in colorado the pine bluff arsenal in 
arkansas which produces the new binary chemical weapons muscle 
shoals in alabama newport army ammunition depot in indiana and 
aberdeen proving ground in maryland 
at the pentagon lt col john chapla said chemical weapons 
currently are produced or stored only at pine bluff and muscle 
shoals 
these are locations which are at present or were at one time 
involved in the production of chemical weapons chapla said of 
friedersdorfs list at rocky mountain and newport there is no 
chemical weapon production testing or storage going on 
chapla said aberdeen is used to test some components of the 
current generation of chemical weapons but is not used to produce 
store or test the binary or dual chemical weapons the military 
now uses 
our focus now is the production of binary chemical 
principally at pine bluff he said 
some work is also done at muscle shoals on one of the chemicals 
used in binary weapons but the weapon is not deadly until the two 
chemicals are combined chapla said 
the binary program is such that you never have a complete 
weapon stored in any one place he said the two chemicals are 
never kept together and they will not be mated until just before 
firing 
at the geneva conference the united states also submitted to 
the conference ideas for methods to destroy chemical weapons under 
an eventual ban 
delegates have drafted many parts of a chemical weapons ban the 
main unresolved issue is how to guard against cheating 
other problems include ensuring that the maximum number of 
countries joins the ban maintaining a military balance while 
stocks are gradually destroyed and precisely defining chemical 
weapons 
friedersdorf said in his speech that an agreed definition of 
chemical weapons is within reach and the conference has made 
significant progress toward resolving some issues in the past 
months he did not elaborate

democratic vice presidential candidate 
lloyd bentsen told a union audience thursday that the only time the 
reagan administration cares about american workers is when they 
want to put 2 million of them on polygraph machines 
later thursday in a speech in reno nev bentsen criticized 
reagan administration drugfighting efforts he also planned to 
visit los angeles and amarillo texas on his first solo campaign 
trip since being nominated last week in atlanta 
the united food and commercial workers convention gave a noisy 
welcome to bentsen in san francisco many of the 3500 members in 
the audience were wearing i like mike tshirts and waving 
unionprepared signs for presidential nominee michael dukakis and 
bentsen 
earlier this year the union was credited by lawmakers with 
helping with compromise language in legislation that barred most 
polygraph tests of job applicants by private businesses 
administration officials had opposed the separate versions passed 
by the house and senate but president reagan signed the compromise 
final version last spring 
the congressional office of technology assessment has estimated 
that about 2 million polygraph tests are given each year most of 
them by private businesses 
four years ago reagan received nearly half the votes of the 
traditionally democratic members of the union said spokesman al 
zack but he released a poll taken prior to last weeks 
democratic national convention showing the 11 millionmember 
union was 2to1 in favor of the democrats this year 
those union members who were hoodwinked by ronald reagan are 
coming home in droves said ufcw president william h wynn 
the convention was to hear from dukakis later by satellite 
television hookup after that wynn scheduled action on a 
resolution putting his union on record in favor of the ticket and 
requesting the parent aflcio to make a formal endorsement 
bentsen made the most of his senate record before the crowd 
citing this years fights with the reagan administration over the 
trade bill and the sixtydays notice for plant closings 
the texas senator said administration officials have dragged 
their feet for eight years when action was needed to help 
american industry compete their indifference has cost america 
more than a million manufacturing jobs and caused trade deficits 
that will cripple growth bentsen said 
sure the reaganbush administration occasionally pays 
attention to working men and women in america like when they want 
to put 2 million of them on polygraph machines he said 
he said the reaganbush record for women and minorities amounted 
to a speed bump on the path to equality in america 
later in reno bentsen blasted the reagan administration for 
chaos that exists in drug control 
he told the national conference of state legislators that our 
war against drugs lacks a commander he said a bentsendukakis 
administration would appoint a single drug czar to oversee the 
battle 
bentsen said dukakis experience in state government gave him an 
affinity with local officials and he said the democratic white 
house would recognize the costs to state government when the 
federal government cuts back on its programs

investigators have blamed the 
fatal 1985 frankfurt bombing on abu nidals terrorist group and 
found a possible libyan connection a newspaper reported thursday 
the frankfurter neue presse said a special commission of law 
enforcement officials had identified the attackers and authorities 
were seeking arrest warrants for abu nidal and three alleged 
accomplices 
hansjuergen foerster spokesman for the chief federal 
prosecutors office in karlsruhe told the associated press the 
commission had firmed up suspicions against abu nidal and his 
supporters but denied warrants were being sought 
for more than three years west german investigators have tried 
to pin down who planted the bomb that exploded in crowded passenger 
terminal at frankfurt airport on june 19 1985 killing three 
people and wounding 42 they had expressed suspicion of the 
palestinian terrorist group before 
foersters office is represented on the commission and acts as 
its spokesman but also is conducting its own inquiry 
hesse state officials established the commission a few months 
after the bombing 
abu nidal is a former jerusalem school teacher and his real name 
is sabry albanna he is based in libya and syria 
israeli arab and western intelligence agencies have accused him 
of directing scores of terrorist attacks since he broke in 1976 
with fatah the mainstream guerrilla faction led by palestine 
liberation organization chief yasser arafat abu nidal has been 
blamed for coordinated assaults at rome and vienna airports dec 
27 1985 in which 20 people were killed 
his group also was linked by greek authorities to the terrorist 
attack july 11 on the city of poros cruise ship in which nine 
people were killed and 98 wounded 
according to the newspaper the west german panel also decided 
agents of col moammar gadhafi the libyan leader may have played 
a role in the attack 
the investigations have shown that the libyan peoples bureau 
in bonn as the embassy is called had knowledge of the attack 
it said whether it was involved in the preparation and execution 
still cannot be proven 
foerster did not say when kurt rebmann the chief federal 
prosecutor might be ready to file criminal charges

authorities have equipped britains intelligence 
listening post with a system that works like a computer detective 
to ferret out software sabotage the domestic news agency reported 
press association said the new equipment will help avert 
sabotage by computer amateurs known as hackers and by enemies who 
use computer viruses alien coding that insinuates itself into 
a system 
the detecting system was installed at the government 
communications headquarters in cheltenham about 110 miles 
northwest of london the agency reported the listening facility 
sifts through radio and other airborne messages seeking military 
and other secret communications

damaging software within our systems rupert soames managing 
director of gpt data systems was quoted as saying his company 
developed the system

to corrupt data it can infect other computers through networks or 
exchanged software or can lie dormant until a predetermined 
command activates it 
one of the main concerns with the strategic defense initiative 
in the united states is its vulnerability to viruses and logic 
bombs which would only trigger under war conditions soames was

a federal drug agent testified thursday he was 
told that a white house aide leaked details of one of the 
governments most sensitive cocaine investigations thus ending it 
prematurely in order to expose drug smuggling by the nicaraguan 
government 
ernst jacobsen an undercover agent of the drug enforcement 
administration said that following the leak in july 1984 i 
heard from my superiors the leak came from an aide in the white 
house 
while jacobsen did not name the official the house judiciary 
subcommittee on crime released pages from oliver l norths diary 
showing the former national security council aide made frequent 
references to the operation in the weeks before the leak 
and the diary shows he was aware of photographs from the 
investigation showing cocaine being loaded at a nicaraguan 
airstrip a purported nicaraguan government official who aided the 
smuggling operation was in the pictures 
jacobsen testifying from behind a screen to hide his identity 
also said that shortly before the leak a cia agent in miami told 
him the spy agency planned to leak the material to the news media 
to show sandinista involvement in smuggling 
the hearing was the first in a series by the crime subcommittee 
into whether reagan administration officials condoned drug 
smuggling and other criminal activities to further its central 
american policy especially winning aid for the contra rebels 
the panel is particularly interested in whether administration 
officials obstructed law enforcement operations as may have 
occurred in the 1984 nvestigation 
panel chairman william j hughes dnj said a vote on aid to 
the reagan administrationbacked contra rebels in nicaragua was 
moving through congress when the story was leaked on sandinista 
drug smuggling 
jacobsen said the leak ended one of the most significant 
cocaine investigations in dea history which he said could have 
led to the arrest of the entire leadership of colombias cocaine 
cartel the cartel was operating inside nicaragua at the time 
jacobsen said 
jacobsen testified that convicted drug pilot barry seal was 
working for the dea in the sting operation and had made contact 
with the cartel and federico vaughn whom jacobsen described as a 
nicaraguan interior ministry employee 
however the subcommittee also released information that cast 
doubt on vaughns connection with the nicaraguan government 
hughes said the subcommittee staff recently called vaughns 
number in managua nicaragua and spoke to a domestic employee 
who said the house belonged to a us embassy employee the 
employee who was not named was among a group of us officials 
expelled recently by nicaraguas leftist government hughes said 
hughes said his investigators were told the house has been 
continuously rented by the united states since 1981 he later 
told reporters that vaughns name never surfaced before the drup 
operation and no one knew about him afterwards 
jacobsen said to our knowledge federico vaughn had no 
association with the us embassy or anything related to the us 
government 
norths diary however had several references to freddy 
vaughn including a july 6 entry that said freddy coming in 
late july 
in the undercover operation seal had flown to a nicaragua 
airstrip in a plane that had cameras installed by the cia jacobsen 
said the agent said the pictures had been developed at cia 
headquarters near washington and then taken to the white house 
the cia wanted to release them to the press to show the 
sandinistas were dealing in cocaine jacobsen said 
the agent said dea officials initially persuaded the cia to 
change its mind but shortly afterwards the story on the operation 
appeared in the washington times 
he said that story caused the dea to frantically make all the 
arrests possible at that point but the operation was over 
a second dea official who testified after jacobsen said he met 
with north about the operation before the news story was leaked 
and the former nsc aide asked when the operation could go 
public 
ron caffrey who was in charge of the dea cocaine desk at the 
time said north did indicate to me there was a vote coming up on 
an appropriation bill to aid the contras i told him public 
disclosure would come from the us attorney or the attorney 
general but we had a lot of goals left in the investigation 
caffrey added that north came up with a plan to use the 
investigation to aide the contras 
the agent said he told north that the chief dea operative in the 
sting planned to fly 15 million into nicaragua to pay for drugs 
already brought back from that country 
colonel north asked why we couldnt land the plane outside 
managua and turn the money over to the contras caffrey said 
adding he told north that plan would jeopardize the operation 
frank monastero former assistant administrator of the dea told 
the subcommittee that the day the news story appeared an irate 
north called him to deny that he was responsible for the leak 
monastero said that north accused the dea of telling a reporter 
that north was the source of the information 
he called to say he did not leak the information and the proof 
was the facts in the story were not accurate monastero said 
my response was thats the standard way to cover your tracks 
i didnt accept that 
monastero said at another point i thought the leak came from 
the white house because of the contra vote that was coming up

the home that has belonged to nelson 
mandela and his family since the 1940s was gutted in an arson 
attack thursday that apparently involved a teengang dispute and 
was not aimed at mandela himself 
police said no one was hurt and no arrests were made 
capt ruben bloomberg said in pretoria that 30 to 50 black high 
school students stoned the home of the imprisoned leader of the 
african national congress doused it with gasoline and set it afire 
neighbors and black journalists said some attackers wore jackets 
of daliwonga high school in soweto and were involved in a dispute 
wednesday with the young black comrades who guard the home 
mandelas wife winnie a prominent antiapartheid activist was 
bound for a news conference concerning detainees when she learned 
of the fire which broke out about noon 6 am edt her daughter 
zindzi 27 and her two grandchildren who also live at the 
fourroom home were away at the time 
but neighbors and journalists said some of the comrades who 
often travel with mrs mandela and guard her home were at the house 
when the fire began 
state of emergency regulations restrict reporting about unrest 
security force action treatment of detainees some forms of 
protest and a range of statements classified as subversive 
the rev frank chikane general secretary of the south african 
council of churches said leaders in soweto and other black 
townships had been asked to call upon the community not to act 
emotionally so they do not create a situation where there is a 
spiral of violence 
he said an attempt would be made to talk to the principal and 
the students of the school involved to ease the situation he said 
young men who congregate around the mandela home were told not to 
act without thinking or with revenge 
although the dispute is local he said when it is mandelas 
house that is attacked that makes it a national issue anybody who 
attacks a wellknown leaders house like that one would know they 
would anger the people in the community and cause them to take 
action 
mrs mandela arrived by car about an hour later and viewed the 
blackened windows and burned furniture in the yard from inside the 
car she then was driven to her nearby offices where she conducts 
social welfare projects 
the comrades some wearing jackets of the mandela united 
soccer club sponsored by the family pushed journalists away from 
the office one threatened to burn a photographers car 
later attorney amrichand soma told reporters mandela was 
reached at pollsmoor prison in cape town where he is serving a 
life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the 
whitedominated government and said no statement should be made 
however aubrey mokoena a family friend and head of the release 
mandela campaign said the community must put an end to 
this anyone who would think of attacking mandelas house 
represents the forces of darkness 
journalists were allowed to enter the stillsmoking home in the 
orlando section of soweto while black police with shotguns kept a 
crowd of 300 neighbors away a sodden carpet of hot black ash 
covered everything 
flames flickered in a side room the house was filled with steam 
from the heat and the water firemen pushed clothes out a bedroom 
window pulled a smoldering mattress outside shoved smoking 
cabinets and chairs onto the lawn 
all the contents including framed wedding pictures and the 
family piano were destroyed 
mrs mandela has lived in the house periodically since she 
married mandela in 1958 last year she built a mansion on a hill 
overlooking this huge black township outside of johannesburg a few 
blocks from the burned home but mokoena said the new house is not 
habitable and she would spend the night with friends 
mandela moved into the house with his first wife evelyn in the 
1940s and raised his two sons and his oldest daughter there evelyn 
mandela lives in the xhosa tribal homeland of transkei

a federal appeals court late thursday ordered 
the federal election commission to respond to a request that the 
presidential campaign of michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen be 
barred from spending federal campaign funds until a dispute over 
the financing is resolved 
the court order said the fec must respond by monday to a motion 
to block the spending of the money and the court invited lawyers 
for the dukakisbentsen campaign to respond as well 
the national republican senatorial committee and bentsens gop 
opponent for the texas senate seat rep beau boulter are seeking 
to block the federal campaign money they charge that by running 
simultaneously for the senate and for vice president as texas law 
allows bentsen gains an unfair financial advantage over 
republicans 
the fec rejected that argument on tuesday when it released 46 
million in federal campaign money for the democratic ticket 
republicans appealed the fec decision to the us court of 
appeals for the district of columbia and a threejudge panel 
decided late thursday to solicit arguments in the case the appeal 
contended that the fec action was arbitrary and contrary to federal 
campaign financing law and asked that the democrats be barred from 
spending any of the 46 million until the matter is resolved 
the court has found this a serious enough issue to require its 
review said ben ginsberg legal counsel for the gop senate 
campaign committee they are asking the fec to say why it acted 
properly 
the threejudge panel was made up of chief judge spottswood w 
robinson iii judge laurence silberman and judge douglas ginsburg 
republicans say bentsen has some 4 million in private funds set 
aside for his senate campaign which he can spend in texas but which 
will also benefit the partys presidential ticket in effect 
violating the 46 million spending ceiling for presidential 
campaigns and the use of private money for the general election

democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
turned up the heat on the reagan administration and attorney 
general edwin meese on thursday saying if the democratic ticket is 
elected the ethics office will be in the oval office not some 
place down the hall 
dukakis also began wooing local supporters of former rival jesse 
jackson as he campaigned across the industrial northeast and 
midwest holding meetings with former jackson delegates and local 
elected officials who backed jackson in the democratic primaries 
the massachusetts governor hammered at meese and the reagan 
administration in a speech at an outdoor shopping mall in secaucus 
nj in the meadowlands area and kept up the attack at a rally 
before 2000 people in downtown cleveland 
i want to tell you that in 1989 were going to have a 
president and vice president who wont sit by and do nothing when 
theyre told by highranking officials in the justice department 
that the attorney general of the united states has been violating 
the law dukakis said 
his remarks included a dig at vice president george bushs 
proposal this week to create a white house ethics office 
he was referring to two former top justice department officials 
former assistant attorney general william weld and former deputy 
attorney general arthur burns who told congress earlier this week 
that they had voiced concerns about meeses actions before 
resigning 
i hope i never have to listen to that kind of briefing 
dukakis said but if i do i can tell you i wont sit there and do 
nothing well take action 
dukakis departed from the text of his prepared speech devoted 
to calling for investment in jobs and economic opportunity to 
comment on meese and the broader subject of impropriety by some 
serving in the reagan administration he repeated lines from his 
nomination acceptance speech delivered at the democratic national 
convention last week when he said in his administration those who 
violate the public trust will be fired and if you violate the law 
youll be prosecuted 
in cleveland dukakis praised but was not accompanied by the 
states two democratic senators john glenn whom he passed over in 
selecting lloyd bentsen as his running mate and howard metzenbaum 
who faces a tough reelection fight this year in an interview with 
a local television station dukakis said he picked bentsen after 
deciding the texas senator had the right stuff a phrase that 
recalled the title of the book and movie that depicted glenns life 
as astronaut 
dukakis met privately with jackson supporters in newark nj 
and in cleveland and spokesman dayton duncan said he would meet 
with jackson supporters friday in michigan the state where 
jackson stunned dukakis with a twoone victory in the march 
caucuses 
newark mayor sharpe james who had been a jackson delegate said 
some in the group had been disappointed by dukakis selection of 
texas sen lloyd bentsen as his running mate but that all seemed 
pleased by their 20minute discussion with the nominee 
now were ready to support michael dukakis he won james 
said pointing to the new dukakis 88 button he had just put on his 
lapel 
i have now replaced my jesse jackson button he said in an 
interview the alternative is to support george bush or to do 
nothing and allow bush to win 
donald payne a member of the newark city council and democratic 
nominee for congress said dukakis showed a very good grasp of 
urban issues but made no commitment for more federal spending 
fletcher wiley a dukakis senior adviser who sat in on the 
meeting said one purpose of dukakis campaign trip was to meet 
with jackson supporters in cities where he is stopping 
dukakis also stopped at a daycare center where he was 
photographed talking with small children 
in his speech dukakis spoke about his call for a new era of 
greatness made in his acceptance speech it begins with the 
recognition that a strong economic future needs three fundamental 
things investment innovation and teamwork he said 
he called for more investment in research including by business 
leaders to keep up with research and training by japan and other 
countries 
i want to restore some balance to our federal research and 
development programs and wed better not forget that our military 
strength cannot be sustained without economic strength a lesson 
the soviet union has finally learned and we must too he said 
as dukakis spoke about a dozen antiabortion protesters stood a 
short distance away and chanted civil rights for unborn babies 
the nominee walked close by them as he left

the government ordered a 
temporary suspension thursday of rules that would require some 
journalists to register or face penalties including jail 
the regulations were to take effect sunday media groups in 
south africa and abroad accused the south african government of 
attempting to make further inroads on press freedom 
stoffel botha home affairs minister said registration of 
journalists remains a matter of grave concern for the 
government but the regulations were suspended temporarily 
because of practical considerations 
he said they would be reviewed but did not indicate when a 
decision would be made the broadly worded rules now say anyone 
carrying out newsagency business must register or face a 
10year prison term or a 8500 fine 
south africas largest news agency the south african press 
association and such major international agencies as the 
associated press are exempt 
local journalists who work parttime for some of the worlds 
large news organizations would be required to register if as many 
do they had more than one employer 
lawyers say the definition of a news agency is so broad that 
major newspapers that exchange stories church and political groups 
that publish newsletters and businesses that issue regular press 
statements on their operations could be included if the government 
wished 
under the regulations botha could remove journalists from the 
registration list and prevent them from working if he objected to 
their reporting he already has broad censorship powers that allow 
him to close publications and expel foreign journalists 
the latest regulations appear aimed at small local news 
agencies but most news organizations operating in south africa 
would be affected because they get reports from those agencies 
botha has said local agencies endanger public safety by 
reporting unfavorably on police activities forced removals of poor 
blacks and labor disputes in rural areas that other news 
organizations do not cover regularly 
the foreign correspondents association of south africa has said 
even journalists not required to register would be compromised 
because they would be seen as having favored status with the 
government 
stateofemergency regulations already in force restrict 
reporting about unrest security force actions treatment of 
detainees some forms of protest and a broad range of statement the 
government considers subversive

aides to republican george bush and democrat 
michael dukakis traded barbs thursday over an assertion by bush 
campaign manager lee atwater that dukakis had commuted the 
sentences of 58 violent criminals while governor of massachusetts 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich immediately denied the 
claim saying poor lee after his candidate failed in his 
attempt to promote a positive message on either ethics or day care 
lee is returning to the welltraveled low road preferred by 
political muggers 
in a statement atwater said that among the 58 criminals whose 
sentences he claimed dukakis had commuted were 28 firstdegree 
murderers and a convicted heroin dealer 
dukakis also commuted the sentences of 25 convicted 
seconddegree murderers some of whom had served sentences of as 
little as two to five years atwater said 
it appears that mike dukakis just cant stand the thought of 
violent criminals spending time behind bars atwater said 
countered ms estrich in a statement of her own lee should 
stop distorting the facts under michael dukakis leadership the 
massachusetts crime rate dropped l3 percent in five years while 
crime nationally jumped 4 percent 
the homicide rate in massachusetts is half the national 
average and the lowest of any industrial state she said 
leslie dach campaign communications director for the democratic 
nominee said that for the record dukakis has commuted 10 
sentences in six years 
balderdash said bush spokesman mark goodin when told of the 
response by the dukakis aides he said the figures the likely 
republican nominee used were taken from massachusetts state records 
the only reason crime has gone down in massachusetts is that 
dukakis has let all the criminals out of jail and theyve gone to 
other states goodin said 
bush has repeatedly criticized a massachusetts prison furlough 
program that allowed passes for firstdegree murderers the program 
was later amended but not until after one of the prisoners escaped 
from a furlough and raped a maryland woman

outpourings 
ms lin said the planned civil rights monument will bear the

will be inscribed with time lines and the names of people killed 
during the civil rights movement from 1955 to 1968 water emerging

george bush said thursday his search for a republican running 
mate is proceeding in an orderly fashion but offered no clues 
about the outcome democrat michael dukakis renewed his attack on 
the vice presidents handling of attorney general edwin meeses 
legal difficulties 
the process is going along in an orderly fashion bush told 
reporters hopefully it wont be demeaning to anyone 
sources said that senate republican leader bob dole had been 
notified by bush that he was under consideration among about a 
dozen prospects sen dan quayle of indiana also is under 
consideration at least in a preliminary way said one source 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
three republicans are known to have received bush campaign 
requests for background information including rep jack kemp of 
new york who has figured prominently in speculation and sen pete 
domenici of new mexico and new hampshire gov john sununu who have 
not 
dukakis embarked on a hectic campaign swing through seven 
eastern and midwestern states combining fresh criticism for bush 
with a renewed effort to reach out to jesse jacksons 
primarycampaign supporters 
he said that if the democrats win the white house this fall 
the ethics office will be in the oval office not some place down 
the hall that was a jab at bush who said in a speech earlier in 
the week that he would appoint a special counselor on ethics to 
work in the white house and other agencies of the federal 
government 
dukakis also said that beginning next year were going to 
have a president and vice president who wont sit by and do nothing 
when theyre told by highranking officials in the justice 
department that the attorney general of the united states has been 
violating the law 
the massachusetts governors comment was a reference to 
congressional testimony earlier this week by two former top justice 
department aides who said they had told president reagan and bush 
last spring that they had concerns about meeses legal difficulties 
dukakis also met privately in new jersey with about two dozen 
local officials most of them black who backed jacksons drive for 
the democratic presidential nomination newark mayor sharpe james 
said the group was ready to support michael dukakis the 
alternative is to support george bush or to do nothing and allow 
bush to win 
dukakis postconvention high in the polls continued thursday 
as a harris poll gave him an 18point lead over bush but pollster 
louis harris said such a wide margin was likely to be very 
temporary 
harris survey of 1268 likely voters found 57 percent support 
for dukakis to 39 percent for bush it was the fourth national poll 
since the democratic convention last week to find a dukakis lead of 
that magnitude 
the new harris poll was done july 2225 and had a margin of 
error of plus or minus three percentage points 
topic no 1 in republican circles was bushs search for a 
running mate and the campaign signals were anything but clear 
one senior adviser speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
vice president had personally telephoned about a dozen prospective 
running mates to notify them they are being considered 
aside from dole and kemp the names that have surfaced most 
consistently in speculation include california gov george 
deukmejian illinois gov jim thompson and sens nancy kassebaum of 
kansas and alan simpson of wyoming doles wife former 
transportation secretary elizabeth dole also has been mentioned as 
a possible contender 
dole joked during the day that he and his wife have been 
waiting for the phone to ring at home i cant get elizabeth to 
leave the house 
the republican guessing game flourished while democratic vice 
presidential candidate bentsen told the united food and commercial 
workers convention in san francisco that the reaganbush record for 
women and minorities is a speed bump on the path to equality in 
america 
meanwhile jackson said he has asked the united nations 
secretarygeneral to ask iranian officials for assistance in 
freeing us hostages held by iranian sympathizers in lebanon 
but jackson said no meeting has been set and no meeting has 
been sought for him to negotiate personally with iranian 
officials 
weve simply talked through secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar who did meet with the iranian foreign minister he 
said in a telephone interview with the associated press 
bush in an interview published in usa today called jackson a 
loose cannon and said he should stay out of the hostage affair 
dukakis said he was unfamiliar with the facts about jacksons 
effort but as a general matter private citizens should not try 
to conduct foreign policy 
in washington the dispute over 46 million in federal campaign 
money for dukakis entered a new phase as a federal appeals court 
ordered the federal elections commission to respond to a request 
that the funds be held up 
the national republican senatorial committee and bentsens gop 
opponent for his texas senate seat rep beau boulter are seeking 
to block the money they charge that by running simultaneously for 
the senate and for vice president as texas law allows bentsen 
gains an unfair financial advantage over republicans 
the fec rejected that argument on tuesday when it released 46 
million in federal campaign money for the democratic ticket

a news leak on a covert plan to undermine 
panamanian military ruler manuel antonio noriega came from the 
reagan administration and was a setup deal to make it look 
like the disclosure came from congress leaders of the senate 
intelligence committee said thursday 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the panel and the 
committees ranking republican sen william cohen of maine said 
they believed the leak was a heavyhanded attempt to derail a 
bill that would tighten congressional oversight of covert 
operations and also to enhance vice president george bushs 
political prospects 
i think the matter was handled in such a way as to set up 
members of congress to make them appear the source of the leak 
said cohen i am offended by it 
i think the intelligence committee was used in this case 
added boren 
boren said the whole matter had been handled in highly unusual 
fashion including a much wider dissemination than is normal for 
information about presidential covert action authorizations which 
are known as findings 
i have a feeling its much broader more people than normal 
knew boren said possibly including members of congress outside 
the 15 senators and 17 house members who are on the intelligence 
panels 
if theyve briefed other people we cant be responsible for 
that said cohen 
boren said reporters already were calling the senate 
intelligence committee and waiting outside its secure hearing room 
on tuesday even before the cia briefing began cohen said he 
expressed suspicions about the possibility of a leak before any 
information was given in the briefing 
in panama foreign minister jorge ritter on thursday called 
reports of the covert action plan intolerable and terrorist 
and said the panamanian government would take a complaint to the 
united nations security council 
it is intolerable and irritating that in the highest spheres 
of power in the united states they talk of possible terrorist 
actions in panamanian territory the government news agency 
panapres quoted ritter as saying 
he added that the panamanian authorities are maintaining a 
state of alert to reject any type of terrorist action 
on wednesday the washington post and the los angeles times 
reported that reagan had signed a finding authorizing unspecified 
covert activities aimed at undermining noriegas rule the military 
ruler has clung to power for months despite previous us efforts 
to weaken the panamanian economy and us inability to budge him 
has become a political liability for the administration 
later reports said the covert action authorization included 
support for the countrys internal political opposition but 
stopped short of direct military or paramilitary action 
legislation is due to come to the house floor within the next 
two weeks which would require notification of the house and senate 
intelligence committees within 48 hours of any covert action plan 
signed by the president 
the measure prompted by last years irancontra investigation 
is designed to tighten current law which requires only that 
unspecified timely notice be given to congressional overseers 
the administration strongly opposes the bill calling it a 
strait jacket on the presidents ability to conduct intelligence 
operations and arguing that in cases of extremely sensitive covert 
acts the white house must be free to withhold notification from 
congress 
boren said he did not believe the administration action would 
have any significant impact on future us policy decisions and 
added that noriega would be unaffected by any threat from the 
united states 
noriega doesnt put much stock in words said boren i 
think its time we went back to teddy roosevelts admonition weve 
talked loudly and carried a small stick i dont think hurling 
more words at him is going to work

9200 students failed a new standardized test needed to pass to the 
next grade

their anger grew 
protesters said wednesday they would expand their action to 
pressure the greenville public schools board of trustees to fire 
superintendent nolan vickers and his assistant janet sweatt who 
also is white

needs of blacks who comprise more than 90 percent of the school 
systems students 
vickers and sweatt were in meetings thursday and unavailable for 
comment said assistant superintendent arthur peyton who is black 
when asked if he has any problems with the current school 
administration peyton replied no i dont because im 
instrumental in running it in the things that are coming out im 
as much responsible for it as anyone else 
school board president mary haynes who is black declined to 
comment on the boycott but said board members probably would 
discuss it at their aug 11 meeting 
parents and students marched wednesday in groups as small as 
four and as large as eight in front of department stores a 
shopping mall two fastfood restaurants and a car dealership 
were definitely making an impact said long who teaches 
biology in the school district our being out here is against the

prime minister margaret thatcher told the house of 
commons on thursday that she welcomed new york city mayor ed kochs 
change of heart on the subject of northern ireland 
koch completed a sixday tour of northern ireland and returned 
to new york where on wednesday he publicly disavowed his earlier 
opinions about the british stance on the troubled province koch 
said he accepted the british army as a peacekeeping force rather 
than an occupying army 
mrs thatcher told members of parliament in the elected lower 
chamber if more people came with an open mind and looked at what 
is happening on the ground we would have many others making 
similar remarks 
i admire mr kochs forthrightness and i am glad he took time 
to come to northern ireland she added 
in belfast koch was described as one of the few american 
politicians of stature who have had anything positive to say about 
britains role in northern ireland 
his comments after his factfinding visit to ireland are as 
refreshing as they are surprising the belfast telegraph northern 
irelands independent evening newspaper commented editorially on 
thursday 
compare his statement my impression is that the british are 
trying to play a constructive role with the attack launched by 
congressman joe kennedy after his visit earlier this year the 
newspaper said refering to the democratic us representative from 
massachusetts 
mr koch has shown an attitude uncommon in american 
politicians when dealing with the irish problem a willingness to 
view the situation with an open mind 
he is also honest enough to admit that his vision of ulster 
from across the atlantic did not square up with what he found here 
i do not believe that they the british deserve the castigation 
that many of us myself included have heaped upon them the 
belfast telegraph quoted koch as saying 
too many people in the international community mistake the 
myths and propaganda emanating from these shores for facts and 
believe a british withdrawal is the simplistic solution to all our 
ills mayor koch realizes the problems are much more complex than 
other greentinted visionaries understand the newspaper said 
of course the hardline irishamerican lobbyists will attempt 
to make political capital from his comments but those americans who 
are willing to listen will learn much more about the reality of 
life in ireland today from mayor koch 
they should as must the people of ulster learn that 
harboring grievances for past errors or wrongs will not further the 
quest for peace here the newspaper said there have been 
historical mistakes in ireland on all sides but acknowledgment 
should also be given as mayor koch does for the positive 
contributions made in areas like housing jobs and electoral 
representation we can build on gains not divisions

contras in their almost 7yearold war against nicaraguas leftist

refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a rio grande 
bridge crossing in laredo texas the convoy finally crossed the 
mexican border at nuevo laredo on july 14

states within 30 days or convoy members will face fines of up to 
50000 and 10 years in prison convoy members refused to sign 
forms promising they would return the trucks

gulf on thursday after a 3week investigation of the destruction 
of an iranian airliner by an american warship navy officials said 
the team led by rear adm william m fogarty arrived july 5 two 
days after missiles fired by the cruiser uss vincennes hit an iran 
air airbus flying over the strait of hormuz killing all 290 people 
aboard

airbus a300 for an iranian f14 jet fighter on an attack course 
fogartys team worked in secret and made no statements before 
leaving 
the us navy officials said the report would work its way up 
the chain of command to defense secretary frank carlucci because 
carlucci is in the soviet union until about aug 8 they said the 
report could not be released until midaugust

and two other us warships that were in the area the frigate uss 
elmer montgomery and missile frigate john h sides 
they also took sworn testimony from the commander of the 
vincennes capt will c rogers iii and other officers of the 
three warships 
an initial 15day deadline for the investigation was extended at 
fogartys request 
the navy officials would not give details of the investigations 
and said contact with iran for information would have to be through 
diplomatic channels the vincennes has been assigned to the arabian 
sea just outside the persian gulf and is expected to complete its

road a gritty grimy and thoroughly 
fascinating journey through industrial england puts most of the 
audience where the action is right in the middle of an unnamed 
lancashire town dying during margaret thatchers boom times 
this provocative play which opened thursday at offbroadways 
la mama annex lets theatergoers wander a dismal thoroughfare and 
mingle with the towns citizens the less adventurous can perch 
along a threesided balcony and observe the action but the 
distance would seem to dilute the drama 
to get the full effect of simon curtis masterful direction 
its better to be right down on the road a depressingly realistic 
environment designed by paul brown curtis does a remarkable job 
not only with the actors but with the audience which follows the 
flow of the play across the playing area with minimal instruction 
from the performers 
the setting reflects the deadend dreams of its inhabitants the 
hulk of an abandoned car sits on one corner of the playing area 
squat dilapidated homes line one side of the street other open 
spaces become the oppressive parlors and bedrooms of these people 
who have lost all hope 
playwright jim cartwright has written some bitter yet often very 
funny vignettes about their threadbare existence and stitched them 
together by creating a scruffy master of ceremonies named scullery 
the character is played with a roguish charm by jack wallace 
scullery introduces the residents of the road all of them in 
the process of going out for the evening going out for most of 
them means getting drunk 
several of the scenes are etched in despair audiences meet the 
middleaged jerry who in a poignant soliloquy laments the days 
long ago when people had jobs good times and felt safe 
i cant get away from the past he says but no matter 
what they say i cant see how that time could turn into this 
time 
the hopelessness of today is reiterated throughout the play and 
cartwright offers several variations on that desolation in another 
sketch a young man named joey is on a hunger strike they rush 
you from the cradle to the grave but now weve come to a 
standstill no job no hope he murmurs to his goodnatured 
girlfriend who joins him in the starvation pact 
theres also a defiance in the desperation particularly in the 
plays powerful last scene when two young men pick up two girls and 
bring them home for booze and sex the quartet is moved by otis 
reddings recording of try a little tenderness and as they 
become progressively drunker they chant fiercely somehow 
might escape you get the impression that if they dont 
something terrible is going to happen 
cartwrights play is overtly political and his message 
occasionally becomes heavyhanded there are references to thatcher 
and what kind of country england has become under conservative 
party rule but his characters are immensely human often 
humorous often repugnant and completely believable 
the plays seven actors portray a variety of characters and 
their versatility is a marvel kevin bacon gets the most difficult 
workout he must switch from the impassioned hunger striker to a 
drunkenly catatonic soldier as the strikers simpleminded 
girlfriend joan cusack projects a delicacy that shines through all 
the despair she radiates a sweetness that is captivating 
equally fine work comes from gerry bamman as the nostaglic 
jerry betsy aidem as an old hag trying to get dressed to go out 
for an evening of fun michael wincott an unnerving and menacing 
skinhead and jayne haynes as a sassy tart 
road is a joint production of lincoln center theater and la 
mama for lincoln center it is another feather in an already 
crowded cap of shows that includes anything goes sarafina 
and speedtheplow

war enemies iran and iraq traded 
recriminations during a oneday suspension of un peace talks 
thursday the talks at an impasse over iraqs insistence on direct 
talks and irans reluctance to agree 
however un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said the 
impasse did not mean peace talks were collapsing he said he was 
working on a formula for breaking the disagreement 
iraq demands a facetoface meeting before a truce and iran 
insists on a truce before it will consider a direct meeting at a 
later stage 
iran accused iraq thursday of stalling sabotaging un peace 
talks and blocking a truce in the 8yearold iraniraq war 
pressure was increasing on iraq in the 15member security 
council to drop its direct talks demand and other proposals that 
could prolong the fighting according to un diplomats speaking 
on condition of anonymity 
foreign ministers tariq aziz of iraq and ali akbar velayati of 
iran did not visit un headquarters thursday after perez de 
cuellar called a oneday suspension in his revolvingdoor diplomacy 
aimed at ending the war 
iranian ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati told reporters who 
asked about direct talks we will maintain our position we will 
not accept any preconditions for direct talks no step can be 
taken before a ceasefire 
accepting un ceasefire resolution 598 has been the last 
flexibility by the islamic republic of iran 
perez de cuellar said he hoped iranian officials are 
reflecting on the possibility of having direct talks at some 
stage but said he cannot compel the two sides to do so if iran 
is unwilling 
later thursday he assumed a more positive tone assuring 
reporters that talks were still under way 
i reject the idea of any collapse absolutely i reject it 
emphatically i have to keep waiting perez de cuellar said 
adding he believed at some stage direct talks are 
indispensable 
he acknowleded there was an impasse and when asked if he had a 
formula for breaking it said im working on that 
also thursday perez de cuellar announced he would meet friday 
with the wife of an american un official kidnapped in lebanon 
last feb 17 marine lt col william r higgins he said he would 
meet robin higgins higgins wife at un headquarters at her 
request 
the iraqi mission insisted that given the iranian duplicity 
and bad faith peace can only be achieved through direct 
facetoface negotiations under un auspices it said that 
iraqs goal was lasting peace and not just a ceasefire 
the deadlock over direct negotiations has complicated un 
efforts to end the persian gulf conflict 
fighting continued thursday with iran saying it crushed an 
iraqi force in two days of fighting around the western iranian city 
of eslamabad 60 miles from the iraqi border 
perez de cuellar suspended talks for a day to study his 
exchanges with the iraqi and iranian envoys since tuesday meetings 
were to resume friday 
mohammad javad zarif counselor at irans un mission told 
reporters direct talks would not promote peace at this time 
he commented one day after velayati accepted all of perez de 
cuellars proposals on implementing the resolutions peace plan 
iraq has not yet responded 
details of the proposals have not been disclosed 
on wednesday aziz said baghdad insists on direct talks with 
iran before a ceasefire and will not be stampeded into a truce 
without guarantees from iran 
the iraqi mission accused iran on thursday of a malicious 
campaign to sow confusion in diplomatic efforts to achieve peace by 
flooding the un and media with statements alleging that iraq is 
fighting inside iran 
the mission said iraqs recent military operations were carried 
out to liberate remnants of occupied iraqi territories it said 
troops only entered iranian territory to liberate iraqi land and 
added iraqi forces have long since withdrawn iraq has no 
territorial ambitions inside iran 
iraq accused iran of simply seeking a hasty truce without 
giving any commitments that it will comply honestly and sincerely 
to the full implementation of the resolution as a plan for 
comprehensive and durable peace 
the policy of iraq is to put obstacles in the way of the 
secretarygenerals peace efforts irans zarif said this 
whole iraqi exercise is planned to sabotage the efforts upon which 
the international community is looking with hope 
the un chief summoned both foreign ministers to new york this 
week for intensive consultations on setting a timetable for a 
unsupervised ceasefire a troop withdrawal prisoner exchange 
formal peace negotiations and creating a panel to determine which 
side started the war all points contained in the security council

british airways said thursday it grounded the most 
senior pilot of its supersonic concorde jetliner division for the 
rest of his career because he broke company rules about fuel levels 
during a flight from new york to london in may 
the airline said in a statement that it banned capt brian 
walpole 54 from flying and confined him to his desk job as 
general manager of the concorde division until he retires on his 
55th birthday in december 
queen elizabeth ii had honored walpole just this year on the 
advice of the government by making him an officer of the order of 
the british empire 
british airways said the concorde that walpole had been flying 
developed an hydraulic fault forcing him to reduce speed and so 
use more fuel than normal 
but it said that despite having the option of stopping at 
shannon airport in ireland to take on more fuel he flew on to 
londons heathrow airport 
it said air traffic controllers at heathrow responded to a 
request to clear the concorde for a priority landing the plane was 
found to have enough fuel for 25 more minutes flying instead of the 
minimum 30 required by british airways rules 
a rule had been broken capt walpole has ceased flying duties 
and will carry on his managerial duties as general manager of the 
concorde division until his time for retirement comes the 
statement said 
it said the 49 passengers on the flight were not endangered 
walpole was the first pilot to fly concorde across the atlantic 
to new york on its inaugural supersonic flight from london in 
1977 after helping testfly the plane 
in 1985 he flew queen mother elizabeth in a concorde as a treat 
for her 85th birthday

federal officials who have taken over an 
abandoned chemical plant in which a roof collapsed on already 
leaking drums warned worried residents thursday night that they may 
face an emergency 
us environmental protection agency spokesmen told about 300 
residents who crowded into a school auditorium for a town meeting 
that the agency does not know what is in more than 1000 decaying 
drums at artel chemical co 
so the bottom line is were in danger asked one woman in 
the audience after the twohour questionandanswer session 
we wouldnt be there if you werent answered dr joseph 
lafornara with the epas environmental response team from edison 
nj 
but the hazard has been there for years youve been living 
with it what were saying is in three or four months it wont be 
there anymore 
lafornara characterized the site as one of the three most 
critical among hundreds he has worked with under the federal 
superfund program which draws money from the chemical industry to 
help clean up hazardous dump sites 
epa spokesman harold yates said the plant had a long history of 
legal maneuvering and safety violations he said the plant 
manufactured small batches of exotic chemicals that cleanup 
workers now are having trouble identifying 
former artel employees attacked the epa for not hiring them to 
identify substances in the unmarked chemical drums while some 
residents harshly criticized the epa for not stepping in years ago 
yates said the most pressing problems at the closed plant 
include at least 60 drums of highly volatile metallic sodium and a 
large tank containing 9000 gallons of methyl mercaptan a chemical 
that is mixed in with natural gas to give it an odor 
yates said the threat of a severe explosion had been created 
over the weekend when rain triggered a roof collapse at the plants 
main warehouse 
there are drums that are rupturing as we speak he had said 
wednesday were talking about a major accident that could happen 
there 
but yates said thursday an engineer determined that the building 
was structurally safe and kanawha county emergency services 
coordinator bill white played down the danger 
i do not think the potential is any greater than it has been 
in the last five years white said the roofs been leaking for 
years the barrels have been leaking for years 
white said the epa told him that saturdays roof fall had 
punctured several barrels of acid and that water or moisture had 
reacted with the chemicals and they started fuming 
but he said there was little environmental danger 
the artel plant is one of several chemical plants along a strech 
of kanawha valley in western west virginia nitro with about 8000 
residents is about 12 miles west of charleston 
the plant has been closed since 24 employees walked off the job 
june 6 in a pay dispute they contended that they were being paid 
below minimum wage operations then were shut down after the us 
department of labor obtained a federal court injunction against 
artel 
the epa has stepped in to clean up the unidentified chemicals at 
artel and an ohio company is finishing the first step of taking 
test samples from the containers 
white said the chemicals will be moved for disposal increasing 
the risk of spills and leaks at that time 
the plant was owned and operated as fike chemical co for about 
25 years by elmer fike who was retained as a minority owner and 
consultant by artel when he sold the plant in 1986 
fike could not be reached at home thursday and former plant 
manager tom beal fikes soninlaw was out of town a family 
member said

james messer jr was executed in georgias 
electric chair thursday night for beating and stabbing his his 
8yearold niece to death when she fought his attempts to molest 
her 
messer 34 was pronounced dead at 723 pm thursday said 
department of corrections spokesman john siler 
warden walter zant asked messer if he had any final words and 
he said he did not messer did ask for a prayer and prison 
chaplain nolan lavelle placed his hands on messers left forearm 
and gave about a oneminute prayer at the conclusion messer said 
amen 
fourteen people witnessed the execution including one of 
messers attorneys messer did not ask for any personal witnesses 
to the execution siler said his mother mary messer and an aunt 
visited him at the prison wednesday 
outside the prison 12 death penalty protesters sang while 
about 20 prodeath penalty demonstrators including one man wearing 
a white ku klux klan robe carried signs in favor of the execution 
the execution came just over an hour after the us supreme 
court in a 72 vote refused to halt it justices thurgood 
marshall and william j brennan dissented but there was no 
immediate elaboration from the court 
the supreme court order followed a similar action thursday by 
the georgia board of pardons and paroles which had been asked to 
commute messers death sentence to life in prison chairman wayne 
snow said the panel concluded there are insufficient grounds for 
further consideration of the commutation request 
snow said the board rejected a psychiatrists testimony that 
messers explosive behavior may have been caused by brain 
damage 
messer was convicted of the feb 13 1979 slaying of rhonda 
joan tanner prosecutors said he abducted her from her school in 
cedartown tried to molest her and then killed her when she fought 
him 
her parents wayne and joyce tanner of cedartown came to the 
prison thursday with 28 friends and neighbors carrying signs with 
slogans like ten years too long and tanner family finally 
gets justice 
after the execution tanner 47 tearfully said the death was 
a big relief he finally paid 
we feel we can finally put our baby to rest said mrs 
tanner 45 
messer was the 13th person executed in georgias electric chair 
since the state resumed executions in 1983 he was the 101st person 
put to death in the united states since the supreme court allowed 
states to retore capital punishment in 1976 
us district judge robert hall of atlanta rejected messers 
appeal for a stay wednesday and the georgia supreme court denied a 
stay monday 
messer was sentenced to death in 1980 prosecutors said he 
abducted his niece after telling school officials her father had 
been hurt 
the girls body clad in a shirt was found the next day 
testimony in messers trial showed he had led her into the woods 
and tried to molest her when she resisted he kicked her slashed 
her stomach five times beat and stabbed her then left her to die 
messers lawyers contended their client was mentally incompetent 
and thus under a us supreme court ruling could not be put to 
death the attorneys also have argued that messers civil rights 
were violated when state prison officials refused to allow 
neurological tests for a possible brain tumor 
messer came within 15 hours of execution two years ago but won 
a stay from the us supreme court the case later went back to the 
circuit court which voted 75 to uphold the death sentence

the administration on thursday projected the 
federal deficit for the upcoming budget year at 1401 billion 
short of the trigger for acrosstheboard spending cuts but 
warned that a hefty droughtrelief bill could cause the automatic 
reductions to kick in 
the new deficit estimate covering the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 is 59 billion below the 146 billion level that would 
force politically painful cuts under the grammrudman budget law 
however james miller head of the office of management and 
budget said that the drought relief bill and several other 
spending proposals could quickly wipe out the cushion and trigger 
the spending cuts which would take effect right before the 
november elections 
miller said that president reagan supports drought relief a 
popular initiative in an election year but he said the president 
doesnt want to use the plight of the farmers as an opportunity 
to make a christmas tree out of that bill by loading it up with 
provisions that have little to do with drought relief 
later thursday the house approved a drought bill providing up 
to 58 billion in assistance for farmers while the senate passed 
a drought relief measure estimated to cost between 585 billion 
and 655 billion 
the administration is also fighting to hold down spending on 
other measures pending before congress including antidrug 
legislation trade legislation and aid for the hungry and homeless 
miller said if all of those measures were adopted the 1989 
deficit would increase by between 64 billion and 87 billion 
enough even at the low end of the estimate to trigger the spending 
cuts 
we cant do all the things that congress has on its list right 
now he told reporters during a white house briefing congress 
has got to pare down and make sure it doesnt go over these 
limits 
house budget committee chairman rep william gray dpa agreed 
that the administrations midsession budget review showed we may 
be moving uncomfortably close to automatic spending cuts 
it is clear from this report that congress and the 
administration will have to make difficult choices in the months 
ahead all of the urgent needs of the nation cannot be funded at 
the levels most of us would support in less difficult times gray 
said 
under the grammrudman act the administration is required to 
estimate the coming years fiscal budget deficit by midaugust the 
white house budget office must then adjust that estimate in october 
to take into account any new legislation 
if such legislation pushes the deficit past the trigger amount 
of 146 billion automatic spending cuts of more than 10 billion 
automatically take effect in october right before the fall 
elections with half of the cuts taken out of domestic spending and 
half out of military spending 
the administrations new budget estimates which are based on 
updated economic and spending projections predicted that the 
deficit in the current fiscal year would be 1523 billion 
this is slightly higher than the 1467 billion deficit estimate 
the administration made in february but it is still well below the 
deficit estimates of 160 billion or more that were being made by 
many private economists at the time 
betterthanexpected economic growth which has pushed the 
unemployment rate down to a 14yearlow and boosted government tax 
revenues was credited for lowering the shortfall 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc a private 
consulting firm said his current estimates were close to the 
administrations forecasts for this year and next year 
the 1987 budget deficit was 1504 billion as a onetime 
windfall from tax overhaul resulted in a big improvement from the 
2211 billion record deficit suffered in 1986 
miller noting that the administrations original forecast was 
scorned as a rosy scenario blamed higher spending in such 
areas as deposit insurance for missing the administrations 
february target 
the budget review said that the bank and savings and loan 
insurance funds would pay out 46 billion more this year than had 
been originally budgeted because of high failure rates at financial

the deficit target under the grammrudman legislation for the 
upcoming fiscal year is 136 billion but the legislation says 
automatic spending cuts can be avoided if the governments deficit 
projection is within 10 billion of that figure thus for 1989 
any estimate below 146 billion would avoid the need for spending 
cuts

an arson forest fire that has burned 
into the western edges of this city expanded and switched direction 
thursday and more subdivisions were ordered evacuated officials 
said 
its out of control it has expanded drastically since i was 
there last evening gov george mickelson said 
in wyoming efforts to block a fire burning toward old faithful 
geyser in yellowstone national park were hampered by what normally 
would be good firefighting weather cool damp conditions slowed a 
backfire intended to head off one of seven major fires 
fires also burned in alaska montana idaho california utah 
and washington state 
three subdivisions in western rapid city were ordered evacuated 
thursday as a precaution as wind whipped a fire in the heavily 
forested black hills later thursday officials suggested that 
residents leave another rural housing area 
reports that the fire was arson brought strong reaction from 
residents 
i cant believe theres people that sick said susan van 
norton who couldnt return home after a dental appointment because 
of the evacuation order it floors me to think that someone could 
cause that much destruction and devastaton to so many people 
fire officials did not know how many homes were involved but 
said the number was in the hundreds 
its almost being defended totally by air at the present time 
because it is in those canyons and the ground crews simply cannot 
fight the fire mickelson said in an interview from his office in 
pierre 
the wind switched from the southeast to the north during the 
morning and gained speed he said that combined with a forecast 
high of 100 degrees does not bode well for fighting the fire 
the governor said 
the fire had been declared 70 percent contained by late thursday 
after burning an estimated 2800 acres fifteen homes 32 
outbuildings 14 vehicles and a bridge had been destroyed 
earlier thursday about half of the 1000 people who were told 
to leave their homes wednesday were allowed to return 
mickelson was at the scene wednesday and saw a barn and a house 
catch fire no more than 200 yards away the buildings were engulfed 
in seconds 
don kopp the fire incident commander said wednesday that the 
fire was the work of an arsonist and he said authorities have been 
investigating a series of about 50 fires dating back to may that 
are believed to have been started by the same person 
a 14yearold boy was arrested in rapid city after a small fire 
was reported on a ridge overlooking the town but police said they 
did not think he was responsible for setting the main fire on 
tuesday 
fires inside yellowstone had charred 95135 acres by thursday 
evening about 4 percent of the parks 22 million acres 
although cooler temperatures higher humidity and scattered 
showers aided fire control efforts the conditions created problems 
for firefighters attempting to start a 6mile backfire along the 
eastern edge of the 8500acre north fork fire that was within six 
miles of old faithful 
but the same conditions helped firefighters outside the park and 
officials in the bridgerteton national forest prepared to release 
some of the 690 firefighters battling the 24400acre mink creek 
fire in the forests teton wilderness said ed waldapfel fire 
information officer 
the seven major fires in the park have not discouraged tourists 
from visiting the famous old faithful geyser as hundreds have been 
gathering to watch its regular eruptions 
officials continued to stress thursday that the old faithful 
complex around the geyser was in no danger from the fire the 
complex consists of three lodges providing 521 rooms including the 
old faithful inn which is on the us department of interiors 
list of national historic landmarks other services at old faithful 
include a general store and two service stations 
controversy continued over the national park services socalled 
let it burn philosophy the park service prefers its action to 
be called fire management saying fires are a natural part of a 
healthy forest 
park naturalist ranger don buss said the last time the park 
burned very badly was back in the 1600s 
tons of fallen timber fastgrowing brush trees killed by pine 
beetle and nearly 100 years of fire suppression have kept an 
elderly forest intact as a likely fire victim park officials said 
a forest that is 200to300years old is more or less 
preparing its own funeral pyre said john varley a park 
scientist 
five more families left their homes early thursday in western 
montana when the madison gulch fire grew to about 900 acres in the 
lolo national forest about 50 people left their homes in the area 
wednesday as a precaution from areas near alberton a town of 300 
on the clark fork river about 35 miles west of missoula 
there were 51 windwhipped fires burning across alaska 
firefighters were battling only 16 of them bureau of land 
management spokesman bill rockwell said fires this summer have 
blackened 14 million acres in alaska 
ten families remained out of their homes in the area of the 
3000acre willis gulch fire northeast of boise idaho and the 
state imposed strict fire restrictions due to go into effect at 
midnight on government land throughout the dry southern part of 
the state 
in california firefighters were working on scores of small 
fires throughout the sierra nevada most of them caused by 
lightning but a fire that burned about 30 acres wednesday near 
coulterville destroying four structures and forcing the evacuation 
of up to 70 homes was blamed on a careless 13yearold smoker

north korean president kim il sung called on south 
korea thursday to agree to his proposal for legislators from the 
two rivals to meet at the earliest date and renewed the norths 
demand to cohost the olympic games 
in a banquet speech for visiting ethiopian president mengistu 
hailemariam kim also denounced us plans to reinforce its 
military presence in and around south korea during the sept 
17oct 2 olympics in seoul the communist norths official korean 
central news agency reported 
the kcna englishlanguage report monitored in tokyo was 
transmitted late thursday night no immediate reaction came from 
south korean officials 
last week north korea proposed that legislators from the two 
koreas meet in pyongyang the norths capital to discuss a 
nonagression pact in a second letter tuesday it said it was 
ready to consider ending its boycott and entering the olympics if 
the south would consider its demand to act as host at the games 
south korean officials have said they were studying the letters 
and would respond affirmatively but they want to meet in the 
truce village of panmunjon in the demilitarized zone that divides 
the two koreas 
said kim these days the united states is reinforcing massive 
armed forces in and around south korea on the plea of guaranteeing 
olympic safety and at the instigation of the united states the 
south korean authorities are maneuvering more blatantly than ever 
to keep our nation divided forever 
what is needed is a dialogue for great national unity and 
reunification and the cohosting of the olympics kim said 
the international olympic committee has rejected north koreas 
demand to act as cohost at the games saying they are awarded to 
only one city 
the korean peninsula was divided into communist north and 
prowest capitalist south in 1945 at the end of world war ii the 
two halves fought the bloody korean war from 1950 to 1953 and 
remain bitter rivals 
kim added without elaborating that the standing committee of 
our supreme peoples assembly has decided to send a letter of 
proposal to the us congress for negotiations 
it was this assembly north koreas rubberstamp parliament that 
sent the two letters to south koreas national assembly through 
panmunjon 
kim noted that marxist ethiopia has taken the same stand with 
us in the struggle to realize olympic cohosting 
cuba albania nicaragua and the seychelles also are boycotting 
the games but 161 nations plan to attend in what will be the 
largest olympiad with about 12000 athletes competing

the parliament approved a reshuffled 
cabinet on thursday to help premier branko mikulic fight 
yugoslavias worst economic crisis 
during the parliamentary session vice premier janez zemljaric 
defended a government austerity program introduced in may the 
program has set off a wave of workers protest strikes nationwide 
over wages and inflation 
mikulic survived calls for his resignation in may when 
parliament decided against voting on noconfidence motions 
submitted by the nations two most economically developed 
republics slovenia and croatia 
he promised then to reconstruct his cabinet to promote more 
capable people 
mikulic picked radoslav bohinc a former deputy economy minister 
of slovenia as federal minister of economy a new cabinet post 
franc horvat also from slovenia replaced miodrag mirovic from 
montenegro as new minister of tourism 
dragi donev minister without portfolio from the southern

percent a 21 billion foreign debt falling living standards and 
growing labor unrest

hefty wage cuts 
the measures made in conjunction with the international

the may measures are a strong and brave economic program and 
they were accepted as such by our foreign creditors zemljaric

a federal prosecutor ridiculed defense tactics 
at the wedtech corruption trial thursday saying they were a bid to 
cloud the case with allegations against attorney general edwin 
meese iii 
rep mario biaggi dny and six others on trial since 
midmarch are charged with a racketeering conspiracy that allegedly 
turned wedtech corp into a vehicle for bribery and kickbacks 
prosecutors claim wedtech a nowdefunct military contractor 
grew into a multimilliondollar concern by committing fraud against 
a government program that set aside contracts for minorityowned 
businesses 
a key element of the defense case however was the claim that 
corrupt wedtech executives had connections to reagan white house 
insiders like meese and did not need to buy biaggis influence to 
obtain the nobid defense contracts 
assistant us attorney howard wilson in a daylong rebuttal of 
the defenses closing arguments compared the socalled meese 
defense to a squid that squirts black ink into the sea 
eveything gets cloudy everything gets muddy 
its impossible to see the creature and he escapes said 
wilson adding that his admittedly silly parable showed what 
so much of the defense in this case has been 
he compared it to a squid under attack talk about something 
else dont talk about the facts create a diversion and a 
smokescreen so theres a lot of ink and muddy waters 
in his closing argument thursday biaggi attorney james larossa 
said meese was at the core of the conspiracy and accused the 
attorney general of orchestrating corruption by investigating 
wedtechs competitors while allowing the company to pay his legal 
fees during his confirmation hearings in washington 
another prosecutor edward j little shocked the courtroom last 
week when he conceded in his summation that meese was a sleaze 
but said his activities had no bearing on the guilt or innocence of 
biaggi and his codefendants 
in his rebuttal argument wilson hammered at that point 
the biggest smokescreen or diversion in this case to protect 
them the defendants from the truth is ed meese said wilson 
meese was under scrutiny for some time because of his wedtech 
connections but a special prosecutor in washington james c 
mckay determined there was insufficient evidence to charge meese 
with wrongdoing however mckay questioned the attorney generals 
ethics on several issues 
meese has said he will leave office later this summer 
us district judge constance baker motley was to instruct the 
jury on the law governing its deliberations friday before it began 
weighing evidence in the fourmonthold trial motleys charge to 
the jury was expected to last all day

amnesty international appealed to sudan on 
thursday to investigate reported massacres of hundreds of civilians 
by government forces fighting rebels 
the londonbased human rights group also called on prime 
minister sadek mahdis government to repeal amputation and flogging 
as legal penalties 
in a 10page report amnesty urged sudan to take firm measures 
to assert the rule of law and establish independent inquries into 
reported massacres in the southern part of the east african nation 
the report followed a letter the group sent to sudan in may 
outlining its concerns over reported human rights abuses amnesty 
said it received no reply 
the sudanese peoples liberation army based in the christian 
and animist south has waged a guerrilla war against 
moslemdominated governments in the northern capital of khartoum 
since 1983 
the rebels oppose islamic law introduced by ousted president 
gafaar nimeiri which imposes amputation and flogging for certain 
offenses amnesty international said 
no amputations have been carried out since the military toppled 
nimeiri while he was visiting egypt in 1985 but floggings continue 
and courts still pass amputation sentences the report said 
massacres of unarmed civilians have taken place apparently 
because they belonged to an ethnic group regarded as sympathetic to 
or supportive of the rebels it said 
soldiers and militiamen reportedly massacred 1000 to 2000 
dinka tribesmen in the town of wau in august and september 1987 it 
said 
hundreds of other dinka civilians were burned to death by mobs 
in the town of addaien when police failed to intervene the report 
said 
relief agencies have estimated that fighting has displaced up to 
half the 6 million residents of the south the report said 
hundreds of thousands of them fled to neighboring ethiopia where 
the government is fighting its own civil war against rebels in the 
north

up a seasonally adjusted 10 percent in june the steepest climb

the morning after someone burned down 
bruce hartfords home friends and neighbors came by to offer help 
and sympathy standing in the ashes of all hed lost he found 
himself wondering if any of them had lit the match 
people are coming by and you think i wonder if its jim or 
bob or bill hartford said 
fifteen unsolved arsons since may 5 have reduced the town of 850 
to waves of rumor and fearful speculation about everyone 
knowing that most of the fires have been set around midnight or 
1 am many residents dont leave their houses after dark 
in most homes someone keeps watch through the night 
in many theres a gun near the door 
morning talk in the old corner store drifts to how many days 
have passed since the last fire 
people in town have changed said pat perkins whose family 
escaped its burning house when her husband heard something in the 
yard and smelled smoke everybody used to be very happy and 
smiling laughing talking now its long faces tired nervous 
the town 125 miles north of concord is on the defensive 
now hartford said people are staying pretty much to 
themselves because no one knows who it is 
it could be one of your best friends someone youve known for 
years and never suspected perkins agreed 
by daylight jeffersons 100 square miles of fields forests and 
back roads nestle in the shadow of the white mountains 
presidential range tourists on their way from mount washington 
pass through the villages three blocks where they find the old 
corner store three gas stations a post office and public library 
and little more 
with no local industry most residents commute to nearby towns 
for work 
about 30 volunteers make up the fire department jefferson has 
no police force the town depends on state police in twin mountain 
about 12 miles away 
you see someone who looks haggard and drawn in the corner 
store on sunday morning and you know its because they were up all 
night said charles bond a state senator were not unlike the 
hostages in a hijacking its a feeling of helplessness 
the fires that began in fields and brush escalated to barns 
unoccupied houses and two occupied homes back roads and main 
routes alike are dotted with blackened shells and foundations one 
of the burned homes is 1 blocks from the fire station no one has 
been injured in the fires 
authorities have said most of the fires began at the back of the 
buildings and most were set late at night theyve refused to 
divulge other details 
finding patterns is the key to finding the arsonist according 
to experts 
there is always a pattern it may be as illogical as you can 
imagine said charles king who after 23 years with the the new 
york city fire department began his own fire investigating firm 
alex ahart executive secretary of the international association 
of arson investigators said patterns can be found in the time of 
day the day of the week the location the method and other 
details 
a serial arsonist will progress ahart said hell work 
his way up the ladder little fires become bigger fires and bigger 
fires become yet bigger fires as they get bolder and more 
accustomed to what theyre doing whatever drives them to do this 
becomes a bigger need or addiction 
plainclothes state policemen driving unmarked cars now patrol 
jefferson and investigators have asked the fbi to try to develop a 
psychological profile of the fire starter a member of the state 
fire marshals office has moved to town 
at least 200 people attended a recent town meeting called by 
state police to calm residents fears 
the jefferson firemens association has offered a 5000 reward 
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever is 
responsible 
at hartfords burnedout house the reward poster sits amid 
flower pots that stood in what was the dooryard 
he and his wife son and stepdaughter scrambled out a bathroom 
window onto a roof and down a ladder to escape the fire that broke 
out at about 115 am they lost everything a 5monthold springer 
spaniel and a cat didnt make it out 
hartfords wife donna and her daughter wont sleep at night 
unless someone is awake he said blueprints already are drawn for 
another home on the site but the new house will be only one story 
easier to escape 
its tough to live this way right now said hartford 43 
who manages a building materials store in nearby littleton 
jefferson before this started was a very cohesive town a 
traditional small town where everyone would look out for each 
other said greg brown a local innkeeper while closeness 
remains you look over your shoulder you are suspicious of your 
neighbor it may break some bonds 
state police lt thomas kennedy said people are attempting to 
protect their own property and we have word that people are 
establishing their own citizen patrols late at night to identify 
this individual 
he has encouraged residents instead to call police with anything 
unusual 
mrs hartford told a story about a man who got a flat tire while 
driving late at night but was afraid to leave his car until 
daylight another resident recounted how a plainclothes policeman 
emerged from the woods near a barn and was met by three people with 
guns trained on him 
i wouldnt walk this street when it starts getting dark 
perkins said 
its difficult to convince people who feel their lives are 
threatened not to take action mrs hartford said 
were all frightened to death she said we dont want to 
hurt anyone but we want to protect whats rightfully ours 
perhaps the intensity of the investigation will drive the 
arsonist to leave or to stop setting fires for a time leaving 
residents with only their fear 
ive heard many people say they are not going to sleep again 
until this person is caught said innkeeper brown

you know how youll be standing in the 
grocery checkout line and youll pick up one of those tabloids with 
the screaming headlines and the story inside never lives up to the 
promise on the cover 
fox has turned that kind of an idea into a television show 
the reporters making its debut saturday 
true there are no stories at least in the premiere about 
aliens from outer space or twoheaded babies 
but the first installment does tease with the promise to 
answer the nagging question is mike tyson a homosexual 
never mind that no one who screened the show at the tv critics 
convention here could recall ever hearing the nagging question 
what seemed immediately more interesting than the answer was what 
happened to the person who asked 
reporter steve dunleavy did put the question to tyson after a 
fashion but the program never gives the promised answer other 
than tysons mumble about such rumors being typical when you have 
all the money and women 
otherwise dunleavys piece is a rambling profile that reveals 
little that is new about the heavyweight champ 
the reporters begins with a dramatic fastpaced opening 
similar to cbs west 57th what follows isnt really a news 
show though the reporters from the reporters defended it as 
such during a heated presentation to television critics 
earlier in the week the same critics got a peek at gtgs 
syndicated magazine show usa today the television show 
questions about its entertainment tonightstyle of happy talk 
paled next to the reporters which makes usa today the 
television show look like cbs reports by comparison 
on the reporters the reporters make lessthansubtle 
statements of their own conclusions about their stories getting 
the other side or at least presenting it to viewers seems an 
alien concept 
dunleavy even suggested there was no difference between his 
editorializing in the tyson piece and the commentary written by the 
tv critics who were questioning his tactics he didnt seem to 
grasp the difference between clearly labeled opinion and something 
presented as objective reportage 
for instance after tyson tells dunleavy hed do something 
irrational to anyone who threatened his wife dunleavy gushes 
in voiceover and believe me he means it 
dunleavy is a veteran of rupert murdochs tabloids in australia 
and more recently worked at the star and the new york post murdoch 
owns fox broadcasting co dunleavy is also seen on foxs syndicated 
news show a current affair 
the reporters is from the same people who do a current 
affair but that show somehow has an edge of winkwink 
nudgenudge thanks in part to host maury povich that is lacking 
in the deadly serious and selfimportant the reporters 
rafael abramovitz another of the reporters who is also a 
veteran of a current affair became angry at the tv critics at 
one point explaining his cracking voice im trembling because 
im offended 
besides the tyson piece critics took exception to a story in 
which reporter krista bradford helped a taiwanese student legalize 
her alien status and avoid deportation 
in the final scene bradford shows the girl a tape of an 
interview with a government official agreeing to let her stay in 
the united states the girl overwhelmed by the news hugs 
bradford then the crew takes her to the statue of liberty 
cbs dan rather had some emotional encounters with traumatized 
vietnam veterans for a recent network documentary and the network 
took the veterans to the vietnam veterans memorial but somehow it 
all served to illustrate the issue without becoming embarrassingly 
selfconscious 
abramovitz disagreed if you think they the networks work a 
story any differently than we do theyre a lot better at pulling 
the wool over your eyes than we are he said 
i think we can display emotion without commenting on the 
issues said bradford i agree its a fine line and im happy 
with where i have placed it 
abramovitz called the show firstrate journalism 
we used to have a trick we used to hide all these things and 
make it look like objective journalism he said i think its 
time to come out in the open and tell it like it is 
were going to be doing stories about real people in a real way 
and were not going to confuse people about whats on the screen or 
whats in our minds 
the critics didnt get to screen abramovitzs piece for the 
premiere show the story called the actress and the dwarf was 
still being edited 
the reporters on the reporters might have a point about 
elitism lowbrow entertainment has its place and who doesnt have 
a guilty pleasure 
viewed as unintentional spoof of the 60 minutes genre the 
reporters is not bad entertainment but calling it an objective 
news show is a little scary

more reality from fox fox has more realitybased 
series in production for the fall to fill in for entertainment

the story appeared in the sports section but 
like many a modern sports story it was about finance and 
economics too 
after a prolonged negotiation dave cadigan the first round 
draft choice of the new york jets football team had signed a 2 
million contract 
the sticking point according to news accounts had been that 
cadigan and his lawyer wanted most of the 850000 signing bonus 
paid in 1988 while the maximum income tax rate is 28 percent 
cadigan wanted to receive a larger portion of his overall 
bonus this year as the maximum rate could go up in succeeding 
years the new york times reported 
there is a lot of that going around these days a sense that 
some longoutstanding bills will soon come due for many americans 
as individuals and the country as a whole 
when analysts listen to campaign promises from either party this 
year they react with more than the customary skepticism how they 
ask is anybody going to pay for these goodies when the government 
is already shoulderdeep in debt 
stop kidding us says the current issue of fortune magazine 
chastising the presidential candidates for playing down the 
question of a tax increase everybody knows that for the deficit 
to come down taxes must go up 
william brennan who publishes the newsletter brennan reports on 
tax and investment planning is giving advice very similar to what 
cadigan got from his attorney 
normally brennan says savvy taxpayers begin around this time 
of year figuring out how to defer as much income as possible past 
new years day in order to reduce the tax bills they will face 
in the past planning was usually concentrated on deferring 
income thats no longer true he observes 
there may be cases where income should be accelerated into 
1988 while tax rates are low in the future a 28 percent or 33 
percent rate may be pretty appetizing when we look back to 1988 
it is less than two years since congress overhauled the income 
tax system curbing or eliminating many tax deductions the 
legislators were able to sell the bill to the public by lowering 
tax rates 
so you might expect cries of outrage at talk of raising those 
rates again but there are other forces at work as well 
one is the grammrudmanhollings bill also enacted in 1986 
that mandates acrosstheboard cuts in spending for government 
programs unless specific goals are met toward balancing the federal 
budget 
in this election year says pamela pecarich director of tax 
policy at the accounting firm of coopers amp lybrand policymakers 
probably can dodge the grammrudman ax with some imaginative 
maneuvering and optimistic assumptions next year will be a 
different story she says 
then there are the stirrings of inflation that lately have 
troubled wall street and that alan greenspan chairman of the 
federal reserve board has spoken of with unusually candid concern 
these inflation worries arise out of a vibrant economy in which 
industry is enjoying a renascence and unemployment has fallen to a 
14year low 
but that nearboom has been financed to a great extent with 
other peoples money in many cases money borrowed from foreign 
investors to pay for goods made by foreign manufacturers 
there is very good momentum in the economy right now says 
paul boltz financial economist at the investment management firm 
of t rowe price associates 
however he adds we havent started to pay for this party 
and we wont until we have a trade surplus

they stood on their heads and yodeled they 
smushed marshmallows in their mouths and chanted chubby bunny 
chubby bunny chubby bunny they dressed as uncle sam and tapped 
danced on stilts 
they were weird but they had a purpose 
more than 100 people staged their weirdest acts last week for a 
chance to be seen on the big screen with a guy who proudly bills 
himself as weird al 
his real name is al yankovic a 27yearold southern california 
native who hit the big time in 1983 with a song called another 
one rides the bus 
it was his way of laughing at pop culture the song is a parody 
of the rock group queens hit song another one bites the dust 
hes been laughing his way to the bank ever since 
five albumns later weird al is on the radio and video music 
stations again laughing at pop culture this time with im fat 
from his even worse albumn the song and lp is a takeoff on 
michael jacksons im bad from the bad album 
most of the songs i do are about food or tv two of the 
things that have shaped my life most yankovic said 
five years later weird al is still well weird and hes 
making a fulllength feature film to prove it called u h f due 
for release next summer shooting was to begin in early august in 
tulsa 
it feels kind of cold and clammy said the former college 
disc jockey its a lot harder to be funny for an hour and a half 
than it is for three or four minutes he said referring to his 
work with music videos 
ten years ago yankovic was an architecture student at calpoly 
san louis obispo college he left with a degree and moved on to 
develop weird al now he has a movie deal to film the screenplay he 
and longtime friend and manager jay levey finished in 1983 
the character that i play is going to be somewhat like weird 
al yankovic said but this isnt going to be weird als big 
adventure 
the movie is a cross between its a wonderful life the 
texas chainsaw massacre and purple rain said levey who is 
directing the film its a love story 
ok not really yankovics character george newman owns a uhf 
tv station and turns it into the hottest thing around by putting on 
nice wholesome weird programming 
levey began managing yankovics career from his inception 
when he was an embryo he also has directed the weird al videos 
a change of pace from directing u h f his first feature film 
i just kind of fell into directing shooting music videos is 
kamikaze work you have two days to do four days of work levey 
said the pacing is not quite so deadly in film 
the tulsa auditions were an open call for acts that may be used 
later during the eightweek filming schedule when staging a 
telethon to save newmans station levey said 
they came at us for five hours they were all so strange he 
said its hard to describe them without sounding ridiculous but 
they were all great 
the movie is being filmed in tulsa because its the perfect 
anytown levey said and thats meant as a very affectionate 
compliment to tulsa 
executive producer gray frederickson suggested tulsa as a film 
location after his experience here in 1982 while shooting the 
outsiders and having a chance to come back home makes working in 
the state more desirable he said 
this is repeat business so thats great said mary nell 
clark director of the oklahoma film office 
u h f is the fourth motion picture filmed in the state this 
year the killing device was filmed in tulsa in april the 
bounty hunter in sand springs in may and portions of rainman 
in guthrie hinton and el reno in june 
clark said she is able to sell the state to film companies 
because of the varied location work that is available i always 
tell them about the varied terrain ive hyped that so much now 
that i think they believe me 
television video and fulllength feature filming in oklahoma 
brought in about 50 million last year clark said

drought has taken its toll on beans peas and 
other food crops as well as chewing away at bigticket items like 
corn soybeans and spring wheat says the agriculture department 
the droughts greatest impacts on fruit and vegetable crops 
are likely to be on dry edible beans tart cherries green peas 
sweet corn and snap beans for canning says economist glenn zepp 
wisconsin and minnesota produce about 50 percent of us sweet 
corn and green peas much of which is on nonirrigated acreage 
he says wisconsin produces about 40 percent of the us snap 
bean output about half of which is grown on nonirrigated 
acreage 
the production of vegetables grown for the fresh market tends to 
be concentrated on irrigated land so the drought impact has not 
been so great 
zepp writing in the august issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine provided an appraisal of how the hot weather and drought 
has affected several highvalue crops 
heres a summary of his analysis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
midwestern output of green peas is about 50 percent below 
normal sweet corn and green beans are harvested later in the 
summer and production depends on rainfall in the remainder of the 
season canners expect midwestern sweet corn and green bean 
production to be only 70 percent to 75 percent of what had been 
planned and carrot and beet production is expected to be 60 
percent to 65 percent 
canners boosted prices of peas sweet corn and snap beans by 10 
percent to 20 percent in june because of anticipated production 
shortfalls 
most of the corn peas and beans grown in wisconsin and 
minnesota are for canning vegetables for freezing are concentrated 
in the pacific northwest where water for irrigation generally has 
been adequate for vegetable production this summer

hot dry weather in june hurt development of potatoes across the 
northcentral states reducing stands and stressing plants the usda 
estimates 1988 total potato acreage at 127 million acres down 2 
percent from last year the area for fall harvest is estimated at 
106 million acres down 3 percent from last year the large 1987 
fall crop resulted in generally lower prices causing farmers to 
reduce acreage this season

growers planted 93900 acres of sweet potatoes for 1988 down 3 
percent from last year the biggest change was in louisiana where 
acreage dropped nearly 11 percent from 1987 dry soils delayed

drought appears to have contributed to a 36 percent cut in 
michigans dry bean acreage this year since most of the crop is on 
nonirrigated land dry weather delayed plantings in michigan 
which increased the chance of frost damage this fall before the 
crop is mature also some growers shifted dry bean acreage to 
soybeans hoping for higher returns 
michigan grows mainly navy beans accounting for about 60 
percent of last years navy bean harvest nationwide navy bean 
prices rose nearly 40 percent during the third week of june because 
of anticipated drought losses and smaller supplies 
the july estimate of area for harvest for all types of dry beans 
was 151 million acres down 13 percent from last year in addition 
to the decline in michigan large acreage reductions were reported 
for california colorado idaho and nebraska north dakota on the

estimated plantings of sugar beets were put at 132 million 
acres up 4 percent from last season the acreage was up in all 
major growing areas except california however dry conditions 
resulted in poor germination requiring growers to replant some 
fields several times according to industry sources more than 
250000 acres mostly in the red river valley had to be replanted 
in some cases farmers may have switched to other crops having a 
shorter growing season or requiring less soil moisture for seed 
germination 
according to usda analysts sugar beet production will be 
substantially below last years nearrecord harvest while cane

the economy expanded at a healthy 31 percent annual pace in the 
second quarter according to the government but the financial 
markets focused on rising food energy and clothing costs that 
pushed the inflation rate during the period to a nearly sixyear 
high 
stock and bond prices declined wednesday after the commerce 
department released its economic growth report which indicated 
inflation was at 47 percent annual pace in the second quarter 
the government reported that the growth rate in the gross 
national product the economys total output of goods and services 
was down only slightly from a revised 34 percent increase in the 
first three months of the year 
but inflation as measured by a price index tied to the gnp 
registered the biggest advance since the third quarter of 1982 the 
gnp price index had risen at a 35 percent rate in the first 
quarter 
the white house dismissed the inflation figure as a temporary 
deviation but some private economists said the current long 
economic recovery may be coming to an end setting the stage for a 
recession some time next year 
we have had a definite upturn in the inflation rate which is a 
byproduct of our long expansion said allen sinai chief 
economist of the boston co the demand side of our economy is now

other cashrich japanese companies have bought into large 
established capitalhungry wall street firms but the investment 
by nomura japans biggest securities house represents a 
relatively more potent capital boost to the small sixmonthold 
investment boutique 
wasserstein perella was formed in february by two leaders of 
first boston corps highly successful mergers and acquisitions 
operation who quit to start their own firm 
under an agreement announced wednesday the two firms plan to 
work together on mergers and acquisitions involving japanese 
american and european companies the transactions are expected to 
be handled through a joint venture company 
this will be a very good source of business for our firm and 
nomuras knowledge of the japanese market is a real advantage to 
our clients who are looking to sell assets to japanese buyers 
said michael biondi a vice president at wasserstein perella 
tokyobased nomura securities had 1987 profits totaling 213 
billion and a market capitalization in excess of 56 billion 
yoshihisa tabuchi nomuras president and chief executive said 
the affiliation will provide our clients with unique benefits in 
execution skills and strategic insight in the global mergers and 
acquisitions marketplace 
japanese companies long have had a keen interest in the 
fastpaced mampa business that has evolved in the united states at 
the same time wall street firms hungry for new sources of capital 
increasingly have turned to foreign partners 
in late 1986 sumitomo bank ltd paid 500 million for a 
nonvoting stake in goldman sachs amp co last year nippon life 
insurance co acquired a 13 percent stake in shearson lehman 
brothers holdings inc for 538 million 
and also in 1987 yasuda mutual life insurance co agreed to pay 
300 million for an 18 percent stake in painewebber group inc 
on tuesday japans fourthlargest securities house yamaichi 
securities co agreed to acquire a 25 percent equity interest in 
lodestar group a small us merger and acquisitions firm headed by 
kenneth miller former mampa head for merrill lynch amp co yamaichi 
also invested 100 million in lodestars corporate buyout fund 
biondi said nomura made the investment for strategic reasons 
they want to be an important factor in the global mampa market 
they want to learn and be in partnership with someone who is 
perceived as a very highquality provider of mampa advice he said 
one source on wall street said the deal ensures wasserstein 
perella gets all the advantages of having the pockets of a major 
player in the financial markets while nomura gets access to an 
enviable flow of deals 
indeed wasserstein perella has represented such major players 
as campeau corp georgia pacific corp beatrice us food corp 
and macmillan inc the firm with offices in four us cities and 
in london has advised clients on transactions valued at more than 
19 billion since its inception 
biondi said nomuras contribution was the first outside 
money the young investment firm had raised until now we were 
100 percent owned by employee shareholders he said 
wasserstein perella has 500 million earmarked for leveraged 
buyouts and expects to raise further capital for the buyout fund 
nomuras contribution will be a substantial boost to the firms 
operating capital biondi said 
in a statement announcing the nomura deal the firm stressed 
that while its goal was to be a major player in mergers and 
acquisitions it did not want to amass a huge staff that would 
prevent potential problems inherent with a big workroll such as 
conflicts of interest while sharply boosting the potential profits 
for the firms partners 
bruce wasserstein president and chief executive and his 
partner joseph perella the firms chairman were in japan and 
could not be reached for comment 
the pair stunned the investment community in february when they 
left first boston the investment house they helped propel to the 
top ranks in the mergers and acquisition business a string of 
other first boston professionals resigned to follow them taking a 
toll on the venerable investment house 
the takeover team they headed was believed to have brought in 
more than 350 million in mergers and acquisition revenue in 1987 
alone and some analysts estimated the duo was responsible for half 
of first bostons 1987 profits

the nations biggest hospital industry group 
is calling for caution in prudential insurance co of americas 
revolutionary plan to direct policyholders to have major organ 
transplants at hospitals it believes have the best survivability 
rates 
the giant insurance companys plan announced wednesday could 
mark a break with tradition that leaves the choice of hospital up 
to patient and physician but is seen as helping to hold down 
rising health care costs 
but bruce mcpherson vice president for group health care at the 
american hospital association in washington said hospital ratings 
based on statistics should not be the sole criteria for judging 
quality care 
it is important for them to disclose their quality criteria 
how that quality criteria was designated what the connections are 
in terms of the criteria they chose and which hospitals appear on 
the lists mcpherson said in a statement 
prudential is the nations largest health insurer covering 20 
million people it has negotiated contracts with hospitals to 
perform the special surgeries including heart kidney or liver 
transplants 
dr dan dragalin vice president of the prudential groups 
medical services division said the company would use financial 
incentives such as coverage of travel costs to have policyholders 
travel to a handful of hospitals nationwide 
we decided if we were going to direct patients to specific 
hospitals we would choose institutions that meet very tough 
criteria said dragalin he also said prudential chose hospitals 
that offered the highest quality package for various operations 
prudential said hospitals found foremost in the industry were 
promised volume in exchange for cost discounts the company 
negotiated discounts of 25 percent to 30 percent on the complex 
operations which can cost up to 250000 
diedre perkins manager of group medical services said the 
company also tried to find institutions that could serve as 
regional facilities for prudential beneficiaries requiring a 
particular operation 
joel miller deputy director of the health insurance association 
of america said his group long has advocated the use of designated 
hospitals for complex operations 
we believe there are two distinct advantages he said 
when only a few hospitals perform a high volume of transplant 
operations we believe the outcome of the operations are likely to 
improve we also see designated hospitals preventing unnecessary 
duplication of investment in transplant capacity which will hold 
down costs 
james mortimer president of the midwest business group on 
health a chicagobased coalition of employers also said the plan 
could prompt lower healthcare costs 
getting the insurance industry to actively purchase care for 
its corporate clients is a major step mortimer said in 
wednesdays edition of the chicago tribune 
of the 50 to 60 hospitals that do transplants prudential found 
three qualified for heart transplants two for liver transplants 
and seven for kidney transplants 
dragalin said prudential intends to expand the system to include 
other complex and costly procedures including bone marrow 
transplants coronary artery bypass surgery burn treatment and a 
host of neurosurgical operations 
dragalin said the company is negotiating with eight hospitals to 
provide neurosurgical services 
the 15 million prudential beneficiaries who are members of 
health maintenance organizations or managed care plans will be 
required to use the designated institutions the company said 
while prudential plans to continue paying for the operations of 
other policyholders who use nondesignated hospitals 
prudential said its primary goal is to prevent patients from 
being drawn to inexperienced hospitals by lower prices for complex 
operations 
hospitals are increasingly diversifying and performing 
procedures they havent done in the past dragalin said adding 
that many are trying to compensate for the loss of some traditional 
business to health maintenance organizations

a new telephone holding company that will become 
the nations fourthlargest long distance carrier has no plans to 
take on the industry leaders nationally according to company 
officials 
southernnet inc of atlanta and teleconnect co of cedar rapids 
iowa said wednesday they signed a letter of intent to create a 
yettobenamed holding company that will form a long distance 
carrier serving about 400000 customers the company would have 
annual revenue of more than 400 million 
teleconnect formed in 1979 and southernnet founded in 1984 
have grown rapidly providing long distance and other telephone 
services mainly to businesses within their regions 
teleconnect which made its initial public stock offering this 
year operates in 21 mainly midwestern states the company earned 
76 million or 90 cents per share on revenue of 1678 million 
last year 
southernnet operates in 10 southeastern states and in 
washington dc and earned 87 million or 62 cents per share 
on revenue of 2286 million last year 
trading was halted on both companies shares early wednesday 
afternoon with southernnet standing at 2062 a share on the 
overthecounter market and teleconnect at 15 on the new york 
stock exchange 
wednesdays joint announcement said the holding company would 
concentrate on regional operations and not compete directly with 
the big three of atampt mci communications corp and us sprint 
the companies have high penetration in some areas and we 
specifically do not want to to out and try to cover the nation 
said southernnet president o gene gabbard who will serve as 
chairman and chief executive officer of the atlantabased holding 
company 
teleconnect chairman and chief executive clark e mcleod will be 
vice chairman and president of the company 
the nations long distance market has been estimated at 50 
billion annually with atampt getting 72 percent mci has about 10 
percent and us sprint about 7 percent according to jack grubman 
an analyst with painewebber 
our aspiration is not to be a national player but to be very 
strong regional players sharing research and development and 
sharing network capacities mcleod said 
shareholders who still must approve the deal would receive one 
share of stock in the new holding company for each share they now 
hold in the regional companies 
the companies also announced quarterly results wednesday 
teleconnect reporting second quarter earnings of 26 million 
or 23 cents per share on revenue of 603 million 
southernnet earned 59 million or 43 cents per share on 
revenue of 659 million compared with a profit of 307 million 
or 22 cents per share on 5547 in revenue during the yearearlier 
quarter 
the latest quarter includes 242 million from southernnets 
sale of a cellular telephone subsidiary 
the boards of both companies have approved formation of the new 
company which remains subject to regulatory approval as well as 
the execution of a definitive agreement gabbard estimated the deal 
would be completed in the fourth quarter 
the two companies have worked together previously and last 
month announced the creation of a national tollfree service

with the steel industry enjoying a healthy 
revival after seven years of depression usx corp is willing to 
sell a chunk of its steelmaking uss division according to 
chairman david roderick 
but so far proposals to spin off up to 20 percent of the unit 
have come only from investment bankers not actual principals 
roderick said wednesday at his quarterly news conference 
roderick said he welcomed proposals providing we were offered 
full full valueand we certainly have no incentive to sell 
it for less than full value 
the chairman of the energy and steel company declined to suggest 
a figure 
we wouldnt want to restrict the imagination of potential 
buyers he said 
usx president charles corry said any deal probably would involve 
usx making a public offering of stock in part of the steelmaking 
division 
usx would retain tax benefits accumulated during steels years 
of unprofitable operations said corry who is considered a leading 
candidate to succeed roderick when the chairman reaches the 
companys mandatory retirement age of 65 next may 
meanwhile roderick projected 1988 steel industry shipments of 
81 million tons or more a high figure that would mean two more 
quarters of robust business 
with demand for steel showing no signs of faltering and mills 
running at or near capacity prices are rising and profits are 
flowing in he said 
roderick said the uss division the domestic industrys largest 
producer is reconsidering an oct 1 price increased it announced 
to customers of flatrolled steel 
the timing of the price move was undermined by bethlehem the 
thirdlargest producer which scheduled increases of up to 55 
percent for jan 1 no 2ranked ltv steel co followed bethlehems 
lead 
roderick said price increases are justified even though his 
company is churning out profits of 70 per ton 
back in the first first quarter of this year our prices were 
about 19 percent below 1981 weve picked some of that back up in 
the second quarter but my guess is that were still 12 to 13 
percent below the 1981 steel prices he said 
and when we get out of this decadethe steel prices are 
going to be lower than when we came into the decade roderick 
said i ask you how many manufacturing industries in the united 
states are going to get through the decade of the 80s with 
absolutely zero inflation in price 
stronger earnings in steel compensated for the diminished 
performance in energy for a fourth consecutive quarter as usx on 
tuesday reported secondquarter profits of 213 million or 74 
cents per share on sales of 43 billion 
oil carried us from 1982 through 1987 roderick said this 
is the first period when earnings from energy were lower than 
earnings from steel

henley group inc after failing to gain 
control of santa fe southern pacific inc says it will sell its 
santa fe shares to itel inc in a deal that would give henley a 40 
percent stake in the chicagobased holding company 
the companies valued the deal at 12 billion in cash and stock 
the complex transaction agreed to wednesday also calls for sale 
to itel of henleys stock holdings in american president cos ltd 
a shipping container company and of henleys signal capital 
subsidiary a financing company and lessor of railroad cars 
santa fe southern pacific which fended off henleys advances 
over a sixmonth period responded favorably its president and 
chief executive officer robert krebs said in a news release we 
are sure that itel wil be a constructive shareholder of santa 
fe southern pacific 
henleys stock price rose 150 a share to 2475 in 
overthecounter trading wednesday while itel advanced 25 cents to 
1987 
henley a holding company run by investor michael dingman out of 
dual headquarters in la jolla calif and hampton nh said it 
would receive 827 million cash and 187 million shares of newly 
issued itel stock 
that would give henley 40 percent share of itel which leases 
railroad cars and owns dredging and wire companies in the chicago 
area 
itel would get henleys 169 percent share of chicagobased 
santa fe its 96 percent holding in american president of oakland 
calif and its 132 percent stake in oak industries a rancho 
bernardo calif company that makes and distributes electronic 
equipment for the cable television and other industries 
henley subsidiaries signal capital and the smaller equilease 
corp also would change hands bringing itels total assets to 36 
billion 
henley which under dingman has bought and reshuffled a number 
of companies in recent years would be subject to a 10year 
standstill agreement requiring it to vote its itel shares with 
management and barring further purchases said james knox itels 
senior vice president and general counsel 
itel principals samuel zell and robert lurie who through a 
partnership own 20 percent of itels 27 million shares would be 
issued warrants to purchase new stock to maintain their 20 percent 
equity position knox said

itel would emerge as the largest railroad car lessor in country 
with 30000 railroad freight cars owned by signal capitals pullman 
leasing in addition to its own 43000 cars the company said 
on march 18 an adverse court ruling prompted henley to abandon 
a proxy fight for seats on santa fes board ending a sixmonth 
battle that included attempts to buy the company a rival suitor 
olympia amp york developments ltd of toronto ended up with 196 
percent of santa fe and two board seats 
itel approached henley a few months ago specifically about 
acquiring pullman and discussions blossomed into a farreaching 
transaction among likeminded investors dingman zell and lurie 
knox said 
part of the attraction of this deal was the possibility of 
working together knox said 
zell itels chairman and chief executive officer and longtime 
business partner lurie now a director bought into itel in 1984 as 
it was emerging from bankruptcy and moved it from san francisco to 
chicago in late 1985 and early 1986

the ruler of the united 
arab emirates affirmed thursday his nations support for unity 
within the organization of petroleum exporting countries the 
official emirates news agency wam reported 
the agency reporting the meeting between sheik zayed bin sultan 
alnahyan and cartel secretarygeneral subroto quoted the uae 
president as saying his country has always been at the forefront 
for boosting opec decisions and supporting the stability of the oil 
market 
the report did not specifically address the controversial issue 
of uae oil production but it indicated the emirates would not 
undermine the 13nation cartel by adopting unilateral decisions 
sheik zayeds statements were made after subroto gave him a 
message from oepc president rilwanu lukman of nigeria according to 
the wam report details of the message were not disclosed 
the meeting was also attended by mana saeed otaiba the federal 
uae oil minister subroto and otaiba met earlier as oil sources 
said the opec secretarygeneral sought a compromise regarding the 
uae claim for a higher oil production quota 
wam said only that subroto discussed with otaiba the latest 
developments in the world oil market 
the sources who spoke on condition they not be named said 
subrotos visit came in response to reports quoting uae oil 
officials as saying the country would abandon its opec production 
quota of 948000 barrels of oil a day and produce about 15 million 
barrels a day 
they noted opecs price monitoring committee will meet aug 3 in 
lausanne switzerland to discuss the oil market situation in light 
of irans decision to accept a un security council resolution 
calling for a ceasefire in the persian gulf war 
the war has been casting shadows on the cartels efforts to curb 
production levels and maintain an 18 per barrel benchmark price 
both iraq and iran are prominent opec members and have been 
flouting production and pricing policies respectively because of 
the conflict 
the uae demand for a higher quota is also a prominent issue 
for the lausanne meeting of the fivemember pricing committee which 
comprises the oil ministers of saudi arabia venezuela algeria 
nigeria and indonesia 
otaiba has said the uaes current quota was not fair and did 
not synchronize with its production potential claimed to be 4 
million barrels per day

allegheny international inc says it lost 
153 million during the companys third quarter compared to a 
loss of 294 million in the same period a year ago 
the pittsburghbased consumer products manufacturer said 
wednesday its thirdquarter loss came on sales of 2339 million 
up from its thirdquarter 1987 sales of 2298 million 
the company attributed the latest loss in part to the 
consolidation of its sunbeam appliance and oster divisions 
announced in june 
allegheny international also cited its reorganization under 
chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws and its proxy fight for 
control of the companys board of directors as reasons for the 
latest shortfall 
for the first nine months of fiscal 1988 allegheny 
international reported a loss of 126 million on sales of 7449 
million that compared to a loss of 2336 million on sales of

americans personal income jumped a healthy 
07 percent in june the best showing in three months while 
consumer spending rose even faster the government said today 
the commerce department said that consumer spending rose 10 
percent to 321 trillion following a 06 percent increase in may 
it was the biggest increase since spending shot up 13 percent last 
august 
the big rise in spending is likely to be viewed as worrisome by 
analysts who have been looking for consumer demand to ease to allow 
room in the economy for production of exports 
too much consumer demand is seen as inflationary because it 
places a strain on us manufacturers who are fighting to lower the 
trade deficit 
the 279 billion increase in personal incomes to 404 trillion 
followed a 05 percent rise in may a modest 02 percent increase 
in april and a 10 percent jump in march 
with spending rising a bit faster than income americans 
personal savings rate fell slightly to 43 percent compared with 
44 percent in may still the average savings rate for the first 
half of 1988 41 percent is up substantially from 32 percent in 
1987 
americans aftertax income increased 08 percent in june after 
shooting up 24 percent in may 
the gain in income in part reflected healthy increases in 
employment in june the unemployment rate dropped to 53 percent 
last month a 14year low 
that was somewhat offset by a 13 billion decrease in farm 
income in june attributed to a 39 billion drop in federal farm 
subsidy payments 
the department gave these details of spending 
on durable goods big ticket items expected to last three 
or more years spending rose 86 billion in june compared with an 
increase of 27 billion in may 
on nondurable goods spending rose 45 billion in june

stepping down after four years 
different times call for different types of people wright 
said saying that the network faced an era of enormous change 
both technologically and economically 
when wright offered the job last week during the democratic 
national convention gartner said we didnt talk about the 
present we talked about the future 
wright who was installed as president after general electric 
bought nbc in 1986 has enforced financial discipline in all 
network divisions and has talked of the need for innovation as the 
networks share of the viewing audience declines 
he wright wants me to lead he wants me to manage he wants 
me to use my news judgment and he wants me to be a good 
businessman but most of all he wants me to think about the future 
and help lead nbc into the future safely and soundly and with

audacious and intelligent 
we get various reactions to it around the water cooler here 
chancellor said one is that bob wright has set good journalism 
as his first priority thats obviously clear another reaction i 
would have is that gartner will be able to prove that good 
journalism is the heart of the enterprise 
grossman a former public television executive had been 
criticized within nbcs news division because he had no experience 
in journalism but he said he left because of friction with the 
executive office 
early in wrights tenure grossman had refused to go along with 
a costcutting exercise but later fell into line 
its time for them to get their own guy in there grossman 
said wednesday in los angeles where he was attending an nbc 
meeting things have changed it hasnt been all that fun lately 
ive been there four years its a difference in style personality 
and priorities 
during grossmans tenure at nbc news nightly news and the 
today rose to the top of the ratings lately however 
nightly news has been consistently third in a tight ratings 
race 
gartner said he met wright a few months ago to discuss first 
amendment issues he said they had second conversation about nbc 
and the offer came last week 
ive got a lot to learn as a starter and ive got a lot of 
new people to get to know and to deal with and to get them to sign 
on so that we can move nbc forward together he said 
gartners only previous experience with television was with the 
registers broadcast group which owned television stations in 
moline ill and honolulu 
he wanted to make sure the newscast gave you something said 
richard gilbert who headed the register broadcast group and now is 
publisher of the pioneer press group of weekly newspapers based in 
wilmette ill he wanted to give people news of substance and 
usefulness 
dennis waller general manager of the ames tribune said gartner 
has an energy field that gets everybody fired up he is just an 
exceptional individual 
he has an electric personality said james p gannon editor 
of the des moines register hes a brilliant journalist a great 
idea person and a very outgoing personality who had good effects on 
morale in the newsroom

tonka corp announced a 76 million 
secondquarter loss and said it has laid off 110 employees in a 
restructuring of its kenner products and tonka toy divisions 
in cutting the 87 fulltime and 23 parttime employees 
wednesday tonka cited disappointing sales of its once hot pound 
puppies line and other tonka products as well as a need to 
eliminate overlapping responsibilities with the recentlyacquired 
kenner parker toys 
the company said its secondquarter loss came on sales of 1984 
million and compared with earnings of 16 million or 20 cents 
per share on sales of 496 million in the same period a year 
earlier 
tonka attributed the loss to charges in connection with the 
kenner parker acquisition 
the results brought tonkas sixmonth losses to 181 million 
compared with earnings of 32 million or 41 cents a share in the 
first half of 1987 first half revenues rose to 3668 million from 
979 million 
tonka renewed its earlier prediction that it would break even or 
earn a profit for the year after reporting a loss of 75 million 
for all of 1987 
the layoffs announced wednesday were the latest in a series of 
employee cuts among tonkas four divisions since the kenner parker 
acquisition was announced last fall reducing total employment from 
about 4600 to about 3975 
stephen shank tonkas chairman and chief executive said he 
hoped wednesdays action would put the company in a stable business 
position 
tonka also announced wednesday two kenner executives will head a 
new us toy group within the company to oversee the autonomous 
kenner and tonka divisions david mauer 39 president and general 
manager of kenner in cincinnati will head the group and joseph 
fortino 51 senior vice president of kenner will hold the same 
position within the new group

west germanys central bank on 
thursday raised its lombard lending rate to 5 percent in a bid to 
bolster the mark which has lost ground to other major currencies 
in recent weeks 
the lombard rate had stood at 45 percent since nov 6 1987 
the mark has been falling against the us dollar and the 
british pound on foreign exchange markets analysts said the 
bundesbanks decision which is effective friday was aimed at 
supporting the mark and slowing the flow of capital out of west 
germany 
with this measure the bundesbank is taking account of the 
development of market interest rates and tensions in the currency 
market a bundesbank spokesman said 
the lombard rate is the interest rate charged on banks 
shortterm borrowings from the central bank against securities as 
collateral 
the bundesbank left its discount rate unchanged at 3 percent 
which was set june 30 after a hike of 05 percent 
the higher lombard rate effectively lifts the ceiling on money 
market rates giving the bundesbank room to directly tighten money 
market rates further if the mark shows major signs of weakening 
analysts said 
bundesbank president karl otto poehl has said the dollars 
advance against the mark endangers international efforts to adjust 
trade imbalances in the united states japan and west germany 
thursdays announcement follows bundesbank decisions to raise 
the rate on securities repurchase deals for commercial banks 
that rate has been raised three times in the last six weeks by 
25 percent increments to its current 4 percent

drug store giant revco ds inc said 
today it filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 11 
of the federal bankruptcy code 
the filing includes revco ds its parent company anac holding 
co and most of its subsidiary corporations revco said instacare 
pharmacy services is not included in the filing 
boake a sells chairman and chief executive officer said 
revcos 2000 drugstores in 27 states will remain open and the 
companys 28000 employees will continue to be employed 
revco is in business to stay sells said the stores are 
open employees have jobs and are being paid and customers can get 
prescriptions filled as always 
although we had hoped to avoid this filing and restructure our 
finances outside of the courts we had warned of the possibility of 
a voluntary filing for several months events of the last few days 
left us with no viable alternative this is a fight about who owns 
revco not how revco operates sells said 
revco was taken private in a leveraged buyout in late 1986 in a 
leveraged buyout those making the acquisition usually borrow 
heavily against the cash flow or assets of the company being 
acquired 
the bankruptcy filing was necessary because holders of about 
400 million of the companys highyielding bonds demanded 
immediate payment of principal and 46 million in interest that the 
company failed to pay as scheduled june 15 said kathleen obert 
revco spokeswoman 
she said under terms of the subordinated bonds payment of the 
principal is prohibited until the companys debt to senior lenders 
is paid 
revcos total debt is about 15 billion and obert said the 
company filed for bankruptcy to be able to continue company 
operations 
the senior banks are saying you have to give us the debt first 
and the subordinated want it first ms obert said this is not 
a liquidating bankruptcy the stores are open and the normal 
business operations are intact 
the filing allows revco to obtain new credit and invoices for 
goods and services and requires the company to submit a 
reorganization plan restructuring the companys debt to the 
court obert said 
with annual sales of 23 billion and 2000 outlets revco 
operates the nations largest drug store chain filling more than 
65 million prescriptions each year

a deal to recreate mgm and united 
artists as separate movie companies collapsed today just two weeks 
after it was struck because financiers kirk kerkorian and burt 
sugarman couldnt agree on terms 
mgmua communications co controlled by kerkorian was to have 
been split into its original parts in a 400 million deal that 
would have given sugarman and two independent movie producers a 
substantial share of a new metrogoldwynmayer 
two weeks of extensive negotiations have failed to produce a 
definitive agreement said stephen silbert mgmua chairman and 
chief executive officer details of the talks between the two 
financiers who share a fascination with hollywood werent released 
the restructuring which would have left kerkorian in control of 
a new united artists and with a substantial share of the 
resurrected mgm was the latest in a series of shuffles the las 
vegas nev financier has made at the company 
analysts saw it as a means of raising funds to pay down the 
debts of the company which produced the oscarwinning movie 
moonstruck and tvs thirtysomething though much of the new 
money would have come from kerkorian himself 
the complex shuffle announced july 11 was to have been 
accomplished through an offering of rights to mgmua shareholders 
entitling them to buy shares in the new mgm 
sugarman through his barris industries inc which makes the 
dating game tv show was to have bought 25 percent of the new 
stock barris producers jon peters and peter guber would have run 
the new company 
kerkorian and public shareholders of mgmua would have had the 
right to buy the rest of the new issue of 50 million shares at 8 a 
share 
of the 400 million raised 300 million was to have gone back 
into united artists and 100 million to mgm 
the new mgm whose roaring lion trademark associated with such 
classic movies as gone with the wind would have had rights to 
a batch of relatively new movies but the companys original 
3000title library was sold to broadcast entrepreneur ted turner 
and the famed mgm movie lot was sold to lorimartelepictures corp

the reagan administration estimated today that 
the federal deficit for the upcoming budget year would be 1401 
billion 59 billion under the trigger for acrosstheboard 
spending reductions but budget director james miller said too 
large a droughtrelief package could provoke the automatic cuts 
the new deficit estimate covering the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 is 59 billion smaller than the 146 billion level that 
would force cuts to kickin under the grammrudman balanced budget 
law 
but in presenting the estimate miller head of the office of 
management and budget warned that congress must exercise spending 
restraint in granting relief to farmers and in several other areas 
or face the risk of triggering automatic spending cuts 
we cannot do all those things congress has got to pare down 
and make sure it does not go over the limit miller told 
reporters at a white house briefing 
miller warned that droughtrelief and other spending proposals 
pending before congress could push the deficit upward and trigger 
the politically painful spending cuts which would take effect just 
before the november elections 
the droughtrelief measures now being considered in congress are 
estimated to cost 43 billion to 66 billion the administration 
wants to keep the drought package at 4 billion to 5 billion 
the administration is also fighting to hold the spending line on 
other measures currently before congress these include antidrug 
legislation pending trade legislation and a supplemental spending 
bill 
under the grammrudman act the administration is required to 
estimate the coming years fiscal budget deficit by midaugust to 
project whether acrosstheboard spending cuts will take effect 
the white house budget office must then adjust that estimate in 
october to take into account any new legislation 
if such legislation pushes the deficit past the trigger amount 
of 146 billion acrosstheboard spending cuts of more than 10 
billion automatically take effect 
the report today known as a midsession review estimated that 
the deficit in the current fiscal year would be 1523 billion 
this estimate is still more optimistic than those of many private 
forecasters and the congressional budget office which is 
projecting a deficit of 157 billion for the current fiscal year 
the 1987 budget deficit was 1504 billion down from the record 
2211 billion deficit run up in 1986 the sharp reduction last 
year occurred because of a onetime windfall in revenues generated 
by a massive overhaul of the tax law 
the revised deficit estimate for the current fiscal year of 
1523 billion was up from the administrations february estimate 
that the deficit this year would be 1467 billion which would 
have made it lower than the 1987 imbalance 
the administration blamed that higher deficit figure on 
increased government spending in several areas one of the biggest 
overruns occurred in the federal deposit insurance programs that 
protect depositors at banks and savings and loans association 
the budget review said that the insurance funds would pay out 
46 billion more this year than had been originally budgeted 
because of high failure rates at banks and thrift institutions in 
the depressed southwest 
the deficit target under the grammrudman legislation for the 
upcoming fiscal year is 136 billion but the legislation says 
automatic spending cuts can be avoided if the governments deficit 
projection is within 10 billion of that figure thus for 1989 
any estimate below 146 billion would avoid the need for spending 
cuts 
if the cuts did take effect half of the reductions would come 
from the military and half from domestic spending programs 
however 70 percent of the domestic budget including such programs 
as social security has been declared off limits 
thus such programs as aids research and druglaw enforcement 
would feel the brunt of a disproportionate share of any automatic 
spending cut the administration has warned

officials of first republicbank corp said federal 
regulators could decide the fate of the financially troubled bank 
holding company this week but executives dismissed as speculation 
rumors that the bank would be declared insolvent 
the federal deposit insurance corp which rescued first 
republicbank with a 1 billion loan in march said wednesday it was 
considering all options to resolve the companys financial crisis 
an announcement could come friday 
management of first republicbank which had a net loss of 23 
billion in the first six months of the year is competing with 
three outside bidders for control of the institution 
but the fdic could declare the company insolvent and run the 
institution itself until a suitor is selected in a socalled 
bridgebank transaction 
the fdic received final proposals to buy first republicbank on 
monday from citicorp of new york ncnb corp a regional banking 
company based in charlotte nc and san franciscobased wells 
fargo amp co 
first republicbanks management led by chairman albert casey 
submitted a plan to the fdic to remain independent 
in a memo to first republicbank managers wednesday the company 
said it expected an fdic decision by the weekend spokesman joe 
bowles said the memo was prompted by speculation that a bridge 
transaction was imminent 
as the decision time grows near we expect to see more of this 
speculation bowles said 
the fdic would ultimately shoulder close to 2 billion of the 
cost of any deal fdic chairman wiliam seidman has said including 
an initial recapitalization of as much as 5 billion 
creation of a bridge bank would eliminate bondholder and 
shareholder claims and nullify all current lawsuits against first 
republicbank the fdic can control the bridge bank for up to two 
years

meredith corp said thursday its 
earnings fell 194 percent in its fourth quarter from a year ago 
reflecting weaker magazine profits but that profit increased 396 
percent for the full fiscal year in large part because of 
accounting changes 
the diversified media company reported profit in the fourth 
quarter ended june 30 fell to 67 million or 35 cents a share 
from 84 million or 43 cents a share in the same period a year 
earlier 
its revenue rose 232 percent to 1941 million in the quarter 
from 1575 million a year earlier 
meredith chairman robert burnett attributed the reduced earnings 
to declines in the companys magazine and broadcasting operations 
despite gains from real estate ventures and a lower effective 
income tax rate 
weaker magazine profits in the fourth quarter reflect 
substantial increases in paper and postage costs and our march 
acquisition of craftways corp burnett said in a statement 
releasing merediths financial results 
for the entire fiscal year profit rose to 474 million or 
248 a share from 339 million or 177 a share in the 
previous year 
without accounting changes net profit would have been up 77 
percent at 366 million or 191 a share however profits from 
business operations fell 64 percent in the latest fiscal year to 
366 million from 39 million 
burnett attributed the drop in operating earnings in part to 
declines in merediths television broadcasting because of higher 
programming costs and from residential real estate operations 
because of low market values on houses acquired under a government 
relocation contract that no longer is in effect 
earnings benefited from a lower effective income tax rate and 
lower interest expenses 
meredith publishes books and magazines including better homes 
and gardens and has interests in commercial printing television 
and residential real estate marketing and franchising

mcdonnell douglas corp reported thursday that 
its secondquarter earnings fell 275 percent from a year ago 
citing higher aircraft development and production costs and wider 
losses in its information systems segment 
the defense contractor said it earned 704 million or 183 a 
share in the second quarter compared with 971 million or 239 
a share a year earlier

1401 million or 345 a share 
sixmonth revenue rose 23 percent to 672 billion from 657 
billion for the first half of last year

from higher development costs for the us air forces advanced 
tactical fighter competition and the new md11 trijet higher 
production costs in major aircraft programs and increased losses in 
the information systems segment 
it said higher interest expenses were offset in part by lower 
income taxes which declined because of lower tax rates 
the 1987 earnings had been affected by several unusual items 
including a nonrecurring pretax charge of 66 million to cover 
the cost of an early retirement program in addition results for 
mcdonnell douglas information systems co in 1987 included a gain 
of 15 million before taxes from the sale of about half of the 
corporations interest in a computer services company 
the company also said 1987 earnings were positively affected by 
a pretax gain of 38 million from the conversion to longterm 
leases of md80 jetliners previously leased on a shortterm basis 
a similar conversion in the first quarter of 1988 produced a 
pretax gain of 21 million

system400 and the personal system2 and rt system computers 
the most important products are excluded said jay p 
stevens an analysts at the investment firm dean witter reynolds

said wendy abramowitz an analyst with argus research 
analysts said ibms newest products already have the costs built 
into their prices

york international inc reaffirmed on thursday 
its support for an investor groups 750 million buyout offer after 
a competing bidder withdrew its 795 million buyout proposal amid 
government antitrust concerns 
york a heating and airconditioning equipment manufacturer 
said snydergeneral corp a privatelyheld concern based in dallas 
notified york by letter that it was withdrawing its bid 
york said its board had decided it was not in the interest of 
york stockholders to pursue further discussions or negotiations 
with snydergeneral 
instead it reaffirmed its support for a tender offer by a 
subsidairy of the investor group york holdings corp for up to 919 
million shares or 878 percent of yorks shares at 5750 per 
share expires at midnight friday unless extended 
york holdings bid is backed by the venturecapital unit of 
citicorp the huge banking concern 
snydergeneral spokeswoman michelle pavlik said her company had 
no comment and said company president richard snyder was not 
immediately available 
according to york international snydergenerals letter 
withdrawing the buyout offer said the antitrust division of the 
us department of justice raised new concerns late yesterday as 
to product overlap between york and snydergeneral other than 
centrifugal and reciprocating chillers 
if the antitrust division were to require a divestiture with 
respect to this particular product line we would not be willing to 
consummate the acquisition of york the letter said according to 
york 
the letter added that snydergeneral planned to keep talking with 
the justice department and said if we obtain a satisfactory 
resolution as to these new concerns we intend to reinstate our 
offer 
but york subsequently released a statement that said 
particularly in light of recent developments most notably 
snydergenerals lastminute withdrawal of its latest proposal the 
york board reaffirms it support of the york holdings transaction 
scheduled to close tomorrow 
yorks statement indicates the company considers snydergeneral 
out of the picture york spokesman patrick early said 
on wednesday york international said its board failed to meet a 
noon deadline that day to respond to a revised buyout proposal from 
snydergeneral 
snydergeneral had requested consent tuesday to modify its 795 
million proposal under which york shareholders would receive 61 
per share 
the action came after york international announced the justice 
department investigation of whether the proposed merger violated 
antitrust rules 
york international was a unit of borgwarner corp until it was 
spun off and went public two years ago 
snydergeneral is a privately held company that employs about 
4800 people at nine facilities

drought may take a bite out of the income of 
many farmers but the hot dry weather isnt expected to cut back 
on their spending for many production items this year an 
agriculture department report said thursday 
the drought is expected to have little impact on 1988 
expenditures for seed fertilizer and pesticides because most of 
these were applied at or before planting the report said 
farm machinery expenditures are projected to increase again in 
1988 but could be slowed by the drought 
spending on the fuel and electricity needed to run farms will be 
affected significantly by the drought however 
energy expenditures for irrigation will be up but likely will 
be more than offset by decreased outlays for harvesting and 
drying the report said a grim reminder that reduced yields or 
none at all mean it will cost less to run grain combines and 
dryers 
farmers spending on machinery increased 12 billion to 58 
billion in 1987 ending seven years of decline the report said 
net cash income of farmers the difference between gross cash 
receipts and cash expenses rose to a record 56 billion in 
calendar 1987 current usda forecasts put 1988 net cash income at 
53 billion to 59 billion

thousands of migrant workers are stranded in 
the midwest and dont have enough money to return home because the 
drought has robbed them of a living a texas lawmaker said thursday 
in seeking federal assistance 
democratic rep albert bustamante in a letter asking labor 
secretary ann mclaughlin for emergency aid said many migrants are 
in a desperate situation we can no longer continue to ignore 
labor department spokesman bob zachariasiewicz said the agency 
has a plan of action but it wont be unveiled until mrs 
mclaughlin who is overseas gives it her final approval an 
announcement will be made next week 
an administration source said the package would total 4 million 
to 5 million but the final distribution is just not set on 
paper yet the source spoke on condition of anonymity 
in his letter to mrs mclaughlin bustamante said migrant 
workers pinned their hopes on a successful harvest and invested 
their personal savings to search for field work drought conditions 
have dashed their hopes for employment and for recouping their 
financial losses 
because the presidents emergency relief program is directed 
solely at the farmer level migrant workers and their families have 
no safety net to relieve their conditions measures taken to date 
have allowed migrant laborers to fall through cracks 
bustamante a migrant worker for 23 years and the son and

wheat farmers will still have to idle 10 
percent of their base acreage in 1989 to qualify for federal price 
supports despite the severe drought that has hit some producing 
areas this year agriculture secretary richard e lyng announced 
thursday 
lyng who was out of town said in a statement that the 10 
percent acreage reduction for next year was announced on may 25 
under 1985 farm law which requires a determination for the 
following years crop prior to june 1 that was before the drought 
became so widespread and severe 
even though the severe drought has reduced wheat production 
especially that of spring wheat the prospective supplydemand 
balance for the coming year does not call for a change in the 
previously announced wheat acreage reduction program in 1989 
lyng said 
a crop projection issued on july 12 put the 1988 wheat crop at 
184 billion bushels down from 212 billion bushels forecast in 
june the 1987 harvest was about 21 billion bushels 
but us wheat inventories have been large despite a heavy 
export drain and totaled around 127 billion bushels on june 1 
the beginning of the 198889 wheat marketing year the smaller 
harvest will result in a further reduction in the stockpile to 
around 666 million bushels by june 1 1989 according to the 
projections 
earlier the june 1 1989 wheat carryover was forecast at 781 
million bushels 
winter wheat which comprises about threefourths of the us 
total will be planted this fall for harvest next year spring 
wheat including durum used for pasta is produced farther north 
and bore the brunt of this summers drought damage to the wheat 
crop

the white house in a move that could lead to 
a weakening of president reagans new federalism campaign will 
study whether the federal government should act more aggressively 
to supersede some state and local laws an administration official 
said thursday 
that was the upshot of a meeting by president reagans domestic 
policy council which discussed the specific question of whether 
californias proposition 65 foodlabeling requirement hampers 
interstate commerce and thus should be overtaken by federal 
regulation 
its one of the toughest consumeroriented regulations in the 
country requiring warnings on any food products suspected of 
presenting a risk for birth defects or cancer 
during his more than 7 years as president reagan has advocated 
a new federalism policy aimed at relinquishing some of 
washingtons regulatory powers to states and local governments 
an executive order aimed at instituting this policy contains 
language suggesting intervention by washington under certain 
circumstances however 
an administration official said no decision was reached at 
thursdays meeting on whether to interfere with state and local 
laws and regulations requiring warnings on food packages 
instead this official said a white house working group was set 
up to consider the matter this group would include representatives 
of such agencies as the agriculture department the department of 
health and human services and the food and drug administration 
the official discussing the meeting on grounds of anonymity 
said the central question before the interagency working group is 
when and under what circumstances the federal government should act 
if it concludes that a state or local regulation harms interstate 
commerce 
among other things the study group will try to determine 
whether proposition 65 enacted by voters in 1986 duplicates or 
conflicts with the federal food and drug act 
food industry officials who have criticized the state standards 
as unnecessary and costly and they hailed the action as a victory 
we think this is the formal beginning of a major policy 
review said jeffrey nedelman vice president for public affairs 
for the grocery manufacturers association we think we have a 
crazy situation on our hands and before it gets really crazy the 
government is going to take a real look at the problem 
but environmental advocates in california condemned the 
councils decision 
this is a clear industryorchestrated sneak attack directly on 
proposition 65 said david roe an attorney for the environmental 
defense fund and a principal author of the california initiative 
the proposition the safe drinking water and toxic enforcement 
act of 1986 requires that companies give california consumers a 
clear and reasonable warning if a product contains a chemical 
that poses a significant risk to their health 
a variety of industries including gasoline service stations 
convenience stores and chemical plants have posted warnings about 
the presence of chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects 
the state however has granted a temporary exemption from the 
warning requirements for food products drugs and cosmetics that 
already meet existing federal and state safety standards 
the state will analyze more than 50 chemicals that could be 
found in these products during the next two years to determine 
whether warnings should be required under proposition 65 
food industry officials contend none of their products pose a 
danger to consumers 
but they say they fear proposition 65 may lead to putting 
warning labels on food packages to alert consumers to the presence 
of lead arsenic or benzene substances that are present in minute 
quantities in many common products

the two broadest measures of the nations money 
supply moved in opposite directions during the week ended july 20 
the federal reserve board reported thursday 
the fed said the measure known as m2 fell to a seasonally 
adjusted 30236 billion in the week ended july 20 from 30274 
billion the previous week 
an even broader measure m3 increased to a seasonally adjusted 
38198 billion from 38174 billion 
the narrowest measure of the money supply m1 fell to a 
seasonally adjusted 7814 billion from 7845 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
in judging its monetary policy the fed has indicated it is 
monitoring the value of the dollar commodity prices and the 
difference between short and longterm interest rates it also has 
shifted its attention from m1 to the two broader money supply 
measures 
the fed said in mid 1988 that it reaffirmed its target for 
annual growth in m2 and m3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent 
which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 55 percent to 85 
percent the fed has not set a specific target range for m1 since 
early 1987

chrysler corp reported thursday that its 
secondquarter earnings slid 245 percent compared with a year ago 
and analysts said buyer incentive programs may have compressed 
results more than the company expected 
the nations no 3 automaker said it earned 3204 million or 
145 per share in the three months ended june 30 compared with 
4241 million or 198 per share in the second quarter of 1987 
the depressed profits due to rebate and incentives programs were 
a shortterm sacrifice to boost market share and improve the 
companys longterm competitiveness chrysler chairman lee iacocca 
said 
that game plan led to brisk sales which should strengthen 
chryslers standing in the marketplace iacocca said 
you get a conquest first time buyer into your stable and 
hopefully you keep him explained joseph phillippi auto analyst 
with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the results came on sales of nearly 85 billion in the second 
quarter up 328 percent from 64 billion in the same period a 
year ago 
the profit margins were very poor considering the level of 
business they did in the quarter said analyst dave healy of 
drexel burnham lambert of new york they have been pushing 
heavily with incentives and the market shares gone up but the 
results show the effect of it 
they were a little bit under where they were going to come in 
under the forecast phillippi said the principal reason 
essentially as i read the number was average yields per unit were 
down a little bit and that reflects fleet sales the cost of 
rebates and incentives it was essentially the incentives 
chryslers 207 percent share of the us truck market was up 
nearly two percentage points from the second quarter of 1987 the 
company said 
through june chryslers combined us car and truck retail 
sales were up 16 percent from the same period of 1987 
were going after a bigger base of loyal customers because 
thats what it takes to succeed over the long haul iacocca said 
for the first half of the year chryslers net earnings totaled 
5041 million or 227 per share down from 6935 million or 
322 per share 
the first half results include a 931 million charge for 
previously announced plant closings in the acustar inc subsidiary 
firsthalf sales rose 306 percent to 1616 billion from 1244 
billion a year earlier 
during the second quarter the nations no 3 automaker 
continued to hold the line on 1988 model prices with 42 percent of 
the passenger cars it sells tagged below 1987 prices 
thats paid off for us in higher market share but were 
caught in a classic case of margin squeeze and we cant rely on 
that strategy forever iacocca said 
we have seen that the incentives in terms of rebates have 
been coming steadily down for about six months phillippi said 
the basic game plan i think in a sense among the executives at 
the three large companies is to launch the new models without any 
meaningful incentives 
on wednesday chrysler announced a small price increase on the 
colt gt for 1989 but said it would lower prices on two other colt 
models 
chrysler financial corp chryslers credit arm made record 
earnings on the increased sales volume reporting profits of 61 
million for the second quarter of 1988 and 126 million for the 
first six months of the year the subsidiary announced today 
the results eclipse the previous quarterly high of 56 million 
set in the second quarter of 1987 and a sixmonth earnings record 
of 117 million also set a year ago a company statement said 
on wednesday no 2 ford motor co reported an auto industry 
record second quarter earning 166 billion up from 150 billion 
in the second quarter of 1987 general motors corp the worlds 
largest manufacturer last week reported its secondquarter 
earnings 15 billion compared with 117 billion in the 
comparable period of 1987

corn and sugar futures prices fell sharply thursday in trading 
that analysts said was inspired by technical conditions and had 
little to do with fundamental supplyanddemand factors 
most wheat and soybean futures also slipped lower on the chicago 
board of trade and coffee futures joined sugar in falling for a 
third straight day on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa exchange 
on other markets precious metals were lower cattle were up 
while pork futures plunged and energy futures were mixed 
thursday marked the fifth consecutive day of falling corn 
futures prices and the ninth straight daily drop in the price for 
august delivery of soybeans 
but in a departure from the past three months the weather had 
little impact on the markets analysts said 
instead they said corn traders were watching their markets 
open interest a rough measure of the number of speculators who 
have in effect placed their bets but not collected their 
winnings 
open interest has been running at an unusually high level in the 
corn market and stood at more than 244000 contracts when the 
market opened thursday 
the majority of the open interest was believed to represent 
long positions or wagers that prices would rise since prices 
have been falling some players feared that many holders of those 
long positions were preparing to sell and either cut their losses 
or settle for only a slight profit 
a sudden massive selloff would cause prices to plummet and 
some traders tried to beat the rush by selling ahead of it which 
caused corn prices to fall sharply anyway 
the selling sentiment spread to the neighboring wheat and 
soybean pits causing prices to fall in those markets too said 
walter spilka an analyst in new york with smith barney harris 
upham amp co 
the national weather services latest 6to10day forecast 
calling for normal rainfall next week in the droughtstricken 
midwest was bearish but it was not a major factor in thursdays 
action spilka said 
i think weather forecasts are maybe contributing about half 
the influence right now and i think nearterm forecasts are more 
important than the 6to10days he said 
wheat settled 4 cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in september at 357 a bushel corn was 14 cents lower 
to 2 cents higher with september at 265 a bushel oats were 3 
cents lower to 7 cents higher with september at 256 a bushel 
and soybeans were 12 cents lower to 15 cents higher with august at 
741 a bushel 
the situation was similar in the sugar market which ignored the 
bullish news of new sugar purchases by china and plummeted to its 
lowest level in about a month 
this was a technically driven selloff said judith ganes 
sugar analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
sugar futures have been extremely strong and stood at 6year 
highs on monday ms ganes said the market fundamentals remained 
bullish and that the nearly 3cent plunge over three days just 
gives you better bargains 
sugar for october delivery settled 53 cent lower at 1082 cents 
a pound 
coffee futures continued their technicallydriven decline with 
the september contract settling 26 cent lower at 12379 a pound 
the continuing decline in the grain markets forced some 
speculators with additional holdings in silver and platinum futures 
to take profits in the metals markets so they could meet their 
financial obligations in the grain markets said bette raptopoulos 
an analyst in new york with prudentialbache securities inc 
gold was more stable in its traditional role as a safe haven 
for investment dollars she said 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 70 cents to 1 
lower with august at 43250 a troy ounce silver was 258 cents to 
296 cents lower with august at 6707 a troy ounce 
hog and porkbelly futures fell their respective daily limits of 
150 cents and 2 cents a pound on the chicago mercantile exchange 
because theres too much supply and not enough demand period 
said chuck levitt an analyst in chicago with shearson lehman 
hutton inc 
cattle futures followed the grains to a mixed close levitt said 
live cattle were 87 cent lower to 33 cent higher with august 
at 6642 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower to 93 
cent higher with august at 7975 cents a pound hogs were 112 
cents to 150 cents lower with august at 4387 cents a pound and 
frozen pork bellies were 132 cents to 2 cents lower with august at 
3095 cents a pound 
crude oil prices were little changed in quiet trading on the new 
york mercantile exchange as traders waited for an upcoming opec 
committee meeting 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 1 cent to 2 cents lower 
with september at 1615 a barrel heating oil was 23 cent to 69 
cent lower with august at 4434 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 11 cent lower to 115 cents higher with august at 5195 cents

both houses of congress overwhelmingly 
approved some 6 billion in aid for droughtstricken farmers 
thursday after scaling back provisions for special assistance to 
milk producers and ethanol fuel makers 
hold on help is coming in a sensible rational compassionate 
way agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza 
dtexas said as the house gave 36829 approval to its version of 
the bill 
within hours the senate approved 940 a similar bill but only 
after peppering it with scores of complex changes that may not be 
untangled before a housesenate conference committee next week at 
which lawmakers plan to fashion the final version 
congressional leaders aim to send the final product to president 
reagans desk by aug 11 
the house had come under fire over a provision that would have 
increased on oct 1 the pricesupport level for milk to 1110 for 
each 100 pounds it would raise consumer costs by a few cents a 
gallon at most and cost the government 145 million by 
congressional estimate the agriculture department put the price 
tag at 300 million 
both the house and senate versions would cancel a 50cent 
pricesupport cut set for jan 1 and the plan to actually increase 
the level was denounced by agriculture secretary richard e lyng as 
well as an array of business and farm groups that often are allies 
of the dairy industry on such matters 
this is a most dangerous and wrongheaded precedent said 
rep pat roberts rkan he scoffed at claims that dairymen need 
the price increase to offset the increased cost of feed resulting 
from the drought saying cattle and sheep ranchers and poultry 
producers are not getting anything similar in the way of a subsidy 
the house moved to deflect criticism adopting a compromise 
version sponsored by reps steve gunderson rwis and tim penny 
dminn it would go ahead with the increase but only for april 
through june next year supporters said it would knock 30 million 
off the price tag 
in the senate sen tom daschle dsd scaled back his plan to 
allow us ethanol fuel makers to buy up to 2 million bushels each 
every month of government surplus corn ethanol is a fuel based 
partly on alcohol produced from corn and other commodities 
under daschles plan ethanol makers would be able to purchase 
the corn at 110 percent of the governments acquisition price much 
of the corn in agriculture department bins now was acquired long 
before the drought sent crop prices skyrocketing 
the south dakotan said he designed the provision to help small 
ethanol makers but it could represent a substantial benefit for 
the the archer daniels midland co the large decatur ill corn 
processing company that makes the lions share of us ethanol 
in any case daschle won voice vote approval of an alteration 
that would terminate the program next sept 1 and limit the total 
use of corn in the program to 16 million bushels a month 
basic provisions of the bill would provide payments to 
droughtstricken farmers equal to 65 percent of their lost earnings 
above 35 percent of anticipated harvest they also would expand and 
streamline government feed programs for dairy and livestock 
producers 
lawmakers have been struggling to keep their plan within tight 
budgetary limits and there has been concern about the possibility 
of excess spending within the bill 
rep bob walker rpa took to the house floor to denounce a 
55 million project to control temperatures in the sacremento 
river near shasta dam and thus aid salmon spawning as this pork 
garbage 
de la garza defended the measure sponsored by rep george 
miller dcalif as one that would help to provide an adequate 
food supply to american consumers he said the measure was not 
merely to help farmers but to make certain that there was enough to 
eat on the grocery shelf 
the house also approved a de la garza amendment that would bring 
the cost estimate for the bill to 58 billion down from 69 
billion at the start of the day most of the decrease was accounted 
for by new limits on a program under which the government could pay 
half the cost of seeding burned out pastures 
the measure sponsored by rep claude harris dala was 
harnessed to the bill when the agriculture committee was racing to 
wrap up work and later estimated to have a 12 billion cost 
de la garzas amendment reduced the overall cost of the bill by 
shrinking the seeding provision 
even then house speaker jim wright dtexas acknowledged 
thursday morning that there was no way to be perfectly sure of 
exactly how much the drought bill would cost farm lawmakers have 
been saying that fiscal watchdogs worried about the spending level 
have nothing to complain about because it would be less than 
federal savings realized because of the drought 
but wright said there was no certainty 
the art of economics is not a precise one wright said

du pont co a major producer of 
chemicals that are destroying the earths protective ozone shield 
said thursday its plans were underway to begin producing 
alternatives to the chemicals by this fall 
the company will modify an existing facility in montague mich 
to produce alternatives to fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons 
or cfcs by as early as october 
cfcs are nontoxic nonflammable compounds that du pont helped 
develop in the 1930s they are widely used as refrigeration fluids 
cleaning solvents plastic form blowing agents and outside the 
united states as aerosol propellants 
du pont announced last march that it planned to move away from 
the production of cfcs in the next 12 years 
the alternatives to be used as blowing agents for a variety of 
insulation and cushioning applications could be commercialized in 
five years said company spokeswoman kathleen forte first the 
chemicals hcfc141b and hcfc142b must be tested to ensure they 
are not toxic 
the ozone depletion rate of the new compounds is more than 95 
percent less than existing compounds forte said 
hcfc141b is being evalutated as a replacement to cfcs used as 
insulating materials in refrigerators refrigerated trucks and rail 
cars homes and buildings and as cushioning for automobile seats 
furniture and bedding 
hcfc142b is being tested in the manufacturing of polystyrene 
insulation and polyolefin insulation and packaging 
the plant will be one of three producing cfc alternatives 
while our ultimate goal is to develop and commercialize 
nonozone depleting products we will continue to search for 
interim alternatives that will enable us to reduce dependence on 
fully halogenated cfcs in a stepwise fashion said joseph p 
glas director of du ponts freon products division 
about 23 billion pounds of cfc compounds are made worldwide 
each year with more than 2000 du pont employees producing about 
25 percent of the total the company says it gets 600 million 
annually from cfc sales about 2 percent of its total sales revenue 
last fall in montreal major producers agreed on a treaty now 
signed by 31 nations but ratified only by the united states and 
mexico agreeing to cut cfc production 20 percent in 1992 and 
another 30 percent in 1998
