a subway car derailment that killed three 
people and injured 162 may have been triggered by a dragging motor 
that hit a track switch federal investigators said thursday 
the altered switch may have sent the last three cars in the 
sixcar train onto another set of tracks wednesday causing one car 
to be yanked into steel support beams said john k lauber of the 
national transportation safety board evidence indicated the motor 
dropped when a nut came loose lauber said adding that 
investigators were told that subway motors had dropped from their 
supports three times in the last 15 years most recently just a 
month ago 
that probably resulted in the pivoting of the motor under the 
car and that probably was the initiation of the accident he 
said 
a 37block section of west philadelphias 128mile subway and 
elevated train line a major commuter artery in the nations 
fifthlargest city remained closed thursday as federal 
investigators made their final inspection of the wreckage 
extra buses were pressed into service to handle some of the 
100000 people who typically ride the line twice a day 
the accident was the worst in the 21 years the commuter system 
has been operated by the southeastern pennsylvania transportation 
authority many of the cars on the line are 20 years old but all 
six on the train in the accident had been renovated in the last 
eight years septa said 
all three of the dead were among seven passengers trapped in the 
wreckage after three support beams tore into one car authorities 
said of the 162 people treated at 10 hospitals 16 remained 
hospitalized thursday two were in critical or serious condition 
the city medical examiners office identified two of the dead as 
denise devlin 34 and gospodin kanchev 52 both of philadelphia 
the third victim a 60yearold woman who died after her leg was 
amputated in an effort to free her from the wreckage remained 
unidentified 
the motor which was under the third car hit a crossover switch 
about 1500 feet after coming loose lauber said 
the philadelphia inquirer reported that problems with the bolts 
breaking led septa employees to brace the motors with bars 
harry knittel business agent with the transport workers union 
said the car with the suspect motor had been inspected once a month 
for at least the past 12 months and the last inspection had been 
feb 1 
theres only so much welding and repairs that 30yearold 
frames can take he told the news 
septa has ordered inspections of all older subway cars which 
date from the early 1960s 
ntsb investigators documented damage to cars and tracks made 
diagrams of seats examined training maintenance and operations 
records interviewed survivors and studied blueprints of the cars 
lauder said 
our people are underneath the car he said theyre 
crawling all over the car theyve been crawling underneath and 
around the sides and all over weve also been collecting bits and 
pieces from along the entire accident scene 
the ntsb gave septa permission to finish clearing the shattered 
glass and twisted metal left from the wreck 
septa put an extra 120 buses into service to deal with the 
service shutdown which also affected underground sections of a 
subwaysurface streetcar system 
subway support columns dating to about 1907 will be repaired if 
necessary septa said but lauder said there were no indications 
the beams had been damaged 
the ntsb has no regulatory powers but determines the probable 
cause of about 3000 plane crashes and other transportation 
accidents annually it recommends preventive steps to government 
agencies and industry

the wife of a death row inmate is suing for a 
conjugal visit or artificial insemination by her husband so he can 
give back a life before his own is taken 
i would like to visit my husband in private so that we can 
conceive a child the way god intended lisa petrocelli said in a

my husband is being punished but that does not make it right 
to punish me and my baby said mrs petrocelli 26 we are 
running out of time i want to have this baby and i do not think 
god would think it is wrong to bring a new baby into the world 
the nevada prison system has no intention of allowing conjugal 
visits which would require special rooms and supervision said 
prison spokesman glen whorton 
were not planning on developing any kind of artificial 
insemination program either he said 
carter king the couples attorney called it cruel and unusual 
punishment to prevent petrocelli from fathering a child 
the best thing he can possibly do now is give back a life 
king said he took a life and this allows him to give one back to 
the world

killed in an argument over the cars price petrocelli has 
exhausted his state appeals and his case is before a federal judge 
robert dulin a paralegal working on the case with king said he 
doesnt believe either of the petrocellis has any children 
just because her husband has committed a crime and is on death 
row paying for it doesnt mean his wouldbe children should 
suffer dulin said she just wants to have his baby to carry on 
his name 
nevada has 51 men and one woman who face death by lethal 
injection four men have been executed in nevada since the supreme 
court allowed states to resume use of the death penalty in 1976

a ruptured hose spilled five gallons 
of hydraulic fluid inside shuttle atlantis and caused a brief drop 
in pressure just before landing but the astronauts were never in 
danger nasa says 
nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said wednesday the damaged hose 
will be analyzed to determine what caused the problem 
atlantis was returning on sunday from a secret military mission 
to deploy a spy satellite when mission control announced an 
indicator light was on warning of a pressure drop in the hydraulic 
system that controls flaps and steering 
a few minutes after the 940 am pst announcement nasa 
reported pressure had been restored the shuttle landed smoothly at 
1008 pm neither of atlantis two backup hydraulic systems was 
used the space agency said 
we dont think it was any threat at all based on the 
information we had at the descent nasa spokesman bruce 
buckingham said 
because of a pentagonimposed blackout surrounding the 4day 
mission the hose may have ruptured before the problem became 
public malone said the blackout was lifted 1 hours before 
touchdown at edwards air force base calif 
it wasnt announced until reentry she said it could 
have happened on the mission or on the way up 
a thin coating of hydraulic fluid was found throughout the aft 
engine compartment malone said engineers discovered a 1inch 
split in a 3footlong highpressure hose for one of the shuttles 
three auxiliary power units 
technicians on wednesday removed the rubbercoated stainless 
steel hose and sent it for analysis to rockwell international in 
downey calif malone said the company builds the orbiters but 
contracts out work involving the hoses 
if the problem had existed and been detected before liftoff 
nasa would have delayed the mission until the hose was repaired or 
replaced malone said 
malone said she was not aware of a hydraulic line rupturing 
during any previous mission 
removal of the hose will not affect the shuttles piggyback jet 
ride from edwards back to kennedy space center malone said 
a modified boeing 747 is scheduled to transport atlantis on 
saturday the trip including stopovers for refueling is expected 
to take about nine hours

in a shabby icecold meeting room behind 
a village store deep in the farmlands of southern poland 150 
people burst into patriotic song in german 
the sound is chilling to poles with vivid memories of the 
brutality of nazi occupiers and a history of partition by foreign 
powers 
but it is encouraged by the solidarityled government which is 
committed to recognizing polands ethnic diversity after decades of 
repression 
weve been negated for a long time we didnt exist we had 
to save ourselves says jan krol founder of the newly registered 
german cultural society he was in his 20s when his native gogolin 
became part of poland 
yet just as polands german minority is being acknowledged the 
debate over guaranteeing polands western border prior to german 
reunification is again stirring tensions between two nationalities 
that have often in their histories fought bloody battles over land 
with the assent of the other world war ii allies stalin created 
postwar polands western third from lands seized from the defeated 
nazis compensation for an even larger swath the soviets took from 
eastern poland 
millions of ethnic german nationals were expelled 14 million 
from the silesian region that includes gogolin and the acquired 
territory was resettled by the poles uprooted from the east 
communist governments in warsaw refused to acknowledge that 
hundreds of thousands of ethnic germans still lived in poland 
their secret police and vigorous discrimination worked to prevent 
any manifestation of german identity 
but under the redtile roofs of silesia german is spoken to 
this day and in some west german political circles these lands 
are still considered german 
west german chancellor helmut kohls reluctance to unequivocally 
renounce claims to silesia and commit a united germany to its 
current polish border along the oder and neisse rivers has strained 
relations with poland 
just five months ago kohl made a longplanned conciliatory 
visit to poland and prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki assured kohl 
that poland was committed to helping its german minority maintain 
its heritage 
four times since 1985 attempts by krol to register his cultural 
society had been rejected on feb 16 it was officially registered 
now the sitting room of his modest house without a telephone 
like most in this tiny hamlet is a beehive of activities to 
organize the estimated 300000 to 400000 ethnic german silesians 
we are facing a difficult task to get back what was taken away 
in 1945 our culture or language we are going to strive for 
that fight for that said the whitehaired raspyvoiced krol in 
an interview frequently interrupted by germanspeaking visitors 
bringing petitions 
when krols son henryk tried to become the only ethnic german 
to gain election to parliament there was an outburst of 
antigerman nationalism grafitti went up saying germans go 
home 
henryk lost the february byelection 
some poles are sympathetic to the german minoritys desire to 
practice its traditions but many are not suspecting aspirations 
are harbored for parts of poland to become german again 
we are willing to grant full rights to persons or groups of 
authentic german descent who profess their allegiance to german as 
their native tongue and to german tradition solidaritys jerzy 
wuttke chairman of parliaments ethnic minorities commission told 
tygodnik solidarnosc 
we will make sure however that those rights will not be 
abused to harm polands national interest he said 
poles who lost 6 million people during world war ii say it is 
unsettling to see banners proclaiming helmut you are our 
chancellor too greeting kohl some wonder if it is the better 
economic situation in germany that moves some ethnic germans to 
profess such allegiance 
when mostly older ethnic germans gathered late one recent 
afternoon in gogolin to organize their ranks they started by 
singing of heimat the homeland 
this is heimat its ours said the elder krol we 
were born here it is our home our family is here 
the krols and their neighbors say they hope their efforts will 
maintain a german presence in the region 
the younger people are waiting and watching to see what will 
happen now if it will be positive they have their suitcases 
packed said hubert materla who returned to gogolin in 1946 
after being released from an american prisonerofwar camp 
he said the secret police harassed him for speaking german and 
that of 16 people who tried to organize an ethnic german group in 
the early 1980s only he remains in poland 
for the krols materla and others in the community german 
reunification means the elimination of one border east germanys 
now crossed to visit the many including 70 percent of the krol 
family who have already left 
without expressing desire for change the krols stop short of 
affirming polands current territory 
very often i am asked like chancellor kohl about recognition 
of the oderneisse border said the younger krol the issue is 
very simple the border does exist today it would be difficult 
to imagine a similar resettlement of people it seems there is 
no other way he said 
added his father the hopes for any kind of border change are 
very small 
instead they say they seek german teachers for their schools 
there are many young people who speak polish but have german 
hearts said henryk krol a 41yearold veternarian who considers 
his german like a 5yearolds 
and they want to win representation in may elections for local 
governments villages that are 90 percent german dot the region

the midday sun seems about to burn 
holes in the streets of the capital the dryseason wind blows dust 
against stillbright election slogans painted in yellow on curbs 
and daubed red and blue on the sides of dilapidated buildings 
the feb 25 election spelled the defeat of nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government if all goes as planned power will be 
transferred next month to a largely conservative opposition 
coalition which says it will use freemarket tactics to rescue the 
country from economic collapse 
the task will be a mighty one each side in the election had its 
own view of nicaraguas future but they agree about the grimness 
of its present a largely agrarian potentially prosperous nation 
where war inflation and unemployment have brought many close to 
despair

those streets now see only a trickle of people walking past 
boardedup buildings and vacant lots filled with scrub

families live in the downtown now pigs and chickens wandering 
in crude courtyards beside their shacks within sight of a 
modernistic new convention center one of downtowns few

inside a crumbling downtown building that somehow survived the 
quake a sandinistaorganized collective works busily women 
hunched over sewing machines 
the sandinistas built collectives throughout the country 
calling them an answer to capitalist exploitation of workers they 
also built schools and health clinics and told workers that they 
were finally masters of their country 
a slogan painted on a cracked outside panel of the sewing 
collectives building reads we are free now we will never be

although us aid and honduran 
hospitality toward them have all but run out contra rebels are 
defiant and even menacing toward their sandinista archenemies 
reluctance to demobilize promptly as has been called for by 
all five regional presidents and the outgoing and incoming 
nicaraguan administrations may jeopardize a peaceful transition 
of power in nicaragua on april 25 
were not going to put down our guns until the peoples will 
expressed feb 25 is respected if the sandinistas try to continue 
to run things it wont only be us fighting them but the 55 
percent of the nation that rejected their totalitarian project 
said a soldier who uses the pseudonym comandante wilmer 
the 27yearold veteran of nine years of counterrevolutionary 
war was loath to put down his ak47 assault rifle for even a 
moment he grasped it by the barrel the wooden stock leaning on a 
log throughout an interview at contra command headquarters in 
yamales 85 miles east of tegucigalpa 
the sprawling camp of shacks of bamboo black plastic sheeting 
and us government issue ponchos is home to about 10000 rebels 
and 42000 dependents most have spent the better part of the last 
two years here since washington suspended military aid 
the army that tried to topple nicaraguas sandinista government 
was sustained for years by us aid 30000 people died in the war 
they waged and ended up losing at least in the field 
some nonlethal aid remains in the pipeline according to contra 
estimates it is enough to keep them in food clothing fuel and 
medicine for seven weeks or just past violeta barrios de 
chamorros inauguration 
wilmer spent several months of last year inside nicaragua 
leading rebel forces despite a ceasefire and the end of military 
aid he said he did not return to yamales until feb 25 the day an 
opposition coalition of 14 parties routed the incumbent leftists in 
presidential and legislative elections 
weve seen daniel ortegas demagogic politics for 10 years so 
its not enough for us that he says hell respect the peoples 
will especially when with his other face hes distributing weapons 
to provoke civil war in nicaragua wilmer said 
the sandinistas insist on contra demobilization and say they 
will not transfer control of the army and interior ministry 
security forces until that happens 
contra commanders just as adamantly insist they wont disarm or 
demobilize until after all powers are transferred to a new 
government they accuse the leftist regime of intending to retain 
power by clinging to military power 
a statement by oscar sovalbarro chief of a contra team 
discussing demobilization came only hours after ortega made a 
vehement defense of the popular sandinista army as the army is 
known ortega said attempts to reform it much less abolish it 
would unleash a national war 
sovalbarro and israel galeano the top contra commander met 
this week in tegucigalpa the honduran capital with jaime cuadra 
mrs chamorros representative 
cuadra described the talks as preliminary asked about a 
specific plan for demobilization and a deadline he said there 
is no plan and no established deadline 
wilmer said the contras are still ready to fight if need be 
were guerrillas said wilmer before we were more like a 
conventional army now our logistical resources are limited but we 
are a nationalist and popular army that arose from the 
peasantfarming sector we have our social and logistical base 
inside nicaragua and if needs be we will operate from inside 
without outside help 
the contras maintain perhaps 3000 fighters inside nicaragua 
and visits to the nicaraguan countryside before last months 
elections found strong support for the contras in several provinces 
our morale is high especially after dona violetas victory 
said contra fighter noel lopez 22 who said he has been fighting 
since he was 13 the campesino once he decides on something 
keeps with it until the end 
if war resumes the contras might stand a fighting chance 
against a sandinista army demoralized by electoral defeat and 
weakened by desertions that began only days after the election 
even so doubts remain about the combat readiness and will of 
many at yamales most have spent the past two years nearly idle 
with occasional drills the wives of many are here and many have 
had children 
whether they could resume a life of extreme privation forced 
marches bad food exposure to inclement weather and mortal danger 
is uncertain

the five fendi sisters have tried to save 
their skins just as animal rights activists threatened to make 
them extinct 
the fendi claim to fame as the most innovative elegant furriers 
on the market was about to put them at the head of the 
conservationists wanted list 
they are still using fur but in coats shown wednesday night it 
was used as lining instead of as an outright fashion statement 
the styles too were less elaborate with many downcoats 
parkas and shearlings 
karl lagerfeld the creative genius behind the fendi label 
indulged in what he termed organized confusion dying leather 
in bright shades working it into chamois as soft as silk or 
stuffing it with silk for a down effect 
he also worked over sheepskin detailing it with velvet strands 
folk braiding or panels of tuscan tapestry 
meanwhile inside the coat lurked plush mink or sable out of 
view of animal rights activists who have mounted a campaign to stop 
the use of animal skins in garments 
the opening of a fendi megastore on new yorks fashionable 
fifth avenue this past fall risked being a flop when protesters 
walked out front shouting antifur slogans 
the campaign could hurt the multimilliondollar fendi fashion 
empire which is famous for its furs but even more renowned for 
its leather goods 
but at the end of wednesdays show presented in an elegant 
renaissance palace in downtown milan there was much praise for the 
move from showy furs to discretion 
in the past decade fendi designed by lagerfeld has also become 
one of the top labels of italian readytowear 
the new fallwinter 199091 collection presented during the fur 
show was short and sexy with lots of demure coat dresses cute wool 
skating skirts and ribbed wool miniskirts often worn over thick 
wool tights and leg warmers 
to go under the sportier jackets fendi presented skintight 
stretch jeans with bright velvet braiding often coupled with 
thighhigh supersoft suede boots

a jury convicted a man of murder and kidnapping 
late wednesday in the shotgun slaying of a preschool teacher a 
case linked to the mail bomb assassinations of a federal judge and 
a lawyer 
defendant emmanuel hammond 24 of marietta bowed his head when 
the verdict was announced in fulton county superior court but 
otherwise showed no emotion 
the jury reached its verdict around 1115 pm about eight 
hours after deliberations began 
the prosecution plans to ask for the death penalty judge ralph 
hicks said the trials sentencing phase would begin thursday 
morning 
in addition to felony and malice murder and kidnapping hammond 
was found guilty of armed robbery in the slaying of preschool 
fitness teacher julie love 
miss love 27 disappeared in july 1988 and was the subject of 
a highly publicized search until her body was found in a northeast 
atlanta dumping ground last august she had been shot in the head 
a letter from a group claiming responsibility for the mail bomb 
deaths last december of 11th us circuit court of appeals judge 
robert vance in mountain brook ala and savannah attorney robert 
robinson said the attacks were motivated by outrage over miss 
loves slaying 
the letter signed by americans for a competent federal judicial 
system threatened more violence if any other white women were 
attacked by black men in alabama florida or georgia miss love was 
white hammond is black 
bombs were also intercepted at the 11th us circuit courthouse 
in atlanta and the jacksonville fla chapter of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people 
testimony in hammonds trial began last week under heavy 
security because of concern over the mailbomb link a death threat 
from a group called the aryan resistance movement apparently 
unrelated to the bombings prompted even tighter security later 
in closing arguments wednesday assistant district attorney 
william l hawthorne iii urged jurors to convict hammond saying 
give the devil his due 
he said there would be more violence if hammond were acquitted 
as sure as i stand here before you there will be another 
victim hawthorne said you just dont know her name yet 
defense attorney william a wehunt said in his closing statement 
that hammond was innocent 
wehunt charged that hammonds two chief accusers former 
girlfriend janice weldon and hammond cousin maurice porter killed 
miss love and were trying to frame his client 
porter pleaded guilty to murder armed robbery and rape in the 
death of miss love and is awaiting sentencing 
he testified last week that hammond abducted miss love from an 
atlanta street after her car ran out of gas and dragged her into 
some bushes before shooting her to death 
miss weldon who led police to miss loves body also testified 
against hammond

treasures are displayed at buckingham palace

visitors can view a lock of french emperor napoleon bonapartes 
hair a watercolor of balmoral royal estate by prince charles and

of haze of wonder as papa was crowned at least i thought so 
wrote the princess 
elizabeth her sister princess margaret and their widowed 
grandmother queen mary had a grandstand view of the ceremony from a 
royal box in the abbey where elizabeth herself would be crowned in 
1953 
what struck me as being rather odd was that grannie did not 
remember much of her own coronation i should have thought that it 
would have stayed in her mind forever princess elizabeth wrote 
however toward the end the child found the service becoming 
rather boring as it was all prayers 
grannie and i were looking to see how many more pages to the 
end and we turned one more and then i pointed to the word at the 
bottom of the page and it said finis we both smiled at each 
other and turned back to the service she wrote 
the princess was probably asked by her tutor to record her 
impressions of the coronation said oliver everett director of 
the royal library at windsor castle the favorite royal residence 
21 miles west of london 
everett a former diplomat selected the essay and 270 other 
items for the exhibition 
the library is closed to the public but the queen takes her 
guests there as the castle is being rewired and repaired guests 
cannot be shown round so we took the opportunity to send some 
interesting things to the gallery everett said in an interview 
at wednesdays preview 
even the prophetic thoughts of king george iii after the british 
defeat by the american colonists in 1781 are displayed america 
is lost must we fall beneath this blow he wrote 
but he was consoled by the thought that it is to be hoped we 
shall reap more advantages from their trade as friends than ever we 
could derive from them as colonies

champion said that although the rats appear to be friendly 
residents are concerned they may bite children and the council is 
search for a way to get rid of the animals the risk of disease 
also is a concern he said 
champion said poisoning cannot be considered because of the 
danger it poses to humans and small animals

the united states and the soviet union are 
moving toward a major increase in scheduled and charter air 
service opening for the first time a wide array of destinations in 
each nation 
the development represents one more signal of closer relations 
between the two superpowers and opens a potential opportunity for 
us commercial air carriers 
clearly it would appear that the market is going to increase 
more rapidly in the future said pamela hanlon a spokeswoman for 
pan american world airways now the only us carrier that flies 
into the soviet union 
potentially its an excellent market she said 
if the tentative agreement reached in london last week bears 
fruit it would normalize and greatly expand air service disrupted 
a decade ago as the united states imposed sanctions to retaliate 
against the 1979 soviet invasion of afghanistan and the 1981 
sovietencouraged crackdown against dissidents in poland 
under the preliminary agreement us airlines would increase 
scheduled service to moscow and leningrad and gain new rights to 
serve six additional soviet cities including two in the soviet far 
east according to the state department 
a department official said wednesday these cities include kiev 
the capital of the ukraine riga the capital of latvia minsk the 
capital of byelorussia tbilsi the capital of soviet georgia and 
khabarovsk and magadan in the soviet far east khabarovsk is a 
station on the trans siberian railroad north of vladivostok 
magadan is a port on the sea of okhotsk which opens to the pacific 
in return the soviet airline aeroflot would be permitted to 
increase its transatlantic service to new york and washington and 
would gain new rights to serve chicago and miami with onward 
service to two undisclosed points in south america 
aeroflot service over the pacific also could begin to anchorage 
alaska and to san francisco with a stop in anchorage the state 
department said 
airlines of both nations also could increase the number of 
weekly flights and increase the number of airlines designated to 
serve the expanded routes the department said 
ms hanlon said pan am sees the new development as an 
opportunity to expand more rapidly in a modest but steadily 
increasing market 
pan am which began nonstop service to moscow two years ago 
with three flights a week added a flight last year and will 
operate five flights a week this summer ms hanlon said 
we are currently looking to increase that to seven nonstops 
next year she said 
the spokeswoman said pan am and other us carriers would not 
necessarily open air service to each of the new possible 
destinations inside the soviet union but would look at each city 
to see if the market is there 
the tentative agreement also would allow the united states and 
the soviet union soviet up to 100 charter flights a year over the 
atlantic 
the state department said positive consideration also would 
be given to transpacific charter flights between the two countries 
the preliminary agreement was reached by us and soviet 
negotiators at a second round of the london talks a third round 
will be convened in london in late april to discuss financial 
provisions and other outstanding issues 
thenpresident carter ordered aeroflot to stop its service to 
new york after the soviet invasion of afghanistan 
in 1981 thenpresident reagan cited sovietinspired repression 
in poland in ordering aeroflot to terminate its service to 
washington 
the latter action halted all soviet air service to the united 
states with the exception of aeroflot flights carrying diplomatic 
personnel and supplies intended for soviet embassies and consulates 
in 1983 reagan ordered aeroflots offices in new york and 
washington closed in protest over the shooting down of a south 
korean jetliner by soviet warplanes 
commercial flights between the two nations were resumed in april 
1986 with regularly scheduled aeroflot flights to washington and 
pan am flights to moscow 
the next year the two nations signed an agreement permitting an 
expansion of air service beginning in may 1988

after losing a bid for dismissal of all 
charges against joseph hazelwood the defense called three 
witnesses who said he appeared sober hours before his tanker caused 
the nations worst oil spill 
among the witnesses was a florist who said she took hazelwoods 
order for easter flowers to be sent to his home in huntington 
ny about six hours before the skipper boarded the ship the 
other witnesses were marine terminal guards 
superior court judge karl johnstone on wednesday showed keen 
interest in a defense argument on why the exxon valdez skipper 
should be cleared but rejected a motion to cut short the trial and 
acquit him 
defense attorney dick madson in arguing for acquittal raised a 
new legal point hazelwood is innocent of operating a vessel while 
intoxicated because he was not at the helm when it went aground 
march 24 
we realize we are asking this judge to go where no judge has 
gone before said madson in my research there has never been 
a case where a person who is intoxicated has been convicted because 
he has the authority to control a vehicle but is not actually at 
the controls 
he noted that hazelwood turned over the ship to a third mate 
about 10 minutes before it went off course struck bligh reef and 
dumped nearly 11 million gallons of alaska crude in scenic prince 
william sound the oil devastated hundreds of miles of rocky shore 
and killed countless birds fish and other wildlife 
the defense steadfastly maintains the skipper was sober when the 
ship went aground but madson drew the analogy of a person who is 
intoxicated gets in a cab and tells the driver where to go if the 
driver runs a red light and hits a school bus the person in the 
back seat giving directions is not at fault 
assistant district attorney brent cole said coast guard 
regulations clearly require the captain to be sober no matter 
where he is on the ship 
the judge countered that coast guard regulations do not apply 
because hazelwood is on trial under state not federal law 
but he refused to drop the intoxication charge or the other 
charges criminal mischief reckless endangerment and negligent 
discharge of oil 
hazelwood 43 could get up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in 
fines if convicted on all counts 
the legal arguments took place outside the jurys presence 
following the judges ruling madson called to the stand emily 
kaiser a valdez flower shop owner who said she took hazelwoods 
order 
he was sober she declared saying she remembered him 
because she also is from huntington and they chatted about their 
hometown which is on long island 
were you pretty busy that day cole asked on 
crossexamination 
yes said the witness but not that busy that i dont 
remember mr hazelwood because of the long island deal 
two other witnesses were guards at the aleyeska terminal who 
screen seamen for contraband and signs of intoxication before they 
board their ships charles dudley and michael craig remembered 
hazelwood arriving by cab with two other crew members and said they 
noticed no signs that hazelwood was drunk 
the prosecution rested wednesday after calling 45 witnesses in 
4 weeks

former michigan congressman charles diggs jr 
who resigned 10 years ago after being convicted of accepting 
payroll kickbacks says hell run for a seat in the maryland house 
of delegates 
diggs a democrat said wednesday he would serve just one term 
and has no interest in running for congress again 
my principal reason for running is to be in annapolis during 
the reapportionment consideration in 1991 and 92 said diggs 
explaining that he wants to tap the political potential of blacks 
in the state 
states redraw political boundary lines including congressional 
and legislative districts after the national census every 10 
years that process would begin in 1991 based on population counts 
from the 1990 census 
although maryland is not likely to pick up an additional 
congressional seat theres going to be significant realignment 
in drawing new lines the former detroit representative said in a 
telephone interview 
he said there is increased discussion about changing the 
boundaries of marylands suburban 5th congressional district now 
represented by house democratic caucus chairman steny hoyer to 
create a district that would be ripe for a black candidate 
diggs a licensed mortician served in congress for 25 years 
before resigning in 1980 after he was convicted of mail fraud and 
falsifying staff payroll vouchers 
he founded the congressional black caucus chaired the house 
committee on the district of columbia and also headed the foreign 
affairs subcommittee on africa 
diggs said he sees the importance of protecting hoyer who is 
fourth in the house leadership hierarchy but said progress 
toward powersharing among white controlling interests in the state 
and prince georges county is moving too slowly 
hoyer said the scenario for redistricting outlined by diggs is 
one of several being discussed 
i think any area that experiences growth in an ethnic or 
minority group needs to accommodate that said hoyer but 
political realities will make it difficult to expand the 
maryland congressional delegation while protecting incumbents 
diggs 67 said he has no interest in a congressional seat that 
might come out of redistricting 
im interested in the development of the talents of younger 
people to take over various offices that will become available as 
the county and state black population grows he said 
diggs said he will file candidacy forms next month for the 
maryland house from a legislative district in prince georges 
county

the first human genetransfer therapy could 
begin within a year if other government panels join a national 
institutes of health committee in approving the experimental 
treatment to combat a rare immune deficiency in children 
six other federal committees must concur with wednesdays 
decision by the nih institutional biosafety committee before the 
experimental therapy can be tried 
the treatment would be the first time that a human illness had 
been directly treated by the process of gene transfer the process 
would insert curative genes into the blood cells of children 
suffering adenosine deaminase deficiency 
if approved clinical use could begin by late fall or winter 
the proposal was presented by dr w french anderson of the 
heart lung and blood institute one of the national institutes of 
health and dr michael blaese of the national cancer institute 
blaese said the clinical plan is to remove lymphocytes white 
cells of the blood of children with the immune deficiency and 
insert into them the gene they lack 
lymphocytes are the major infectionfighting element of the 
immune system 
the treated cells then would be cultured until they increase in 
number by about a thousandfold and then transferred back into the 
patients bloodstream 
adenosine deaminase is an enzyme that performs an essential 
function in the immune system without the enzyme the bodys 
ability to fight infection is crippled 
the gene that would be inserted would program the cells to 
produce the missing enzyme 
the therapy would not be a permanent cure blaese said since 
the enzyme would be produced only as long as the genetically 
manipulated cells live 
we dont know how long these cells last he said some 
lymphocytes however can live for years 
the researcher said the therapy might allow patients to live 
longer than they would otherwise however scientists hope to 
develop a system where the gene could be placed in the cells of the 
bone marrow which would permanently correct the enzyme deficiency 
adenosine deaminase deficiency is very very rare said 
blaese there are only 20 to 30 patients in the whole world 
the sufferers are born without the required gene some are 
treated successfully by bone marrow transplants but for many the 
disorder means death within the first year or two of life by some 
infectious disease

poor people who live and work in rural areas 
would benefit more than city dwellers from several proposed 
antipoverty programs according to a report released today 
the study by the center on budget and policy priorities notes 
that a disproportionate share of working poor live in rural areas 
although only 23 percent of the nation is rural 33 percent of the 
working poor live in rural areas it said 
rep mike synar dokla whose states poverty rate increased 
from 134 percent in the early 1980s to 155 percent by the middle 
of the decade said some of the centers recommendations would cost 
more than the country can afford now 
however there are smaller steps we can take and have taken 
to begin to meet the needs of the rural working poor said synar 
who released the study along with sen james jeffords rvt 
the report suggested aiding the working poor by 
enlarging the earned income tax credit for lowincome families 
with children 
extending the child care tax credit to lowincome working 
families 
restoring the minimum wage to its average purchasing power 
during the 1960s and 1970s 
partially reversing cutbacks made during the 1980s in the 
unemployment insurance program 
expanding medicaid so it can provide health care coverage to 
more children in working poor families 
the earned income tax credit available to low and 
moderateincome families with children offers an example of how 
rural working poor benefit more from such programs than those in 
the city 
to receive the credit which was worth up to 910 in 1989 
families need only to file a federal income tax return the family 
either gets a tax break or if the familys income is too low to be 
taxed the government sends a check for the appropriate amount 
since wages are lower in rural than in urban areas and since 
a larger proportion of the rural poor work the proportion of 
families qualifying for the tax credit is higher in rural than in 
urban locations said the center 
legislation to increase the amount of money available under the 
earned income tax credit is pending in the house 
if the minimum wage were increased to give it the same 
purchasing power it had 20 or 30 years ago a larger share of rural 
workers would benefit than city dwellers said the report because 
one in three rural workers earn at or near the minimum wage 
compared with about one in five urban workers 
expansion of the earned income credit combined with full 
restoration of the minimum wage would lift a substantial number of 
rural working poor households out of poverty said robert 
greenstein center director and coauthor of the report 
providing extended unemployment benefits in areas of states with 
very high unemployment even if the state as a whole doesnt 
qualify would help rural areas where unemployment is often 
seasonal he said 
currently extended benefits may be provided to the longterm 
unemployed only when the statewide jobless rate is very high 
the report is one in a series of rural poverty reports by the 
center on budget and policy priorities an independent research 
organization that specializes in the analysis of data and policy 
issues affecting low and moderateincome americans

production in state industries has fallen 
by nearly a quarter since the solidarityled government began its 
shock transformation of the economy from central planning to 
capitalism statistics show 
since the plan took effect jan 1 industrial managers have 
started exporting some goods because of slack domestic demand the 
official pap news agency said wednesday in a report based on 
government figures 
tens of thousands of poles have lost their jobs and others can 
afford few things to buy because price rises have outstripped wage 
increases during the first two months of the plan 
the government lifted price controls and subsidies which caused 
prices to rise to market levels and restricted wage increase as 
part of the plan to fight hyperinflation and restructure the 
economy by forcing inefficient enterprises to close 
but the figures from the main statistical office showed not a 
single state enterprise had gone bankrupt despite the drop in 
production the news agency reported 
in february state industries reported a drop in production of 
239 percent compared to december 1989 with the sharpest decline in 
food and light industries pap said 
it said wages in febuary had increased 15 percent from january 
when the average monthly pay in major industries was 65 
industrial prices were up 7 percent while the statistical 
office predicted once the final tabulations were made that the 
inflation rate for february would not exceed 23 percent 
prices in january were estimated to be 6070 percent higher than 
in december while the inflation rate for 1989 was put at about 700 
percent 
the finance ministry announced on wednesday that it expected the 
inlation rate for march to be about 6 percent pap said 
the pap report gave no figures for unemployment but the agency 
earlier this month reported that as of feb 28 there were 152190 
jobless in poland with only 20500 openings for jobs 
nearly 56000 people registered as unemployed in january the 
government initially forecast about 400000 unemployed as 
inefficient firms close down and others cut back on the number of 
employees 
the economic program developed by finance minister leszek 
balcerowicz has the support of many western governments the paris 
club of creditor nations the world bank and officials of the 
european economic community 
balcerowicz has anticipated the mass layoffs and prices increase 
but stressed the economic pain was temporary and needed to halt the 
inflation and to end polands economic decline under more than four 
decades of communist rule 
in august solidarity activist tadeusz mazowiecki became prime 
minister the first noncommunist head of a government in eastern 
europe since then democratic reforms have swept the east bloc

the new federal agricultural mortgage corp 
called farmer mac for short is tuning up for its grand entry in 
the financial market later this year 
farmer mac was created a little more than two years ago by the 
agricultural credit act of 1987 as a secondary market for 
agricultural real estate loans 
but it has taken time to organize to work out the kinks and 
follow the instructions congress laid down farmer mac officials 
said wednesday 
startup procedures included the initial sale of 20 million in 
voting common stock to banks and other lenders rules and operating 
specifications are still being honed 
john r dahl chairman of the board said after the 
corporations second annual stockholders meeting that underwriting 
standards and other guides must be developed meticulously to ensure 
integrity 
dahl said farmer mac has a very strong foundation and that 
all the deadlines specified by congress have been met 
the aim of farmer mac he said is to accomplish the goal that 
congress set out for us to increase the availability of 
capital to allow agricultural borrowers and rural housing 
borrowers an opportunity of more places to go to look for credit 
hopefully dahl added these borrowers also will have the 
benefits of competition and competitive interest rates 
but dahl and henry d edelman the corporations president and 
chief executive officer could not offer a firm timetable or 
identify those in line for actual pooling operations 
banks and other lenders can convert longterm assets in this 
case real estate mortgages by selling the loans on the secondary 
market at that point those who buy the mortgages package or pool 
the loans and then sell loanbacked securities to the public 
meanwhile the original lenders are able to increase their cash 
and are able to make more loans to agricultural borrowers 
farmer mac will share the risk of the farm real estate loan 
business by guaranteeing returns on the securities 
other federal agencies such as the federal home loan mortgage 
corp freddie mac federal national mortgage association fannie 
mae and government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
serve a similar function for their clientele 
dahl a rancher from gackle nd said in an interview after 
the meeting that weve come a long way in getting farmer mac on 
solid ground but he said there is no way to estimate the 
corporations eventual impact on the nations agricultural credit 
market 
theres no history involved here he said theres a lot 
of enthusiasm for farmer mac and i wish i could tell you that 
were going to do a billion dollars in business or something but 
theres no way we can predict this 
but what can be predicted dahl added is that were going to 
do everything we possibly can to come up with the kind of program 
that congress envisioned agriculture needed 
there has been some concern among other financial authorities 
that demand for farmer macs secondary market services might fall 
short of expectations 
dahl said he wasnt aware of any major threat to farmer mac at 
least not in the formative stage 
there are some that are hesitant about farmer mac he said 
and there have been some things in the news media from time to 
time but i think those are based on perceptions more than fact 
nothings 100 percent id be the first to say that 
also dahl said there has been some impatience about farmer 
mac not being in business yet 
but we need this program developed with quality and with 
integrity he said were here for the long pull 
dahl said he tried to look back a few years when so much of the 
nations agriculture was going through the financial wringer and 
what farmer mac might have done to help 
and i think it would have been a lot easier a lot more stable 
if we had had it he said thats what we need to try and do in 
the future

lebanon he will mark five years in captivity on march 16 
slaughters district includes his hometown of batavia ny 
most if not all of the hostages are thought to be held by 
shiite moslem groups with ties to iran in all 18 westerners are 
held in lebanon 
the subcommittee sent a resolution by slaughter seeking a 
special envoy to the full foreign affairs committee moynihan is 
seeking a companion resolution in the senate if passed the 
resolution would not be sent to president bush or have the force of 
law but would express congress sentiments 
slaughters measure calls on the president to appoint someone 
of prominence and stature with a keen understanding of middle east 
politics to initiate and coordinate discussions between the 
syrians iran and other influential parties 
rep olympia snowe rmaine wondered if a special envoy might 
conflict whatever the administration is doing secretly on behalf of 
the hostages 
slaughter said she wouldnt proceed with the measure if i have 
any reason to believe that this would hurt ongoing efforts 
us officials usually oppose the idea of special envoys said a 
state department source speaking on condition of anonymity 
remember terry waite he was a special envoy this official 
said referring to the anglican churchman who was seized in beirut 
while trying to free the hostages 
mike kraft an official in the state departments 
counterterrorism office said a great deal is being done that is 
not publicized and that the administration has an opendoor 
policy in talking to people 
officials have insisted however that the us government is not 
negotiating with iran for the release of the hostages 
us policy is not to deal directly with the iranians there 
are no us government talks state department spokeswoman 
margaret d tutwiler said 
but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said administration 
officials were encouraged by the comments of iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani who said there might be a solution soon 
they certainly are more hopeful than what weve heard in the 
more distant past he said of rafsanjanis remarks 
but the revolutionary justice organization said it had no 
intention of releasing the hostages it claims to hold joseph 
cicippio of valley forge pa and edward austin tracy an american 
author 
a statement by the group delivered to beirut newspaper annahar 
and a western news agency was accompanied by a blackandwhite 
instant photograph of cicippio

portauprince haiti ap under the pressure of mounting 
antigovernment unrest haitis military leader has indicated he 
would consider resigning but also says his departure would create 
a lot of turmoil 
lt gen prosper avril spoke wednesday as thousands of students 
rallied in provincial cities for the second straight day to protest 
the armys killing of an 11yearold girl 
the girl was to be buried today and student groups called for a 
national day of mourning eleven political parties urged businesses 
and factories to close in sympathy 
asked in a rare interview whether he might resign avril said 
i will never resist the will of the people but he added we 
must get on with elections because elections reflect the will of 
the people 
if i step down hurriedly it will create a lot of turmoil 
avril said at the presidential palace i have thought a lot about 
how to prevent the country falling into revolution and chaos 
on wednesday thousands of students marched in the provincial 
towns of jacmel jeremie leogane petit goave and mirebalais the 
roman catholic churchs radio soleil reported 
in gonaives 100 miles north of the capital portauprince 
schools stayed closed for a second day and students set up flaming 
tire barricades 
schools were also closed in the northern coastal city of 
caphaitien radio soleil said 
the student marches were reminiscent of demonstrations in 
november 1985 to protest the armys killing of three high school 
students in gonaives those protests led to the downfall of former 
dictator jeanclaude duvalier who fled to exile in france in 
february 1986 
avril a former duvalier aide came to power in september 1988 
replacing lt gen henri namphy in a coup led by lowerranking 
soldiers 
he promised elections and reforms but shipped seven 
prodemocracy leaders into exile during a crackdown in january and 
arrested more than 50 opposition activists some of whom were 
beaten in custody 
avril who has promised presidential elections later this year 
said he imposed a state of siege jan 20 as a preventive 
measure after the killing of an army colonel because the 
electoral process itself was threatened 
he lifted the emergency nine days later after an international 
outcry 
on wednesday the un human rights commission agreed to begin a 
special investigation into allegations of abuses in haiti saying 
the situation under avril remains disturbing and even seems to 
have deteriorated 
the genevabased organization said it was alarmed by the 
proliferation of acts of violence in haiti particularly against 
arrested or detained persons and by the apparent inability of the 
judicial system to put an end to such acts 
virtually all political parties and unions have vowed to boycott 
any elections under avril they say he cant be trusted to turn 
over power to elected civilians 
eighteen parties have proposed that avril be replaced by a 
supreme court justice until a new leader is elected 
if there is a change of government that will only delay 
elections even more avril said 
in the interview avril repeated his promise to allow elections 
this year and abide by the results avril repeated he was not 
interested in running for office 
county and municipal elections are scheduled for april 29 
legislative elections july 22 and presidential elections oct 28 
in november 1987 the first free general elections since 
independence from france in 1804 were canceled after attackers 
protected by soldiers massacred at least 34 voters 
this weeks student marches began tuesday to protest the death 
of 11yearold roseline vaval she was studying on her porch when 
she was fatally shot monday by a soldier breaking up a small 
antigovernment demonstration in petit goave

soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
will hold his next round of talks with secretary of state james a 
baker iii in washington april 46 us officials say 
an official announcement is expected by the end of the week 
the session is designed primarily to prepare for the summit 
meeting soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will hold here with 
president bush in the second half of june 
the precise date for the summit has not been set 
marlin fitzwater the white house press secretary said 
wednesday the meeting might be moved up to earlier in june to 
accommodate the soviets who are expected to hold a major communist 
party session in late june 
were always willing to change fitzwater said we can do 
it any time 
baker went to moscow last month to see gorbachev and 
shevardnadze the trip produced a narrowing of differences on a 
strategic arms reduction treaty the two leaders would like to sign 
at the summit 
and the two sides moved closer on provisions for agreements 
also being negotiated with other nations to ban chemical weapons 
production and to reduce troops tanks and other nonnuclear arms 
in europe 
baker is making arrangements for a meeting with the 15 nato 
foreign ministers probably in brussels after the shevardnadze 
visit the officials said 
this is in addition to a meeting baker will hold with the nato 
ministers in ayreshire scotland june 79 the session which has 
not been announced was disclosed by the officials on condition of 
anonymity 
baker has held five rounds of talks with shevardnadze so far 
in vienna last march in moscow in may in paris in july in 
jackson wyo in september and in moscow feb 710 they also 
could meet in namibia while attending ceremonies marking the new 
african countrys independence from south african rule feb 21 
the active schedule reflects both a stepup in talks with the 
soviet union to try to hasten arms control agreements while lending 
us support to political and economic reform and increased 
consultation with the nato allies on ussoviet relations 
also baker has pledged to consult regularly with the west 
europeans about german unification the us formula gives special 
roles to britain and france as well as the soviet union as the 
big four allies of world war ii 
a number of smaller countries feel left out many are victims of 
german aggression in world war ii and some are worried about the 
situation in europe after west germany merges with east germany 
italian prime minister giulio andreotti carried these concerns 
to president bush and baker on tuesday it then was decided to have 
baker meet with the foreign ministers after shevardnadzes visit

president bushs choice as the justice 
departments civil rights chief is headed for likely confirmation 
after parrying thrusts by democratic senators 
john r dunne a former new york state senator was peppered 
with questions wednesday by members of the senate judiciary 
committee over his lack of civil rights experience his former 
memberships in menonly clubs and investments in companies that do 
business in south africa 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said he was having great 
difficulty supporting dunnes nomination to be assistant attorney 
general for civil rights 
nevertheless metzenbaum said im not sure president bush 
would appoint anybody better than you regardless of how i vote 
youre going to be confirmed 
a staff aide said the committee would probably vote on the 
nomination march 22 
at one point sen paul simon dill who chaired the hearing 
asked dunne if he was offended by a number of recent supreme 
court cases that make it tougher for individuals to prove racial or 
sexual discrimination 
it triggered my concern dunne said 
ideally i would like to have that nominee sitting there say 
i was offended simon said 
taking those 11 or 12 decisions im alarmed im not offended 
yet dunne replied 
ok simon said youre getting a little stronger 
metzenbaum also pressed dunne about his long memberships in the 
menonly garden city ny golf club on long island ny and the 
fort orange club in albany ny which began admitting women in 
1988 
asked whether he might have taken a different course of 
conduct dunne replied i believe i would have 
dunne 60 was tapped for the civil rights job in january the 
post has been vacant since december 1988 when william bradford 
reynolds resigned 
bushs first nominee for the job william c lucas then a 
michigan county executive was rejected by the committee by a 77 
vote last august lucas who is black had spent most of his career 
in law enforcement and had little litigation experience he was 
also opposed by many civil rights organizations 
dunne who resigned from the new york senate last year after 
losing a race for majority leader has been criticized by civil 
rights groups for lacking civil rights experience none opposed his 
nomination outright however 
simon asked dunne to explain his position on apartheid in light 
of the fact that he and his law firm hold stock in companies that 
do business in south africa and that he voted against a measure 
requiring new york state to divest such holdings 
let me put right up in the front i hate if one can hate the 
principle of apartheid dunne replied the three items are 
unconnected and not indicative of an attitude that favors that 
system 
dunne said he cast the vote against divestiture as part of his 
responsibility to lead debate on the state senate floor on a 
personal note i found it very difficult he added 
as for his own investments dunne said his brother is his 
stockbroker and i have no standard with regard to investments 
simon said it would be a very wise thing to do if he now 
told his brother not to invest in companies that do business in 
south africa

real estate problems in the northeast are 
dragging down bank profits and some analysts worry the weakness 
will spread 
banks earned 27 billion in the fourth quarter and 163 
billion for all of 1989 a 34 percent drop from 248 billion in 
1988 the federal deposit insurance corp said wednesday 
provisions for loan losses hit a nearrecord 303 billion last 
year the fdic attributed about twothirds of that to domestic 
loans primarily for real estate development third world loan 
problems caused the rest 
five of the countrys 10 largest banks were in the red last 
year primarily because of provisions for losses on developing 
country loans they were chase manhattan morgan guaranty 
manufacturers hanover bankers trust and chemical bank 
bad real estate loans more than doubled in the northeast where 
four states massachusetts connecticut new hampshire and new 
york were among the 10 with the highest percentage of sour real 
estate loans 
the bostonbased bank of new england alone lost 11 billion 
last year most of it in real estate 
problem real estate continued to cause losses in the southwest 
but institutions in that region appear to be recovering somewhat 
texas losses for instance totaled 537 million last year down 
from 21 billion in 1988 
despite the downturn banks outside the southwest poured money 
into real estate loans particularly in the asyetuntroubled 
southeast and west real estate lending increased 128 percent 
nationally compared with a 54 percent growth rate for bank assets 
generally 
the chairman of the fdic l william seidman called attention 
to the real estate figures but declined to predict if the situation 
would deepen or spread this year private analysts were less 
reticent 
we are in a particularly vicious real estate cycle said 
economist paul getman of regional financial associates of west 
chester pa i think youre going to get more bad news 
particularly in the southeast in florida georgia the carolinas 
because there was a lot of speculative buying there 
i think youll see continued problems in the northeast and on 
a selected basis in the southeast said alex sheshunoff an 
austin texasbased analyst the big question mark is california 
how long can they continue to maintain high prices for real 
estate 
meanwhile in a separate report the office of thrift 
supervision said net withdrawals from savings institutions totaled 
86 billion in december bringing outflows for all of 1989 to a 
record 736 billion 
december marked the 18th outflow in 19 months and was the 
biggest drain since september when withdrawals excluding interest 
credited totaled 88 billion 
outflows for the year were the largest on record the last big 
outflow 254 billion occurred in 1981 when interest rates at 
competing moneymarket mutual funds skyrocketed at a time when 
thrift rates were capped by law 
what youre seeing now is unprecedented but its not 
surprising said economist martin regalia of the national council 
of savings institutions 
early in the year the industry lost deposits in part because 
sampl problems had shaken customers confidence but economists say 
the shrinkage in the last half of the year is almost entirely a 
response to tough new financial standards in president bushs sampl 
bailout enacted last august 
the rules require thrifts to back their lending with more of 
their owners money most cant raise the capital as a result 
they must trim their balance sheets 
thrifts shed 256 billion in assets in december with 46 
billion of that coming at sampls under government control and almost 
threefourths of the remainder at weakly capitalized thrifts still 
operating independently 
sampl assets at the end of the year totaled 125 trillion down 
100 billion 73 percent from a year earlier in contrast 
commercial bank assets grew 54 percent to 33 trillion 
i think the sampl downsizing is going to continue throughout 
1990 and maybe into 1991 as well although we might see some ebbing 
of the pace regalia said

the west germany airline 
lufthansa has tentatively agreed to buy a 26 percent share of 
interflug east germanys stateowned carrier a lufthansa 
spokesman said 
the agreement is similar to those signed by many west german 
companies who want to acquire partners over the border since east 
germany ousted its hardline communist leaders in october 
the two airlines reached a preliminary agreement earlier this 
week but details are still being worked out the lufthansa 
spokesman said wednesday speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said lufthansa has signed a letter of intent to make the 
purchase but did not say how much it would pay 
the spokesman said closer links with interflug does not mean a 
merger is planned with the wealthy west german carrier which is 51 
percent controlled by the state the letter of intent specifically 
allows interflug to develop new routes on its own and the east 
german companys employees will be guaranteed their jobs he said 
east germanys communistled interim government has been moving 
to open up its economy and make it more compatible with its 
powerful capitalist neighbors but a full foreign investment code 
has not been fixed 
the airlines have been negotiating closer cooperation since last 
fall they already have agreed to work together in several areas 
including booking systems pilot training airline catering and 
charter flights 
a spokeswoman at the east german transport ministry said this 
week that no final accords can be signed with lufthansa until 
interflug workers vote next week on whether they want cooperation 
with the western airline 
news reports have suggested interflug might lease 17 boeings 
737200s from lufthansa in 1992 as the west german carrier phases 
in newer planes 
although strapped for capital the east german company has also 
expressed interest in buying jets from airbus industrie sa a 
european consortium to replace its aging sovietbuilt fleet

the 20year fight over the seabrook nh 
nuclear plant is entering what may be its final chapter as 
opponents look to federal appeals court in washington prevent the 
plant from generating commercial power 
an appeal filed wednesday by two antinuclear groups and the 
massachusetts attorney general seeks to highlight the public risk 
posed by the plant and the alleged procedural slightofhand used 
by the nuclear regulatory commission in granting seabrook a 
fullpower license 
massachusetts attorney general james shannon and the groups 
argued in their us court of appeals filing that thousands of 
residents and beachgoers near new hampshire plant would be unable 
to escape in a nuclear emergency 
they also contended that the nrc improperly ignored that very 
conclusion made by a lowerlevel board within the agency 
this large closein beach population has access to very 
limited shelter and estimates of the evacuation times for these 
populations seven to 11 hours greatly exceed the arrival times of 
a radioactive plume the opponents said in a 20page motion 
the many thousands of beachgoers face entrapment 
the appeal includes the request for a stay and a motion for the 
court to revoke the license and send the issue back to the nrc for 
further consideration 
joining shannon in the lawsuit were the new england coalition on 
nuclear power and the seacoast antipollution league 
the commission has violated the intent of congress and its own 
regulations by finding this is an adequate evacuation plan said 
attorney robert backus representing the league 
we are happy to be in court shannon said in an interview 
this is the opportunity we have been looking for we have been 
precluded from making these arguments before 
plant officials predicted wednesday that the appeals will fail 
we dont believe that there would be any reason to further 
delay the operation of seabrook said plant spokesman ron sher 
the nrc had no immediate comment on the lawsuit well have to 
file our own reply when that will happen i dont know said 
commission spokesman john kopeck 
the nrc voted 30 last thursday to grant seabrook its fullpower 
license the 65 billion plant has been tested at low power but 
has not been allowed to operate at full throttle the nrc placed a 
hold on the license for up to 14 days to allow time for appeals

small striped aliens that stowed away on 
european freighters are threatening the security of north americas 
waterways warn lawmakers who fear the great lakes will become 
mussel beaches 
the rapid spread of the marauding mollusks led legislators 
wednesday to introduce bills aimed at preventing further aquatic 
invasions and battling the one underway by the dread zebra mussel 
unchecked the exotic inedible shellfish could cause 5 billion 
in damage by the turn of the century and spread to twothirds of 
the nations waterways said sen john glenn dohio 
i can tell you its no joke said glenn who was joined at a 
news conference by seven lawmakers who want the federal government 
to spend 40 million to research and control the barnaclelike 
creature 
we dont want to look a few years from now on what we should 
have spent this year said rep fred upton rmich whose 
district is bound by lake michigan that lake so far is musselfree 
except for the bottom of one boat in green bay wis 
the mussels usually no more than 1 inches long are believed 
to have been carried here from eastern europe three years ago in 
the ballast water of freighters 
theyve multiplied dramatically because they spawn almost 
continuously an adult female can produce upwards of 30000 eggs 
in a year and because there has been nothing to control the 
spread of the alien mussels 
an expert who investigated the problem for the congressional 
research service found evidence that diving ducks and crawfish eat 
zebra mussels but warned that there may not be enough intact 
wetlands to provide a habitat for more of the natural predators 
there werent enough predators to prevent 30 tons of mussels 
from clogging a 2mile intake pipe at an ontario water plant or 
prevent mussels from accumulating up to two inches thick on screens 
of the water intakes at five cleveland electric illumination co 
power plants 
monroe mich was forced to close its water plant for three 
days after zebra mussels restricted water flow detroit edison co 
had to reduce the output of its monroe mich plant by 25 percent 
because one of its pipes became coated with the mussels 
sen arlen specter rpa said a 29 million breakwall that 
took a decade to get for presque isle in lake erie is being 
jeopardized by zebra mussels 
and sen john heinz rpa warned that the shellfish can easily 
migrate into the mississippi missouri and ohio river systems 
which could become literally musselbound 
and theres more dead zebra mussels can produce offensive 
quantities of methane gas according to the congressional 
research report when they die in the pipes of water treatment 
systems they can give the water a foul taste and smell once they 
wash ashore the mussels sharp shells can rip up the bare feet of 
beach walkers 
rep dennis eckart dohio said the mussels already endanger 
the fisheries of lake erie by stripping the lake of microscopic 
feeder plants 
when the bottom of the aquatic food chain collapses the net 
result is there will be no little baby fish left in lake erie to 
grow up to be big fish said eckart who added hes worried about 
the impact on a newly revived sportfishing and recreation economy 
its another one of those unwanted foreign imports thats 
costing us jobs he said 
the bills introduced by glenn in the senate and rep henry 
nowak dny in the house would authorize spending 4 million a 
year for five years to control the mussels and the same amount on 
prevention programs to protect us waters from other foreign 
invaders 
in addition the bills require freighters to dump their ballast 
water in the ocean at least 200 miles from the us coast

consumer groups like the food and drug 
administrations plan to revamp the nations foodlabeling system 
but they say the agency cant be trusted to fulfill its promise of 
stronger rules 
weve been here before said ellen haas executive director 
of public voice for food and health policy complaining that fda 
has been trying unsuccessfully for a decade to redo the labeling 
regulations 
what consumers do not want is to continue in the nutritional 
minefield that is the supermarket she said and proposals will 
not get us out of that minefield only final action will 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan on wednesday 
outlined the foodlabeling program the government will propose 
they include requiring disclosure of the fat fiber and cholesterol 
content of nearly all packaged foods and standardized definitions 
of terms like low fat and high fiber 
sullivan said the fda will offer the changes in three phases 
the first of which will be formally proposed in the next six 
months after the public is given time to comment final rules 
would be published in the federal register sometime in 1991 he 
said the rules would take effect after that 
but michael jacobson executive director of the center for 
science in the public interest said that in light of repeated 
delays legislation will be necessary to set a firm deadline for 
agency to complete action 
bills sponsored by rep henry waxman dcalif and sen howard 
metzenbaum dohio would impose requirements similar to those the 
fda said it will propose 
the fda proposed new foodlabeling regulations during the carter 
administration in 1979 but the plan languished on the back burner 
after president reagan took office the agency revived the effort 
in the mid1980s proposing piecemeal changes in the system but 
few went through 
industry representatives complained that the fdas plan would 
not head off state efforts to extend federal regulations with their 
own requirements 
if everybody is concerned about confusion then why can we not 
have one uniform national labeling system that applies across the 
board from portland maine to portland ore said john cady 
president of the national food processors association 
sullivan said the need for new foodlabeling regulations is 
clear 
the grocery store has become a tower of babel and consumers 
need to be linguists scientists and mind readers to understand the 
many labels they encounter he told a food policy conference 
some food labels are hard to read and understand vital 
information is missing and frankly some unfounded health claims 
are being made in the marketplace sullivan said its a real 
mess 
the fda recently proposed a regulation to toughen rules on what 
health claims food marketers can make for their products it also 
is expected to go into effect fully in 1991 
in the next six months the fda will issue a proposal requiring 
nutrition labeling for nearly all packaged foods this requirement 
could be extended to other foods that the agency regulates 
including fresh fruit and produce officials said 
as part of this proposal the fda also wants to revise the list 
of nutrients required on the label to include such items as 
saturated fat fiber cholesterol and calories from fat 
meat and poultry would not be affected by the plan because those 
foods are regulated by the agriculture department 
foods that have no nutrition content such as spices herbs and 
tea also would be exempt from the regulations as would foods 
produced by local retail bakeries and other small operations 
under current fda labeling requirements which were put in place 
17 years ago nutrition labeling is required only when a 
manufacturer adds vitamins minerals or proteins or makes a 
nutritional claim about the product about 60 percent of packaged 
foods now list nutrients 
later this year the fda plans to define food descriptions such 
as low fat and high fiber and determine whether to require 
percentage listing of ingredients and whether specific flavors 
colors and spices should be on the label

dianne feinstein has catapulted from 
last to first in the governors race partly because of a tv 
commercial that shows her announcing the assassination of her 
predecessor as san francisco mayor 
feinsteins surge in the campaign to succeed retiring republican 
gov george deukmejian has turned a quiet contest between two 
cautious men into a lively and unpredictable race 
during most of the past year the 56yearold feinstein was the 
forgotten third candidate in a race dominated by republican us 
sen pete wilson and state attorney general john van de kamp a 
democrat 
feinstein had suffered several setbacks early in the race 
her recuperation from a hysterectomy canceled two months of 
public appearances her first campaign manager clint reilly quit 
and complained that she was unwilling to commit to a schedule an 
organization and a budget prompting jokes that he was the first 
campaign manager to fire the candidate and her fundraising lagged 
millions of dollars behind that of her rivals 
polls reported her up to 18 points behind van de kamp whom she 
faces in the june 5 democratic primary and 11 points behind wilson 
in a general election matchup political columnists speculated 
about when she would drop out 
but in a doordie effort feinstein and her husband richard 
blum put up their own money for a 600000 blitz of tv commercials 
in late january and early february mostly in los angeles where she 
was not well known 
feinsteins 30second commercial opens with blackandwhite 1978 
footage of feinstein then president of the san francisco board of 
supervisors announcing at a news conference that mayor george 
moscone and supervisor harvey milk had just been shot 
stressing that she showed tough and caring leadership in a 
time of tragedy the commercial also cited feinsteins prochoice 
stand on abortion and described her as the only democrat for 
governor for the death penalty all three candidates are 
prochoice wilson supports the death penalty van de kamp opposes 
it 
six polls by three independent pollsters tracked a dramatic 
shift from october van de kamps large lead became a large 
deficit one late february poll put feinstein ahead 43 percent to 
24 percent the poll also had her in front of wilson 44 percent to 
33 percent 
steve teichner who conducted three of those six polls said 
that an unusually large 29 percent of the voters he surveyed could 
describe the feinstein commercials without prompting and that 
voters recalling the ad had a favorable impression of feinstein by 
4to1 
teichner cautioned however that the large shift based on one 
commercial is a sign that voters are fickle 
it also means a large number of voters out there are seeking a 
personality candidate teichner said he noted that feinsteins 
standing as the first woman to seriously compete for governor of 
california created a more exciting image than that of her two 
rivals 
the race is open and its volatile and nobody is questioning 
any more that dianne has a viable candidacy said feinstein 
spokeswoman dee dee myers 
feinsteins sudden emergence as frontrunner has dramatically 
changed the tenor of the race 
van de kamp 54 shifted tactics abruptly in late february with 
scathing attacks on feinsteins fiscal environmental and civil 
rights record during her nine years as mayor 
wilson 56 also has joined in attacking feinstein for leaving 
a budget deficit for her democratic successor in san francisco art 
agnos 
its now abundantly clear that were going to have a 
democratic primary that were going to have a real race van de 
kamp said

a study today demonstrating the effectiveness of 
the new french abortion pill may help spur acceptance of the 
treatment in other countries a doctor says 
the study in the new england journal of medicine concludes the 
medicine is 96 percent effective in terminating early pregnancies 
the pill ru 486 or mifepristone is sold only in france where it 
has been available since 1988 
the studys results which duplicate earlier findings show that 
the pill works as well as vacuum aspiration the most common form 
of abortion when taken by women up to three weeks after they miss 
their menstrual period 
the study of 2115 women was conducted by dr louise silvestre 
and others from rousseluclaf the french company that makes the 
abortion pill 
in france the pill is now used for about onequarter of the 
120000 abortions performed yearly but is not available for home 
use women must take the medicine at a clinic or hospital and 
return two days later for an injection of a synthetic form of the 
hormone prostaglandin 
dr sheldon j segal of the rockefeller foundation in new york 
noted in an accompanying editorial that rousseluclaf had withheld 
distribution of the drug in other countries until its effectiveness 
and safety were reviewed in larger studies 
the new findings reported in this issue of the journal provide 
reassurance on these issues and could presage the availability of 
the method in countries where comparable conditions of authorized 
clinical use prevail he wrote 
no company has proposed selling the drug in the united states 
segal said and obtaining federal approval can take several years 
once someone applies 
most of the women studied had temporary abdominal pain after 
getting the shots but there were few other side effects treatment 
failures consisted mostly of incomplete expulsion of the fetus in 
those cases the abortions were completed surgically 
we conclude that the administration of mifepristone followed 
by a small dose of prostaglandin analogue is an effective and safe 
method for the early termination of pregnancy the french doctors 
wrote 
members of the national righttolife committee disagreed 
richard glasow education director of the group contended the 
study offers nothing to calm concerns about the possibility of 
longterm adverse side effects

senate leaders and the bush administration are 
trying to hold together a compromise clean air bill amid criticism 
by some lawmakers that automobile emission controls are too weak 
about a dozen senators were preparing to introduce today a 
string of amendments that would toughen pollution controls from 
auto tailpipes and require carmakers to produce more fuelefficient 
vehicles 
the provisions are opposed by the administration as well as the 
senates democratic and republican leadership 
as senators considered a number of minor changes to the 
legislation wednesday white house and industry lobbyists tried to 
head off any major reworking of the bill which was the product of 
three weeks of closeddoor negotiations 
the legislation calls for sweeping regulations on smogcausing 
pollution from automobiles and industries requires controls on 191 
toxic industrial chemicals and requires cuts in acid rain 
pollutants from coalburning electric utility plants and factories 
as part of the compromise a second round of automatic tailpipe 
controls and a fuel economy provision were deleted from the 
legislation the auto industry has maintained that both 
requirements were too expensive and perhaps not attainable 
but several senators said wednesday they would attempt to revive 
the tougher provisions on the senate floor 
transportation secretary samuel skinner said in a letter that 
the fuel economy proposal would have a devastating impact on 
the auto industry and consumers forcing automakers to concentrate 
on making smaller cars 
proponents contended that new controls on carbon dioxide are 
needed to deal with global warming carbon dioxide is responsible 
for nearly half of the greenhouse effect and motor vehicles are 
the largest single source of carbon dixoide emissions said sen 
albert gore dtenn 
meanwhile some republican senators complained late wednesday 
that the complex bill was being pushed through the senate too 
quickly 
sen william armstrong rcolo suggested that the bill was 
being rammed down our throats and he and sen ted stevens 
ralaska expressed doubt that it could be completed soon 
but majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he wants to 
finish the bill by the end of the week and might call the senators 
into session saturday to get the job done 
the senate begins a weeklong recess next week and mitchell 
expressed concern that if debate on the legislation extends to 
after the recess the compromise might fall apart 
meanwhile the senators meeting until nearly midnight 
wednesday approved and rejected a number of amendments mostly by 
voice vote with little debate 
among the amendments approved were provisions 
exempting fertilizer from certain reporting requirements and 
agricultural tanks from other requirements under the toxic 
pollution section of the bill 
continuing the authority of the environmental protection agency 
to regulate radioactive emissions along with the nuclear 
regulatory commission the amendment also would allow states to 
continue to impose more stringent standards on radioactive 
emissions than federal standards 
in the first roll call vote on the bill during the three days it 
has been on the floor the senate voted 5343 to let stand a 
section of the bill that favors ethanol as part of an oxygenated 
fuels program 
critics of the provision had claimed it unfairly promotes 
ethanol which is made from corn as opposed to other fuels such a 
methanol supporters including most farm state senators said 
those concerns were unfounded 
the provision requires that in areas not meeting federal air 
quality standards gasoline must have a 31 percent oxygen content 
during winter months opponents of the measure had sought to lower 
than to 27 percent saying that would open the way for a broader 
range of fuel blends and not just an ethanol blend

gen augusto pinochet is fighting to 
retain his grip on chile even as his 17yearold military regime 
gives way to an elected civilian government presidentelect 
patricio aylwin says 
aylwin said he and pinochet argued during a meeting wednesday 
about the militarys role in the new democratic government that 
takes office on sunday 
the 71yearold christian democrat said he expressed concern 
over recent legislation that grants the armed forces broad powers 
and virtual autonomy under the new government 
he also said he was alarmed by speeches in which pinochet who 
is staying on as army commander said he would reject any attempt 
to alter the role of the military aylwin said pinochet refused to 
subordinate himself to a civilian defense minister who under the 
constitution commands the army leader 
pinochet in a white army dress uniform said only that the 
encounter was very pleasant he did not elaborate 
pinochet 74 seized power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled an 
elected leftist government 
after handing over the presidency to aylwin pinochet plans to 
stay on as commander of the 60000member army under the 
constitution approved during his rule he can lead the army for up 
to eight more years 
since the december elections pinochet has pushed through 
legislation that limits the presidents power to promote or retire 
military officers and limits the civilian leaders power to make 
military appointments 
it also allows the army to sell any property it owns without 
going through regular government procedures among other measures 
aylwin said he told pinochet he hoped the outgoing 
administration had no plans to change the militarys role further 
aylwin said he feared pinochet might introduce other administrative 
measures before leaving office but he did not elaborate 
the 1980 constitution drafted under pinochet makes the armed 
forces guarantors of chiles internal security and legal 
framework aylwin and other civilian politicians maintain the 
military should be only to defend chile from other countries 
aylwin could change the militarys role with support from 
congress 
wednesdays meeting was the second since aylwin leading a 
17party coalition soundly defeated a pinochetbacked candidate in 
elections dec 14 
the new governments relations with the military are expected to 
be an area of friction for aylwin and one that is complicated by 
demands that officers who violated human rights during pinochets 
rule stand trial 
hundreds of people were killed after the military seized power 
in 1973 and international human rights agencies regularly 
criticized chile for grave human rights violations 
in recognition of the elections restoring traditional democratic 
rule in chile the un human rights commission on wednesday agreed 
to drop chile from a list of countries meriting close attention 
because of consistent and gross violations of civil liberties 
aylwin said he did not discuss the human rights issue with 
pinochet but reiterated that his government will seek to find 
the truth and do justice 
asked whether pinochet himself could be brought to trial aylwin 
said a trial is not in my mind but he added we can not 
simply close our eyes and forget everything 
military leaders have warned they wont accept trials 
in a speech on monday to military officers pinochet predicted 
tough times for the armed forces and appealed for unity he said he 
would resist any changes in the armed forces legal role

leading social democrats from east and west 
germany are seeking to thrash out their differences with us 
officials about the future membership of a unified germany in nato 
this is our main theme in washington said horst ehmke 
deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the west german 
social democratic party 
the west german party has been giving extensive campaign support 
to its fledgling east german counterpart which is widely expected 
to win the march 18 east german election and form a government to 
negotiate reunification with west germany 
if you read the newspapers you might think it looks like 
this the us administration says a unified germany must be in 
nato while the spd says a unified germany must not be in nato 
said ehmke but if you look carefully the positions are much 
closer together 
ehmke said the delegation had a long discussion on the issue 
wednesday with brent scowcroft president bushs national security 
adviser and lawrence eagleburger deputy secretary of state 
the spd delegation on a twoday visit to washington also 
includes marcus meckel deputy chairman of the east german spd 
hans misselwitz foreign policy adviser to the east german party 
and dietrich stobbe former mayor of west berlin and a current 
member of the west german bundestag 
the group was to include ibrahim boehme chairman of the east 
german party but he canceled at the last minute so that he could 
campaign for the elections 
ehmke said no one in the us administration wants to extend 
military institutions of the north atlantic treaty organization 
into east germany and noted that bush and secretary of state james 
a baker iii have renounced winning any security advantages in 
europe at the expense of the soviet union 
he said the spd wants to treat each of the germanys differently 
for a transition period during which nato would be transformed and 
lead into a new security system for europe 
complicating the issue is the fastchanging situation in europe 
he said 
our problem is that no one in washington and no one in bonn 
knows first what the final result will look like and how the 
transformation will look said ehmke 
but we are agreed that we must use something positive from 
nato the european community and the european security and 
cooperation process that began in helsinki he said 
that will still require much effort but we leave here 
with the impression that the apparent opposition turns out to be a 
superfluous verbal conflict 
meckel said it was clear that the nato strategy would have to 
change in any event he noted that for example shortrange nato 
nuclear weapons would have to be eliminated because they can only 
reach east germany 
the strategy certainly cannot remain the same said meckel 
adding that elements of the north atlantic treaty can be expanded 
to include all of europe 
the delegation spoke in a panel discussion organized by the 
washington office of the spds friedrich ebert foundation

a jury wednesday found the city and five police 
officers used excessive force in a case of mistaken identity and 
awarded 76 million to two men who said they were shot at and 
beaten 
the jury which deliberated about four hours also found against 
the officers and city for negligence false arrest and malicious 
prosecution 
its hard not to feel vindicated with a verdict like that 
said one of the plaintiffs in the civil lawsuit gerard j papa a 
lawyer and brooklyn community activist 
maybe finally therell be a message sent and at long last the 
police will learn how to police themselves he said 
the case was featured last october on the cbs program 60 
minutes 
papa 36 was giving his friend james rampersant jr 27 a 
ride home on march 12 1986 when they were boxed in about 1130 
pm by two unmarked police cars 
police said they stopped the car because papa and rampersant 
matched the description of a holdup team that had stolen 10 and a 
ring from a woman on a coney island street six days earlier 
the plainclothes officers rushed the car without identifying 
themselves and with their guns drawn papa said he believed they 
were gang members and smashed his car into the two police cars 
the officers said they fired three shots into papas car after 
they saw one or both of the men pull a gun no gun was found inside 
the car 
papa and rampersant said they were dragged from the car then 
thrown on the ground beaten and kicked by the five officers 
the two men said they suffered concussions and other injuries in 
the attack including psychiatric problems such as phobias and 
depression 
the defendants denied the men were beaten and said the injuries 
were the result of the car crashes 
papa and rampersant were arrested and charged with attempted 
murder but the brooklyn district attorneys office dropped all 
charges three months later 
a grand jury that investigated the incident in 1987 did not 
return any criminal charges against the officers but criticized 
them for not following proper procedures 
papa was awarded almost 513 million and rampersant 248 
million 
the city planned to appeal the verdict

most americans have had their fill and more 
of news about donald and ivana trump and their martial problems 
says a new poll 
the monthly times mirror news interest index showed a record 55 
percent of the 1226 people surveyed thought there was too much 
news about the trumps domestic battle by far the largest over 
covered rating accorded a particular story since the poll was 
started in 1986 
only about one in 10 americans said they followed the trump 
story very closely while an additional 25 percent said they 
followed it fairly closely even in new york just 15 percent 
fell into the very closely category 
the survey conducted by the gallup organization found no 
single news story dominated public attention in the last month 
the freeing of black south african leader nelson mandela and 
political changes in the soviet union led the index with very 
closely ratings of 30 percent and 28 percent respectively 
a majority expressed annoyance with the media on the cbs 
suspension of 60 minutes commentator andy rooney for allegedly 
making racist remarks to a magazine interviewer 
the suspension was disapproved by 58 percent of the respondents 
while only 24 percent approved the cbs decision was unpopular in 
majorities of every major demographic group except among blacks 
who divided about evenly 38 percent approved 36 percent 
disapproved 
rooney who strongly denied making the disputed statements was 
reinstated after 3 weeks of the original 90day suspension 
the index is sponsored by the times mirror center for the people 
amp the press based on the total sample of 1226 adults the poll 
has a 95 percent chance of being within 3 percentage points of the 
results which would be obtained if the entire adult population were 
interviewed

two army sergeants and seven colombians were behind 
bars today charged with stuffing cocaine into duffel bags and 
using military mail to smuggle the drugs from panama to the united 
states 
the sergeants raphiel fultz and james earl worelds were 
among 20 people indicted by a grand jury wednesday 
us attorney dexter lehtinen said investigators are convinced 
the two were the only us military personnel involved 
were confident that the scope of this operation was shut 
down he said 
the indictment alleges the group made three shipments to the 
united states beginning in october with about nine pounds and 
ending with an estimated 400pound load in february the cocaine 
was packed in duffel bags which were transported through military 
mail then passed on to the us civilian postal system 
its not something new said lionel stewart associate agent 
in charge of the drug enforcement administration office in miami 
this system has been used for many years its something were 
always looking at along with the army 
fultz who was secretly arrested in january after a tip to drug 
agents agreed to cooperate with investigators and helped set up 
the final shipment along with an army undercover agent on feb 27 
the drugs were delivered to a home in sunrise and the colombians 
paid him 100000 for his part 
the scheme began in october well before the united states 
action in panama and culminated in the february shipment 
indicating there was no direct connection with the dec 20 us 
invasion of panama lehtinen said 
but the ring apparently took advantage of the initial us 
pullout in midjanuary to send an estimated 70pound shipment 
lehtinen strongly denied any connection between the case and the 
recent grenade bombing of a panama city nightclub or a series of 
executionstyle slayings in that country 
col mark mueller of the armys criminal investigation division 
said the method used by the ring led to several previous arrests 
in 1988 four people were convicted in columbus ga in an almost 
identical scheme and that same year an army private was arrested 
for smuggling cocaine from panama to puerto rico in his duffel bag 
the army uses drugsniffing dogs and other methods to try to 
stop smuggling through its mail system and has recently intercepted 
other shipments mueller said 
no system is perfect said mueller there are checks but 
were talking about a tremendous volume of equipment people 
materiel so its difficult to check and close every hole 
five people were arrested in panama in the case and four of 
them all colombians were delivered to us authorities here 
under panamanian law the fifth a citizen of panama could not be 
extradited lehtinen said 
three colombians were arrested in south florida for allegedly 
receiving the final cocaine shipment in sunrise and 10 people all 
colombians are fugitives in the case 
the military men apparently came into contact with the 
smalltime colombian drug smugglers in the panamanian port city of 
colon mueller said

a study seen as very good news for women in 
their 30s concludes today that those who delay motherhood until 
they establish their careers face little unusual risk of delivering 
premature or stillborn babies 
the researchers did not check for downs syndrome and other 
genetic disorders which are more common among older womens 
babies because virtually all the mothers underwent testing for 
such problems during pregnancy 
the study in todays new england journal of medicine shows that 
if those in their late 30s and 40s successfully get pregnant for 
the first time and avoid miscarriages chances are good they will 
have healthy children 
the number of women delaying their first pregnancies until late 
in their reproductive lives has increased dramatically according 
to federal statistics the rate of first births among those in 
their 30s has more than doubled since 1970 and among those in 
their early 40s it has increased 50 percent 
most although not all previous studies suggest they might be 
at an increased risk of low birth weight infants and stillbirths as 
well as certain other complications said dr gertrud s 
berkowitz who directed the latest study 
thats why women over the age of 35 have generally been 
considered to be at high risk 
but her study based on 3917 pregnancies shows that older 
women have only a slightly increased risk of producing unusually 
small babies and they are no more likely than younger firsttime 
mothers to deliver prematurely or have stillbirths 
overall their data represent very good news for women in 
their 30s who are contemplating their first pregnancy dr robert 
resnik of the university of california san diego said in an 
accompanying editorial 
berkowitz an epidemiologist at mount sinai school of medicine 
in new york said her findings should reassure women who were like 
those who took part in the study largely white welleducated 
nonsmokers who had private insurance received prenatal care and 
delivered in sophisticated medical centers 
even though this is a very unique group it typifies women who 
are delaying childbearing said berkowitz by and large it is 
women who are doing it for career reasons 
the findings do not mean however that women can postpone 
childbearing indefinitely and still be assured of having a baby as 
women age they become less fertile and even when they get 
pregnant they are more likely to have miscarriages 
the study also showed that those older than 35 are twice as 
likely as younger women to have some health complications of 
pregnancy including diabetes and high blood pressure 
at bostons beth israel hospital dr henry klapholz said many 
doctors have come to accept that women can safely have babies into 
their 40s but he cautioned women over 40 may unexpectedly go 
through menopause ending all chances of pregnancy 
if you are going to do it you should do it as soon as you 
can klapholz said but if you want to put it off until you are 
in your 30s or 40s there is a very good chance of getting pregnant 
and having a successful outcome 
in his editorial resnik said that the message of the latest 
research is clear and highly optimistic 
given sound genetic diagnosis and counseling together with 
appropriate prenatal care and the judicious management of labor and 
delivery he wrote the increasing number of women postponing 
first pregnancies can look forward to excellent outcomes

purveyors of american pop culture face a dilemma 
with the easing of eastwest tension if the russians no longer 
qualify as bad guys who does 
who will james bond outwit who will gi joe pulverize who 
will rambo vanquish singlehandedly 
where have all the villains gone 
where were going to go witchhunting next i dont know 
said brian walker who has seen a host of bad guys vaporized or 
sent to the fourth dimension in his 10year tenure as exhibit 
director of the museum of cartoon art in rye brook ny 
some suggest the new wicked ones in spy movies comic books and 
saturday morning cartoons will be polluters others see the 
japanese and germans making a comeback as the baddies 
the search for the new bad guy has its troubling side for petra 
hesse a college professor and a member of the cambridgebased 
center for psychological studies in the nuclear age 
she recently created a 13minute video program on how children 
may be affected by the images of the enemy in action cartoon 
shows 
the world is a dangerous place images of the enemy on 
childrens television uses clips from rambo and gi 
joe among other progreams to demonstrate how the enemy is 
usually a swarthy foreigner or faceless monster who speaks with 
an accent respects no laws and is evil for the sake of being evil 
at some level yes we do need bad guys but i feel its very 
up in the air what that bad could be she said i dont mind 
bad guys but why cant we diversify 
larry hama a former marvel comics editor who as an artist draws 
gi joe and as an actor frequently plays the bad guy recognizes 
the importance of an effective enemy what is king david without 
the philistines he asked 
villains can be more interesting than heroes too 
look at batman walker said the joker was certainly not 
the hero but he was definitely the star of the movie 
moreover a child needs to see his fantasies and fears come to 
life hama said theres that kid who comes over and steals his 
peanut butter sandwich and stomps his face in the ground at an 
early age you know evil exists and you want some sort of justice 
done 
during the silent movie era everyone knew bankers were evil 
people they took peoples houses they tied women to the railroad 
track hama said 
during world war ii germans and the japanese were the enemy 
nazis especially have served as great bad guys for 50 years 
hama noted from casablanca to the indiana jones movies nazi 
wore black uniforms and menacing expressions and could be counted 
on to hiss we have ways of making you talk 
russian made bad bad guys hama insisted theyre shoddy 
theyre not as cool theres no monocle and dueling scar from 
heidelberg 
hesse wonders if the japanese and germans could again become the 
new supervillains this time armed with microchips and driving 
economy cars 
what the world needs walker and hesse said is not necessarily 
fewer villains but more complex ones 
hesse contends that 4 to 5yearolds see the world in 
blackandwhite terms while 7 to 9yearolds can grasp the 
concept of a bad guy with some redeeming qualities or an enemy 
that comes from within ourselves 
perhaps the real bad guys to todays kids are polluters hesse 
and walker said walker envisions an action cartoon based on a 
group of environmental activists fighting oil spills and other 
such threats to the earth 
maybe its hard to imagine james bond foiling a polluter in the 
same exciting style as a handtohighheel combat with a blonde kgb 
agent whose name is a sexual pun but as walker put it 
kids are saying the enemy is not the russians nor people in 
other countries but more the greedy people raping the environment 
for their own profit

two men who were shot at and beaten by police in 
a case of mistaken identity were awarded 76 million 
a jury deliberated for four hours wednesday before finding that 
the city and five police officers had used excessive force shown 
negligence and committed false arrest and malicious prosecution 
its hard not to feel vindicated with a verdict like that 
said one of the plaintiffs gerard j papa a lawyer and community

papa 36 was driving a friend home in 1986 when they were boxed 
in about 1130 pm by two unmarked police cars police said papa

team that had stolen 10 and a ring from a woman about six days 
earlier 
papa said he thought the plainclothes officers who rushed the 
car with guns drawn were a gang and tried to escape smashing his 
car into the police cars 
the officers said they fired three shots into papas car after 
seeing one or both of them pointing a gun no gun was found inside 
the car 
lawyers for papa a columbia university law school graduate and 
rampersant the son of a baptist minister said the two were 
dragged from the car beaten and kicked by the officers 
they played hollywood they played cowboys and these men had 
the misfortune to be the indians rampersants lawyer keith 
devries told the jury hollywood came to brooklyn and trampled 
on the constitution 
papa and rampersant said they both received concussions in the 
attack and later suffered from psychiatric problems such as phobias 
and depression 
the city and the five officers denied any beatings occurred and 
said the men were injured in the car crashes 
papa and rampersant were charged with attempted murder but 
charges were later dropped a grand jury that investigated the 
incident in 1987 did not indict the officers but criticized them 
for not following procedure 
papa was awarded almost 513 million and rampersant more than 
248 million 
the city said it would appeal

the rush is on to legalize deeds on 
thousands of houses lots and vehicles confiscated by the 
sandinistas who are trying to make it difficult for previous 
owners to recover such property when the new government takes over 
the sandinistas are also moving to strip the government to bare 
bones before the 14party united national opposition coalition 
takes office april 25 
the flurry of giveaways extends even to government office 
supplies 
were going to leave them the offices empty said a 
prosandinista city hall secretary carting home a cardboard box 
full of blank file folders 
the secretary who did not want her name used said she was 
hoping to get an office desk for her home another government gift 
something else the incoming government will have to live without 
is cuban military aid though it doesnt appear to be any love lost 
president fidel castro of cuba announced wednesday in havana 
that he would cut all military assistance to nicaragua by the time 
violeta chamorro takes office maybe even before 
castro was quoted by cubas official news agency prensa latina 
as saying that cuban aid in housing construction and health care 
would remain if the new government wants them 
neither government has ever said how much aid military or 
otherwise castro has been giving the sandinistas during their 
decade in power 
in a series of increasingly defiant speeches since losing the 
feb 25 elections president daniel ortega has vowed the 
sandinistas will defend the conquests of the revolution 
the list of conquests runs from the integrity of the sandinista 
peoples army to a daily glass of milk given small schoolchildren 
it also includes tracks of urban land seized by the government 
and given to poor people on which shantytowns have sprung up most 
without running water 
in the seven weeks before mrs chamorro is inaugurated the 
sandinistas are trying to make confiscations legal 
but theyre also leaving an empty shell of a state structure 
that will make it harder for uno to function as a government 
in the northcentral town of matagalpa uno legal adviser 
santiago rivas said the sandinistas are gutting state enterprises 
he said government officials are giving state property away 
emptying sugar and coffee warehouses registering state vehicles in 
private names or selling them off 
although he offered no proof rivas said officials also are 
funneling public money into foreign bank accounts 
we are going to take over a government totally in ruins 
rivas said we are inheriting a bankrupt government 
a bill allowing tenants to claim legal ownership of state 
housing was to be read before the sandinistadominated national 
assembly today 
the bill covers more than 10000 homes nationwide the homes 
have been awarded rented or loaned to the tenants usually 
sandinista party militants or government officials many of the 
previous owners were supporters associates or relatives of 
dictator anastasio somoza who the sandinistas overthrew 
some homes were seized by the state through the law of 
absence under which nicaraguans who leave the country for more 
than six months are subject to the confiscation of their property 
the law was aimed at antisandinista exiles who fled nicaragua 
by the thousands after the july 1979 sandinista revolution 
but in other cases people who just happened to be living 
outside the country for longer than six months returned to find 
their homes occupied by sandinista officials 
in principle the reigning idea is to award the houses to the 
people already living in them as long as they belong to the 
state said rafael solis first secretary and deputy of the 
national assembly 
but well have to see what solution we give to those persons 
occupying privately owned homes 
the singlechamber national assembly now is dominated by the 
sandinistas who have 61 seats to 35 from six opposition parties 
come april 25 however uno will be dominant with election 
returns showing it gained 52 seats to 39 for the sandinistas an 
extremeleft party the revolutionary unity movement obtained one 
seat 
uno leaders have said they do not plan to simply return all 
confiscated property but to establish special tribunals that will 
hear claims and decide on a casebycase basis 
confiscated farmland that has been distributed to peasants in 
cooperatives will not be returned to previous owners uno said

the sandinista army is delivering 
truckloads of assault rifles to civilians in what one international 
observer calls a time bomb that could disrupt the transition to 
opposition rule 
sandinista leaders say theyll hand over the government april 
25 but their local forces dont appear ready to give their guns to 
the united national opposition which they fear will return 
confiscated land to previous owners 
all the barrios have guns they are all defending their 
land said francisca castileblanco a party organizer in barrio 
roger angin a slum of 400 homes without water and electricity on 
confiscated land on the edge of jinotega 
mrs castileblanco a 52yearold tortilla vendor then went 
into her house a ramshackle shell of mismatched planks and tin 
over a dirt floor and pulled out her new ak47 
it is one of 400 assault rifles she and her neighbors said the 
army delivered on feb 27 two days after uno defeated the 
sandinistas in elections mrs castileblanco and her neighbors say 
the ak47s were distributed to anyone age 15 and over 
the army a party organ is delivering truckloads of the weapons 
to civilians in jinotega and matagalpa provinces who live in the 
poor neighborhoods the leftist sandinistas regard as their social 
base 
international observers diplomats and opposition officials are 
worried about the largescale distribution of weapons at a time 
when tensions are so high 
its a time bomb said luis serrano part of the 
organization of american states observer team monitoring matagalpa 
and jinotega provinces 
highranking sandinista officials in jinotega and matagalpa at 
first denied civilians were being armed 
when confronted with evidence the officials asserted they were 
creating a selfdefense network to fend off possible attacks by 
contra forces that the sandinistas have been battling for years 
but they also acknowledged that guns are going to people living 
on land confiscated after the 1979 revolution areas the party 
regards as its roots 
the sandinistas have said they will defend the conquests of 
the revolution including opposing any efforts to return land to 
previous owners and possibly other aspects of the conservative 
economic policies of the new government of presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorro 
uno officials say they wont dislodge peasants from land that is 
being worked even if it was expropriated under sandinista rule 
there is a little tension acknowledged col manuel 
salvatierra the regional military commander there is a lot of 
uncertainty about what will happen when the new government takes 
over 
uno officials say they have reports of arms being distributed in 
several other provinces 
uno representatives have met with topranking regional officials 
of the sandinista party and the sandinista army said santiago 
rivas unos legal adviser in matagalpa 78 miles north of managua 
weve argued that they shouldnt give arms to civilians it 
could provoke a civil war rivas said in an interview 
sandinista gangs known as turbas have demonstrated in 
jinotega 100 miles north of managua and in matagalpa since the 
election intimidated uno supporters have stayed at home rather 
than celebrate the coalitions resounding victory at the polls 
they are afraid of provoking the sandinistas said the rev 
eliar pineda a roman catholic priest in jinotega whose family 
backed uno 
rivas said uno fears an attempt to destabilize the country 
during the delicate transition from a leftist sandinista government 
to the uno with its freemarket philosphy 
the top sandinista leadership seems disposed to hand over 
power but at the midlevel there are those who want to create a 
coup at the base of the party he said

cubas fidel castro says hell stop sending 
military aid to nicaragua when the ruling sandinistas turn over the 
government to the usbacked opposition next month cubas 
official news agency said 
the communist president increasingly isolated after the fall of 
hardline communists in eastern europe last year also accused four 
former east bloc allies of becoming us puppets 
the four countries poland czechoslovakia hungary and 
bulgaria supported a un resolution this week that criticized 
cubas human rights record 
the cuban news agency prensa latina monitored in mexico city 
quoted castro at a speech wednesday before a cuban womens 
organization in havana 
castro had close ties with nicaragua ruled by the leftist 
sandinistas for a decade until the general elections feb 25 
when violeta barrios de chamorro and her opposition coalition 
defeated president daniel ortega 
our military cooperation will be withdrawn when the new 
government takes office it would not be possible to maintain our 
presence with a government which has shown its dislike for the 
cuban revolution castro said 
it is possible we could leave earlier if the sandinistas agree 
to it mrs chamorro is due to take office april 25 
castro said cuban assistance in housing construction and health 
care could continue if nicaraguas new government desires cuba has 
sent doctors technicians and brigades of volunteers to help build 
houses it is generally believed some of these are military 
personnel but neither havana nor managua have disclosed any 
figures on cuban workers in nicaragua 
the cuban president said his country would no longer supply 
nicaragua with petroleum and food in recent days the united 
states and britain have promised aid to nicaragua 
exact figures on cuban military aid have never been announced by 
havana or managua however the us state department said in a 
report last year that moscow provided about 500 million in 
military aid to nicaragua in 1988 
the soviet union has since said it would stop sending military 
aid to managua most observers believe moscow has been providing 
the military hardware to nicaragua while cubas aid has been more 
in terms of military advisers 
castro blamed the united states and world events for the 
sandinista loss 
analyzing the results of the elections they were a challenge 
accepted by the sandinistas in adverse conditions amid a dirty war 
imposed by the united states and an economic crisis generated by 
the us blockade castro was quoted as saying 
the elections took place a few weeks after the fall of 
socialist governments in eastern europe and the sandinistas had 
to make many concessions and made mistakes he added he did not 
elaborate 
he accused eastern european governments of becoming us 
puppets saying they had fallen into the lap of the empire that 
is the enemy of mankind the oppressor the invader 
the governments and current leaders in czechoslovakia poland 
hungary and bulgaria will have to accept responsibility for the 
blood that spills in cuba if the united states dares to attack our 
country castro said 
the four countries broke ranks with the soviet union on tuesday 
to support a us resolution critical of cubas human rights 
policies 
the measure described as very moderate by us chief 
delegate armando valladares a former cuban political prisoner was 
adopted 1912 by the un human rights commission 
the resolution expressed concern at reports that witnesses 
who testified before commission members visiting cuba on an 
unprecedented factfinding mission in 1988 were subsequently 
subject to arrest harassment and other reprisals cuba calls such 
people counterrevolutionaries 
castro has now lost his only close friends in latin america 
leadership with the sandinista electoral loss and the us ouster 
of manuel antonio noriega of panama in decembers invasion 
noriega is in a miami jail awaiting trial on drug charges

a plot to extort 10 million from the du 
pont co for the return of stolen trade secrets on the manufacture 
of lycra paid off in jail terms for three men 
us district judge joseph longobardi sentenced the mastermind 
of the scheme 52yearold bruno skerianz to 6 years in prison 
wednesday his accomplices raul armando giordano 37 and antonio 
ruben inigo 40 drew 3 years 
the three argentines were convicted in december of conspiracy 
and attempted extortion 
lycra the companys trade name for spandex is an elastic fiber 
used in swimsuits and leotards prosecutors said du pont was given 
the choice of paying 10 million for the documents or having them 
sold to a competitor 
the documents were stolen from du ponts lycra plant in 
mercedes argentina where giordano and inigo had worked skerianz 
worked for the company more than 20 years ago 
the defendants attorneys said they would appeal 
du pont spokesman r john malloy said the sentences will be a 
strong deterrent for those who might consider doing similar 
things 
the defense claimed skerianz did not attempt extortion rather 
they said du pont learned he and the others had the documents and 
approached them with the 10 million to keep the papers from 
falling into the hands of a competitor 
giordano admitted through an interpreter wednesday that he took 
six or seven operations manuals from the plant 
a fourth defendant jose petrosino is fighting extradition from 
italy 
du pont controls more than half the spandex market worldwide and 
sold more than 600 million of the product in 1988

the battle was over charging rent to dockside 
merchants but as anthony captain tony tarracino the former 
skipper and barkeep elected mayor put it the fight was over a 
lot more than you could see 
at stake said the 73yearold tarracino was key wests 
bohemian ambience which some see as endangered 
after the city commission last month voted to charge far lower 
rent than tarracino feared he headed to the full moon cafe to 
celebrate past midnight with other friends of key wests nightly 
sunset festival a collection of vendors who sell snacks crafts 
caricatures and tarot readings on mallory square dock 
but the effort to protect the vendors from big money 
interests remains an uphill fight said tarracino 
theyll be back he said theyre like barracudas they 
dont let up 
the debate over charging rent to the vendors brought out the 
conflicts facing the city 
many businessmen say key west must raise revenues to pay the 
costs of living on a popular island such as skyrocketing prices 
for water which must be piped in from the mainland 100 miles away 
and sewage treatment which has become more costly because of 
floridas environmental protection push 
its just a matter of economics said richard heyman a 
twotime former mayor who operates an art gallery if you want to 
be here youre going to have to pay the price 
to attract wellheeled tourists and new residents the city has 
tried to change a raucous image officials sent a letter to 
colleges warning that lawless behavior wouldnt be tolerated and 
ordinances have been passed against noise outdoor display of 
tshirts and some pushcart vendors 
more pricey restaurants and bars are springing up alongside such 
longtime local favorites as sloppy joes capt tonys and jimmy 
buffetts margaritaville cafe which has a souvenir shop in which 
tshirts carrying the lyrics of buffetts songs celebrating the 
keys lifestyle sell for 1395 each 
during the city commission meeting feb 26 tempers flared 
during debate over a city lease with the cultural preservation 
society representing the sunset vendors who had never paid rent 
before the city commission had voted 32 at its previous meeting 
to charge 48000 for an annual lease 
but commissioner sally lewis moved by complaints the sunset 
festival was threatened succeeded in putting a 24000 annual 
ceiling on the rent based on a 2 nightly charge per vendor the 
lease requires the rent go for dock improvements performers who 
depend upon donations wont be charged 
the sunset festival has evolved over two decades into a ritual 
that draws hundreds of tourists each evening while awaiting sunset 
over the sea they are entertained by offbeat performances such as 
housecats jumping through flaming hoops or a man who balances a 
bicycle on his nose 
the businessmen downtown saw money being made and they wanted 
it said lester gibbs who moved 23 years ago from festus mo 
these are nickelanddime operations and theyre trying to take 
it away from us 
businessmen scoffed at arguments that what they call a flea 
market is essential to the ambience that lured ernest hemingway and 
playwright tennessee williams to live and write here

many schools are announcing some of the smallest 
tuition increases in a decade and some college officials attribute 
that to costcutting moves with resultant savings being passed on 
to students 
but some higher education leaders believe next falls modest 
increases also are a response to a growing sense of outrage among 
students legislators and others after a decade in which tuition 
increases far outstripped inflation 
i think were approaching the end of the big increases said 
robert atwell president of the american council of education 
whats doing it is the demographics the student response the 
legislative response in some cases the governing boards getting 
interested in this issue the editorial boards of newspapers and 
magazines 
especially sobering said atwell and others has been a recent 
falloff in applications at many colleges including top ones such 
as harvard suggesting that schools no longer can simply raise 
their rates with impunity 
stanford university is raising fixed student fees by 525 
percent in 199091 to 20210 the smallest increase in 15 years 
and considerably less than the 8 percent hike in the current year 
the smaller increase results from a 22 million costcutting 
program school officials said 
this week massachusetts institute of technology announced its 
rates next fall will rise to 20700 a 71 percent increase 
compared to 72 percent the previous year 
the university of michigan and wayne state university are 
holding increases to the lowest level in years 65 percent a 
year ago michigan posted a 96 percent increase 
the iowa board of regents which oversees the university of 
iowa iowa state university and the university of northern iowa 
approved a 3 percent rise for 199091 the smallest in a decade 
columbia college announced a 57 percent increase the smallest 
in more than 20 years 
harvards fall tuitions wont be announced until later this 
month but spokesman peter costa said fees probably will be up 5 
percent to 7 percent 
average tuitions rose 5 percent to 9 percent during the current 
school year according to the college boards most recent annual 
college cost survey 
costs rose in double digits from 1981 through 1984 rates at 
fouryear public colleges shot up 20 percent in 198384 they 
leveled into the 59 percent range for the past five years 
still some like richard rosser president of the national 
association of independent colleges and universities arent ready 
to declare an end to the college cost spiral 
he and others point out that next falls announced increases are 
all over the map with some still in double digits and 
students on several campuses have protested steep increases in 
recent weeks 
such protests would seem to indicate a mood change from previous 
years when students paid their tuition with barely a murmur even as 
rates were climbing by as much as 20 percent 
next falls more modest increases also may reflect nervousness 
in academia over a continuing us justice department investigation 
of at least 56 private colleges the probe is looking into whether 
school officials are improperly collaborating in setting tuition 
and financial aid

todays editions of the st louis postdispatch 
hit the streets without bylines as reporters and columnists 
withheld their names to express unhappiness over a proposed 
contract 
the byline strike which began wednesday was approved in a 
vote sunday by local 47 of the st louis newspaper guild 
about 600 union members have been working without a contract 
since their old pact expired midnight feb 28 the guild the 
largest of 11 unions at the newspaper is one of six that have not 
reached agreement on a new contract 
talks between the newspaper and its unions were to resume today 
herb goodrick the locals executive director said wednesday 
that he thought the byline strike the first in the papers 
history was effective 
its to show that theyre embarrased to put their name on a 
paper that takes the bargaining position that the post has taken 
goodrick said 
photographers also were withholding their names from photo 
credits 
publisher nicholas penniman had no comment other than to say 
that the writers were within their rights to withhold their bylines 
under the contract 
the dispute comes at a time when the postdispatch has new 
competition the nonunion st louis sun started in the fall by 
ingersoll publications co the postdispatch founded in 1878 is 
owned by pulitzer publishing co 
goodrick said two issues drug testing and a system that would 
pay new hires lower wages prevented acceptance of a contract 
proposal in october 
but the companys latest proposal deleted a 4 percent 
costofliving increase and added other points of disagreement 
including the denial of sick leave to employees who contract 
illnesses through immorality 
goodrick said the union had not threatened a real strike against 
the newspaper 
at this point weve tried to be very restrained and 
responsible goodrick said our objective is to get an 
agreement a strike is one of the tools for that but we think 
there are other steps we can take before that

china today denied its security forces have 
stepped up surveillance of foreign reporters and implied that 
journalists complaints of harassment were a smokescreen for 
illegal activities 
foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing also denounced a us 
embassy investigation into intimidation of american journalists in 
beijing calling it interference in chinas internal affairs 
correspondents from nearly a dozen foreign news organizations 
including those from the united states europe and the soviet 
union say they have been followed or their chinese sources 
harassed by chinese plainclothes police in recent weeks 
li who has so far refused a request by foreign correspondents 
to discuss the alleged harassment said such reports were 
groundless 
if the report was the result of oversensitivity to the extent 
of excessive suspicion on the part of a few correspondents well 
that would not matter much li said 
but if it was the result of an attempt by certain individuals 
to create by spreading rumors a smokescreen for their own illegal 
activities and to extricate themselves from their predicament or 
worse still to deliberately disrupt the stability and unity in 
china for ulterior purposes that would indeed call for the 
vigilance of all kindhearted people including large numbers of 
media people 
reporters who carry out normal and legitimate news coverage 
need not worry that they might run into troubles he said 
he said the us state department had no right to direct the 
embassy in beijing to investigate the alleged intimidation of 
american journalists 
should an investigation be really necessary the 
justiceupholding people in the world would have every reason to 
ask how many things has this superpower done in broad daylight 
over the years to trample upon the sovereignty and infringe upon 
the human rights of other nations 
he added referring to the us invasion of panama how many 
innocent panamanians were killed and how many houses and how much 
property were destroyed how many people were rendered homeless and 
deprived of their basic freedoms 
uschina relations which plummeted after chinas military 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in june hit another low 
point last month after the state department issued a report 
detailing widespread abuses of human rights in china china has 
responded by assailing the united states human rights record and 
its interference in the affairs of other countries 
the surveillance of foreign reporters appeared to step up after 
martial law was lifted in beijing on jan 11 with some journalists 
saying they have been tailed even while jogging or shopping 
journalists say chinese security agents have also tried to 
photograph their meetings with chinese sources and have 
interrogated their chinese contacts

people who want to hold cigarette makers liable 
for their products got a discouraging signal from a jury that ruled 
american tobacco co shouldnt be held accountable for a smokers 
lungcancer death a lawyer said 
this just puts a further chill on anyone having the audacity 
to take on one of the empires of industry said eric nissen one 
of the attorneys who brought the lawsuit 
a federal jury ruled in favor of the cigarette company wednesday 
after a threeweek trial the case marked one of the rare occasions 
such a suit had reached the courtroom 
in 1988 a federal jury in new jersey awarded the first damages 
against a cigarette company giving 400000 to antonio cipollone 
whose wife died of lung cancer but an appeals court this year 
overturned the award and ordered a new trial 
richard daynard a northeastern university law professor who 
heads a project that helps lawyers who sue tobacco companies 
predicted the american tobacco case would be appealed 
but he added that the ruling in the boston case means you need 
to have a little more to go on than simply a failure to warn 
the suit was filed by joanne kotler of cambridge whose husband 
george started smoking when he was 11 he died of lung cancer in 
1986 at 55 
the plaintiffs argued that american tobacco a subsidiary of 
american brands inc in greenwich conn should have warned the 
public of the dangers of cigarette smoking before the government 
required warning labels in 1966 
andrew lane an attorney for american tobacco declined to 
comment on the verdict earlier wednesday during closing 
arguments he stressed that kotler had ample opportunity to quit 
smoking but chose to continue his habit 
in spite of todays decision i still feel that my husbands 
generation of smokers was consciously misled about the dangers of 
smoking said mrs kotler i do know that this is one battle 
and the war still can be won its not over and this case isnt 
over 
lane told the jury wednesday that the first credible evidence 
linking lung cancer to smoking surfaced in the 1950s but the 
studies were not definitive and some medical experts disagreed with 
the findings he further argued that warnings would not have made a 
difference for kotler 
forty million people have stopped smoking lane said they 
made the decision thats what this case is really about choice 
garry inge representing mrs kotler said the addictive nature 
of nicotine contributed to kotlers habit

a woman was sentenced to five years in 
prison for shooting her husband to death after an argument over her 
cooking that climaxed some 27 years of beatings and drunken abuse 
judge william e crane on wednesday imposed the maximum sentence 
for a conviction of homicide by negligent use of a weapon despite 
testimony that virginia eagan suffered an abuserelated emotional 
disturbance known as battered wife syndrome 
people have to face up to responsibility crane said 
battered woman syndrome doesnt warrant killing someone 
mrs eagan was convicted by a jury jan 31 of shooting her 
husband of 32 years eugene eagan during a july 2 argument 
eagan 56 was disabled since a work accident and walked with 
the help of canes with which he often beat his wife according to 
both the prosecutor and defense attorney 
mrs eagan said the beatings had begun five years into the 
marriage 
trial testimony indicated the shooting followed a sunday evening 
quarrel in which eagan criticized the way his wife cooked boiled 
potatoes and beets 
mrs eagan grabbed a handgun from the pantry and shot her 
husband once at close range after he taunted her saying you 
dont have any guts you wont do it 
defense attorney george curtis said that imprisoning mrs eagan 
53 a factory worker who is going blind was cruel and compounded 
the familys tragedy 
this lady has gone through hell and doesnt deserve another 
minute of it she was a helpless victim curtis said

the 30 magnitude quake struck at 303 am said bob finn 
spokesman for the seismology lab at the california institute of 
technology in pasadena it was centered 2 miles west of highland 
park he said 
i was asleep and it felt like some shook the hell out of my 
bed said chris harris of hollywood i hardly ever wake up but 
this time i did nothing fell down but the pictures on the wall are 
at an angle 
it felt pretty small and quick here said county sheriffs

struck the san francisco area last october causing dozens of 
deaths and billions of dollars in damage

damage 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 6 severe damage 
a 7 reading is a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy 
damage 8 is a great quake capable of tremendous damage

a city with rising unemployment is offering a 
prize and tax breaks to new private businesses a report said 
today in a break with the current anticapitalist trend 
the northeast industrial city of shenyang has started a glory 
cup competition for people starting private businesses who create 
jobs for themselves or others the official xinhua news agency said 
it said one city district set aside the equivalent of 83000 to 
help start new private businesses and shenyang was offering 
preferential treatment in taxation and simplified bureaucratic 
procedures 
li zidan a tailor said she was perplexed and discouraged 
because of disputes about individual businesses in the past few 
months xinhua reported but since the municipal government 
launched the glory cup competition she has felt confident about 
the future of the private sector 
li is not the only confused and discouraged entrepreneur 
ever since conservative leaders cracked down on massive 
prodemocracy protests last year the state media have harshly 
attacked private businessmen for making too much money and living 
better than ordinary workers 
local governments started policing them for tax payment and 
enforcing other formerly ignored regulations forcing many out of 
business banks stopped loaning them money 
top communist party officials branded them bourgeois and 
said the private sector must be controlled so it does not threaten 
the socialist system the number of private businesses dropped 144 
percent to 124 million 
shenyangs proprivate measures seem a case of ideology being 
defeated by practical considerations xinhua quoted local officials 
as saying that state companies do not have enough openings for new 
middle school graduates 
the number of unemployed could reach 103000 this year about 3 
percent of the nonfarming population of 33 million it said 
the actual figure is probably far higher as chinese 
unemployment figures do not include young people who are waiting to 
be assigned their first job or workers idled by factory slowdowns 
or temporary shutdowns 
the national government also may be forced to soften it stand 
toward private businesses 
the state planning commission has said that 12 million people 
will enter the urban work force this year but government offices 
and state factories will be able to employ only 5 million the rest 
will be forced to seek work in collective enterprises such as 
small factories run by neighborhood committees or the private 
sector 
liu minxue director of the state administration for industry 
and commerce said recently that while private business must be 
only a supplement to the stateowned economy the country should 
help them develop in a healthy way

fairbanks alaska his filipino wife and fatherinlaw in an ambush 
on the central island bohol 
one rebel arrested in the killing said gunmen were out to get 
mitchells fatherinlaw for failing to pay revolutionary taxes 
in september rebels killed two american civilians working at a 
us military installation about 60 miles north of manila on the 
day vice president dan quayle arrived for an official visit 
in april rebels killed us army col james nick rowe in an 
ambush on a busy street in suburban quezon city rowe a vietnam 
war hero was assigned to the joint us military assistance group 
in the philippines 
in october 1987 three americans and a filipino civilian were 
killed by rebels in a series of attacks around clark air base 50 
miles north of manila

a dimes worth of difference is nothing to 
sneeze at where the internal revenue service is concerned 
when mary frances stinson of dorchester mass filed her tax 
return in 1987 she was 10 cents short on her payment nearly three 
years later the irs notified her that the 10cent debt had grown to 
5494 because of interest and penalties 
the computergenerated form letter said the irs had assessed a 
24 latepayment penalty plus 3084 interest on the late payment 
however the billing noted that under the law the penalty cannot 
exceed 25 percent of the late payment in this case that would be 
2 cents 
the interest rate charged on late payments has been averaging 
around 10 percent or about a penny a year calculated from the 
april 15 1987 due date of ms stinsons return to the oct 30 
1989 date of the irss latepayment letter 
ms stinson took her case to the national coalition of irs 
whistleblowers a washingtonbased organization established by the 
church of scientology which gave a copy of the bill to a reporter 
ms stinson could not be reached to determine the outcome of the 
case and the irs is prohibited by law from comment on tax files 
however irs spokesman wilson fadely said today that since a 
stamp costs 25 cents i wouldnt think we would even send a 
notice on 10 cents due if an erroneous bill is sent he added 
you should just write and tell us

security forces fired tear gas and rubber 
bullets to disperse hundreds of palestinian women who staged 
antioccupation marches today in the west bank and arab east 
jerusalem police and arab reports said 
at least 17 demonstrators were hit by rubber bullets or 
rubbercoated metal balls including a teenager shot and wounded 
in the head arab reporters said one of the protests was broken up 
in the walled old city of jerusalem 
army and police said they were checking the casualty reports 
the demonstrations were organized by underground leaders of the 
27monthold palestinian uprising to coincide with international 
womens day 
protesters carried placards calling on prime minister yitzhak 
shamir to negotiate with the plo and demanding a palestinian state 
shamir you must talk to the plo read a banner carried in a 
march of about 200 women in the west bank town of ramallah yes 
to the cairo dialogue that will lead to an international peace 
conference said another placard held by marchers in the biblical 
west bank city of bethlehem 
shamir head of the rightwing likud bloc refuses to negotiate 
with the plo saying it is a terror organization his fear that the 
plo would dominate palestinian negotiatiors has held up a 
ussupported plan to hold preliminary negotiations between 
palestinians and israel in cairo 
one of the worst clashes today occurred in israeliannexed east 
jerusalem where riot police fired rubber bullets to disperse about 
100 palestinian women near the walled old citys damascus gate at 
least six women were hit by rubber bullets according to 
journalists at the scene 
following the march palestinian youths took to nearby streets 
throwing stones and empty bottles at passing israeli cars said 
jerusalem police spokesman uzi sandori 
about one dozen demonstrators also overturned an israeli car in 
nearby salah edin street said associated press reporter haitham 
hamad the youths also broke the windows of a car belonging to a 
tax collector 
six mounted policemen and officers on foot carrying shields and 
clubs chased the youths who escaped into the bustle of east 
jerusalems central bus station sandori said 10 palestinians were 
arrested 
there have been sporadic antiisraeli protests in east 
jerusalem which palestinians consider the capital of a state they 
hope to establish one day but the violence has been far less than 
in the west bank and gaza strip during the uprising against israeli 
occupation 
in ramallah troops fired rubber bullets at about 200 women and 
chased the fleeing demonstrators into the citys old market arab 
reporters said 
ten women hit by rubber bullets were treated at ramallah 
hospital and released a hospital official said 
another demonstration of about 200 women in the west bank town 
of jenin was dispersed when soldiers fired tear gas and 
rubbercoated bullets arab reports said 
hospital officials said a 17yearold girl was injured in the 
head by a rubbercoated metal ball but an army spokesman denied 
soldiers fired such ammunition the rubbercoated metal balls are 
more likely to cause serious injuries than rubbercoated bullets 
in nablus also in the west bank soldiers fired tear gas to 
disperse about 400 women and confiscated palestinian flags and 
banners arab reports said one of the banners raid yes to the 
palestinian peace process

israeli soldiers shot and killed five 
shiite moslem guerrillas today in south lebanon officials in 
lebanon and israel said 
the guerrillas involved in the predawn clash were members of 
the proiranian moslem fundamentalist group hezbollah said maj 
gen yossi peled head of the israeli armys northern command 
they apparently came to attack one of our positions or to 
plant explosives in the security zone a sixto10mile area in 
southern lebanon that is controlled by israel and allied 
militiamen peled said on israel radio 
a security source in lebanon who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the israelis opened fire with tank cannons killing 
five guerrillas after spotting the squad in the zommaraya district 
of the security zone 
a fierce battle with machine guns automatic rifles and 
rocketpropelled grenades ensued after the israeli assault as 
other guerrillas tried to recover the bodies the source said 
israeli officials said the guerrillas were armed with large 
quantities of explosives hand grenades and five sovietmade 
kalashnikov rifles the radio reported the military said israel 
suffered no casualties in the encounter 
israel radio quoted sources in the un peacekeeping force in 
lebanon as saying israelibacked militiamen of the south lebanon 
army exchanged mortar fire with guerrillas through the morning 
guerrillas later fired a salvo of about six katyusha rockets at 
an israeli army outpost in the town of hasbaya on the eastern edge 
of the zone 
the days fighting was the first clash in south lebanon between 
israeli forces and guerrillas since feb 14 when one guerrilla was 
slain and three captured israel has since staged three bombing 
raids against guerrilla targets in south lebanon 
israel maintained control over the border area across south 
lebanon when it withdrew the bulk of its invading army in the 
summer of 1985 three years after they moved over the border the 
zone serves as a buffer against crossborder guerrilla attacks in 
northern israel

a group of writers and academics is starting a 
journal with the aim of bringing liberal ideas back to the top of 
the national agenda 
the american prospect scheduled to debut sunday and be 
published quarterly marks the rebirth of noapologies 
liberalism according to a release 
were not neoliberals or postliberals or any other hybrid 
were liberals said coeditor robert kuttner 
the entry of the journal coincides with the exit of the cold war 
and its attending fixation on military issues the editors said 
a lot of the antagonisms that arose in the 1960s have died 
out said paul starr a princeton university sociologist who will 
be one of the magazines two editors we think americas 
challenges today are mainly social and economic 
the first issue contains several meditations on the role of 
liberalism in the 1990s a feature article on the real welfare 
problem and a pollsters blueprint on how the democratic party 
can reclaim middleclass votes without moving to the right of the 
political spectrum 
the journals board of sponsors includes economist john kenneth 
galbraith historian arthur m schlesinger jr and marian wright 
edelman founder of the childrens defense fund 
who will pay 795 for the journal 
my simplistic vision is of a great emerging army of liberal 
people who dont have anything to attach themselves to no clear 
policy directions no distinct political directions no distinct 
public philosphy certainly no leaders robert reich a harvard 
university economist and chairman of the editorial board said in 
the new york times

the internal revenue service is prepared to go 
to court to force 90 defense lawyers in drug cases to tell the 
source of large cash fees 
we are talking about the hardnut cases where we have made 
repeated attempts to get the information and have not been 
successful says irs publicaffairs director ellen murphy 
the irs which is playing a major role in the governments 
battle against illegal drugs is acting under a 1985 law requiring 
anyone accepting a cash payment of 10000 or more to file a form 
8300 spelling out the source of the money 
the agency wrote 965 lawyers last fall that the forms they had 
filed were incomplete since that time ms murphy said all but 90 
have supplied the required information those 90 cases have been 
referred to irs district offices around the country 
in those cases we plan to pursue summonses in order to get 
the information ms murphy said if we dont get compliance 
with the administrative summonses we will refer the cases to the 
department of justice for enforcement action in district court 
justice department spokesman david runkel said the department 
has assured the irs that each case will be reviewed on its merits 
to determine whether a summons enforcement proceeding should be 
instituted 
continued refusal to provide the information could result in 
jail sentences for the attorneys 
neal sonnett of miami president of the national association of 
criminal defense lawyers predicted attorneys will go to jail 
rather than comply we cannot allow in this country the war 
against drugs to become the war against lawyers and a war against 
the bill of rights and thats whats happening sonnett said 
ms murphy acknowledged that there is obviously the 
attorneyclient privilege issue in these cases but we believe that 
has been addressed in the instructions for form 8300 
this is a form that can be avoided simply by not accepting 
large cash payments we are talking about 10000 paid in a lump 
sum ms murphy said 
a former federal prosecutor who specialized in drug cases said 
the information sought by the irs would enable investigators to 
piece together tax cases against suspected drug dealers 
if all of a sudden a drug dealer is shown paying 25000 in 
cash in legal fees all of a sudden he has to account for 25000 
it identifies the fact that individuals have assets said the 
former prosecutor who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
james holden chairman of the tax division of the american bar 
association said the dispute between lawyers and the irs is likely 
to end up before the supreme court 
this is something of a holy grail issue with attorneys much 
like the first amendment is with publishers holden said 
i think it is unfortunate that congress included lawyers 
when requiring any person with a trade or business such as car 
dealers furriers or jewelers to report receiving 10000 or more 
in cash he said 
holden said the aba is asking the justice department to 
exercise discretion in deciding whether to seek court action to 
look at each case carefully and see whether there is a legitimate 
claim of attorneyclient privilege

a house subcommittee will ask a federal court 
to grant immunity to a top deputy to reagan administration housing 
secretary samuel r pierce jr in return for his testimony about 
abuses at the agency sources said today 
the former pierce deputy dubois gilliam is currently serving a 
federal prison sentence for a conviction in a hudrelated case and 
according to subcommittee sources the panel will ask that the court 
approve an immunity grant protecting him from further prosecution 
the sources speaking on the condition of anonymity said former 
federal judge arlin adams who is the independent counsel leading 
an investigation of pierce and several top aides did not object to 
the request to grant gilliam immunity 
pierces attorney paul perito has predicted the independent 
counsel will exonerate pierce of any wrongdoing perito questioned 
whether gilliam would provide accurate testimony or would seek to 
curry favor for a reduced sentence 
the panel chairman rep tom lantos dcalif was to announce 
the plans at a news conference today the development was first 
reported in todays editions of the new york times and the wall 
street journal 
gilliam according to the sources is expected to testify that 
pierce directed him to steer department of housing and urban 
development money to political and business allies subcommittee 
aides recently met with gilliam at the federal prison in lompoc 
calif where he is serving an 18month sentence 
pierce and several former top aides have refused to testify 
before the subcommittee citing their fifth amendment rights 
against selfincrimination among them was deborah dean pierces 
former top aide the panel considered granting her immunity but has 
dropped the idea gilliam would be the first witness to appear 
under such an arrangement 
gilliam as part of a plea agreement in the mississippi case 
pleaded guilty to accepting cash gifts from a hud contractor and 
conspiring to use a hud grant for personal gain 
gilliam was a deputy assistant secretary for community 
development at hud and considered one of pierces most trusted 
aides documents released last year by hud under the freedom of 
information act show that requests for funds often were routed 
through gilliam 
his job gave him immediate supervision over a technical 
assistance program whose funding was largely discretionary many 
awards under the program were made after contractors made 
unsolicited proposals to the department and hud auditors have 
roundly criticized the program for allowing contractors to use the 
bulk of their cash for personnel and overhead costs 
gilliams division at hud also oversaw the urban development 
action grant program which is now virtually defunct but was a 
favorite of municipal officials seeking federal money for a variety 
of development projects

editor of endeavor a newspaper written and produced by the men on 
death row said wednesday i think shes just trying to be a 
human being i think she recognizes people can change because shes

james beathard an assistant editor also said he would favor 
ms richards saying the texas treasurer appeared to be 
concentrating more on issues like schools minorities womens 
rights and the budget but he added that inmate support for ms 
richards likely would hurt her rather than help her in the election 
but its us theyre trying to kill and we should have a right 
to comment about the people who are trying to kill us said 
beathard awaiting death for a 1984 spree in which three people 
were killed 
asked to comment on the inmates endorsement ms richards 
campaigning in san antonio for tuesdays primary first thought the 
question was a joke 
i dont know what possibly could have engendered it she 
said i dont know anybody on death row my view on the death 
penalty is that its the law and that the law should be carried out 
i think perhaps they are contrasting me with a guy who goes on 
tv and struts up and down in front of pictures of people who have 
been executed its macabre and strange what i think this campaign 
is about is life law 
capital punishment has been the focus of television commercials 
from ms richards two democratic opponents attorney general jim 
mattox and former gov mark white in their ads mattox and white 
take credit for making texas the nations leader in executions 
among states that have the death penalty since texas resumed the 
death penalty in 1982 33 men have been given lethal injections 
endeavor editors and other inmates were particularly upset with 
a white commercial in which large pictures of the executed 
prisoners are used as props 
inmate lester bower who closely follows capital punishment 
legal issues estimated about half of the more than 300 texas death 
row inmates were eligible to vote since their direct appeals still 
were pending once a conviction is affirmed by the supreme court 
the inmate loses his right to vote said bower awaiting death for 
the slayings of four men in 1983 
the newspaper in existence for nearly a year is believed to be 
the only one of its kind among the nations death rows

a sheriff who seized a national guard 
armory when he ran out of space at his centuryold jail says he has 
agreed to move to the states suggested compromise site a vacant 
armory in nearby holyoke 
the sheriff must have a temporary solution workable with the 
state until the new jail site is built in ludlow the sheriff has 
therefore determined to support the states decision richard 
mccarthy spokesman for hampden county sheriff michael ashe said 
wednesday 
holyoke mayor martin dunn said city lawyers will oppose the 
move involving a site across from a preschool and kindergarten 
i think the decision is ridiculous dunn said i will 
fight it as long as it needs to be fought 
the tentative agreement worked out between the state and ashe 
was scheduled to go before hampden county superior court judge 
george keady today 
national guard officials said they would wait until an agreement 
was final before making any comment 
ashe seized a national guard armory in springfield on feb 16 
saying he had a choice between taking the building or putting more 
than a dozen prisoners on the streets 
after the state tried to evict ashe he won a temporary court 
order giving him the right to stay at his makeshift jail since 
then state and county lawyers have been working on a compromise 
when ashe seized the armory he claimed authority under a 16th 
century statute requiring citizens to give suitable aid to law 
enforcement efforts of his office but state officials contend that 
ashe as a county official does not have authority over state 
property

william appleman williams a historian who 
sharply criticized us foreign policy and asserted that the united 
states acted as an imperialist power has died of cancer at age 68 
williams died monday at newport community hospital he lived in 
the nearby coastal community of waldport 
he termed himself a radical and was particularly critical of 
americas role in the cold war and in vietnam 
williams was best known for a series of books written in the 
late 1950s and 1960s that challenged prevailing views of american 
history he asserted the united states was an imperialist power 
seeking to impose its economic and ideological will on an unwilling 
world 
he argued that the nations refusal to acknowledge its 
imperialist past led to a skewed national vision that made it 
difficult to set a course for the future 
critics accused him of employing a double standard of 
explaining soviet actions by citing national security while 
measuring western actions against a utopian ideal 
his books which gave him a reputation as a revisionist 
historian created widespread controversy in academic circles and 
influenced a generation of historians 
his views had entered the mainstream of american thought by the 
late 1970s and in 1980 he was elected president of the 
organization of american historians 
i think of him as the clearest of the revisionist historians 
and the inspirer of a school of younger historians who put the cold 
war into a perspective that they didnt have before said victor 
navasky editor of the nation the liberal magazine for which 
williams frequently wrote 
he was a professor at the university of wisconsin from 1960 to 
1968 and at oregon state university from 1968 to 1986 he also 
taught at the university of melbourne in australia as a fulbright 
scholar in 1977

the united states france and the vatican 
are trying to end a monthlong showdown between rival christian 
forces and help president elias hrawi spread his authority to east 
beirut government sources said today one christian source in the 
government said the vatican told renegade army gen michel aoun and 
militia chieftain samir geagea that their fighting threatens the 
christians existence in lebanon 
the vaticans stand was interpreted as an indirect threat that 
the holy see would have to accept foreign military intrevention to 
quell the armed conflict in the christian enclave said the 
source who demanded anonymity 
such a military intervention most probably by the syrian 
army would spare neither aoun nor geagea the source said 
christian troops under aoun and the lebanese forces militia 
under geagea fought each other to a standstill before accepting a 
ceasefire saturday 
more than 750 people were killed and 2088 wounded during the 
inconclusive fighting which broke out jan 30 at least 850 
million in public and private property were destroyed 
the source said the ceasefire was accepted after the vaticans 
stand was relayed last week 
syrianbacked hrawi and prime minister salim hoss returned to 
beirut late wednesday from a fourday tour of saudi arabia algeria 
and morocco 
hrawi and hoss released a statement today saying that the three 
arab nations promised aid to help them spread the legitimate 
state authority over the whole of lebanon 
leaders of the three arab nations make up a mediation committee 
that brokered octobers peace accord aimed at ending lebanons 
nearly 15 years of civil war hrawi was elected president in 
november under the plan he replaced aoun who headed a caretaker 
government 
aoun has refused to recognize hrawi as head of state and 
rejected the peace plan demanding that it specify a timetable for 
the withdrawal of the 40000 troops syria maintains in lebanon 
the independent newspaper annahar said the united states was 
trying to persuade geagea to withdraw his militia from christian 
east beirut and france had asked aoun to step down and hand over 
the presidential palace to hrawi 
the paper said if aoun agreed to step down and geagea withdrew 
his militiamen from east beirut the us would move seriously 
to arrange a withdrawal from moslem west beirut of syrian troops 
and their allied moslem and leftist militiamen 
a moslem government source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the bush administration has repeatedly informed all the 
parties to the conflict in lebanon that it supports the creation of 
a greater beirut free of militias 
the americans want a unified beirut and its suburbs policed by 
troops loyal to president hrawi as the legitimate head of state in 
lebanon said the moslem source 
beirut has been divided into predominately christian and moslem 
sectors since the civil war broke out in 1975 
aouns refusal to leave the shellwrecked presidential palace 
has forced hrawi to set up temporary headquarters in syrianpoliced 
west beirut 
hrawi aoun and geagea are maronites the catholic community 
that has dominated lebanon since independence from france in 1943

in a rare soviet attack on the cuban leadership a 
newspaper this week attributed the islands stability to fidel 
castros intransigence and reliance on outdated ideas that cause 
suffering for the population 
the weekly edition of the moscow news which came out tuesday 
also said dissension is growing in cuba and that about 15 
opposition groups have formed 
the article in the weekly considered a progressive newspaper 
reflects a growing divergence between the kremlin and cuba as 
president mikhail s gorbachev moves to reduce the power of the 
communist party here and strengthen the government 
at the same time castro has repeatedly said his country will 
never embrace the reforms orchestrated by gorbachev and 
increasingly accepted throughout eastern europe 
to all appearances the sweeping changes in eastern europe 
came as a complete surprise to the cuban leader moscow news 
said on both economic and political counts they produced a 
shock 
it noted that staterun cuban radio carried editorial attacks on 
the collapse of communist regimes in eastern europe and blamed the 
changes on weak governments unable to tackle economic turmoil 
such categorical judgments are pronounced in an island with 
total rationing which insures people against poverty but does not 
give them the impetus to work moscow news said 
it mocked the cuban leader for his dec 7 statement saying if 
history will attach to us the role of the last defenders of 
socialism in the world we will defend this stronghold to the last 
drop of blood 
the cuban model that castro wants to defend is based on a 
complete rejection of a market economy moral principles over 
material ones a militarized state and an untouchable partystate 
elite the newspaper said 
cuba copied none other but soviet administrative and economic 
structures at the time when european socialism was sinking into the 
swamp of stagnation based on the ideological dogma of the late 
leader leonid i brezhnev it continued 
cuba gets about 5 billion in annual aid from the soviet union 
despite castros pledge to defend the party at all costs and 
ignore change in the socialist community moscow news said reform 
is on its way 
about 15 dissident groups have emerged the newspaper said 
their demands vary from support for the perestroika process in 
the ussr to freedom of religious beliefs in cuba 
until change comes moscow news said the island will remain 
stable but only through the efforts of revolution defense 
committees embracing the entire country

saying 56 people died and 200 were injured in the fighting

council had been dismissed apparently for supporting the coup 
attempt

kabul according to diplomatic and western sources there many 
buildings including the presidential palace the finance ministry 
and governmentrun radio kabul were badly damaged said the 
sources who all insisted on anonymity

they still had reports of fighting in southern kandahar eastern 
jalalabad and western shindand where the countrys secondlargest 
air base is located 
one western diplomat said he had reports that protanai forces 
were fighting government troops for control of kabul airport 
another said the air force given much credit for helping najibs 
government survive without soviet troops had suffered severe 
losses 
a lot of aircraft have been knocked out the diplomat said 
none of the reports could be independently verified 
in a message delivered today to the news agency of the 
guerrillas exiled government tanai said we have risen up and 
our struggle will continue 
i am inside afghanistan tanai said in the 2minutelong 
message translated by the agency from dari into english i am 
sending this cassette with my friend outside to be broadcast to 
you 
this is a call for afghanistans moslem people and the army 
and the real party members najib and his dictatorship will fall 
for this and for national unity we have risen up 
the tape was played to reporters who recognized tanais voice 
from miltary briefings news conferences and television 
appearances in kabul 
tanai fled afghanistan on wednesday and pakistani officials and 
guerrilla sources said he then defected to the moslem guerrillas 
whom he fought more than a decade tanai returned to afghanistan 
but his exact whereabouts were not known

radical guerrilla leaders gulbuddin hekmatyar declared his 
support for tanai 
hekmatyar has generally had the support of abdul rasul sayyaf

guerrillas who took up arms against the government after a 
communist coup in 1978 the soviet army fought alongside government 
troops until february 1989 when they withdrew under a 
unmediated accord they still supply the government with arms 
while the united states arms the guerrillas 
tanaiis alliance with hekmatyar was one of convenience not 
ideology for tanai is a staunch marxist who favored a hard line 
against the guerrillas while hekmatyar is one of the most radical 
antiwestern rebel leaders 
an afghan government spokesman meanwhile said najib had 
received messages from all provinces ensuring support for the 
government the spokesman naqib sameer spoke in a telephone 
interview from london

political leaders including former prime minister rajiv gandhi 
arrived to try to end the unrest 
allah is great the crowds chanted as the convoy of army 
jeeps and trucks carrying the delegation drove through the streets 
from the airport we want independence 
earlier today gunfights broke out between the militants and 
security forces and at least two civilians were reported killed 
soldiers carrying machine guns and automatic rifles strictly 
enforced curfew regulations as the delegation arrived but hundreds 
of residents shouted slogans from the loudspeakers of scores of 
mosques in the city

and representatives from all major political parties says it is on 
a peace mission aimed at ending the moslem movement for secession 
of kashmir from hindumajority india

luxury hotel near dal lake which was ringed by at least 1000 
policemen and paramilitary troops they were not allowed to leave 
the hotel 
i am shocked gandhi told reporters at the hotel if there 
is no political solution i see some very hard options ahead 
gandhi also said he had been refused permission to visit 
residents of srinagar the largest city in the valley and the 
focal point of the moslem campaign for secession 
jagmohan said allowing gandhi to go out would create a 
tremendous security risk 
when curfew was lifted from 5 am to 10 am almostcontinuous 
exchanges of fire began said witnesses who spoke on condition of 
anonymity moslem snipers fired at paramilitary police at four 
places but he had no details of casualties said jagmohan a hindu

areas among the shops houses and narrow winding streets of 
downtown srinagar they said militants were sniping from rooftops 
and pinning down soldiers in roadside bunkers the soldiers 
returned fire sporadically the witnesses said on condition of 
anonymity 
it was like a battlefield said one witness contacted by 
telephone ive never heard firing like this before 
witnesses reported two killed and 10 wounded 
the deaths raise to 173 the number of people killed since jan 
20 when security forces launched a crackdown on militants fighting 
for the independence of kashmir jagmohan took charge as the 
states governor jan 18 and ordered the crackdown 
jammukashmir indias only moslemmajority state comprises the 
kashmir valley and the plains of jammu to the south the valley is 
disputed by india and neighboring pakistan and has been the scene 
of a lingering secessionist movement by moslem militants

months with india accusing pakistan of fomenting the trouble a 
charge that pakistan repeatedly denies 
the two countries have gone to war three times since their 
independence from britain in 1947 twice over kashmir a 
unsponsored ceasefire line separates kashmir into indian and 
pakistani sectors 
at least 64 percent of jammukashmirs 6 million people are

cannot be delayed any longer the agency said in a report

the party has eased its grip on society in recent years but has 
ruled out following the radical changes that are taking place in 
communist parties throughout eastern europe

has raised debates throughout the country and is drawing the 
largest participation of the population of ho chi minh city since 
liberation in 1975 
the agency quoted an unidentified debater as saying 
the draft should lay more emphasis on the reorganization of 
the party itself as the basis to broaden democracy and realize 
social equality strengthen the peoples power and the mass 
organizations 
in this connection it is necessary first of all to separate 
the functions of the party from those of the state the debater

jacqueline kennedy onassis ended a 
10year dispute with a group of wampanoag indians by agreeing to 
give them a plot of land and 100000 in exchange for a tiny 
beachfront site 
the case pitted mrs onassis desire for privacy against the 
indians belief that they should retain control of tribal lands on 
marthas vineyard including 15 acres owned primarily by the 
wampanoags that is surrounded by onassis estate on the island 
after all this time im just happy the land was settled 
said thelma weissberg one of the 25 descendants of william 
vanderhoop a wampanoag who lived in the area in the 1870s and 
owned the 15acre plot ive lived on the island all my life and 
im happy that we have some of our land back 
wampanoags have lived at the picturesque cliffs of gay head for 
centuries the tribe believes the tract on onassis estate holds 
the last resting place of the great chief moshup and his wife 
squant 
in 1980 mrs onassis obtained onesixth interest in the 
15acre plot and sought to buy the remaining fivesixths from the 
25 descendants of vanderhoop she wanted to close access to the 
parcel and keep beachgoers and tourists away from her 400acre 
property 
but the wampanoags resisted and a series of lawsuits and 
countersuits followed 
according to the terms of the agreement signed wednesday the 
wampanoags will surrender title and access to the 15acre site in 
exchange for 100000 and a 2acre beachfront plot closer to the 
nearest road 
brian hurley one of mrs onassis attorneys said shes just 
pleased to have resolved this long matter and hopes to continue 
being good neighbors she wants to put it behind her 
since 1974 various wampanoags have regained about 400 acres of 
what they consider tribal land on marthas vineyard through a 
series of federal lawsuits 
they claimed that a 1790 law that forbids transfer of indian 
lands without federal approval was violated in the 1870s when the 
state redistributed tribal lands to other island residents 
the wampanoags have maintained a tribal structure for more than 
370 years according to tribal council president donald widdiss 
but they did not receive federal recognition until 1987 there are 
only 250 wampanoags left at gay head and only 630 in the nation

president mikhail s gorbachev has demanded that 
lithuania pay the kremlin billions in hard currency if the republic 
goes ahead with its plan to secede from the soviet union the 
baltic republics president says 
the demand for compensation came in a meeting with lithuanias 
president algirdas brazauskas ahead of an expected weekend vote 
on secession in the republics parliament 
vilnius radio put the figure at 34 billion saying the money 
would cover investments moscow has made in lithuania since forcibly 
annexing it in 1940 lithuanian nationalists say the kremlin has it 
backward and should pay them for a halfcentury of exploitation 
brazauskas who also heads the republics breakaway communist 
party told lithuanian television wednesday night that there was no 
need to frighten ourselves and others about the economic 
consequences of secession 
in a tass report on the interview brazauskas said gorbachev 
told him during the meeting monday that if lithuania proclaims 
independence economic relations would have to be legalized as 
relations between two independent states and accounts between them 
will have to be settled in freely convertible currency 
the soviet ruble is not convertible meaning its value is set by 
the government rather than through trading on world markets 
the official soviet news agency quoted brazauskas as saying that 
to pay in convertible currency would be an extremely difficult 
task for the republic to accomplish since it imports fuel 
metallurgical products and raw materials from the soviet union at 
about three times lower than world prices 
brazauskas said the republic would nevertheless be so much 
better off on its own that the advantages would offset its debt to 
moscow according to eduardas potashinskas an editor at lithuanian 
tv 
brazauskas said gorbachev indicated the soviet union may demand 
lithuania turn over the port of klaipeda if allowed to secede as 
well as a small section around drushinikai in extreme south 
lithuania according to the editor 
potashinskas said the lithuanians could make counterclaims for 
the areas around oshmyany and novogrudok that were parts of 
lithuania after lenin signed a treaty recognizing the republics 
independence in 1920 
klaipeda a warmwater port on the baltic sea 125 miles 
northwest of vilnius was occupied by the germans and later freed 
by soviet forces in 1944 
solid victories in recent elections have given backers of 
sajudis the proindependence popular movement control of 
lithuanias parliament as a result the groups leaders have 
decided to force the issue of secession 
the parliament in a session called for this weekend is sure 
to come out with some form of declaration of independence said 
potashinskas who also is a sajudis activist 
prosecession sentiment in the republic of 38 million has been 
swelling for months but sajudis decided to move now to preempt 
gorbachevs plans to introduce a vastly more powerful presidency 
with the right to crack down on restive republics the national 
congress of peoples deputies is scheduled to meet monday to 
consider the presidency proposal 
why so fast i think gorbachev himself created such a 
reaction said audris siaurusavicius a reporter for rebirth the 
sajudis newspaper 
if there were no such proposal on the presidency we wouldnt 
have done this now 
all three baltic republics latvia lithuania and estonia were 
independent nations between the world wars before being forced to 
join the soviet union in 1940 while under soviet occupation 
lawmakers in moscow are considering a proposed law that would 
give republics the right to secede from the union but settling 
financial issues is just one of a daunting series of requirements 
that the republics would have to meet in order to secede 
the proposed law also says a republic can secede only after a 
republicwide referendum in which threefourths of the adults vote 
in favor of the move then the secession proposal must be submitted 
to national lawmakers in moscow 
during a minimum fiveyear transition phase defense security 
and border questions are to be settled and the government of the 
seceding republic must also settle financial and property issues 
the soviet constitution guarantees republics the right to 
secede but the procedure never has been spelled out in soviet law 
siaurusavicius said sajudis leaders were expecting moscows 
response to the declaration to be restrained but he said the 
republic could already feel the effects of a mounting soviet 
economic blockade many factories are running short on raw 
materials and they expect the situation to get worse 
gorbachev has repeatedly denounced separatists and has asked 
activists to give moscow time to work out the terms of a new soviet 
federation before moving to secede 
an article in the government newspaper izvestia on wednesday 
complained that lithuania is getting public opinion used to the 
fact that it is leaving without thinking through all the 
economic and political difficulties secession would create 
the article said such problems would include trade imbalances 
the difficulty of deciding what to do about various sovietbuilt 
factories and the fate of lithuanian residents who want to retain 
their soviet citizenship 
moreover it said the lithuanian push for independence had 
spread to other republics one after another legislative 
measures are passed which like a lancet cut off vein after vein 
nerve after nerve from the overall organism the article said 
about half of the soviet unions 15 republics now have popular 
groups pushing for independence or greater sovereignty including 
moldavia georgia armenia azerbaijan estonia and latvia

democrats pushed their version of a campaign 
financing bill through the senate rules committee today but 
acknowledged it is subject to wholesale change if a compromise can 
be struck with republicans 
i expect that the leadership will propose a comprehensive 
substitute amendment to what we passed the panels chairman 
sen wendell ford dky said of the democratic proposal that 
would impose voluntary spending caps ranging from 16 billion to 
92 billion on individual senate candidates 
the committee approved the bill on a 73 partyline vote 
republicans supported a bipartisan advisory panels call to limit 
how much candidates can raise from political action committees 
pacs and outofstate donors but place no limit on instate 
contributions from inidviudals 
sen ted stevens ralaska called the recommendations wednesday 
from the panel of six experts appointed by senate demnocratic 
leader george mitchell of maine and republican leader bob dole a 
genius solution 
republicans plan to begin work next week on a bill based on the 
panels recommendations but said they will add a provision to 
address unreported soft money contributions by nonparty 
interest groups such as labor unions corporations and nonprofit 
organizations 
the panel endorsed individual candidate spending ceilings sought 
by democrats but with reasonably high and flexible limits and 
a provision that would let the gop keep using its advantage in 
raising money through mass direct mailings 
under the panels plan individual candidates could exceed the 
limits through an exemption for limited donations from instate 
residents and still qualify for the discount mail and television 
advertising rates intended to lure compliance 
the fact that it embraces a concept of spending limits is an 
especially encouraging sign that there is bipartisan momentum 
building for real reform said boren 
sen mitch mcconnell rky the leading senate critic of 
campaign ceilings said the panels report can serve as a framework 
for further talks but he said he was confused by democrats 
insistence on advancing their bill in the meantime 
others however were highly critical of the panels 
recommendations including its acceptance of political action 
committees or pacs and socalled unreported soft money 
contributions 
fred wertheimer of common cause called the package 
fundamentally flawed 
no serious reform of the congressional campaign finance system 
is possible unless the role and influence of pac money is 
dramatically reduced and the soft money system has brought back 
watergatesize and watergatestyle contributions into federal 
campaigns is shut down wertheimer said 
the experts three each picked by mitchell and dole supported 
republican desires for unfettered party spending on phone banks 
voter registration and direct mail campaigns and higher limits on 
individual contributions 
the report recommended a compromise on pacs opposing president 
bushs call for an outright ban on corporate and union pacs that 
have overwhelmingly favored democratic incumbents instead it 
recommended diminishing their role 
pacs could contribute only up to onethird of a candidates 
spending limit under the panels proposals from then on their 
contributions to each candidate would be limited to half the 
current 10000 limit for primary and general election campaigns 
together 
the panel also would ban pacs from making postelection 
contributions to retire a candidates campaign debt and restrict 
labor and corporate pacs in bundling or gathering donations on 
behalf of a candidate 
however it found little obvious cause for concern in 
bundling done by individuals such as the more than 200000 raised 
in campaign gifts raised by phoenix savings and loan executive 
charles h keating jr for five us senators 
other campaign financing abuses raised by last years sampl crisis 
also were ignored by the panel including the use of socalled 
leadership pacs by senior party officials to raise money for other 
candidates 
it also had no recommendation on taxexempt foundations of the 
13 million keating contributed to five senate candidates 
850000 was through a taxexempt voter registration foundation 
headed by the son of sen alan cranston dcalif

in a darkened ceremonial hall president 
bush watched as new streamers were attached today to the four flags 
of the us military services to commemorate the invasion of panama 
that toppled dictator manuel antonio noriega 
were here today to add another campaign streamer to the roll 
call of glory the roster of great american campaigns yorktown 
gettysburg normandy and now panama said bush 
he reaffirmed his support for overturning a supreme court 
decision that struck down laws making it illegal to burn the flag 
the flag honors those who died in the defense of liberty 
and that is why i am determined that the american flag will be 
consecrated not desecrated said bush 
gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said with the presentation of these streamers the campaign in 
panama is now part of the glorious tradition of our nation and its 
armed forces 
for as long as the stars and stripes flies over this nation 
the actions of the men and women who helped to restore democracy to 
panama in december of 1989 will be remembered said powell 
the flags borne by an honor guard from the army the navy the 
air force and the marines already carry dozens of multicolored 
streamers each signifying a different war or engagement from the 
revolutionary war to the civil war to vietnam and grenada 
on the surface the streamer is but a piece of multicolored 
cloth but for every american and especially for those of us who 
wore a uniform in december of 1989 it will always represent 
unselfish sacrifice said powell 
bush reviewed the troops arrayed in ceremonial hall at this base 
just across the potomac river from the capital more than 200 
soldiers sailors airmen and marines stood at attention some 
bearing bayonets others rifles and still others carrying flags 
from each state and territory 
the people of that nation panama needed us to stand with 
them to defend that struggle for democracy and for the opportunity 
that americans have enjoyed for over 200 years said bush 
he said that 27000 of americas finest sprang into action 
for the dec 20 operation that the pentagon called just cause 
the expeditionary streamer was the 169th affixed to the army 
flag the 13th for the marine flag the 19th for the navy and the 
78th for the air force 
bush said the streamer is most of all for the 23 soldiers 
killed in the panama operation

prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty 
for a man convicted of a murder that was cited in a letter that 
claimed responsibility for the mail bomb killings of a judge and 
civil rights lawyer 
jurors deliberated eight hours wednesday before convicting 
emmanuel hammond shortly before midnight of murder kidnapping and 
armed robbery 
hammond 24 of marietta hung his head and rubbed his eyes as 
the verdict was read 
fulton superior court judge ralph h hicks scheduled the 
sentencing portion of hammonds trial to begin today 
julie love a 27yearold preschool fitness teacher who 
disappeared in july 1988 was the subject of a muchpublicized 
search until her body was found in august she had been shot in the 
head 
hammond was handcuffed in the courtroom and led away as miss 
loves family embraced her father jerry love rfused to comment 
until its all over 
fulton county assistant district attorneys william l hawthorne 
iii and richard hicks shook hands after the trial 
i am obviously very pleased hawthorne said 
i think the jury worked long and hard in their deliberations 
and they apparently had some basis for their verdict said 
defense attorney william a wehunt 
wehunt contended hammonds chief accusers his former 
girlfriend janice weldon and his cousin maurice porter 
actually killed miss love and were trying to frame his client 
porter has pleaded guilty to murder armed robbery and rape in 
the death of miss love and awaits sentencing he testified last 
week that hammond abducted miss love from an atlanta street after 
her car ran out of gas and that hammond dragged her into some 
bushes and killed her 
miss weldon who led police to miss loves body also testified 
against hammond 
testimony in the trial began last week under heavy security 
because of concern over the possible link to the prechristmas mail 
bombs a death threat from a group called the aryan resistance 
movement apparently unrelated to the bombings later led to even 
tighter security 
a letter from a group claiming responsibility for the mail bomb 
deaths of judge robert vance of the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals and savannah lawyer robert robinson said the attacks were 
motivated by outrage over miss loves killing 
the letter signed by americans for a competent federal judicial 
system threatened more violence if any other white women were 
attacked by black men in alabama florida or georgia miss love was 
white hammond is black

former president richard m nixon returned 
today to the house of representatives where his political career 
started in the role of political educator lecturing lawmakers 
about the world and the changes taking place 
an extraordinary session house minority leader bob michel 
rill said after the closeddoor meeting an extraordinary tour 
de force said rep newt gingrich of georgia the no 2 man in 
the house republican hierarchy 
nixon said he told the congressmen that while the cold war is 
probably over in europe it is still going on in the third 
world he said any peace benefit coming from the reduction of 
tensions should go toward reducing this countrys huge deficit 
what really went through my mind was that here is where it all 
began said nixon who entered the political world as a freshman 
congressman in 1948 he recalled that his office was a couple of 
doors down from that of another freshman congressman john f 
kennedy dmass 
the two of us who disagreed politically and later on some 
very big issues agreed on foreign policy and our first vote was 
for president trumans request for military and economic aid to 
greece and turkey nixon said it was a good vote and it 
started the bipartisan policy which i hope can be reinitiated 
today 
there was no mention that the house of representatives was 
prepared to vote nixons impeachment in 1974 when he resigned the 
highest office in the land 
nixon spent more than an hour with republican congressmen 
speaking of global changes later he went to the senate side of 
the capitol to the office of minority leader bob dole to meet 
with 18 incumbent gop senators who are up for reelection this year 
the former president was in good humor as he talked with 
reporters saying as i look at this crowd i know im getting 
older but the press seems to be getting younger 
he suggested that a change could come in cuba if soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev cuts off the 6 billion in aid it 
gives each year to that country 
the key is gorbachev said nixon 
at that point a reporter addressed nixon as mr gorbachev 
when the laughter died down nixon said ive been called 
worse 
the former president reminisced that in his days as a 
congressman and senator when the cold war began the chief goal of 
the united states was to defeat communism now he said the 
greatest responsibility is to see that freedom works 
the 77yearold nixon has become more visible in recent months 
through his visit to china a dinner with president bush to discuss 
that trip and his effort to help bush convince the senate to 
sustain a veto 
nixons briefings were one more step in his increasing political 
acceptance 
the former president was invited by the congressional institute 
inc an organization founded three years ago by house republicans 
the institute organizes retreats and events for members a 
spokesman said this is the first time it has attracted a speaker of 
nixons renown 
nixon has written extensively in books and in magazine and 
newspaper articles about foreign affairs in recent years and is 
sought after as a speaker on global politics 
his latest book in the arena a memoir of victory defeat and 
renewal is to be published next month its profits will go to 
the nixon presidential library and birthplace foundation which 
built the nixon library in yorba linda calif the library is to be 
opened in july 
nixon made his sixth trip to china in november and in private 
talks with top chinese leaders expressed american concern over 
political repression in that country he was the most prominent 
american to go to china since the bloody military crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators last june 
on his return the 37th president had dinner with bush the 41st 
president bush found the talk interesting according to press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
in january nixon made at least two telephone calls to 
republican senators asking them to sustain bushs veto of a bill 
protecting chinese students from deportation the senate failed to 
override the veto

a planning official disclosed today that the 
government has plans to build a new jewish neighborhood in arab 
east jerusalem despite a dispute with the united states over new 
construction in the area 
ruth kaminker a member of jerusalems ninemember city planning 
board told the associated press that the new 225acre neighborhood 
was in final stages of planning after a threemonth study of 
the site 
the development estimated to include up to 3000 homes or 
apartments is planned for a steep slope of a hill known as mt 
homa said mrs kaminker a member of the leftwing citizens 
rights movement 
she said the government of prime minister yitzhak shamir 
requested development of the jewish neighborhood apparently in an 
attempt to strengthen the jewish hold in the arab sector of 
jerusalem which was captured from jordan in the 1967 middle east 
war 
city spokeswoman bonnie boxer denied any new neighborhood in 
east jerusalem was in the planning stages but she acknowledged the 
site was one of several under consideration in east jerusalem for 
construction of jewish housing 
israel has been under growing us pressures to give the 140000 
palestinians of east jerusalem a role in middle east peace talks 
but shamir has objected saying such a move could harm israels 
claim to all of jerusalem as its undivided capital 
last week president bush criticized israeli building in 
disputed areas of jerusalem we do not believe there should be 
new settlements in the west bank or east jerusalem bush told 
reporters in california 
unlike settlements in the west bank or gaza strip new housing 
projects in east jerusalem are generally referred to here as 
neighborhoods because people who move into them do not get special 
benefits such as lowinterest mortgages available in the occupied 
territories 
israel annexed east jerusalem in 1967 but most countries 
including the united states have not recognized israeli 
sovereignty over the area 
in response to bakers remark jerusalems city council held an 
emergency meeting tuesday and adopted a resolution to continue to 
build the city for the good of all its inhabitants 
in the past 23 years israel has moved 120000 jews into the 
annexed arab area of the city a total of 350000 jews live in east 
and west jerusalem 
mrs kaminker said the new neighborhood would be alongside zur 
baher an arab neighborhood of several thousand people and would 
in effect complete a jewish ring around the city 
but mrs kaminker said plans for the new jewish neighborhood 
were nearly complete requiring only official approval that would 
be a foregone conclusion since the government asked for the 
neighborhood 
efforts at arabisraeli reconciliation have several times been 
stalled by housing built on confiscated arab land but mrs 
kaminker said the current site already was stateowned purchased 
by the jewish national fund from arab landowners and then sold to 
israel 
the land had long been earmarked for treeplanting and banned 
for construction because of its rocky terrain mrs kaminker said 
it is a very difficult area for construction so the decision 
seems purely political she added 
mrs kaminker said her party would protest implementation of the 
housing project but the citizens rights movement is a tiny 
minority on the city council dominated by shamirs likud bloc the 
centerleft labor party and conservative religious parties

florida atlantic university this fall 
will become the states only public university offering free 
tuition to every black freshman who meets admissions standards 
school officials said 
the gesture which the united negro college fund said was 
probably the only such program in the nation is intended to boost 
the number of black students at the school in boca raton 
sometimes you spend too much time talking about why you should 
do something and not enough time doing it fau president anthony 
catanese said tuesday if youre serious about recruiting the 
best students a full scholarship simply is the way to go 
there also is a practical motive the board of regents has 
ordered fau to increase its freshman class by 50 percent next year 
and the number of black students must go up to meet state targets 
for minority enrollment 
its a phenomenal idea an excellent first step said 
maurice hall president of the west palm beach branch of the naacp 
both floridians and outofstate students can apply but 
instate students will get preference under the program which will 
be financed through private donations and school funds 
fau has 608 black students including foreign students out of 
a total student body of 11310 
but this years freshman class had only 28 black students that 
meets the board of regents target for blacks who must account for 
at least 77 percent of the student body but it is smaller than 
the proportion of blacks in surrounding broward and palm beach 
counties 112 percent and 135 percent 
the targets are far too low for this area said brian 
levinstankevich admissions director it should be obvious to 
anybody that 28 black freshmen students are not enough 
what bothers me is that the goals are rather modest i want to 
redouble the efforts catanese said 
university officials emphasized that boosting the number of 
blacks will not require cutting the number of nonblack students 
because freshman enrollment is being expanded so dramatically 
were not displacing anybody by adding minorities 
levinstankevich said i think thats an important point 
enough scholarship money already is earmarked to pay full 
tuition costs for 30 black freshmen every black freshman this year 
has a scholarship financial aid officials estimate that tuition 
will be 1350 a student next year 
fau would be the only university in the nation to guarantee full 
scholarships to each black freshman the united negro college fund 
says private lemoyneowens college in memphis launched a program 
this year to give free tuition to innercity black male high school 
students who stay off drugs 
the school also set up a dualdegree program last week with 
predominantly black bethunecookman college in daytona beach 
allowing students there to transfer to fau to earn an engineering 
diploma again with a full scholarship similar partnerships are 
being pursued with florida memorial college in miami and edward 
waters college in jacksonville

the first major study of women and heart 
disease is being undertaken by the johns hopkins medical 
institution and six other centers after decades of research 
devoted solely to male heart disease 
the 10 million fouryear study is designed to determine 
whether three different hormones can help reduce heart disease in 
postmenopausal women heart disease kills more americans than any 
other disease 
in the study 840 women will be assigned at random to one of the 
three medications or to a placebo high blood cholesterol 
hypertension and heightened levels of a bloodclotting factor will 
be studied 
the results could prompt doctors to prescribe hormone therapy 
for postmenopausal women said dr trudy bush an epidemiologist 
at the johns hopkins school of hygiene and public health 
in my opinion there is good evidence at this time that women 
who use estrogens probably have about half the risk of heart 
disease compared to women who dont bush said estrogen hormones 
will be part of the study 
bush is heading the study at hopkins along with gynecologists 
dr david foster and dr howard zacur 
in the past major studies of heart disease in the united states 
have involved males because the ailment tends to strike men at a 
younger age than women and younger people are less likely to 
suffer from additional health problems that could complicate a 
study 
the new study called postmenopausal estrogen and progestin 
intervention reflects a belief that women have been denied equal 
time in health studies as well as a growing emphasis on the health 
of older people 
underlying the study is the belief that estrogen a hormone 
needed for normal female sexual development protects younger women 
against heart disease researchers also suspect the threat of a 
heart attack increases during menopause when estrogen production 
drops off 
the study will try to determine whether hormone drugs take the 
place of natural estrogen in protecting the hearts of older women

the house ethics committee said today it will 
not pursue an investigation of republican whip new gingrich but 
criticized him for failing to disclose a house purchase and for 
improper activities by his staff 
no adequate basis exists to begin even the preliminary phase 
of an investigation the committee said in a report approved 
unanimously wednesday and made public today 
gingrich said the committees decision demonstrated that the 
charges were politically inspired nonsense 
the panel said it decided that allegations in separate 
complaints last year by rep bill alexander dark even if true 
did not state violations of applicable standards of conduct 
by the georgia republican 
gingrich however was ordered to amend his financial disclosure 
forms to reflect participation in his purchase along with his 
daughter of her personal residence in georgia four years ago 
the committee also criticized two letters sent on gingrichs 
official letterhead in december 1986 and january 1987 promoting a 
forprofit senior citizens cruise sponsored by marathon travel co 
of marathon fla 
the panel wrote gingrich you were remiss in your oversight 
and administration of your congressional office in the cruise 
mailings 
accordingly you are directed to immediately take steps to 
preclude recurrence of the type of improper activity here involved 
you are further placed on notice that a future recurrence of 
improper use of mail and resources may result in more severe 
committee action 
the outcome of the case was eagerly awaited on capitol hill 
because gingrich the no 2ranking house republican was the chief 
accuser in the ethics investigation that led to the resignation 
last june of house speaker jim wright dtexas 
this process of responding to a clearly political smear cost a 
lot of money and was very demanding both politically and 
personally gingrich said contending that the investigation cost 
the taxpayers at least 300000 and himself more than 100000 in 
legal fees 
gingrich said his failure to report that he cosigned the 
mortgage for his daughters home stemmed from his misreading of 
house rules and he blamed the travelpromotion letters on a 
staffer a young man who made a mistake in judgment 
in a letter to gingrich attached to the report the committee 
said the joint purchase of his daughters home as well as the 
underlying liability you incurred should have been reported on 
your financial disclosure statements 
the panel said it considered gingrichs contention that he was 
only a guarantor of the loan and signed documents only as an 
accommodation for his daughter 
nonetheless the committee believes that the true nature of 
the transaction as reflected in the pertinent legal documents 
should control reporting accordingly pursuant to the ethics 
in government act of 1978 the committee directs that you promptly 
amend your financial disclosure statements to reflect the 
transaction in question 
the panel also rejected gingrichs assertion that he had no 
personal knowledge of the cruise letters until alexander filed his 
complaint 
the committee said each member is responsible for the conduct of 
his staff and that members cannot use official stationery or other 
resources for nongovernmental purposes 
alexander had alleged that gingrich committed hundreds of 
violations of house rules including financial disclosure 
requirements and also ran afoul of campaign finance laws he filed 
the ethics complaints last april and october 
alexander said wednesday the ethics committee has resolved 
the gingrich matter by deciding not to investigate further but by 
deciding to admonish gingrich 
further disciplinary actions against mr gingrich are 
therefore not needed at the present time alexander said 
in his ethics complaint filed in october alexander said 
gingrich failed to list the fulton county ga home as an asset or 
the mortgage as a liability 
the complaint said the home was bought in 1986 and the mortgage 
totaled 77800 
house rules exempt members from disclosing financial information 
about their own homes but gingrich acknowledged last year the 
residence was for his daughter 
gingrich said then he was incensed that the fact that i helped 
my daughter by cosigning or signing the note or whatever one 
calls it gets drug out and becomes a story 
he said alexanders decision to include his daughters mortgage 
in the complaint carries politics in the house to a new low 
level i mean it just strikes me as madness 
the committee on standards of official conduct as the ethics 
panel is formally known never voted to hold an investigation of 
gingrich an outspoken conservative but it took the unusual step 
of hiring a chicago law firm to advise members on whether to 
proceed with the case 
late last year the firm the same one that investigated wright 
for the committee reportedly recommended that the panel not 
proceed against gingrich 
alexanders original complaint in april 1989 focused on a 
limited partnership gingrich created in 1984 to promote window of 
opportunity a book written by the lawmaker his wife and a third 
author 
the cos limited partnership was made up of 21 individuals 
who each put up 5000 to promote the book gingrich was not an 
investor but his wife was paid more than 10000 for running the 
business 
the complaint contended the 105000 raised by the partnership 
could be considered income to gingrich in violation of house 
limits on members outside earnings or it said it could 
constitute a gift to gingrich in violation of a rule prohibiting 
members from accepting substantial gifts from anyone with a direct 
interest in legislation 
the second complaint filed in october charged gingrich with a 
long list of campaign finance and financial disclosure violations

fourteen prisoners used hacksaws on 
window bars to escape from a jail section reserved for serious 
felony offenders and 12 remained free this morning authorities 
said 
the south bay detention facility inmates sawed their way through 
the bars wednesday night kicked out the plexiglass window and 
lowered themselves 30 to 40 feet to the ground on a rope made of 
knotted bed sheets sheriffs sgt jim cooke said 
the prisoners climbed up a brushcovered slope and scattered 
despite perimeter guards and remote security cameras cooke said 
sheriffs deputies said jail officials did not know how the 
inmates got the hacksaws 
one inmate was captured minutes later hiding in the back of a 
pickup truck heading out of the area said sheriffs sgt roy 
stamper a second inmate was picked up by police while walking 
along a street near the jail 
police stopped and searched a trolley headed for the 
usmexican border but found no fugitives on board other 
officers chased handfuls of fugitives through the dark hills to the 
east of the jail normally the scene of thousands of crossings 
nightly by undocumented aliens 
the escaped inmates were wearing jailissue blue pullover shirts 
and blue pants each bearing the stencil sd jail or were 
wearing pale green unmarked tshirts

the white house is urging vigorous action 
to shut down a plant in libya believed to be producing chemical 
weapons a west german official said quantities produced so far are 
small but enough to cause concern 
marlin fitzwater chief spokesman for president bush said that 
a plant located at rabta about 60 miles south of tripoli 
apparently is producing poison gas 
us officials said the plant was making limited quantities of 
mustard gas and nerve agents 
rabta is dangerous and becoming more so fitzwater said 
wednesday this points to the necessity for heightened 
international vigilance of libyan procurement activities and for 
vigorous efforts to stop the operation of rabta 
in bonn norbert gansel a lawmaker from the opposition social 
democratic party said today west germany also has evidence the 
plant has begun making deadly gas in small quantities but enough to 
cause concern 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher has proposed that the 
european economic community seek international inspections of the 
factory 
washington has replied by saying it wants the plant closed for 
good a west german government source said 
the bush administration wants to dismantle the factory but 
with our diplomatic means we dont have the possibility to do 
that said the official speaking on condition of anomyity 
another west german government official said genscher has 
proposed that the eec ask north african nations to bring pressure 
for international inspections on short notice officials said 
washington has not rejected the initiative 
fitzwater asked today to predict the life expectancy of rabta 
said we hope two nanoseconds a nanosecond is one billionth of 
a second 
fitzwater refused to exclude the possibility of a military 
strike to knock out the plant we dont rule out anything he 
said 
however fitzwater also suggested the plant could be closed if 
foreign suppliers denied it the raw materials needed to produce 
chemical weapons 
the international community should step up its efforts to deny 
libya the ability to continue operating the plant he said 
chemical weapons are relatively cheap to produce and hard to 
detect libya is one of about two dozen countries considered 
capable of or actually producing poison gas 
the latest us charges underscore the hostile relationship 
between the united states and libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 
tensions reached a crisis point in 1986 when the reagan 
administration ordered that tripoli be bombed 
fitzwater asked what he meant by vigorous action said 
we arent willing to speculate on what specific efforts but 
nothing is ruled out 
he would not comment on the type or quantity of weapons being 
produced 
any amount is a major threat he said 
gadhafis regime has a history of terrorism activities and a 
history of erratic military behavior fitzwater said and 
therefore that is the most immediate threat 
in 1988 the united states raised concerns about rabta and 
persuaded west german companies and other foreign suppliers to stop 
providing technical assistance us officials said then that libya 
had stopped work on rabta before reaching full production but 
maintained an assembly line 
fitzwater said production resumed recently and west german 
politicians have said that libya had produced enough gas for 1000 
artillery shells 
fitzwater declined to discuss which countries were supplying 
chemicals to libya 
we certainly would urge all countries to survey their internal 
situation inventory their chemical production facilities and to 
make their own judgments that they are not a source for any of 
these chemicals 
we dont really know how the chemicals are getting there or 
where they are coming from fitzwater said but there are so 
many routes again i urge you not to focus on whos giving them 
chemicals but to focus on mr gadhafi and libya 
gadhafi who has steadfastly denied libya was producing chemical 
weapons says the plant was designed to produce pharmaceutical 
drugs 
jana the libyan news agency said in a dispatch that an unnamed 
official source at the libyan foreign ministry disclaimed 
reports that libya has produced quantities of chemical weapons in 
the rabta medicine factory 
the source according to jana contended that such allegations 
aired at present by some media circles aim at creating a state of 
suspicion in light of efforts by libya and other arabafrican 
nations toward economic and political unity

chancellor helmut kohl of west germany 
met today with the nato allies and said he reassured them that 
their concerns will be considered in the drive to reunify the two 
germanys 
nobody has to be concerned that the germans would one way or 
the other want to go it alone he told reporters after a nearly 
threehour meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization 
headquarters 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner a former german defense 
minister described the talks as very intensive constructive 
fruitful and lively he said the visit opened a formal series of 
consultations within nato on german unification and related 
security issues it will be synchronized with talks between the two 
germanys and the four victorious world war ii powers britain 
france the united states and the soviet union 
kohl met first with woerner and then with the ambassadors of the 
16 alliance nations 
what is happening in germany at present must be embedded in 
the overall developments the ongoing developments in europe he 
said at a news conference afterward 
german interests must be taken into account he said but 
also the interests of all our friends and partners and neighbors in 
east and west must be taken into account 
this means we need to have talks constantly that we need to 
consult very closely and that we need to cooperate very closely 
he said that was the idea behind my visit we shall pursue this 
practice of talking with one another at all necessary and possible 
levels 
the trip was apparently prompted by complaints from smaller 
countries in the atlantic alliance about having no say in 
discussions on the future of the two germanys and how a new state 
would fit into the western military alliance 
one nato official described the visit as damage limitation 
hes going to be moaned to by the little guys hes coming 
here because people have been complaining quite loudly he said 
before the talks began 
the decision of the world war ii allies to meet separately to 
discuss german unity has angered officials in italy belgium and 
the netherlands 
under the twoplusfour process the two german states also 
will gather after march 18 elections in east germany to discuss 
their future 
western officials have repeatedly stressed that the unified 
state must remain in nato but soviet officials have insisted it be 
neutral 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev reiterated on tuesday 
opposition to nato membership for the new german state we cannot 
agree to that it is absolutely out of the question he said 
according to the tass news agency 
east germany is a member of the sovietled warsaw pact and more 
than 380000 soviet troops are stationed on its soil 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany has 
proposed a formula that would keep the future state in nato but 
only the territory of west germany would be tied to its military 
structure 
nato troops would not extend into east germany 
nato officials have previously said soviet troops could 
temporarily remain on the territory of what is now east germany

parliament today adopted a resolution 
calling for a united germany to honor polands western border after 
a raucous debate marked by charges that chancellor helmut kohl had 
endangered the unification process 
the resolution states that the two germanys should adopt 
identical declarations saying the polish people are assured that 
their right to live in secure borders will not be questioned by us 
germans through territorial claims either now or in the future 
it further says that the future government of a united germany 
should sign a border treaty on the basis of those declarations 
after the parliament session kohl traveled to brussels 
belgium to meet with nato allies he said he reassured them that 
their concerns will be considered in the drive to reunify the two 
germanys 
nobody has to be concerned that the germans would one way or 
the other want to go it alone he told reporters after a nearly 
threehour meeting at the north atlantic treaty organization 
headquarters 
kohl had come under fire abroad and at home for his previous 
reluctance to unequivocally state that a united germany would never 
lay claim to land ceded to poland after the third reichs 1945 
defeat 
in parliament today one lawmaker from the opposition social 
democrats juergen schmude said kohls handling of the border 
issue had amounted to political arson in the european house 
 
kohl apparently trying to avoid offending conservative voters 
before federal elections in december had insisted that only the 
government of a united germany could address the matter 
his demands that a border treaty be linked to polish concessions 
also caused an uproar and he withdrew them earlier this week while 
at the same time proposing the resolution passed today 
in todays parliamentary debate the opposition social democrats 
charged that kohls pronouncements had seriously endangered the 
unification process 
party chief hansjochen vogel said seldom has a federal 
chancellor so mishandled his responsibilities to west germans 
as chancellor kohl in the last days and weeks 
vogel charged that kohls pronouncements on the matter had 
squandered international trust of the german people which is 
now needed more urgently than ever so that our neighbors do not 
reject the unification process 
in his own address kohl battled back by pointing out the social 
democrats contacts with east germanys nowdisgraced communist 
party in past years 
the social democrats contribution to the german politics 
unification matters in the last years can been characterized as 
simply pathetic he charged 
kohl also seemed to address concerns by moscow that he is trying 
to make unification occur too quickly 
we are producing no artificial time pressures in order to 
speed up unification said kohl 
he repeated that a united germany must be a member of the nato 
alliance which the soviets have consistently rejected 
but he also reiterated that what is now east germany could have 
a special military status in a united germany with nato troops 
barred from being stationed there 
kohl also rejected fears that a united germany could become a 
toomighty presence in europe 
no one needs to be worried about a german dominance in the 
european community a united germany would also be a reliable and 
solid partner kohl said

the supreme court agreed today to hear the united 
states appeal for the extradition of charles mcvey who is accused 
of selling computer secrets to the soviet union 
the united states has been trying to extradite mcvey 65 since 
august 1987 when he was arrested while on a fishing trip in the 
canadian yukon community of teslin at that time he had been a 
fugitive for four years 
mcvey once ran a computer export business in orange country 
calif 
us indictments in 1983 and 1987 accuse him of smuggling 
computer technology to the soviets 
if convicted sentences could total 125 years according to us 
officials 
in november the british columbia court of appeal ruled mcvey 
could not be extradited because the charges against him in 
california do not constitute an offense under the canadaus 
extradition treaty 
in its application to appeal to the supreme court the united 
states argued the appeals court erred in deciding that an 
extradition crime must be an offense listed in the extradition 
treaty 
mcvey faces more than 30 charges on the two separate indictments 
related to the alleged shipment of saxpy matrix1 supercomputer 
technology to the soviet union 
even if the us extradition efforts fail mcvey still could be 
deported by the canadian government 
an immigration hearing in vancouver is looking into the 
documents and information that mcvey used to enter canada in 1987 
and trying to determine if he stayed longer than permitted

the general trend presented in milan this 
week during the italian fallwinter 199091 readytowear 
collection is ultrashort and sporty 
but two designers never known to follow the fashion pack 
gianfranco ferre and giorgio armani went their own way showing 
discreet hemlines and more town than country clothes 
ferre who also designs for dior in paris presents a woman used 
to living in the lap of luxury the gold theme is threaded 
throughout his collection appearing from the early hours of the 
morning in gray mohair sweaters painted with gold to be worn over 
flannel sweat pants 
this theme becomes ever more opulent as the day goes on with 
rich gold embroidery on silk brocade jackets and coats for the 
cocktail hour and shimmery gold evening gowns for the grande 
soiree 
the ferre skirt stops a discreet inch above the knee and the 
elegant hemline is enhanced by the simplicity of the footwear 
suede or silk moderately heeled pumps 
the overall look is closer to couture than ready to wear and 
definitely separates itself from the myriad of fastfashion mini 
skirts knit body suits ski jackets and thigh boots that have 
permeated the milan runway this week 
ferre did indulge in a series of gold leather parkas with fur 
trim which looked a bit much on the runway but are sure to be a 
hit on the slopes of vail or gstaad 
ferre says he wanted to interpret oriental themes in a 
european context the oriental theme is evident in his choice of 
palette lots of blue yellow and multicolored porcelain prints 
the heavy use of gold brocade of satin and velvet and the robed 
styles in jackets and coats 
giorgio armani also looks to the orient for inspiration for his 
fallwinter 199091 collection particularly in his evening wear 
armani whose day wear with its tailored suits and multitude of 
jackets in super soft tweeds has become a trademark of the moda 
milanese has for several seasons concentrated on evening to give 
the armani woman an aroundtheclock choice of outfits 
his afterfive wear for next winter is more feminine and 
flattering than ever delicate gold lace velvet embroidered with 
graceful silk flowers tiny pearl passamenterie the softest of 
silk printed in dainty porcelain prints all combine to create an 
image of fragile beauty like a ming vase 
the shape too is vaselike with a tiny velvet richly 
embroidered blouse with high collar and long sleeves creating a 
narrow bodice to the flowing silk printed skirt or pajama pants 
below 
the new armani jacket is longer than ever reaching far below the 
hip often with a rounded lapel and silk cord belt like a chinese 
robe other jackets have no lapel are loose and close in a single 
button at the shoulder 
like ferre the armani skirt is a good many inches longer than 
the rest of the milan runway never more than several inches above 
the knee the hemline is rounded and has an unfinished look to it 
a style he introduced several seasons ago 
armani says his aim is to let women choose their own 
direction without falling into the trap of trendiness 
along with his new feminine look armani proposes a series of 
mantailored outfits to satisfy the woman that identifies his 
style with the transposition of menswear into womens clothing 
the new armani pant suit in ultra light wool tweeds inspired by 
silk tie patterns has a longer jacket with narrower shoulders but 
a wider rounded base the trousers are baggy and cuffed a 
masculine shirt with mandarine collar completes the outfit 
coats play heavily in the new collection they are either full 
and superlong with plush lining or long slim military coats closed 
at the waist by a brown leather silver buckled belt 
armani made yet another fashion statement wednesday night at 
the end of his much applauded collection presented in the theater 
of his downtown milan headquarters 
for the first time in memory he appeared on the runway to take 
a bow in jacket and tie as opposed to the usual casual sweater 
throwing down the gauntlet to fellow designer gianni versace who 
during the mens collections in january decreed the death of the 
tie 
versace took his runway bow earlier in the week in a polo shirt

lhasa residents passed the first anniversary of 
martial law thursday under heavy security and there were no 
reports of renewed protests by tibetan nationalists 
authorities felt confident enough of their control to allow 
tibets strongly nationalist buddhist monks to hold a major prayer 
festival moinlam qenmo which has been the occasion of 
antichinese protests in the past 
the 10day festival which began last week draws hundreds of 
monks to lhasas ancient jokhang temple last year chinese 
authorities canceled the festival for fear of unrest but tibetans 
held a small march anyway 
police opened fire triggering three days of violent clashes 
that ended when martial law took effect march 8 it was the fourth 
bloody confrontation with tibetan nationalists since 1987 
lhasa authorities who have tightly restricted tourism to the 
remote city in the past year made sure even fewer foreigners would 
be there this week 
travel agents in chengdu the main gateway to lhasa said no new 
tour groups were being allowed in from march 1 until march 15 
one of the few foreigners in lhasa speaking on condition of 
anonymity said by telephone that the city appeared quiet thursday 
sporadic reports in recent weeks indicate that authorities 
stepped up already tight security in anticipation of the 
anniversary 
the peoples armed police a paramilitary force paraded through 
the city center on feb 20 the local radio said thousands of 
police a column of armored cars and other vehicles took part in 
the parade held to display their majestic appearance 
a special team was sent into a leading monastery ganden to 
weed out rioters according to another official report police 
also said they arrested six people for alleged separatist 
activities and seized several guns bullets separatist leaflets 
and banned tibetan flags 
the official xinhua news agency said the government shipped half 
a ton of butter to lhasa for last months celebration of tibetan 
new year in an apparent effort to placate the public tibetans use 
butter in tea and burn it in candles at religious shrines 
at the same time authorities issued stern warnings against 
renewed protests 
we must fully maintain our vigilance the local radio quoted 
tibetan communist party secretary hu jintao as saying if those 
separatist elements dare to stir up trouble again we will 
resolutely strike a heavy blow at them 
china claims sovereignty over tibet dating back to the 13th 
century but there were long periods when tibet had virtually no 
contact with china and nationalists say it was actually 
independent 
chinas red army entered in 1950 the chinese set up communes 
closed monasteries and for years banned traditional religious and 
cultural activies in the 1980s china reopened several monasteries 
but many tibetans remain bitter 
smallscale protests have continued despite martial law in 
september a small group of buddhist nuns shouted proindependence 
slogans during a festival and were arrested immediately 
when tibets exiled religious leader the dalai lama won the 
nobel peace prize in october tibetans showed their joy by making 
ritual offerings of barley flour outside the jokhang

a federal judge has ruled that the reagan 
administration acted within the constitution when in 1984 it barred 
family planning aid to private foreign organizations that perform 
abortions 
it is within the executive branchs plenary authority over 
foreign affairs to disassociate the united states completely from 
foreign organizations based upon their views or activities us 
district judge john walker said in a decision wednesday 
walker made the finding in dismissing a lawsuit by the planned 
parenthood federation of america challenging the policy 
the policy which was adopted by the agency for international 
development in 1984 and continued under president bush requires 
that foreign private health agencies in return for american 
grants certify that they did not perform or actively promote 
abortion as a method of family planning 
planned parenthood which assists private foreign agencies had 
charged that the policy was a violation of their first amendment 
right to advocate abortion and interfered with the rights of 
privacy of people seeking family planning information 
roger evans planned parenthoods director of litigation said 
the organization would appeal the judges ruling 
the ruling was the second time walker had dismissed the lawsuit 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals sent the lawsuit back to 
walker saying he must decide the constitutional questions of free 
speech and free association of american workers overseas who are 
affected by the policy

house investigators will seek a grant of 
immunity for a onetime aide of samuel r pierce jr seeking 
testimony that pierce made politically tainted contract awards as 
housing secretary in the reagan administration sources said 
thursday 
the former department of housing and urban development official 
dubois gilliam is serving a federal prison sentence for a 
conviction in a hudrelated case 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
employment and housing panel of the government operations committee 
would ask a federal court to grant gilliam immunity from 
prosecution for any crimes he might discuss during congressional 
testimony 
pierce has refused to testify to the subcommittee he is also 
being investigated by an independent counsel to determine whether 
there was illegal activity in the awarding of grants under a hud 
rehabilitation program 
several former pierce aides have refused to testify before the 
subcommittee citing their fifth amendment rights against 
selfincrimination among them was deborah dean pierces former 
top aide the panel considered seeking a grant of immunity to 
compel her testimony but then dropped the idea 
a hud source described the move with gilliam as a breakthrough 
saying he knows everything 
pierce has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has accused the 
subcommittee of targeting him despite evidence to support his 
position 
the independent counsel former federal judge alvin adams met 
with subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif this week and said 
he would not object if the subcommittee sought immunity for 
gilliam the sources said 
pierce attorney paul l perito said he questioned whether 
gilliam would provide truthful testimony or merely seek to curry 
support for a reduced sentence perito also objected to the 
development on grounds it could interfere with the independent 
counsels review 
gilliam was a deputy assistant secretary in huds community 
planning and development office a post that gave him oversight of 
urban development action grants and a technical assistance program 
paid for through discretionary funds 
subcommittee aides recently visited him at the california prison 
where he is serving an 18month sentence and the sources said he 
could provide testimony about the role of pierce in contract awards 
former hud officials described gilliam as a trusted pierce aide 
who was in line to become the secretarys executive assistant 
agency documents show many funding requests were routed through 
gilliam 
a 1986 internal audit of the technical assistance program 
roundly criticized its administration saying most contracts were 
for proposals that had been sent to hud unsolicited often were 
approved although incomplete or unnecessary and then were financed 
at levels that allowed exorbitant overhead costs 
an associated press review of the program last year found that 
among the grant recipients was the match institution a company 
headed by a man pierce had picked to head a black republican panel 
set up to advise reagan also benefiting from the program was a 
company called one america inc whose president once served as 
chairwoman of the gop group the council of 100 
also receiving technical assistance funding was a mississippi 
company called promark whose owner had a longstanding association 
with gilliam 
both one america and promark first received technical 
assistance grants during gilliams tenure which ended in early 
1988 hud documents show one america president elaine b jenkins 
wrote gilliam several times seeking additional grants 
pierce in his final days in office signed contracts making new 
grants to both one america and promark according to hud documents 
and interviews but those contracts were canceled by hud secretary 
jack kemp shortly after he took over for pierce 
gilliam was quoted in the new york times as saying pierce 
ordered him to give a 300000 grant to a longtime pierce friend 
samuel singletary who had managed pierces unsuccessful campaigns 
for a new york judgeship pierces order overruled agency officials 
who had recommended rejection of the proposal gilliam said 
gilliam as part of a plea agreement in the mississippi case 
pleaded guilty to accepting cash gifts from a hud contractor and 
conspiring to use a hud grant for personal gain

despite efforts to reduce lead in the 
environment millions of american children have levels of lead in 
their blood that could cause health problems a government official 
told congress thursday 
dr vernon n houk director of environmental health for the 
federal centers for disease control said lead exposure is 
devastating to the developing brains and nervous systems of 
fetuses and young children 
experts have steadily reduced their estimate of blood lead 
levels that have toxic effects so that blood lead levels that 
cause concern for young children today 10 to 15 micrograms per 
deciliter are onesixth the levels of concern in the 1960s and 
before houk said 
today in the united states millions of children from all 
geographic areas and socioeconomic strata have blood lead levels 
high enough to cause adverse health effects he said 
houk was joined by other federal health and housing officials 
private health advocates and lead industry officials in discussing 
the toxic effects of lead before the senate environment and public 
works subcommittee on toxic substances environmental oversight 
research and development 
dr ellen k silbergeld a scientist with the new yorkbased 
environmental defense fund cited federal estimates in 1988 that 
nearly three million children under the age of 6 have lead levels 
considered dangerous 
she said her group estimated 50 percent of children under 6 are 
affected by lead from leadbased paint and 90 percent of urban 
minority poor children may be affected 
lead has been used in paints gasoline solders batteries and 
other products many uses have been decreased or eliminated such 
as lead in gasoline and in paints 
but lead continues to be used some areas and remains in the 
environment in existing paints plumbing systems and in dust and 
soils said victor j kimm deputy assistant administrator of the 
environmental protection agencys office of pesticides and toxic 
substances 
sen harry reid dnev said the estimates of exposure in 
children are alarming and called for increased federal efforts to 
regulate and clean up lead in the environment

federal investigators focused on a motor 
found hanging loose under a subway car as they looked for the cause 
of a derailment that peeled open a train like a sardine can 
killing three people and injuring 162 
the subway line which normally serves 100000 riders per day 
was out of service today transit employees used bullhorns to 
direct passengers to and from 97 buses temporarily assigned to the 
eastwest city streets above the empty tunnel police lined the bus 
routes to keep traffic moving during the morning rush 
news reports citing unidentified sources said the dragging 
electric motor may have hit a switch and caused the train to jump 
the tracks wednesday and passengers reported bumping and a bam 
bam bam before the accident 
the train smashed into three support beams during the morning 
rush hour trapping victims for up to five hours a surgeon who 
took part in the rescue dr jina joder said she used a 
paramedics buck knife to cut the leg off a dead man to free a 
victim beneath him 
officials said it was the worst accident in the 21 years the 
southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority has operated the 
regional commuter system whose trains run underground downtown and 
above ground in outlying areas 
national transportation safety board member john lauber said 
late wednesday that one end of the motor had separated from the 
train and that railroad ties leading up to the accident scene were 
chipped 
lauber said his agency is investigating whether the broken motor 
was a cause or effect of the accident russell gober ntsb 
investigator in charge said he had not yet checked the maintenance 
and inspection records of the car 
i was in the first car and as we went through the station you 
could hear the train hit something like something was dragging it 
went bam bam bam said mark robinson who was en route home 
from an overnight cashiers job 
the second and third cars were bent and the whole side of the 
second car was torn off robinson said it was peeled like a 
sardine can 
doctors amputated the right leg of one woman to free her from 
the wreckage but she died four hours later of complications from a 
second broken leg and severe chest injuries said hahnemann 
university hospital spokeswoman linda clossey 
all three of the dead were among seven passengers trapped in the 
wreckage authorities said of the 162 people treated at 10 
hospitals two remained in critical condition this morning more 
than 100 were treated and released 
people were screaming said passenger robert rogers it 
was dark and people were going left and right and were falling off 
the tracks and stuff 
lauber said the ntsb hadnt seen any reason to order other cars 
pulled off the subway line which serves about 100000 riders a day 
if in the course of the investigation we run into anything 
that demands immediate attention we would issue an emergency 
recommendation he said 
louis gambaccini the transit authoritys general manager said 
the cars on the line are about 30 years old and there had been no 
indication of problems he said the cars have been well maintained 
but that the entire fleet will be inspected 
however the philadelphia inquirer reported today that bolts 
holding the motors in place have broken before and that the transit 
agency tried to solve the problem by bracing the motors with a bar 
under them 
a preliminary inspection indicated there was no danger of a 
cavein of the subway tunnel said transit inspector james sweeney 
the city medical examiners office identified one of the dead as 
denise devlin 34 of philadelphia the name of a 52yearold 
philadelphia man was withheld until his family could be notified 
and a third victim a 60yearold woman could not immediately be 
identified

president bush announced today a new 
transportation policy that calls for more user fees toll roads and 
local government help he said it would help keep america the 
world leader in transportation 
bush and transportation secretary samuel skinner unveiled the 
longawaited policy moving america into the 21st century to 
members of congress and industry officials many of whom already 
had found reason to criticize it 
its overall goal is to maintain the us transportation system 
as the finest in the world however the report said there 
are increasing signs that the system is beginning to break 
down 
if we work together in this joint venture america can 
continue to be the world leader in transportation bush said 
when transportation lags or is congested when people and 
goods are stranded in traffic or in airports they will suffer 
bush said when people and goods flow through a responsive 
wellmaintained and efficient transportation system our quality of 
life improves with it 
sen james exon dneb chairman of the senate surface 
transportation subcommittee said im going to be looking 
through this to see whether or not this simply doesnt transfer the 
problems we have with the infrastructure as we head to the 21st 
century off the backs of the federal government and onto the backs 
of state and local governments 
he questioned the administrations logic they said today that 
moving people in a speedy fashion was obviously necessary while at 
the same time theyre suggesting that we zero out all subsidies for 
amtrak exon said 
rep norman mineta dcalif chairman of the house surface 
transportation subcommittee called the proposal a good start 
but said the administration had failed to address the big 
question of funding 
shifting programs to the state and local level without financial 
resources would be the shift and the shaft said mineta 
rep john paul hammerschmidt of arkansas the top republican on 
the house subcommittee said i think the money has to come from 
users one way or another and because it is a national plan the 
logical way for it to come from users is through a national tax 
system 
a coalition of 16 aviation industry groups said it opposes 
bushs proposed increases in aviation taxes which the presidents 
fiscal 1991 budget calls user fees the american public transit 
association said the policy was long on advice and short on 
help 
the 129page policy published in a book with illustrations 
showing everything from a futuristic airplane to a trafficclogged 
freeway covered a wide range of issues affecting air land and 
water transportation 
anyone looking for a farreaching program such as the interstate 
highway system begun in the eisenhower administration is likely to 
be disappointed 
the policy statement outlined no strategy that would involve 
major federal funding beyond that already called for in the 
presidents budget 
it proposed that users including airline passengers and 
motorists pay more of the cost of building maintaining and 
administering major transport systems 
the policy set out six key goals 
maintain and expand the nations transportation system by 
shifting major responsibilities onto local governments and 
encouraging more private investment while concentrating federal 
funding on projects of national significance 
foster a sound financial base for transportation 
emphasizing user fees as the key element to financing the federal 
share of transportation expenditures as well as spending some of 
the billions of dollars in the aviation and highway trust funds 
keep transportation businesses strong and competitive by 
deregulating the trucking industry and further deregulating other 
transportation sectors including repealing railroad employee 
liability and retirement laws opposed by the rail industry 
ensure that the transportation system supports public safety 
and national security 
protect the environment and the quality of life by reducing 
pollution emissions by motor vehicles 
advance us transportation technology for the 21st century by 
encouraging research into highspeed rail magnetically levitated 
trains tiltrotor aircraft and intelligent vehicle and highway 
systems that use computers to increase safety and efficiency 
proposals that shift more of the cost to users are rising 
concerns in the aviation mass transit and trucking industries 
skinner had described the policy to industry groups and some 
people outside government saw drafts before it was released 
the transportation department began working on the proposal 
shortly after skinner took office early last year holding 117 
hearings in 48 cities to get suggestions 
the public transit group said the administrations policy 
would give uncle sam junior partnership in the traditional 
intergovernmental alliance that has underwritten mass transit for 
more than 25 years the group said in a statement 
the air transport association said it generally supported the 
new policy but opposed an airport head tax that is included bush 
called for such a fee as well as other user charges in his fiscal 
1991 budget 
ata which represents major airlines also has been looking for 
clear national standards on noise levels at airports and a 
timetable for phasing out older noisier airliners neither is 
found in the new policy 
the aircraft owners and pilots association speaking for 
thousands of private pilots said the policy would have the federal 
government rely too much on state and local governments for 
improvements in aviation 
the american trucking associations objected to skinners call 
for more toll roads and to the lack of a detailed plan for spending 
the 10 billion surplus in the highway trust fund collected from 
federal gasoline taxes 
jerry bastarache spokesman for the highway users federation 
said the group generally likes the policy because it calls for 
greater capacity and highway improvements 
but he said some areas cause concern including toll roads and 
proposals for higher proportions of matching funds from local 
governments in transportation department projects

the food and drug administration said thursday 
it will ban the sale of all nonprescription drugs used to treat 
enlargement of the prostate gland 
the agency said its review of these products found little 
evidence any of them eliminates arrests or treats the condition 
called benign prostatic hypertrophy 
surgery is currently the only effective treatment the fda said 
the condition causes enlargement of the male gland which can 
obstruct the flow of urine create back pressure in the kidneys and 
cause urinary tract infections that are difficult to treat the fda 
said 
the overthecounter products which contain the amino acids 
glycine alanine and glutamic acid and a plant extract called 
sabal can relieve some symptoms of the condition however their 
use also could lull men with the condition into a sense of false 
security which could delay their getting proper treatment the 
agency said 
few of these products are being sold today the fda said 
about 50 percent to 80 percent of men with the condition will 
develop unstable bladders and have symptoms of frequency and 
urgency of urination 
the fda said the ban will take effect in six months 
the agencys review of the products was part of its ongoing 
review of overthecounter drugs

oliver north will testify that he lied 
lied lied to congress about the irancontra affair on 
instructions from john poindexter a prosecutor said today in 
opening statements at poindexters trial 
north was not out there as a lone ranger over this 
multimilliondollar enterprise to assist the nicaraguan rebels 
irancontra prosecutor dan webb told a jury of seven women and five 
men defendant john poindexter was right in the middle of it 
webb told the jury that north the governments leadoff witness 
will tell you that after being instructed by poindexter he 
met with thenhouse intelligence committee chairman lee hamilton on 
aug 6 1986 
at that meeting north was asked question after question 
about whether he was raising money and providing military 
assistance to the contras said webb specific names were used 
places 
webb previewing norths upcoming testimony said he lied he 
lied he lied one false statement after another 
every answer he gave is false it worked like a charm said 
webb hamilton later told poindexter to thank nlegal gratuity 
norths testimony was crucial to irancontra prosecutors because 
it bolsters their assertion that poindexter was trying to cover up 
from congress his knowledge of a november 1985 shipment of hawk 
antiaircraft missiles to iran and norths covert military 
assistance to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
poindexters lawyers contended that norths statements on both 
points were based on testimony that poindexter gave to congress in 
1987 under a grant of immunity prosecutors disagreed 
no part of a prosecutors case may be derived from a defendants 
immunized testimony 
the government contends that poindexters knowledge of the 
existence of the finding was his motive in november 1986 for 
concealing from congress the us involvement in the missile 
shipment

negotiations to extend the stay of 
us military bases were set for midapril and their success 
depends on how the united states explains aid cuts the foreign 
secretary said thursday 
no specific agenda has been set for the preliminary talks said 
foreign secretary raul manglapus 
this is an exploratory talk we dont expect commitments he 
said we will have to assess the responses and attitudes of the 
us government in order to help us arrive at our own decision 
he said the philippines is particularly interested in hearing 
the reasons why congress cut 96 million in aid in january 
some filipinos consider the reduction a violation of the october 
1988 agreement under which the united states offered to give the 
philippines about 962 million in the last two years of the 1947 
military bases agreement which expires in 1991 
about 2000 members of militant feminist groups marking 
international womens day marched to the us embassy calling for 
the immediate dismantling of the six us bases in the philippines 
speaking at a rally in front of the embassy sister mary john 
mananzan a roman catholic nun and head of the leftist gabriela 
womens alliance said the bases obstructed philippine economic 
progress because they represented foreign control of the country 
we say out with the us military bases so that we can 
achieve genuine development she said 
the united states maintains clark air base subic bay naval base 
and four other smaller facilities in the philippines 
a new bases treaty must be ratified by twothirds of the 
philippines 23member senate where opposition to the bases is 
strong also many in the 195member house of representatives have 
urged president corazon aquino to postpone the talks until the aid 
is restored 
mrs aquino has refused to say publicly whether she supports 
extending the stay of the us bases but has agreed to talks 
meanwhile a clandestine leftwing rebel umbrella group the 
national democratic front distributed a statement at the 
demonstration accusing mrs aquino of being a puppet of the united 
states who has connived with other filipino officials to keep the 
us military bases in the philippines 
the front which includes the outlawed communist party of the 
philippines and its military arm the new peoples army urged 
filipinos to take up arms and wage liberating violence against 
the criminal us and its running dogs

the government thursday approved a 
draft of the 1990 budget that will include major cuts in defense 
state subsidies and funding for the communist party an official 
said 
finance minister vaclav klaus said the austerity measures will 
cut 15 billion from a budget first proposed by the nations 
communist government before it was overthrown peacefully late last 
year 
we have managed to turn a budget calling for a deficit of 1 
billion into a budget with a 500 million surplus klaus said 
he said savings will also be made by slashing price subsidies in 
agriculture mining administration and security but gave no 
further details 
klaus said price rises were inevitable on heavily subsidized 
items such as food housing and transportation and said he expected 
the price rises to be felt even before free elections scheduled for 
june 89 
there is nothing to wait for the elections can be no 
watershed a cheap policy could be counterproductive klaus said 
he said a compensation scheme was being prepared to help those who 
will be hardest hit by the price increases 
the new budget requires final approval by parliament 
czechoslovakias current inflation rate is between 25 percent 
and 35 percent and the nation has a foreign debt of 79 billion 
one of the lowest per capita in the soviet bloc czechoslovak 
premier marian calfa said in his february report to parliament 
klaus also said stateowned industries will be sold to the 
private sector very quickly but 30 to 40 mostly public service 
industries such as railways and water will remain under state 
control

new orleans a committee at louisiana state university medical 
center concluded today that it should not stop researchers from 
firing pellets into the brains of anesthetized cats despite 
opposition from animal rights groups 
the 2 million project funded by the department of defense was 
suspended in november pending results of the internal review and a 
us general accounting office study of the program the status of 
the gao study hasnt been made public 
dr michael e carey of lsu has said his project is aimed at 
studying head injuries and evaluating treatments 
the committee concluded that the project addressed critical 
scientific problems and that dr careys approach was well 
conceived proper and made maximum effort to protect the welfare 
of animals the review committees report said 
the research involving hundreds of animals is designed to learn 
how to return braininjured soldiers to active duty 
a group called the physicians committee for responsible medicine 
had asked defense secretary dick cheney to cancel the contract 
saying the research is redundant scientifically flawed and 
ethically unacceptable 
the group said the primary conclusions by lsu researchers is 
that respiration stops when the brain is injured information 
critics say had been documented in neurosurgical literature for 
nearly 100 years 
the lsu faculty committee reviewing the project made up of five 
medical doctors and two phds said careys project had received 
unwarranted and distorted coverage in the news media 
the committee was adamant in the opinion that the project 
should be continued and that the university should take the 
position of a strong defense on behalf of dr carey the report

the government will begin paying for certain 
liver transplants in medicare beneficiaries health and human 
services secretary louis sullivan announced thursday 
medicare is expected to spend 10 million for the operations in 
the first year and 120 million by the fifth year as more 
hospitals gain approval for reimbursement under the liver 
transplant program 
but sulliivan said the net impact on the medicare budget would 
be lower because the transplants will save the costs of treating 
patients with advanced liver disease he did not estimate the 
expected savings 
under the proposed rule medicare payment would allowed for 
transplants in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis primary 
sclerosing cholangitis hepatitis b antigen negative or 
postnecrotic cirrhosis alcoholic cirrhosis alpha1 antitrypsin 
deficiency disease wilsons disease and primary hemochromatosis 
a public health service study found liver transplants are safe 
and effective in treating those conditions in adults 
more than 3500 liver transplants have been performed in the 
united states 
to qualify for payment under the program a hospital must have a 
written patientselection process for choosing patients for whom 
the operation is most likely to be successful 
they also must show that at least 77 percent of their adult 
patients with the conditions covered under the program survive for 
at least one year after receiving a new liver and that 60 percent 
of them live at least two years 
the process is similar to the system used to approve hospitals 
for performing heart transplants on medicare beneficiaries the 
department said 
after a 60day period for public comment a final regulation 
will be published in the federal register and become effective

two weeks before her fraud and racketeering 
trial imelda marcos is trying to follow her lawyers advice but 
sometimes its hard for a woman used to the world as her forum to 
keep quiet 
for months the 60yearold mrs marcos has ignored incessant 
interview requests choosing instead to pore over legal documents 
in a cool dark room that was once the wine cellar of her makiki 
heights home 
her new lead attorney wyoming maverick gerry spence said the 
only way the usually outspoken mrs marcos will get a fair trial in 
this country is if she keeps her mouth shut and lets the evidence 
speak for itself 
she has been branded as a crook and a thief everyone thinks 
of her as that woman with the shoes spence said in a recent 
telephone interview 
nearly every evening she visits the tomb of her late husband 
former philippines president ferdinand marcos the visits are timed 
to avoid tourists 
on wednesday night mrs marcos broke her silence saying in an 
interview that she is a misunderstood nervous and lonely widow 
and fears standing trial now that her defense team has been shaken 
up 
washington attorney richard hibey withdrew from the case less 
than a month before her federal trial in new york was scheduled to 
begin 
i dont know how my present lawyers can familiarize themselves 
with more than three years of litigation just before my trial 
she said this is most unjust and so detrimental to my defense 
hibey and attorney sandor frankel of new york withdrew after 
prosecutors said hibey faced a possible conflict of interest 
because they intended to call one of his partners as a witness 
us district judge john keenan delayed the start of the trial 
for six days to march 20 
mrs marcos and her husband who died in september were charged 
in october 1988 with fraud and racketeering counts accusing them of 
stealing more than 100 million from the philippine treasury to buy 
art and real estate they also were charged with defrauding banks 
of 165 million in loans 
defense attorneys say the key to mrs marcos defense is proving 
that the marcoses were forced out of the philippines during a 1986 
popular revolt with a promise of safe haven in the united states 
and that they did not leave willingly even though protesters 
threatened to overrun the presidential palace 
chief prosecutor charles labella refused to comment on the case 
although exile in hawaii has meant a series of indignities 
life was never bleaker than after marcos died mrs marcos said 
she added that mounting medical funeral and legal expenses and 
philippine president corazon aquinos refusal to let him be buried 
in his homeland also were discouraging 
the late dictator ruled the philippines for two decades 
most of the marcos alleged billions of dollars in assets have 
been frozen as part of the criminal indictment and because of more 
than a dozen civil lawsuits accusing the marcoses of acts ranging 
from corruption to murder 
mrs marcos refused to say where she gets her money allowing 
only that millions of dollars in legal and medical bills remain 
unpaid and that she relies on the goodwill of friends to stay 
afloat 
the us government does not control mrs marcos spending 
habits but requires her to submit a monthly accounting and receive 
special permission if she wants to spend more than 10000 a month 
marcos aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said the budget 
has fallen sharply from a high of about 200000 a month shortly 
after the marcoses fled here 
one source of money is mrs marcos daughter irene araneta who 
lives in woodside calif and is married to the son of a wealthy 
filipino industrialist aides said 
marcos spokesman roger peyuan said the marcoses have accumulated 
more than 3 million in legal bills he said the household staff of 
about 30 is paid irregularly but remains loyal because the marcoses 
have helped us so much and this is when she really needs us 
its very difficult to be a widow to be alone for the first 
time mrs marcos said i must admit that ferdinand handled all 
of this money business everything like that we led a very 
compartmentalized life 
during the interview at her home she appeared at times nervous 
apprehensive and lonely wringing her hands and fidgeting only to 
turn hopeful philosophical and reminiscent giggling and reading 
romantic inscriptions on cards from someone who signed them 
andy 
she recalled her past with no regret 
everything in life comes in pairs good and bad day and 
night yin and yang she said ferdinand always said you 
cannot argue with destiny just stay on top of it im just trying 
to keep control of my life

bombs rained down on the afghan capital 
and the sound of artillery thundered through the city during the 
attempt to overthrow the government said travelers arriving 
thursday from afghanistan 
the ariana airlines plane was the first international flight to 
leave kabul airport since the attempt to overthrow president najib 
was launched tuesday some passengers said that considering the 
ferocity of the attack civilian casualties appeared low 
stateowned radio kabul said thursday night 56 people were 
killed and 200 injured since tuesday 
many of the 150 passengers on the jet had been scheduled to 
leave kabul on tuesday but had their plans changed by the coup 
attempt which began with an air raid on the international airport 
four jets began bombing the airport just before we were to 
leave we grabbed our hand luggage and ran said ashok patel an 
indian businessman we walked for about 12 kilometers 8 miles 
and sucked icicles to quench our thirst he said there were no 
taxis after the attack and none the next day either 
three people working with the international committee of the red 
cross were among the travelers they refused to give their names 
and nationalities but said casualties were not as high as might 
have been expected 
in fact we as westerners were quite amazed at the normalcy 
while there was quite obviously a coup going on one said 
other travelers spoke of repeated explosions the boom of 
artillery and people fleeing from the streets into the relative 
safety of houses and cellars 
i was very scared said harinder singh an afghan whose 
ancestors were sikhs from india all of us thought we were going 
to die a bomb exploded in a taxi near me and i saw the driver 
being blown apart 
singh said he walked from the airport back to the city tuesday 
and spent the next day worrying about his luggage which had 
already been checked onto the plane 
but there was a curfew and i couldnt do anything about it 
and when i heard there was flight today thursday i just got 
on he said ill check about the luggage later

soldiers killed in the invasion which ousted gen manuel antonio 
noriega 
at the ceremony bush joined top generals and admirals in a 
darkened hall where spotlights played on nearly 200 soldiers 
sailors airmen and marines standing at attention bearing 
bayonets rifles and the flag of each state and territory 
the honors began with the roar of a 21gun salute from cannons 
outside the ceremonial hall that doubles as the base gymnasium 
it ended with the old guard fife and drum corps in colonial 
garb marching off after the army band played the anthems of all 
four services 
were here today to add another campaign streamer to the roll 
call of glory the roster of great american campaigns yorktown 
gettysburg normandy and now panama said bush

antiapartheid activists are 
behind an outbreak of violence in tribal homelands because they 
dont want to negotiate the government suggested thursday 
the violence is certainly part of an overall plan to 
destabilize the country and make it difficult to commence 
negotiations said constitutional development minister gerrit 
viljoen 
it is quite clear that certain elements pretend to be keen on 
participating in negotiating reform but are in effect not ready to 
do so he said apparently referring to the african national 
congress and other leading black groups 
they have been caught on the wrong foot by the initiatives of 
the state president viljoen said 
anc spokesman pallo jordan in lusaka zambia denied that the 
recently legalized organization was behind the violence which has 
led to 200 deaths in the past month according to business day 
newspaper in johannesburg 
he said tension had been building in some of the 10 homelands 
which the apartheid system has designated as the national states 
where the black majority of 28 million can own land and exercise 
political rights 
the language of violence looting and arson reveals the 
bitterness in the hearts of many of our people but it is senseless 
and savage in the extreme said the rev stanley mogoba 
president of the methodist church of southern africa and a 
prominent black antiapartheid activist 
there may be leaders and groups who are encouraging this type 
of behavior he said if true then i must brand these adults 
cowards who do not have the interests of our nation at heart 
mogoba said 
homeland army troops fired automatic rifles shotguns rubber 
bullets and tear gas at protesters and used whips to disperse 
crowds in bophuthatswana where demonstrators are demanding that 
the nominally independent tswana republic be reincorporated into 
south africa 
soldiers and police in armored personnel carriers and trucks 
randomly opened fire with assault rifles to stop crowds forming in 
the garankuwa area witnesses said 
youths erected barricades of burned out vehicles to block 
streets but were chased away by soldiers and police who tore down 
the barriers eyewitnesses said there were no immediate reports of 
casualties 
viljoen the cabinet minister in charge of beginning 
negotiations with black leaders on a new constitution and an end to 
apartheid made his accusation at a cape town news conference 
with him was hudson ntsanwisi leader of the gazankulu homeland 
which shares a border with kruger park the nations largest 
wildlife reserve 
after a meeting with president fw de klerk ntsanwisi was 
granted national police personnel and equipment to help quell a 
threeweek work stoppage that has closed government offices 
schools businesses and shops in gazankulu homeland of the 
shangaan people black workers at the nearby kruger parks main 
camp went on strike thursday 
at least 25 people have been killed and more than 200 huts 
burned in the past two weeks in the homeland where activists are 
demanding ntsanwisis ouster 
de klerk accused unspecified groups of making mischief and 
when foreign minister pik botha was asked wednesday night if the 
anc was involved he said the government had no proof 
but viljoens comments were interpreted by local newspapers and 
by the anc as referring to the organization which de klerk 
legalized feb 2 
anc affiliates in johannesburg issued a statement thursday 
deploring violence in the township of katlehong 15 miles to the 
southeast and sent teams to arrange peace talks between warring 
factions 
a black man was hacked with knives and a woman was shot 
thursday police said five houses and nine vehicles were burned 
up to 70 people were injured early thursday the independent south 
african press association said 
in another development lawyers for more than 340 prisoners on 
robben island in cape town said their clients had ended a twoweek 
hunger strike the lawyers said the government is considering the 
prisoners demands to be granted political status and ultimately 
freedom

the rev billy graham is bringing his crusade 
for christianity to the berlin wall to fill the spiritual void left 
by retreating communism the us evangelist and german religious 
leaders said thursday 
graham said the sweeping events of eastern europe have lessened 
the danger of nuclear confrontation but that in its place have 
appeared threats of hedonism materialism and 
selfgratification 
at a news conference to discuss his saturday evangelical meeting 
at the berlin wall graham said many people who were repressed 
under communism were ready to heed his message 
a few weeks ago president vaclav havel of czechoslovakia in 
an address to the united states congress declared that the 
salvation of the world lies not in slick political slogans about 
freedom and democracy but rather in the human heart i agree with 
that graham said 
graham said he accepted an invitation from religious leaders in 
both germanys to address a gathering saturday because i felt 
germany was on the verge of a spiritual awakening 
hartmut stepp a west german evangelical church leader from 
stuttgart said grahams ministry was sought at this time because 
a spiritual ideological vacuum exists because of this social 
upheaval 
grahams crusade comes just a week before east germans go to the 
polls for their firstever free elections which will seat a new 
parliament and set the nation on the road to reunification with 
west germany 
graham said the date for his appearance was set when the east 
german vote was planned for may 6 the election had to be advanced 
because of the swiftly worsening economic and political situation 
in east germany 
i dont want to say anything to indicate which side im on 
because i must be politically neutral graham replied when asked 
how his christian crusade might affect the elections 
the east german christian democratic union aligned with the 
christian democratic union of west germany that is headed by 
chancellor helmut kohl has been emphasizing its religious roots in 
the campaign but the party trails the social democrats who are 
predicted to win a majority of seats in the parliamentary elections 
posters announcing the crusade call on germans on both sides of 
the wall to listen to the man whose message can give meaning to 
life billy graham 
graham 71 has conducted eight previous evangelical crusades in 
germany the first in 1954 when much of the nation still lay in 
ruins tens of thousands of west germans attended those gatherings 
he has also preached in the soviet union hungary romania 
czechoslovakia and yugoslavia

oldguard italian communists acknowledged 
thursday they were fighting a losing battle to save the traditional 
identity of their party its name and symbols 
party leader achille occhetto has all the votes he needs at the 
extraordinary congress of the italian communist party to guarantee 
the success of his proposal to revamp the party a move expected to 
lead to changing its name and eliminating its hammerandsickle 
symbol 
it is true 65 percent of the votes in the congress are in his 
favor said armando cossutta who has fought to block any reform 
that could destroy the partys traditional identity 
but he argued it was not enough just to decide what form the new 
party would take how it will be formed and who will lead it he 
said the congress should decide if life really must be given to a 
new party 
occhetto speaks as if it is our fault that we have not 
succeeded in being in the government as if anticommunism 
stemmed from our name and not from forces that want to keep every 
prospect of change a long way from the government cossutta said 
to lukewarm applause from the 1092 delegates gathered in bolognas 
sports palace awash in red for the congress that ends this weekend 
other oldguard communists such as aldo tortorella have argued 
that the wests largest communist party which claims 14 million 
members could conduct major reforms without creating a new party 
we are divided on what is a party of the left said 
tortorella 
for this reason we have defended our revered symbols our 
name and our flag it is true this name has been muddied by 
others but they are the ones that must change it he added 
tortorella collapsed just after he descended from the speakers 
platform on the red multitired dais doctors said later that he 
had fainted because he was suffering from too much stress he was 
taken to a hospital but doctors said he needed only to rest 
occhetto has pushed for the birth of a new party as part of an 
effort to reverse the partys electoral slide and offer an 
alternative to the domination of the christian democrats and their 
allies 
the communists nearly came to power in 1976 when they won 34 
percent of the vote but they dropped to about 27 percent in the 
last parliamentary elections in 1987 
the strongest criticism i have of the party secretary is that 
he created the illusion in the body of the party and in public 
opinion that with this proposal it is possible to unblock the 
political situation dominated by the christian democrats and their 
allies for 40 years cossutta said 
i dont know a single communist who doesnt want to open the 
situation and who doesnt want us to be in the government he 
added 
but he said the objectives could not be reached simply by 
launching a new party he said the partys electoral slide began 
before the storm in eastern europe 
we lost votes among all the classes but particularly among 
the working classes because they disagreed not with our image but 
with the substance of our political action the uncertainty of 
those years 
he was referring to the drift in the communist party since it 
abandoned the historic compromise of the late 1970s through 
which it supported the christian democrats in return for being 
consulted on major government decisions 
if the problem remains one of substance then there is no need 
for us to eliminate our symbols and our name said tortorella 
he agreed with occhetto that unity was essential for the party 
which has been fractured by the debate over changing its identity

the government on thursday introduced legislation 
to enable prosecutors to charge three aging emigres as nazi war 
criminals and police said they probably will set up a special unit 
to investigate more suspects 
the nazihunting simon wiesenthal center said britain was 
finally on the threshold of meting out justice to the suspects 
eastern europeans who fled after world war ii and became 
naturalized britons 
government officials said they hoped the war crimes bill would 
be passed by the summer raising the prospect of the first trial as 
early as years end 
but critics declared the bill was a revenge measure that would 
result in emotional and unfair show trials 
legislating in a spirit of revenge rarely produces good 
said governing conservative party lawmaker robert adley a leading 
critic of the government move 
the idea of hounding three old men to court will either finish 
up in farce or tragedy for those conducting this vendetta he 
added 
the bill followed a dec 12 vote by the house of commons to 
accept a governmentordered inquiry that said there was sufficient 
evidence to prosecute three suspects living in britain 
the report urged the investigation of 124 more cases of suspects 
who came to britain with thousands of displaced persons after the 
end of the 193945 war 
scotland yard londons police headquarters said there is a 
likelihood of scotland yard investigation team being set up to 
deal exclusively with war crime cases 
two eminent lawyers who conducted the inquiry for the government 
said britain must change its law to allow prosecutions of british 
citizens for crimes committed abroad or risk becoming a safe 
haven for nazis 
britain is the last allied country to take action australia and 
canada passed legislation in the past few years and are holding 
their first trials while the us justice department investigates 
and deports suspects for trial in israel 
prime minister margaret thatcher supports prosecutions 
but the government will allow a free vote according to 
conscience and not along party lines on the bill the key 
legislative stage the second reading is scheduled for march 19 
the los angelesbased simon wiesenthal center which submitted 
initial lists of suspects to the british government in 1986 urged 
britain to set up a special nazihunting unit similar to the us 
office of special investigations it includes historians and 
archivists 
but what is important is that the british government and the 
british parliament have now finally entered the threshold where 
justice is about to be done in respect of nazi war criminals 
said rabbi marvin hier dean of the center 
hier estimated the first trial could begin about three months 
after the bill becomes law 
the names of the suspects were kept confidential in a separate 
section of the report by the british investigators issued in july 
but one suspect antanas gecas a lithuanianborn retired mining 
engineer who lives in scotland has been identified repeatedly by 
the british news media 
gecas 73 acknowledges serving in a notorious police battalion 
in nazioccupied lithuania but says he only watched the atrocities 
all the suspects in britain are from lithuania or two other 
soviet republics ukraine and latvia where locals manned mobile 
death squads set up by the nazis the squads rounded up and 
murdered tens of thousands of jews 
the trials would involve new rules of evidence in britain to 
allow videotaping of testimony by aging witnesses in the soviet 
union and depositions left by witnesses who have since died

israels housing minister called for building 
2000 new apartments in the occupied west bank this year to house 
jewish immigrants israel radio reported thursday 
the issue of settling immigrants on the disputed land has drawn 
strong criticism from the united states which argues that israels 
settlement policy is an obstacle to peace 
earlier thursday a jerusalem planning official disclosed the 
city government has plans to build a new jewish neighborhood in 
arab east jerusalem despite american opposition to such a move 
the request by housing minister david levy on the west bank 
settlements if approved by the government could jeopardize 400 
million in us loan guarantees israel requested to build housing 
for an influx of soviet jewish immigrants 
secretary of state james a baker iii told a congressional 
subcommittee last week the administration was willing to support 
such guarantees but only if it received assurances these funds 
will not be used to create new settlements or expand old 
settlements in the occupied territories 
almost 500 soviet immigrants have been arriving daily in israel 
the radio said levy long a proponent of the settlement 
movement wants 2000 of the 30000 new housing units planned this 
year for immigrants to be built in the west bank 
a finance ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said levys proposal is not the policy of the 
government levy could not be reached immediately for comment 
about 70000 jewish settlers live in enclaves in the west bank 
and gaza strip the government says that about 200 soviet 
immigrants moved to the territories last year 
ruth kaminker a member of jerusalems ninemember city planning 
board told the associated press that the new 225acre neighborhood 
was in its final stages of planning after a threemonth study 
of the site 
the development expected to include up to 3000 homes or 
apartments is planned for a steep slope of a strategic hill known 
as mount homa said mrs kaminker a member of the leftwing 
citizens rights movement 
she said the government requested development of the new 
neighborhood apparently in an attempt to strengthen jewish hold in 
the arab sector of the city which was annexed by israel after its 
capture from jordan in 1967 
city spokeswoman bonnie boxer denied any new neighborhood in 
east jerusalem was in the planning stages but she acknowledged the 
site was one of several under consideration in east jerusalem for 
constructing new jewish housing 
about 140000 palestinians live in arab east jerusalem in the 
past 23 years 120000 jews have moved into seven new communities 
around the arab area 
most countries including the united states have not recognized 
israeli sovereignty over the arab sector 
on march 3 president bush leveled unusual criticism at israeli 
building in disputed areas of jerusalem 
we do not believe there should be new settlements in the west 
bank or east jerusalem bush said in california 
two previously announced jewish neighborhoods are also going up 
in east jerusalem to house soviet immigrants and a rapidly 
expanding population of ultraorthodox jews 
but a city building plan for arab neighborhoods has been stalled 
for years by the israeli government and the initial plan for 
17000 units has been ordered cut to about 7500 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
the territories 17 million palestinian residents have waged a 
27month uprising against israeli occupation

a court challenge mounted by a suburban 
chicago savings institution could derail president bushs savings 
and loan bailout 
olympic federal savings and loan association berwyn ill 
contends in us district court that the director of the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision is holding his position 
unconstitutionally 
sampl legislation adopted last august allowed m danny wall 
chairman of the nowdefunct federal home loan bank board to serve 
as thrift office director without being appointed by the president 
or confirmed by the senate 
wall resigned in december and was replaced temporarily this week 
by assistant treasury secretary salvatore r martoche who has been 
confirmed for his assistant secretary post but not as thrift office 
director 
olympic which is trying to deflect potential seizure by the 
government contends in court papers that both wall and martoche 
lack the legal authority to turn a thrift over to the resolution 
trust corp a new agency created to sell or close failed 
institutions 
us district judge royce c lamberth late wednesday blocked the 
thrift office from seizing olympic for 10 days unless the agency 
provides the court and the sampl with six hours notice he scheduled 
a hearing for tuesday 
the case has wide ramifications over the past year the 
government has seized more than 380 sampls in nearly 40 states and 
has closed or sold 50 of those 
more than 120 of the takeovers have occurred since the 
conversion of the bank board into the thrift office the government 
is expected to seize as many as 200 additional institutions 
olympic with 11 billion had exhausted its tangible capital 
and was deep in the hole at the end of september according to 
sheshunoff information services an austin texas consulting firm 
an official of the biggest trade group representing sampls urged 
the bush administration to swiftly render olympics legal challenge 
pointless by nominating a new thrift office director 
this underscores the fact that the president and the 
administration have to move with great haste here to appoint a 
permanent director and get the ots moving again said james h 
grohl senior vice president of the us league of savings 
institutions 
an administration source said the white house has received a 
recommendation from treasury secretary nicholas f brady for a 
permanent successor to wall the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity would not reveal the individuals name

the united states acting at the request of 
the late soviet dissident andrei sakharov will participate in a 
soviet project using a large orbiting radio telescope to peer into 
the core of quasars and other active galaxies it was announced 
thursday 
this is a small but significant step in the evolving 
cooperation in space activities between our two nations said 
vice president dan quayle announcing the us role at a ceremony 
with soviet ambassador yuri dubinin 
shortly before his death last year sakharov had written to 
nasas administrator richard truly asking the united states to 
take part in the program known as radioastron 
the project calls for the soviets to launch a 10meter radio 
telescope into earth orbit in 1993 it will work synchronously with 
us groundbased telescopes to produce unprecedented resolution 
for peering deep into space the vice presidents office said 
the united states will provide precision tracking facilities for 
very high accuracy measurements of the soviet satellite orbit in 
addition the united states will lend the soviets data recorders 
now being developed by the national radio astronomy observatory 
space is an area where in the past we have had competition 
with the soviet union quayle said and with the reduction of 
tensions perhaps this will be a place where we can have not 
competition but cooperation 
dubinin called the us participation a good start toward an 
era of cooperation

the dangerous trend of low birthweight babies is 
on the rise especially among black infants after a 10year 
decline federal health officials reported thursday 
the national centers for disease control said the rate of babies 
born at less than 5 pounds rose 2 percent from 1985 to 1987 the 
latest year for which statistics are available during 1975 to 
1985 the rate declined by 9 percent 
sixtynine of 1000 babies born in 1987 were under 5 pounds 
compared with 675 of 1000 in 1985 the 1987 figures still 
represent an improvement over the 739 per 1000 reported in 1975 
and the rate of babies at very low birth weight is rising 
even faster up 68 percent from 197587 the report said in 1987 
124 per 1000 was below 3 pounds 4 ounces compared with 116 in 
1975 
this rate is a small proportion of births but its 
increasing which makes it more difficult in the future to improve 
our infant mortality rate said dr carol hogue director of the 
cdcs division of reproductive health 
very low birth weight babies below 3 pounds 4 ounces are 
90 to 100 times more likely to die in their first year than other 
babies she said infants under 5 pounds low birth weight 
babies face at least a five times greater risk of death than 
babies of normal weight about 6 to 9 pounds 
the problem is worse for black infants 
black babies who already have been at greatly increased risk 
of low birth weight and infant mortality are experiencing a 
greater increase in this risk than white babies hogue said 
the rate of low birth weight among black infants is more than 
twice the rate for white infants 1271 per 1000 blacks in 1987 
versus 568 for whites and the disparity has widened since 15 
years ago when the rates were 1309 for blacks to 626 for whites 
low birth weight rose less than 1 percent for whites between 
1985 and 1987 but 2 percent for blacks 
the data the cdc said underscore the substantial and 
persistent difference between black and white infants in the risk 
for low birth weight 
the reasons for the blackwhite gap are complex the 
atlantabased agency said in its weekly report chief among them 
more black women are in highrisk groups for underweight babies 
poor unmarried under age 20 undereducated or lacking proper 
prenatal care 
other factors include poorer nutritional status closetogether 
pregnancies and higher rates of unwanted births the cdc said 
adding that infants born less than two years after a sibling run a 
higher risk of low birth weight more than 16 percent of 
underweight black babies were unwanted or mistimed pregnancies the 
cdc said 
the prevention of unintended pregnancies could substantially 
reduce the difference in rates of low birth weight between blacks 
and whites the agency said 
hogue said improvements in the nations infant mortality rate 
during the past two decades are largely because of improved means 
of keeping premature babies alive not because of improved infant 
health 
were not sure we can continue to improve infant mortality by 
improving this very expensive technology she said we really 
need to focus on reducing the incidence of low birth weight 
about 35 million babies are born in the united states each 
year most low birthweight babies are premature babies nearly six 
in 10 are born earlier than 37 weeks of pregnancy compared with 
the standard 40 weeks as such low birthweight babies run a much 
greater risk of serious illness including respiratory problems or 
death

a private advocacy group called thursday for 
46 billion in new federal spending on child health and education 
programs to back up the mostly empty rhetoric of president bush 
and the nations governors 
marian wright edelman president of the childrens defense fund 
applauded recent actions by the national governors association and 
bush to endorse national education goals 
but she said her groups proposal would be a significant step 
toward translating the mostly empty rhetoric about preparing 
children for school into real dollars and placing children at the 
top rather than in the margins of the nations agenda 
she commented at a news conference as her group released its 
annual report on the status of children in america 
the group proposed increases for fiscal 1991 in federal spending 
on child care the head start program health and nutrition 
services and child protection programs 
meeting the governors goals for national education achievement 
will require far more than lofty rhetoric and token 
investments she said 
among the recommendations of the group 
enactment of a comprehensive national childcare bill costing 
at least 175 billion plus additional state appropriations 
expanding the head start program which provides educational 
nutritional and health services to needy preschool children it 
called for 14 billion in additional spending on the program plus 
state supplements 
a 1 billion expansion in programs to protect vulnerable 
children and families against abuse and neglect 
additional spending in health nutrition immunization and 
related programs including expansion of medicaid health care to 
cover all pregnant women and children with incomes below 185 
percent of the poverty level 
she said bushs campaign pledge to become the education 
president was at odds with his proposal for a modest 500 million 
increase in federal education spending she said the increase would 
not allow federal education spending to keep pace with inflation

thousands of moslems confined to mosques 
and homes by a curfew vowed thursday to die for kashmirs 
independence shouting their slogans at top indian politicians who 
arrived to assess the situation 
before the curfew was imposed at 10 am moslem militants and 
security forces fought prolonged gunbattles and at least two 
people were killed and 10 injured witnesses said 
islamic and proindependence slogans broadcast continuously by 
mosque loudspeakers reverberated through this city of 1 million 
people as the politicians drove from the airport to their hotel 
the 14 leaders belonging to major political parties traveled 
the 9mile route in a convoy of 40 cars escorted by paramilitary 
troops in trucks mounted with machine guns 
the slogan of the faith allah is great thousands shouted 
from within the mosques as the convoy drove past at noon 
we want independence they also chanted 
the politicians including former prime minister rajiv gandhi 
and deputy prime minister devi lal were refused permission to 
leave their heavily guarded hotel 
security forces strictly enforced the curfew but the broadcasts 
continued many speeches urged moslems to sacrifice their lives for 
kashmirs independence 
at least 173 people have been killed since jan 20 when the 
government launched a crackdown on moslem militants who demand 
secession of the predominantly moslem jammukashmir state from 
mostly hindu india 
i am shocked if there is no political solution i see some 
very hard options ahead gandhi said at the luxury centaur hotel 
on the edge of dal lake i do not want to define them 
disenchantment with the government was incredible he said 
while at least 1000 commandos and paramilitary police patrolled 
the lake and gardens surrounding the hotel 
gandhi said state gov jagmohan refused to permit the delegation 
to visit residents of srinagar jammukashmirs largest city and 
the center of the secessionist campaign 
jagmohan took charge as the states governor jan 18 and ordered 
the crackdown 
he said allowing gandhi and the other leaders to go out would 
have created a tremendous security risk 
jagmohan later allowed a delegation of about 40 residents to 
meet gandhi at his hotel a police official said 
the meeting became unruly however and gandhi was forced to 
leave as the group shouted slogans blaming his 198489 government 
for the strife in kashmir 
jagmohan said the curfew will be relaxed friday after the 
politicians leave srinagar 
when the curfew was lifted from 5 am to 10 am exchanges of 
gunfire began witnesses said 
jagmohan a hindu said moslem snipers fired at paramilitary 
police at four places during the curfew relaxation but said he had 
no details of casualties 
witnesses said they heard firing from at least a halfdozen 
areas in downtown srinagar 
militants were firing from rooftops and pinning down 
paramilitary troops in roadside bunkers and the soldiers returned 
fire sporadically according to the witnesses who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
it was like a battlefield one said by telephone i have 
never heard firing like this before 
at least two people were killed and 10 injured according to 
information gathered from witnesses in several parts of the city 
federal law minister dinesh goswami a member of the political 
delegation said the kashmir situation today is very serious 
this problem must be dealt with at a national level 
asked if the government was planning talks with the militants 
he said you can have talks in an atmosphere of peace 
the militants have in the past rejected negotiations with the 
government saying they wont compromise 
the campaign for an independent kashmir simmering since 1948 
has flared up in recent months with the consolidation of militant 
groups 
india has accused pakistan of fomenting the trouble a charge 
that pakistan repeatedly denies 
the two countries have gone to war three times since their 
independence from britain in 1947 twice over kashmir a 
unsponsored ceasefire line separates kashmir into indian and 
pakistani areas 
about 64 percent of jammukashmirs 6 million people are moslem 
nationwide moslems comprise 12 percent of the 880 million 
population and hindus account for 82 percent

a ninenation conference on north 
sea pollution ended thursday with agreement on lowering dangerous 
emissions but left some countries angry with britains stand on 
sewage dumping and undersea nuclear waste storage 
the coastal states pledged to reduce emissions of mercury lead 
cadmium and dioxins by 70 percent in 1995 and to phase out by 
decades end pcbs or polychlorinated biphenyls believed to be 
among the most hazardous materials made by man 
in a grudging concession to britain the dumping of sewage 
sludge will be allowed until 1998 while british industry will be 
allowed to dump until 1993 an annual 205000 to 270000 tons of 
industrial waste into the north sea one of the worlds most 
contaminated saltwater bodies 
we were very disappointed that the united kingdom could not 
follow us on this point said hanja maijweggen the dutch 
transport minister and conference chairman we hope the british 
will be more flexible the next time 
british environment secretary chris patten also refused to rule 
out britains storing nuclear waste under the seabed 
danish environment minister lone dybkjaer said the conference 
ended in a furious row on this issue and he accused britain of 
betraying the lives of future generations 
the twoday conference was the third in a series that began in 
1984 in the west german port of bremen a followup meeting was 
held in london in 1987 
participants were the netherlands belgium france britain 
west germany switzerland denmark norway and sweden as well as 
the european commission the eecs executive body ten other 
nations among them east germany and czechoslovakia had observer 
status 
it was a very very tough conference and the results dont go 
far enough for us particularly in the field of sewage treatment 
said west german environment minister klaus toepfer 
but we signed the final document because it will bring us a 
step further in the international field toepfer told reporters 
here 
on wednesday britain underwent a barrage of criticism because 
of its failure to meet the 1990 deadline for halting sea dumpings 
of industrial waste as had been agreed on in london in 1987 
the british contend they need time to convert their industrial 
plant to landbased waste treatment they also claim that most of 
the waste is not hazardous to the marine environment anyway 
during extremely tough negotiations thursday patten refused to 
budge on the issue conference sources said 
on the question of nitrates and phosphates the cause of massive 
blooms of algae along the north seas coast the conference decided 
to stick to its 1987 pledge to cut in half emissions of those 
substances by 1995

top finance officials from the worlds seven 
largest industrial countries will meet in paris early next month to 
discuss turbulence in global currency markets and dramatic 
developments in eastern europe officials confirmed thursday 
the special talks involving the united states japan west 
germany britain france italy and canada were seen as an effort 
to strengthen economic coordination between the major industrial 
countries at a time of dramatic change in world affairs 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who was instrumental in 
scheduling the meeting insisted that there was no special 
urgency for the gathering of finance ministers and central bank 
presidents of the seven countries the talks are scheduled for 
april 7 
however the discussions will occur just one month before these 
same officials were scheduled to meet for a regular economic review 
session in conjunction with the spring meeting of the international 
monetary fund in washington 
currency markets have been especially volatile in recent weeks 
with the west german mark and the japanese yen falling in price 
while the us dollar has strengthened in value 
private economists predicted that the dollars strength and the 
corresponding weakness of the yen and the mark would be a key topic 
of discussion at the meeting 
analysts said that the rising dollar threatened to worsen an 
already huge american trade deficit by making foreign products less 
expensive for us consumers while making american goods more 
expensive on overseas markets 
the dollars strength is of great concern to the 
administration said allen sinai chief economist of the boston 
co it constitutes a recession threat because it is a further 
risk to an already beleaguered industrial side of the us 
economy 
the dollars advance has occurred despite coordinated 
intervention by the united states and other governments to sell 
dollars on foreign exchange markets and buy other currencies 
some analysts suggested that since government intervention has 
proved largely unsuccessful the g7 officials might discuss 
coordinated changes in interest rates 
higher interest rates in japan and west germany would tend to 
bolster their currencies while lower interest rates in the united 
states would make dollardenominated investments less attractive

the blue moon tavern doesnt qualify as a 
cultural landmark and hundreds of longtime patrons are left 
crying in their beer 
the 56yearold taverns lease runs out in four years and after 
that landowner westlake capital corp plans to tear it down and 
build a sixstory housing and shopping development spokesman 
robert hannah told the seattle landmarks preservation board on 
wednesday night 
when the eight members of the 11person board present were 
evenly divided on whether to grant landmark status dozens of 
tavern supporters sporting blue moon stickers let out a collective 
groan the proposal needed six votes to pass 
the forever blue moon committee pushed for landmark status as 
the only way to save the establishment from the wrecking ball 
what the landmarks board has effectively done is say it will 
not designate any cultural landmarks in seattle said walt 
crowley a television commentator and former mayoral aide who 
helped organize the 1500member committee 
if the blue moon does not qualify i cannot imagine what 
could crowley said 
one patron john foss said the blue moon is the one spot in 
town where all these groups of people can come in and speak 
together 
i went in and sat down at a table last sunday night he 
said there were five of us and none of us knew each other we 
ended up speaking on everything from rap music to skiing and urban 
aesthetics 
board member don brubeck argued that seattle has many historic 
taverns and though the blue moon reportedly has quenched the 
thirst of such luminaries as jack kerouac dylan thomas and 
pulitzerprize winner theodore roethke it doesnt qualify as a 
landmark 
there are some really nice taverns in this city brubeck 
said theyve been there a long time and they have a lot of 
physical integrity if we designate this one why not all the 
others 
the tavern was among the first in seattle to open after 
prohibition just outside the onemile limit around the university 
of washington where sales of alcoholic beverages were banned 
its worn wooden booths bear years of carvings and graffiti its 
walls are plastered with postcards handbills road maps and 
business cards one wall features the original tavern sign with 
its 1930s vintage bathing beauty perched atop a blue crescent moon 
a replica of the sign hangs outside today and supporters say 
that alone makes it recognizable as the bar where david wagoner 
wrote poetry in a back booth and jack leahy wrote outlines for his 
short stories 
board member horace foxall likened the blue moon to a sort of 
university with taps a place where for decades seattle residents 
have met and exchanged ideas seattle he said is running out of 
the old taverns that marked it as a port town 
this is about seattle history he told other board members 
this is it this is what were preserving

a congressman criticized the state department 
thursday for not counting guatemala an opium producer among the 
countries that must be investigated before receiving american aid 
why wasnt it on the list rep larry smith dfla 
chairman of a house foreign affairs task force on narcotics asked 
melvyn levitsky the assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics 
your figures indicate they produced 14 tons of opium smith 
said 
guatemala was not on the certification list in its international 
narcotics control strategy report presented to congress last week 
the law requires that the president certify that major drug 
producing and drug transit countries have cooperated fully with 
the united states in antidrug efforts before they can receive us 
aid 
nations that produce more than 5 metric tons of opium must be 
included on the list as major producers 
but levitsky said information about guatemalas opium production 
was received after the report was prepared in late 1989 
there is always an excuse smith retorted 
us officials say guatemala is taking steps to fight its drug 
production problem 
the government of guatemala recognizes the countrys potential 
as a significant source of opium and took steps in 1989 to reduce 
opium production through an aerial eradication program supported by 
the us the strategy report said 
guatemala is also a leading transit country in central america 
for cocaine sent from colombia to the united states according to 
david l westrate assistant administrator for operations at the 
drug enforcement administration 
the united states withdrew its ambassador from guatemala this 
week because officials said president vinicio cerezo had failed to 
contain an upsurge of assassinations believed to be the work of 
rightwing extremists 
in another development smith joined administration officials in 
criticizing cuba for refusing to cooperate with the united states 
on drug interdiction efforts 
recounting the story of a plane suspected of carrying drugs that 
was lost by us radar over cuba smith said so much for cuban 
president fidel castros representations about wanting to help 
the departments report said cuba has failed to respond 
to several us requests about the seriousness of cubas commitment 
to fighting drug trafficking

the bush administration is continuing 
emergency food shipments to sudan even while phasing out some other 
programs in the militaryrun african country 
it was not clear if military aid would be suspended 
a congressional provision forced the phasing out of economic 
assistance sudan had eight months under the law to reverse a 
military takeover but the deadline passed feb 28 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said thursday 
that military sales also were prohibited but that food aid and 
voluntary programs were continued 
congressional sources said meanwhile that the administration 
has provided sudan with 25 million a year in military help through 
other programs 
military officers overthrew prime minister sadek elmahdis 
civilian regime june 30 saying multiparty democracy had failed to 
end a long civil war or save the countrys shattered economy 
over the last two years the united states was to provide sudan 
with 236 million in food and transportation costs to get the food 
to the hungry but much of it has not reached its destination 
because of sabotage and diversion 
thousands of sudanese have starved as food is caught up in the 
war between the khartoum government and leftist rebels in the south 
in the meantime sudan has not repaid lowinterest loans from 
the united states this led to suspension under another 
congressional provision of 214 million in economic assistance 
this year 
apart from emergency food shipments a few projects will be 
continued including one to assist in building roads 
a congressional source demanding anonymity said the bush 
administration was determined to keep military help going to sudan 
theyve been doing an end run around congress he said 
in power eight months sudans national salvation revolution has 
done little to revive a collapsing economy or end a debilitating 
civil war that has killed hundreds of thousands and threatens more 
with starvation 
the war pits the military government against the sudan peoples 
liberation army which launched a rebellion in 1983 
the largest country in africa sudan once was considered a 
potential bread basket for the region

richard nixon whose political career began in 
congress came back to capitol hill on thursday to dispense 
geopolitical wisdom to a large audience of republican legislators 
who wanted his views 
to a rapt audience some of whom had not been born when nixon 
began his first term as a representative from california in 1947 
the former president roamed the political globe for more than an 
hour republican whip newt gingrich called the feat an 
extraordinary tour de force 
nixon was clearly elated by the response 
its good to be back here where my political career started 43 
years ago he said 
why are you here asked a reporter 
because they invited me 
that in itself is something that might not have happened only 
a few years ago for a decade after his 1974 resignation prompted 
by an imminent impeachment vote in the house nixon was anathema 
to republicans his name was not mentioned at gop political 
gatherings or at national conventions 
but he worked his way back through analytical books about world 
affairs magazine articles a few speeches to influential 
audiences offtherecord dinners with reporters trips to china 
and meeting with successor presidents who sought his views 
he was pale and a bit more jowly than in the past and his walk 
was that of a 77yearold man which he is 
but he was in good humor as he talked with reporters never his 
favorite audience saying as i look at this crowd i know im 
getting older but the press seems to be getting younger 
in the closed session with the lawmakers and invited guests 
nixon referred to soviet president mikhail gorbachev as a troika 
a communist a russian nationalist and a brilliant practical 
politician 
according to a house staff member who was there nixon said 
gorbachev decided he would risk his power to save his reforms 
rather than the other way around and that according to nixon 
meant that gorbachev would take credit for something he really 
didnt want or set out to do 
nixon called the developments in eastern europe a change of 
the head and not of the heart 
reporters asked what he thought of this weeks proposal by rep 
richard gephardt dmo the house majority leader that direct 
us aid be sent to help the soviet union succeed in its reform 
effort gephardt specifically called for food aid and freer 
investment in the soviet union 
my reaction to is that it is a bad idea first because 
gorbachev has not indicated his wants it nixon said no aid 
directly or indirectly should be provided for gorbachev unless his 
reforms have a chance to work 
further nixon said gorbachev must first adopt a less 
aggressive foreign policy particularly in the third world 
what has happened here is the cold war is probably over in 
eastern europe but is still being waged in the third world he 
said 
gorbachev he said should also stop sending aid to cuba 
if gorbachev continues to provide 6 billion a year to prop up 
castro castro is going to stay if gorbachev cuts off his water 
so to speak castro has to make his deal with the west 
the key is gorbachev said nixon 
at that point nixon was addressed as mr gorbachev by a 
tangletongued reporter 
ive been called worse said nixon

hundreds of government supporters staged a 
demonstration thursday in front of a house where witnesses said a 
meeting of dissidents was taking place 
the demonstration featured the chanting of antiamerican slogans 
and noisy expressions of support for hardline president fidel 
castro it took place outside the home of gustavo arcos a 
wellknown human rights activist who was said to be meeting with 
three allies 
a similar demonstraton occurred monday in front of the home of 
arcos brother sebastian arcos who also was said to have convened 
a meeting of dissidents 
witnesses said that after neighbors learned of the thursday 
meeting the progovernment activists arrived and staged their 
demonstration spontaneously 
it was a peaceful protest but several participants reacted 
angrily when an unidentified woman appeared on the balcony of the 
home and stuck her tongue out at them 
they are meeting at this house to make plans for the 
counterrevolution said one demonstrator 
castro has repeatedly said his country will never embrace the 
reforms orchestrated by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and 
increasingly accepted throughout eastern europe 
an article in a soviet newspaper tuesday reflects the growing 
divergence between the kremlin and cuba as gorbachev moves to 
reduce the power of the communist party in the soviet union 
in the article the weekly moscow news said castro has used 
intransigence and relied on outdated ideas to keep his country in 
check 
it noted that staterun cuban radio carried editorial attacks on 
the collapse of communist regimes in eastern europe and blamed the 
changes on weak governments unable to tackle economic turmoil 
such categorical judgments are pronounced in an island with 
total rationing which insures people against poverty but does not 
give them the impetus to work moscow news said 
it mocked the cuban leader for his dec 7 statement saying if 
history will attach to us the role of the last defenders of 
socialism in the world we will defend this stronghold to the last 
drop of blood 
the cuban model that castro wants to defend is based on a 
complete rejection of a market economy moral principles over 
material ones a militarized state and an untouchable partystate 
elite the newspaper said 
cuba copied none other but soviet administrative and economic 
structures at the time when european socialism was sinking into the 
swamp of stagnation based on the ideological dogma of the late 
leader leonid i brezhnev it said 
cuba gets about 5 billion in annual aid from the soviet union 
despite castros pledge to defend the party at all costs and 
ignore change in the socialist community moscow news said about 15 
dissident groups have emerged in cuba 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said thursday it 
is not surprising that a soviet newspaper should be critical of 
cuba 
cuba remains a rigid police state she said at a time 
where the soviet government is changing its domestic and foreign 
policies cuba is becoming ever more isolated and rigid 
obviously cuba is out of step and resisting the rising tide 
of change she said castro is isolated even among socialist 
countries

cuban president fidel castro has 
offered to leave 1000 cuban workers in nicaragua if the new 
ussupported administration agrees the sandinista party 
newspaper said thursday 
in a front page story from havana the newspaper barricada said 
castro offered to keep the volunteers on the atlantic coast where 
they are rebuilding homes damaged by a 1988 hurricane and helping 
with health care and other community services 
most of them are in the port of bluefields where castro said 
they can remain if that is the wish of the new government and if 
it guarantees the security of cuban personnel 
officials of yatama the dominant atlantic coast political 
organization which supported presidentelect violeta barrios de 
chamorro said the cubans were welcome to stay 
the newspaper said cuba had been giving nicaragua 90000 tons of 
crude oil and 50000 rations of food a year it said the food was 
mostly for miskito sumo and rama indian communities on the 
atlantic coast 
on wednesday castro announced he will stop sending military 
aid petroleum or food after mrs chamorro takes office 
our military cooperation will be withdrawn when the new 
government takes office it would not be possible to maintain our 
presence with a government which has shown its dislike for the 
cuban revolution castro said in a speech to a womens 
organization in havana 
excerpts of the speech were quoted in a dispatch by the cuban 
government news agency prensa latina monitored in mexico city 
exact figures on cuban military aid have never been released by 
havana or managua however the us state department said last 
year that moscow provided about 500 million in military aid to 
nicaragua in 1988 
since mrs chamorros election cuban ambassador fernando ravelo 
has returned to havana for consultations and a secretary at the 
embassy who answered the telephone said she had no information on 
his return 
last fall the soviet union said it had suspended further 
weapons shipments to nicaragua under president mikhail gorbachevs 
liberalization policies 
also thursday representatives of the sandinistas and mrs 
chamorros united national opposition met privately to make 
nicaraguas first transition to an elected opposition government a 
peaceful one 
details of the talks were not made public immediately but 
officials on both sides said they centered on demands for the 
immediate demobilization of the ussupported contra rebels and 
mrs chamorros plan to sharply cut the armed forces which are 
controlled by the sandinista party 
both mrs chamorro and outgoing president daniel ortega have 
called on the contras based in neighboring honduras to demobilize 
immediately 
but rebel leaders say they will only do so after mrs chamorro 
is sworn into office april 25 for a sixyear term and after their 
safety is guaranteed when they return 
another issue reportedly being discussed is unos plan to return 
private property expropriated by the sandinistas during their 
decade in office as part of a policy of lifting state controls 
over the economy and encouraging private enterprise 
the sandinistas are balking at returning banks to private 
ownership 
uno leaders meanwhile are complaining the sandinistas are 
trying to ram through the national assembly which they will still 
control for more than a month bills legalizing titles to 
properties the government confiscated and distributed among 
sandinista supporters 
in washington the state department condemned what it said were 
recent actions taken by the sandinista government including 
distributing weapons to their followers as disturbing signs that 
the sandinistas are not keeping faith with their promises to honor 
a peaceful transfer of power 
margaret tutwiler the departments spokeswoman also cited the 
emptying of government offices and threats to enact economic 
measures such measures would make it exceedingly difficult to 
bring about the economic recovery of that country she said 
meanwhile mrs chamorro left thursday for caracas to visit 
venezuelan president carlos andres perez before going to houston 
for additional treatment for a knee that she fractured on dec 31 
it was her second trip abroad as presidentelect wednesday she 
visited briefly with another old friend president oscar arias of 
costa rica

two leading republicans in congress predicted 
on thursday that their party will change the strict antiabortion 
stance that has been part of its platform since 1980 
sen alan k simpson of wyoming the secondranking republican 
in the senate predicted the 1992 gop platform committee will 
come up with something in an effort to soften the plank 
it will speak to the sanctity of life and it will do things 
and it will be probably altered im sure of that said simpson 
who has long held the position that a woman should have the right 
to have an abortion 
i dont know whether it will be an exact excising or changing 
of it or what he said 
rep newt gingrich rga the house minority whip and simpson 
disputed the widespread perception that republican candidates 
opposed to abortion have been hurt since a supreme court ruling 
last summer the court gave states more authority to restrict 
abortions and thus intensified political debate on the 
emotionfilled issue 
but gingrich who opposes abortion rights said the new gop 
platform will cater to voters conflicting feeling about abortion 
by supporting restrictions if not a total ban 
the republican party i will venture to predict will draw 
the line in such a way that we are clearly the party which will 
have fewer abortions in america than the democrats he said 
we will be for restrictions that now and naral will not favor 
such as making sure that 12yearolds have their parents consent 
before they go to an abortion clinic he said 
the national organization for women and the national abortion 
rights action league oppose government blocking a womans right to 
choose abortion they also oppose efforts in some states to require 
one or both parents consent or notification before a minor woman 
can receive an abortion 
we will in fact be responsive to changing circumstances 
gingrich said citing polls that gauge which abortion restrictions 
are favored by the public 
president bush has stuck by the antiabortion position that he 
embraced as a vice presidential candidate in 1980 but republican 
party officials including national chairman lee atwater have 
sought to defuse the divisive issue by saying the party has no 
litmus test and remains open to candidates and voters on both sides 
of the abortion debate

marcia hoebreckx can practice piano in her 
condominium but only if she keeps her foot firmly on the soft 
pedal a judge ruled 
a neighbor complained that hoebreckxs rendition of chopin 
violated a 1981 city ordinance that prohibits boulder residents 
from disrupting the quiet enjoyment of a home 
municipal judge richard hansen reluctantly upheld the complaint 
wednesday and fined the pianist 30 if she wants to continue her 
hobby she must perform pianissimo he said 
the judge acknowledged the ordinance was a poor law and 
encouraged hoebreckx to either appeal or orchestrate a campaign to 
repeal the ordinance 
i really feel being allowed to play the piano in the privacy 
of my home is an inalienable right hoebreckx said my peace of 
mind my whole living standard has been violated 
hoebreckx coordinator of a writing program at the university of 
colorado said she never plays before 10 am or after 10 pm 
her nextdoor neighbors chris whelan and julia ermes 
complained to the environmental protection office when mediation 
failed a trial was arranged 
other neighbors testified they werent bothered by the music 
and decibel tests found the noise to be within acceptable limits 
but the judge said he had no choice in accepting the ordinance 
the city council he said wanted a silent town and they 
passed an ordinance designed to get that with little or no 
consideration given to the active people or things that might make 
noise 
hoebreckx says shes considering her options but they dont 
include quitting the piano its what i do and what i enjoy

the nations main intelligence agencies 
disagree on whether the waning soviet military threat could be 
revived a pentagon official suggested thursday 
pete williams a spokesman for defense secretary dick cheney 
ackowledged that cheney differs on the issue with cia director 
william webster who told congress last week it is unlikely the 
soviets would pose a major military threat in the future even if 
president mikhail s gorbachev were replaced by hardliners 
cheney contends that moscows move toward a less aggressive 
military stance could be reversed if gorbachev lost power cheney 
argues that this possibility alone is reason not to rapidly reduce 
us troop levels and military spending 
at a pentagon briefing williams denied a published report that 
cheneys view also is at odds with the defense intelligence agency 
the pentagons intelligence arm 
there is no evidence that the secretary and the dia are out of 
step on the question of whether the soviet reforms are 
reversible williams said adding later that it would be a fair 
characterization to say cheney and the dia agree on the issue 
williams remarks suggested that the dia and the cia dont agree 
on the issue although the spokesman declined to comment directly 
on the agencies exact views 
we dont discuss intelligence so im somewhat limited in the 
answer that i can give he said 
the disagreement has important political implications because 
bush administration estimates of soviet military capabilities play 
an important role in the congressional debate under way on next 
years defense budget 
williams said the split between webster and cheney was not 
personal and the two planned to hold a breakfast meeting at cia 
headquarters thursday to discuss world events 
williams also sought to play down cheneys remark in a weekend 
television interview that websters testimony delivered on the 
same day cheney was giving another congressional committee a 
different view of the soviet threat was not helpful to the 
administrations efforts to win approval of the defense budget 
secretary cheney does not view anyones job as defending the 
defense budget in their testimony in congress williams said he 
added later that cheney has no intention to stifle different 
views within the intelligence community

a doctor who was suing the city claiming she had 
contracted aids though the carelessness of another physician 
accepted a settlement thursday as attorneys were preparing to 
present their trial summations 
the judge would say only that the amount was between zero and 
100 million 
jurors interviewed after the settlement indicated they had been 
leaning in favor of the plaintiff dr veronica prego 
prego pale and looking tired as she sat between her two 
attorneys sighed in relief as the judge dismissed the jurors she 
said a short time later she was happy the trial had finally ended 
its been extremely difficult for me she said complaining 
that her health had worsened because of the strain of the more than 
2monthlong trial now its time to take care of myself 
the trial judge justice aaron d bernstein of brooklyns state 
supreme court ordered the lawyers on both sides not to disclose 
the amount of the settlement 
its no ones business except the people who are paying it 
and the person whos receiving it bernstein said it has 
nothing to do with the relative merits of this case 
under the agreement sealed by bernstein none of the parties 
named in pregos lawsuit acknowledged any guilt 
prego maintained in her lawsuit which named the city health and 
hospitals corp and two physicians that she contracted the deadly 
disease when a doctor who drew blood from an aids patient in 1983 
left the contaminated needle and other debris on the patients 
bedding prego said she accidentally pricked her finger while 
cleaning up the waste 
diane wilner a lawyer for prego said the settlement was 
reluctantly accepted because defense lawyers said they would appeal 
any jury victory by prego 
dr prego must live the rest of her life with some peace and 
must be able to put this behind her wilner said in essence i 
believe they put a gun to our head with the appeal 
an appeal would tie the matter up in the courts for two to three 
years pregos doctor had testified the 32yearold woman might 
have less than a year to live

a childrens advocacy group asked on thursday 
that regulators require broadcasters and cable tv operators show 
antismoking messages on youthoriented programs if they televise 
sports events sponsored by cigarette companies 
action for childrens television which was instrumental in 
reviving advertising limits for saturday morning childrens tv 
shows asked the federal communications commission to close a 
loophole in a 1969 law that banned cigarette advertising from 
television 
the group said cigarette companies got around the ban after it 
went into effect in 1971 ban by sponsoring televised sports events 
such as tennis tournaments and car races making their brands part 
of the names of the events 
act said tv cameras also routinely show billboards advertising 
cigarettes behind the sports action being shown act called them 
hidden commercials that subverts the purpose of the 1969 law 
congress passed the law because it had concluded that it is 
not in the public interest to have cigarettes advertised over such 
unique media that reach into every household and are particularly 
viewed by the young act told the fcc 
the young are being bombarded over television by hidden 
messages associated with sports that are meant to show that 
smoking is attractive act president peggy charren said in an 
interview 
act said it was no accident that cigarette companies created the 
virginia slims tour in 1971 winston cup racing in 1971 and 
marlboro cup racing in 1973 the sponsors often place billboards in 
positions where cameras are sure to pick them up the group said 
the filing quoted from an opinion piece by syndicated columnist 
george will in the feb 25 washington post that said nbctvs 
93minute telecast of the 1989 marlboro grand prix contained 4997 
images of marlboro billboards and 249 of the marlborosponsored car 
the brand name was visible 46 of the 93 minutes 49 percent 
of the telecast act told the fcc 
act called on the fcc to require broadcast and cable networks 
that show such events carry offsetting antismoking messages 
during the advertising breaks in programs that have large youth 
audiences 
officials at the new yorkbased philip morris co which makes 
virginia slims and marlboro cigarettes and at winstonsalem 
ncbased rj reynolds which makes winston had no immediate 
comment on the filing nor did washington representatives of the 
broadcasting and cable tv industries 
charren said she believes the time is ripe to petition the 
government on this issue in the wake of recent attacks on cigarette 
advertising by health and human services secretary louis sullivan 
and reports that tobacco companies were aiming new brands at blue 
collar white females and urban blacks 
congress also recently imposed a virtual ban on smoking on us 
airliners and rep thomas a luken dohio has introduced 
legislation to outlaw tobacco advertising and promotion that could 
reach anyone under age 18 it would also bar sponsorship of events 
that use a cigarette brand name 
lukens bill would permit textonly ads in newspapers magazines 
and other publications plus signs and billboards outside but not 
in sports facilities 
when the 1969 law went into effect the fcc dropped provisions of 
its socalled fairness doctrine that required antismoking messages 
on television

young children left to themselves watch more 
educational television than when their parents watch with them 
says a new study that looked at scores of workingclass households 
in california 
these findings suggest that children prefer pbs public 
broadcasting service over commercial networks but when children 
and parents view tv together they watch the commercial channels 
that the parents prefer the study said 
it supported previous findings that preschool children watch 
about 25 hours of television a week watch fewer hours after they 
start school and are usually unsupervised by parents in their 
programming choices authors said 
the important thing to me is that the attitude that parents 
set up in relation to television in the home seems to have an 
impact on what children will watch and how much they watch said 
dr howard l taras lead author and assistant pediatrics professor 
at the university of california at san diego 
children of parents who regard television more as a babysitter 
or distraction will watch more tv he said in a telephone 
interview wednesday 
also children of parents who regard television more as an 
educational tool will watch more pbs he said 
the study found children viewed more pbs programming in 
households where television was not routinely being used as 
entertainment parents were not viewing tv with the youngsters more 
than 50 percent of the time and children had a strong influence on 
program selection 
the study was based on interviews with workingclass englishand 
spanishspeaking parents from households that totaled 66 children 
ages 3 to 8 in a suburban san diego community findings were 
published in the march issue of the american medical associations 
american journal of diseases of children 
i hope beyond hope that theyre right but i cant quite 
believe it said peggy charron president of action for 
childrens television a child advocacy group based in cambridge 
mass 
and yet she said the findings make sense because preschoolers 
like public broadcasting they relate to mr rogers because 
hes talking to them and they really get to know him and as much 
as possible through the medium of television get to love him 
she said in a telephone interview wednesday 
hes like a substitute parent and they love sesame street 
i cant imagine what they get out of commercial broadcasting 
its so noisy and fast and peculiar and violent 
gary selnow a visiting professor of communications studies at 
virginia tech in blacksburg va agreed with the speculation of 
the studys authors if the parents are watching with the kids 
there may be sort of subtle pressure for parents to encourage the 
kids to watch something that would also be of interest to the 
parents 
but he refused to jump on network television 
commercial programs promote many of societys most laudable 
values people who help each other are the ones who succeed 
problems are resolved by hard work he said in a telephone 
interview 
the study did not single out particular programs from commercial 
or public television 
taras said the group plans to follow up on its findings with 
more detailed research

a new york legislator and a florida couple 
whose sixweekold son was found dead on an infant pillow urged the 
consumer product safety commission on thursday to immediately 
recall the cushions 
republican sen alfonse damato criticized the commission for 
an entirely too casual attitude about taking legal action 
against the pillow manufacturers 
the commission on tuesday warned consumers not to allow infants 
to sleep on the small pillows or cushions which are filled with 
plastic foam beads because of the potential danger of suffocation 
ten infants have died while sleeping on the pillows since 1987 
the agency said it has not taken action against the manufacturers 
or distributors because an investigation is ongoing officials said 
gigi lindstrom whose son died on one of the pillows last year 
urged parents not to use the pillows retailers to take them off 
store shelves manufacturers to recall them and lawmakers to take 
action to remove the killer pillows from the marketplace 
damato who earlier this week praised the agencys warning to 
consumers on thursday complained it had tried to dissuade 
increased publicity which might disrupt delicate industry 
negotiations the agency is conducting 
an agency spokesman said officials had not tried to prevent the 
publicity but said there was concern about releasing names of 
companies which could jeopardize our activities down the road

for want of a dime the internal revenue 
service hit mary frances stinson with a bill for 5494 
the dorchester mass woman underpaid by 10 cents when she 
filed her federal tax return in 1987 the irs computers eventually 
caught the mistake and last october sent a form letter telling her 
she had been hit with a 24 latepayment penalty and interest of 
3084 
it was almost like a joke ms stinson said thursday if i 
have to ill pay them which really stinks she acknowledged 
however that she has yet to write the irs to clear up the mistake 
as spelled out on the form ms stinson received the penalty is 
limited by law to 25 percent of the late tax in this case that 
would be 2 cents the interest on the late payment averages about 
10 percent which would be about a penny a year for ms stinson 
i wouldnt think we would even send a notice on 10 cents 
due said irs spokesman wilson fadely noting that a stamp costs 
25 cents any time an erroneous bill is send he said you should 
just write and tell us 
ms stinson said she had telephoned her local irs office and was 
told to write the irs regional service center in andover mass 
which sent the form letter 
so its just a matter of writing up the actual letter and 
informing them of this she told a reporter but it was a 
little unreal to me that id even get that type of thing in the 
first place 
instead of writing the irs ms stinson handed her bill to the 
national coalition of irs whistleblowers which was established by 
the church of scientology 
the coalition called the form letter an outrage and turned it 
over to a reporter

democrats pushed their version of a campaign 
finance bill with fixed limits on how much candidates can spend 
through a senate committee thursday as prospects for a compromise 
brightened 
the rules committee approved the democrats ideas for reform on 
a 73 partyline vote but lawmakers acknowledged the action was 
intended only to get serious negotiations started between the two 
parties 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said he intends to 
bring the issue before the full senate as soon as it completes 
action on a clean air bill and crime legislation possibly late 
this month or early april 
the senate now knows that the issue is not going away said 
okalahoma sen david boren the primary author of the democratic 
bill there has to be a time deadline out there for the 
negotiations to begin 
boren and his key ideological opponent on the issue sen mitch 
mcconnell rky both said their hopes for a compromise were 
buoyed by an outside panels endorsement wednesday of limits on how 
much candidates can raise from political action committees and 
outofstate donors 
the sixmember task force appointed by mitchell and senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas called for flexible 
spending ceilings with a provivion that would exclude small 
contributions possibly 250 or less from instate donors from 
the total 
boren hailed it as the first bipartisan recognition of the need 
for some form of spending ceiling while mcconnell praised the 
distinction between good money from those who can vote for you 
and bad money from special interests and other outsiders who 
cant 
sen ted stevens ralaska called the recommendation a genius 
solution to the gops abhorrence of any spending limits and 
democrats fears of superior republican party fund raising 
however there is still widespread disagreement between the 
parties and within each on how much political action committees or 
pacs should be reigned in and the role of nowunreported 
socalled soft money in politics 
the task force avoided the soft money issue but proposed 
cutting allowable individual pac contributions to a candidate in 
half once the aggregate of them reachs onethird of the 
candidates spending ceiling 
pac contributions in recent elections have overwhelmingly gone 
to democratic incumbents and republicans would like to cut the 
allowable gift by a pac to an individual candidate from 10000 to 
2000 per election cycle 
boren and mitchel have proposed putting a 100000 ceiling on 
pac gifts a house candidate can receive and an 825000 lid on 
senate candidates in addition they would tell the parties senate 
and house campaign committees that no more than 30 percent of their 
total contributions could come from pacs

the house ethics committee said thursday it 
found no adequate basis to investigate republican whip newt 
gingrich but criticized his failure to disclose a home purchase 
and his loose control over his staff 
the report concluded that even if most allegations made against 
the georgia republican were true they would not violate house 
rules 
the no 2ranking house republican who was the chief accuser in 
the ethics case that triggered democratic speaker jim wrights 
resignation last year has called the case filed against him a 
political retaliation 
gingrich said thursday the report demonstrated the charges filed 
by rep bill alexander dark were politically inspired 
nonsense 
he contended the political smear cost taxpayers at least 
300000 and himself more than 100000 in legal fees jan keyes 
spokeswoman for the committee on standards of official conduct 
the ethics panels formal name said she could not verify the 
300000 cost 
gingrich was criticized by the committee for failing to report 
on his annual disclosure forms his joint purchase with his 
daughter of her home in fulton county ga in 1986 
he also was criticized for his staffs use of his official 
letterhead in december 1986 and january 1987 to promote a 
forprofit cruise 
gingrich was ordered to promptly amend his disclosure 
statments to reflect purchase of the house and was warned of more 
severe committee action if he fails to prevent future misdeeds by 
his staff 
but alexanders complaint was also criticized some of the 
assertions are pure speculation the committee concluded 
others advance unusual legal arguments not supported by prior 
committee interpretations 
the most publicized issue in the case was whether gingrich 
violated outside income limits and rules against receiving gifts 
from those with a direct interest in legislation 
the allegations focused on the cos limited partnership 
gingrich formed to promote a book window of opportunity he 
wrote with his wife and a third author alexander also questioned 
gingrichs royalty arrangement 
the committee found gingrich properly listed as royalties the 
24036 he and his wife received from book sales and advances 
alexander questioned whether gingrich exceeded outside income 
limits with the payments but the committee concluded the royalties 
were exempted from the ceiling 
the committee also rejected alexanders allegation that the 
105000 raised from the 21 cos investors to promote the book 
could be considered gifts from people seeking legislative 
favors from gingrich 
the partners may simply have been seeking in addition to 
making investments advancing the political or philosophical 
policies which rep gingrich advocated in the book the committee 
said gingrich is the leader of conservative republicans in the 
house 
in sum the committee is of the firm view that no adequate 
basis exists for initiating a preliminary inquiry in the case 
the panel said referring to the first phase of its investigative 
process 
the committee set up what amounted to an initial investigation 
when it hired a chicago law firm last july for advice on whether to 
pursue the case the firm recommended last october the case should 
be dismissed due to lack of evidence that rules were broken 
the panel wrote gingrich a letter on the home purchase and the 
travel promotion which paralleled its findings in the report 
you were remiss in your oversight and administration of your 
congressional office the committee wrote in criticizing the 
letters promoting the cruise for senior citizens 
gingrich on thursday blamed the travelpromotion letters on a 
staffer a young man who made a mistake in judgment 
the panel also wrote gingrich that the joint purchase of his 
daughters home as well as the underlying liability you incurred 
should have been reported on your financial disclosure statements 
the panel said it considered and rejected gingrichs 
contention that he was only a guarantor of the loan and signed 
documents only as an accommodation for his daughter 
gingrich said thursday he failed to report that he cosigned the 
mortgage stemmed because he misread of house rules

fbi director william b sessions strongly 
denied on thursday an allegation that a highly decorated 
counterespionage agent was suspended because of his efforts to 
uncover antihispanic bias at the bureau 
the charge was leveled earlier this week by attorneys for 
fernando mata a miamibased agent who was suspended with pay 
about two months ago administration sources who declined 
identification said he was suspected of unauthorized contacts with 
cuban intelligence agents 
mata 48 a cubanamerican was a key witness in a successful 
1988 suit by 311 hispanic agents who accused the bureau of bias in 
hirings promotions and discipline his attorneys hugo rodriguez 
and antonio silva have charged that mata and other hispanics 
involved in the suit have been targeted for harassment at a time 
when a courtappointed panel is about to begin a followup review 
of the case 
the fbi categorically denies retaliation against agent mata 
sessions said thursday in a written statement there is no 
connection between agent matas being placed on administrative 
leave with pay and the lawsuit in which he participated the fbi 
further denies that it leaked any information relating to the 
inquiry 
the fbi is acutely aware of its obligations to protect the 
rights of employees who use legal procedures available to them to 
express their grievances the directors statement continued 
allegations of retaliation against any employee for having taken 
advantage of these procedures are taken very seriously by the fbi 
and if confirmed will be met with stern disciplinary action 
allegations that information of an official nature may have been 
leaked by any fbi employee for any reason will likewise be met with 
stern disciplinary action if confirmed 
mata who in 1983 received the justice departments top award 
for counterespionage has said that in 1988 shortly before his 
testimony in the discrimination case he was confronted with 
allegations that he compromised national security while working 
undercover no charges have ever been filed against him 
the case against mr mata is a house of cards said silva 
an el paso texas attorney who represented mata in the bias case 
heard by us district judge lucius d bunton in el paso there 
is no substance whatsoever to the allegations silva said it 
is nothing more than reprisals and retaliation against him 
bunton ruled that the fbi had demonstrated a pattern of 
discrimination against hispanics called its affirmative action 
program bankrupt and ordered sweeping changes in its promotion 
policies a special panel headed by former rep barbara jordan 
dtexas is about to begin its evaluation of the fbis compliance 
and mata and others are expected to testify once more 
in miami rodriguez matas other attorney said it is very 
ironic that those hearings are going to go forth next month and 
that allegations against mr mata and other agents are all of a 
sudden surfacing he said minor administrative actions had been 
taken against about 10 others involved in the lawsuit including 
agents in el paso and san antonio texas los angeles san juan 
puerto rico and atlanta 
overall there are 425 hispanic agents among the fbis 10000 
employees according to rodriguez himself a former agent 
rodriguez confirmed that his client had again been questioned 
about the possibility of contacts with cuban intelligence agents 
several years ago he said mata had taken several lie detector 
tests and passed them all fernando mata is not a spy they know 
that everyone knows that rodriguez said 
only one fbi agent has ever been charged with espionage richard 
miller an fbi counterspy based in los angeles was convicted of 
delivering defense secrets to soviet agents but the conviction was 
overturned by a federal appeals court last year a new trial is 
scheduled to begin later this year

a sheriff who relieved his overcrowded 
jail by commandeering a national guard armory and refusing to budge 
won a victory thursday when the state promised him another 
refurbished armory 
under the agreement approved by hampden county superior court 
judge george keady county sheriff michael ashe would move from the 
springfield armory to a vacant armory in holyoke about 10 miles to 
the north once the state has made about 77500 worth of repairs to 
the building 
obviously were tremendously pleased ashe said 
everyone has won said lawrence fletcherhill the state 
assistant attorney general handling the case 
holyoke officials however were outraged by the decision 
saying their armory lacks parking is surrounded by homes and sits 
across the street from a preschool and kindergarten 
our primary concern is that 500 young schoolchildren should 
not be exposed to a jail 40 yards from their facility its highly 
inappropriate said mayor martin dunn who ordered city lawyers 
to try to get a court order blocking the move 
holyoke had officials tried to have the court hearing delayed 
until monday but keady said the issue couldnt wait 
i think this matter is such it deserves immediate attention 
the judge said in approving the order entered jointly by the state 
and county 
ashe said he understood dunns concerns he said only 
minimumsecurity prisoners close to the end of their terms would be 
sent to the armory and that other springfield lockups close to 
community agencies have operated peacefully 
i know this is a difficult thing but we had an emergency 
something had to be done and we just had to stand up for this 
said ashe noting that 25 percent of hampden county prisoners come 
from holyoke 
gov michael s dukakis praised the agreement we all want to 
keep violent criminals in jail he said 
thursdays amicable settlement contrasted with the days 
immediately following ashes feb 16 seizure of the springfield 
armory under a 17thcentury law the statute orders citizens to 
give suitable aid to law enforcement efforts 
the state tried to evict the sheriff but was blocked by a 
temporary restraining order he won from a judge state officials 
never conceded ashes argument that his mission to keep the peace 
justified his action 
it was not clear where funds would come for ashe to run the 
armory as a jail 
the agreement calls for the sheriff and the state to make their 
best efforts to obtain the approximately 470000 ashe estimates it 
will cost him to run the holyoke armory until june 
the pact notes that massachusetts is in a fiscal crisis and 
says that if new revenues arent available the state may have to 
dip into funds other sheriffs are trying to obtain for their 
crowded jails 
the bestefforts clause isnt a guarantee the money will be 
there said dukakis spokeswoman mindy lubber 
it means just that our best goodfaith efforts it does not 
mean this is an insurance policy she said 
repairs to the holyoke armory which was closed march 1 should 
be completed within weeks and inmates may be moved there next 
month ashe said the temporary prison will be used only until a 
new jail is built in ludlow which is expected to take at least two 
years 
no limit was set on the number of inmates but only as many will 
be moved as needed to keep the old jail at its federal limit of no 
more than 500 inmates so far up to 26 inmates have been kept at 
the springfield armory 
under the agreement ashe will establish a jail population 
committee to discuss the best way of dealing with cramped prison 
space

unescos director thursday defended his 
controversial restructuring plan for the agency after drawing 
criticism from us and other western diplomats 
director general federico mayor on feb 28 established 24 new 
management posts and promoted 18 top officials including many who 
came from the senior staff of his predecessor amadou mahtar mbow 
of senegal 
mayor appointed the former deputy director of the soviet state 
commission for radio and television henrikh yushiavitshus to the 
sensitive post of deputy director general for communications 
it had been expected that mayor would give the communications 
post to a westerner as part of his campaign to induce the united 
states and britain to rejoin the organization which they left in 
the mid1980s 
another soviet boris kluchnikov was proposed as director for 
europe a post that normally goes to a western or a neutral 
european 
the united states and britain which had provided about 30 
percent of the budget of the un education scientific and cultural 
organization left the agency because they claimed it was 
antiwestern poorly managed and spending too much 
western and japanese diplomats and the head of the us observer 
mission to parisbased unesco richard t miller called mayors 
plan a mistake a japanese delegate said it showed unesco was 
going backwards at great speed 
british news reports have criticized the cost of the plan mayor 
confirmed that the appointments would cost 5 million but said the 
measures he had introduced the past two years ago had saved three 
times that amount 
in an interview at the thai beach resort of jomtien where he is 
attending an international conference on education mayor called 
british media criticism of his moves misleading and 
illinformed 
mayor said the choice of officials from the soviet union 
reflected the changing political climate it had inspired through 
recent reforms 
asked whether the appointments were insensitive to british and 
american interests mayor said i cannot follow the sensibilities 
of any countries i have 161 countries 
i have chosen all my staff according to their personal 
qualifications and professional achievments i dont take into 
account their belonging to official systems that were in the past

four senators told president bush thursday 
that congress will press again this year for a us contribution to 
the united nations population control agency a fight that led to a 
veto of last years foreign aid bill 
the lawmakers said third world population growth poses a grave 
threat to our own future security because of the increasing 
pressures it places on the environment and on the political 
stability of poor countries 
supporters of aid to the un population fund dropped a 15 
million appropriation for the agency as part of a compromise after 
bush vetoed the foreign aid bill last year but they believe they 
have a better chance of getting the aid approved because of growing 
gop restiveness on the abortion issue 
adding to their optimism is an agreement by the un agency to 
allow the united states to earmark its population aid for specific 
countries whose family planning practices do not run counter to the 
presidents abortion stand 
the house and senate voted to send money to the agency last 
year which would have reversed a 5yearold reagan administration 
policy antiabortion forces objected because the agency sends 
money to china which uses coercion and abortion to enforce a 
onechildperfamily policy 
but sens patrick leahy dvt barbara mikulski dmd mark 
hatfield rore and nancy kassebaum rkan told bush in the 
letter thursday that the un agency does not support abortion and 
has guaranteed it will not use american money in china 
with the population of the developing countries projected to 
grow by over 900 million during the 1990s we cannot afford to 
remain outside the unfpa the senators wrote 
a group of moderate house and senate republicans sent a similar 
letter last month to secretary of state james a baker iii calling 
for renewal of us funding for the unfpa 
last years veto sent the wrong signal to the american public 
and the international community regarding the republican partys 
support for international family planning services they wrote

parliament agreed thursday that a 
united germany should honor polands western border and chancellor 
helmut kohl tried to fend off charges that he heightened 
international fears about unification 
a lawmaker from the opposition social democrats juergen 
schmude said during a raucous debate that kohls handling of the 
border issue amounted to political arson in the european house 
parliament passed a resolution that said the two germanys should 
adopt twin declarations that the polish people are assured their 
right to live in secure borders will not be questioned by us 
germans through territorial claims either now or in the future 
it says the future government of a united germany should sign a 
border treaty on the basis of those declarations 
polands deputy prime minister leszek balerowicz told a news 
conference in gdansk poland that bonns declaration was progress 
but that poland still should attend talks on german unification 
the government of the republic of poland treats it as a step 
in the right direction but it is not complete convergence he 
said 
the invasion of poland by nazi germany in 1939 was the start of 
world war ii unease between poles and germans is longstanding 
kohl came under fire abroad and at home for his previous 
reluctance to promise that a united germany would never lay claim 
to land ceded to poland after the third reichs 1945 defeat 
the chancellor apparently trying to avoid offending 
conservative voters with federal elections slated in december had 
insisted only the government of a united germany could address the 
matter 
his demands that a border treaty be linked to polish concessions 
caused an uproar and he withdrew them this week while proposing 
the resolution that passed thursday 
germany was split into communist east and capitalist west after 
the war the rush toward unification followed the ouster of east 
germanys hardline communist leader erich honecker last october 
the social democrats charged in parliament that kohls 
pronouncements had jeopardized the unification process 
social democratic chief hansjochen vogel said kohl squandered 
world trust of germans and endangered the process of german 
unification in its most sensitive phase 
and if people now start talking about the nasty germans again 
if delays in unification occur then you are to blame he told 
kohl 
kohl insisted since i took over the government in 1982 i 
have never given any reason to doubt that we hold to the spirit and 
letter of standing west germanpolish agreements on border 
guarantees 
it is my aim to place reconciliation between the polish and 
german peoples on a lasting and firm basis 
he said the contribution of vogel and his social democrats to 
unification matters over the past years can be characterized as 
simply pathetic 
the chancellor also seemed to address concern by moscow that he 
is trying to make unification occur too quickly 
we are producing no artificial time pressures in order to 
speed up unification he said 
but kohl also said he would like any international concerns 
about german unification settled soon noting that a preliminary 
round of the twoplusfour talks involving the allies is set 
for next week in bonn 
officials from the world war ii allies the united states the 
soviet union britain and france are to meet next wednesday with 
the two germanys 
among unification hurdles is the soviet demand that a united 
germany not be a nato member 
kohl repeated that a united germany must belong to the north 
atlantic treaty organization he said anew that what is now east 
germany could have a special military status with nato troops 
barred from being stationed there 
kohl sought to allay concerns that a united germany could become 
an overmighty presence in europe 
no one needs to be worried about a german dominance in the 
european community a united germany would also be a reliable and 
solid partner kohl said 
thursdays resolution touches on the two concessions kohl sought 
from the poles a demand that warsaw reaffirm its 1953 decision 
not to seek war reparations and to confirm its pledge last year to 
protect the ethnic rights of polands german minority 
the resolution says those decisions remain valid for a united 
germany 
the social democrats offered a resolution omitting mention of 
the two issues but the majority lawmakers from kohls coalition 
government rejected it

a san francisco group that organized 
underground tests of an aids drug derived from chinese cucumber 
roots won government approval to resume testing with a purified 
form of the drug an official of the group said thursday 
project inform an aids treatment and education group planned 
to announce friday that the food and drug administration has 
approved its application to conduct tests of the drug known as 
compound q on about 100 patients said terry beswick research 
director of the group 
an fda official who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
confirmed the approval and said it brings project inform under the 
agencys sanctioned clinical trials system assuring that the 
groups plan conforms to government standards for testing 
it gives the agency more control over the situation than it 
had before the fda official said we had problems with the 
secret trials whether the compound was pure what problems 
might be with the dose who was taking it that sort of thing this 
gives us a handle on that 
working with project inform to come up with a study design that 
meets fda requirements was a better alternative than trying to put 
the group out of business the official said 
how would you stop people from taking this drug if they really 
wanted it youre talking about quite an effort that might not be 
successful the official said this way were assured a good 
hard look at dose and safety 
last may project inform secretly organized a compound q study 
without fda authorization the groups leaders said they couldnt 
wait for the government because desperate aids patients were 
already experimenting with the drug 
doctors in the study infused their patients with compound q the 
name given to trichosanthin a protein from the root of a 
cucumberlike plant that chinese doctors have used for centuries to 
induce abortions and treat cancer the group used couriers to 
import the drug from china 
by the time the fda told project inform to discontinue the 
unapproved experiments last august the group had finished treating 
patients with the drug and had begun to evaluate their data 
in september martin delaney codirector of project inform 
said early results showed the drug holds promise but also has 
serious risks associated with it in earlier testtube studies the 
drug appeared to selectively kill cells infected with the aids 
virus 
in the secret tests about 60 patients were given infusions of 
compound q by doctors in san francisco new york miami and los 
angeles according to project inform officials two patients died 
during the trial and three others suffered severe dementia or 
seizures but recovered delaney said doctors did not believe the 
drug caused the deaths 
under the new study approved by the fda the groups research 
arm project informcommunity research alliance will test a highly 
purified form of compound q on up to 100 patients who previously 
were treated with the chinese import beswick said 
the fda source said the patients in the new study will be 
limited to those who were connected to project informs earlier 
underground study 
but beswick said others besides those who participated in the 
earlier study could participate he said hundreds of other 
people have been treated with the chinese version in underground 
experiments 
the purified form of the drug called glq223 was developed at 
the university of california at san francisco and genelabs of 
redwood city calif 
this version of the drug is being studied on patients in 
fdaapproved tests that were started at san francisco general 
hospital last may

president bush announced a national 
transportation policy thursday that would cost travelers more and 
increase local governments share in meeting air land and sea 
travel needs into the next century 
just as the model t and the wright brothers plane prepared 
the way for todays millions of cars and thousands of passenger 
jets so it is now our turn to invest in americas future bush 
said in unveiling the policy with transportation secretary samuel 
skinner 
bush said it would help keep america the world leader in 
transportation 
the 129page plan moving america into the 21st century 
calls for more toll roads local gas taxes user fees private 
investments competition deregulaton research into futuristic 
systems and openness to foreign air carriers as well as increased 
attention to safety and protection of the environment 
the policy was hailed as an important step by some industry 
groups but most expressed some disappointment and democratic 
members of congress were critical 
aviation and ground transportation groups opposed user fees 
and other taxes that skinner acknowledged would require travelers 
to pay more the american public transit association said the 
policy was long on advice and short on help from the federal 
government 
rep norman mineta dcalif chairman of the house surface 
transportation subcommittee called it a good start but said 
shifting programs to the state and local level without financial 
resources would be the shift and the shaft 
bush did not immediately field questions on the proposal 
leaving skinner to face news media 
the secretary who had the policy drawn up after holding 117 
hearings across the country justified proposals for increases in 
local gasoline taxes and fees by saying polls show that people are 
willing to pay if they get improvements 
skinner denied the policy represents a shift of responsiblity 
for transportation away from the federal government saying it was 
an attempt to strike a balance after years in which the federal 
government has assumed almost all of the responsibility for 
funding some transportation systems 
the federal commitment to infrastructure and to transportation 
will continue to be at a very high level he said adding that 
federal transportation budgets are expected to increase each year 
it is not the panacea or the answer to all of the problems in 
transportation said skinner it was never designed to be that 
it was designed to be a strategic plan or a framework under which 
we could make the many decisions that we are required to make 
the plan outlines no major federal programs not already called 
for in the presidents budget request 
its overall goal is to maintain the us transportation system 
as the finest in the world however the report said there 
are increasing signs that the system is beginning to break 
down 
sen james exon dneb chairman of the senate surface 
transportation subcommittee said im going to be looking 
through this to see whether or not this simply doesnt transfer the 
problems we have off the backs of the federal government and 
onto the backs of state and local governments 
rep john paul hammerschmidt of arkansas top republican on a 
house transportation subcommittee said i think the money has to 
come from users one way or another and because it is a national 
plan the logical way for it to come from users is through a 
national tax system 
a coalition of 16 aviation industry groups said it opposes 
bushs proposed increases in aviation taxes which the presidents 
fiscal 1991 budget calls user fees 
air transport association president robert aaronson who 
represents major airlines praised skinner for real vision in 
developing the plan but he said increasing the share shippers and 
air travelers pay to run the federal aviation administration could 
adversely affect the economy 
before being asked to pay more funds already collected should 
be spent aaronson said referring to a 7 billion surplus in the 
aviation trust fund which is collected from airline ticket taxes 
later skinner defended his proposals before the house public 
works and transportation subcommittee on surface transportation 
he said congress would have to decide the balance of urban and 
rural priorities when new highway legislation is considered next 
year 
skinner was criticized by rep robert a borski dpa for a 
budget proposal that removes 20 million for the philadelphia area 
transit system skinner said the state government would have to 
shoulder more of the burden just as has happened with the chicago 
and new york mass transit systems 
he said the system could no longer rely on the old 
philosophy of free dollars in washington 
reaction among top state transportation officials varied 
thomas harrelson north carolina transportation secretary an 
appointive post in a republican administration said problems are 
fast approaching the critical stage and skinners policy helps 
move transportation higher on the national agenda 
democratic appointee james pitz michigan transportation 
director said bush missed a chance to hit a home run by not 
agreeing to spend more of the aviation and highway trust fund 
revenue he said the chance for private investment in 
transportation is not overly significant

soviet populist boris yeltsin appealed to 
mikhail gorbachev on thursday to expel conservatives from the 
ruling bodies and speed up reforms 
yeltsin said the soviet presidents popularity is fading 
rapidly because the people are getting harder times rather than 
better times after five years of perestroika as a result of 
gorbachevs delays and halfmeasures 
perestroika is gorbachevs plan to restructure the economy 
yeltsin saying again that he considers himself a communist with 
a soul of a social democrat suggested the soviet leader should 
get rid of leading conservatives such as yegor ligachev a 
member of the soviet politburo 
yeltsin a member of the soviet congress was speaking at a news 
conference in milan during a european trip to promote his 
autobiography leonardo mondadori italian publisher of yeltsins 
autobiography said royalties from the book will be used to finance 
a research center on aids in the soviet union 
the soviet congressman said conservative forces had united in 
the soviet union to form an efficient group in the partys 
central committee 
we must not understimate this danger we must remove ligachev 
i cant understand why gorbachev is delaying on the decision to get 
rid of him ligachev is stuck to his chair thus we must get 
rid of him and of his chair but its up to gorbachev to push the 
button he does not allow me to do it 
yeltsin said the sweeping political changes in eastern europe 
could not have been possible without the beginning of perestroika 
in the soviet union in 1985 
however the eastern countries have by now left us behind 
because the people there showed they can change their nations 
while we stuck to the apparatus 
i am not saying that gorbachev is the only one responsible for 
a slowdown in reforms but he must be more determined and 
efficient he must make choices 
yeltsin said if the soviet communist party is not radically 
reorganized at the next party congress this summer he will support 
the foundation of a new party and a pluralistic political system 
yeltsin dodged a question on whether he may try for the soviet 
presidency but he said a change of guard at the top is not 
easy but would be necessary if things continue this way 
certainly nobody quits voluntarily in the soviet union 
yeltsin also said he did not agree with the decision of some 
eastern european countries to remove their statues of vladimir i 
lenin the soviet communist founder he also criticized calls by 
some soviets to take lenins body from the mausoleum in moscow 
lenin is not my idol he too made mistakes but we must 
preserve his memory certainly i prefer to have lenins 
portrait in my office rather than gorbachevs he concluded with 
a broad smile

the state attorney general declared 
west virginias first teacher strike illegal thursday as the 
walkout spread to more than half the schools in the state 
attorney general roger tompkins warned teachers they could be 
suspended for a year fired or charged with a misdemeanor for 
walking off the job 
despite that warning and the governors refusal to hold talks 
until they go back to class the 16000member teachers union 
voted to walk out in 20 more counties thursday and in six more by 
monday if the legislature fails to vote them a pay raise the union 
initially went on strike wednesday in 10 counties 
teachers joined picket lines blocked bus garages and rallied at 
the state capitol authorities arrested seven teachers on charges 
of blocking school buses in kanawha county and one picket suffered 
torn ligaments when she was hit by a parents car 
gov gaston caperton told the legislature on wednesday he wont 
hold discussions with the teachers until calm and reason are 
restored and the teaching force returns to the classrooms 
this state government will not conduct its affairs under 
intimidation he said to a standing ovation 
west virginia education association president kayetta meadows 
said her group is willing to meet with the governor but is not 
ready to call off the strike 
the association which represents 73 percent of the states 
22000 public school teachers says average teacher pay in the 
state was 21904 49th in the nation before a 5 percent pay raise 
last month mississippi is 50th 
the west virginia federation of teachers which represents 3000 
teachers said 90 percent of its members also were on strike 
state law does not permit teachers to engage in collective 
bargaining andthe attorney general said a strike or work 
stoppage by teachers constitutes an attack upon the most important 
duty and function of this state 
there is no right to strike against the state his opinion 
said thus any strike or concerted work stoppage by the public 
teachers of this state is illegal 
tompkins said it is a misdemeanor for any state officials to 
neglect or refuse to perform their duties or to interrupt a school 
or loiter on school grounds teachers can be barred for one year 
for neglecting their duty by striking he said 
by early thursday evening no teachers had been arrested or 
suspended for staying off the job authorities said 
an agreement with legislators on a 5 percent raise for teachers 
collapsed tuesday when the union refused to rule out a strike 
house speaker chuck chambers and senate president keith burdette 
said the strike threat made it impossible for them to win passage 
of the raise which would have been financed by a new 1 per ton 
minimum tax on coal production 
more than 1000 signtoting teachers rallied at the statehouse 
urging lawmakers and the governor to provide teachers with a pay 
raise 
we think we can do more here if we talk to our legislators 
and get the governor to talk to us said jane mcneill laraba a 
teacher at raleigh countys liberty high school 
the people in raleigh county cant help us the people who can 
do anything for us are here 
i came to school today with tears in my eyes said becky 
wallace a physical education teacher at anne bailey elementary 
school in st albans ive been here 12 years my kids are 
special when i think of the kids crossing the road here with us 
picketing its distressing 
she said teachers are fed up with the governor and the 
legislature 
this is a message to the legislature and governor wallace 
said i think the governors misguided

john m poindexter lied to congress and ripped 
up a key presidential document to rewrite the history of the 
irancontra affair a prosecutor argued thursday at the start of 
the former national security advisers trial poindexters lawyer 
said he was only following ronald reagans orders 
prosecutor dan webb also told jurors former white house aide 
oliver north expected on the witness stand friday will testify 
that on poindexters instructions he lied and he lied and he 
lied to congress by denying the reagan administration was 
secretly helping the nicaraguan rebels 
webb said poindexter later congratulated north on lies that the 
prosecutor said worked like a charm 
but defense attorney richard beckler denied that poindexter ever 
lied to congress and he told jurors admiral poindexter always 
followed the orders of president reagan 
poindexter tore up a presidential finding that authorized a 
1985 arms shipment to iran only because he felt he was protecting 
the president beckler said echoing testimony poindexter gave 
congress about the irancontra affair 
what was driving this man was not a conspiracy but what was 
driving this man was the orders of the president of the united 
states beckler said 
poindexter met with him sometimes seven days a week sometimes 
four five and six times a day and he was carrying out the 
policies of the united states and that is what this case is about 
it is not about criminality 
poindexter worked to help arm the contras when congress shut off 
military assistance because through hell or high water reagan 
wanted support to continue the defense lawyer said 
reagan wanted it done within the law and it was done within 
the law beckler said telling jurors he will play videotapes of 
the former presidents testimony taken last month in los angeles 
as the proceedings got under way us district court judge 
harold greene dealt the defense a setback ruling that when north 
is called to testify prosecutors may ask him about seeing 
poindexter rip up the reagan finding 
the judge also suggested that north had changed his story on 
that subject 
north testified at his trial last year that he saw poindexter 
destroy the politically embarrassing document but at a dec 13 
pretrial hearing in the poindexter case he testified he realized 
it was the finding that poindexter had ripped up only after 
watching poindexters congressional testimony on national 
television in 1987 
north appears to have embarked at that time upon the 
calculated course of attempting to assist his former colleague and 
codefendant by prevaricating on various issues greene said 
the document stated that the arms sale was part of a plan to 
gain release of the hostages 
the case is about coverup deception and concealment webb 
told the jurors who will decide on the five felony charges facing 
poindexter who served as reagans top adviser on national security 
matters from late 1985 to late 1986 
poindexter and north tried to cover up a 1985 shipment of us 
arms to iran and the diversion of profits to the nicaraguan rebels 
to avoid tarnishment of the reagan administration webb said 
john poindexter and oliver north decided to rewrite the 
history of the irancontra affair he said after it was exposed 
in the fall of 1986 
oliver north and john poindexter did not like what the true 
historical facts were because they showed that reagan broke his 
pledge not to sell arms to iran for the release of us hostages 
webb said 
they did not want the irancontra events as they occurred to 
be revealed webb said but they got caught 
poindexter is charged with conspiracy obstruction and making 
false statements to congress about the usiran arms sales and the 
reagan administrations covert support of the contras at a time 
direct military aid was banned by congress 
webb told jurors north will testify that at poindexters 
direction he lied to the house intelligence committee on aug 6 
1986 when questioned about whether the white house was secretly 
helping arm the contras 
the lies worked like a charm to falsely reassure congressmen 
that the white house was not circumventing the ban on us military 
aid to the rebels webb said 
once admiral poindexter found out how successful north was in 
lying what did he do he congratulates north webb said he 
sends him a note that says well done 
beckler argued that poindexter was merely telling oliver north 
he did a good job none of the evidence will show it was done 
as an act to perpetuate a conspiracy to keep information from 
congress 
north at his own trial last year admitted that he lied during 
the aug 6 meeting but said he did not know he was breaking the 
law when he did so 
he was acquitted of a charge pertaining to the meeting but was 
convicted of three others including aiding and abetting obstruction 
of congress and altering and destroying government documents 
poindexter destroyed it on nov 21 1986 eight days after 
ronald reagan was on television addressing the nation telling 
the country what we were doing in iran had nothing to do with 
selling arms and swapping them for hostages webb said 
also poindexter ripped it up just hours after telling lawmakers 
that he knew nothing of the november 1985 missile shipment until 
five weeks after it occurred 
beckler argued that when poindexter testified in congress about 
the shipment he had forgotten when he had learned about it 
after 30 years in the us navy and the white house they want 
to nail him on a fiveweek mistake beckler said his voice 
rising

more than half of national forests lost money 
on timber sales last year the government said thursday in a report 
that environmentalists say support their call to roll back 
subsidized timber sales 
the us forest service in its annual report on timber sales 
from the nations wilderness said profits on all the national 
forests rose 4 percent last year even though the total harvest 
declined about 5 percent 
there were 119 billion board feet of timber harvested from 
national forests last year after 126 billion board feet were 
harvested in 1988 and a record 127 billion board feet the year 
before 
overall the forest service said the government took in 15 
billion through timber sales in 1989 operating expenses for the 
timber sales program were 7767 million last year and the 
government paid states 3391 million for a net sales gain of 
4027 million up from 3886 million the previous year 
the timber sale program in which private companies pay the 
federal government for the right to harvest trees and a portion 
goes to states to build roads and schools generated about 132371 
jobs and 44 billion in personal income in fiscal 1989 the forest 
service said 
of the nations 122 national forests 66 of them lost money by 
selling timber at below cost the report said 
but george leonard associate chief of the service said those 
66 forests account for only 18 percent of the total volume of 
timber cut or about 2 billion board feet 
the forests where we lost the money are the small forests 
he said oregon and washington are responsible for about half the 
revenue and they produce about half the timber 
timber industry leaders said the net gain in sales shows the 
program is in good shape but environmentalists said the losses on 
the majority of the forests show the government is subsidizing 
private logging activities 
the hundreds of millions of dollars the forest service loses 
on subsidized timber sales are nothing more than public welfare for 
the logging industry said tom kuhnle an economist for the 
natural resources defense council 
he said the report should aid the bush administrations proposal 
to slowly eliminate subsidized sales at 12 national forests 
but david ford vice president of the public timber council of 
the national forest products association said the report proves 
the programs financial soundness 
the timber program is rare among federal programs in that it 
consistently earns money for the government he said 
the pacific northwest harvested by far the largest volume of 
timber last year with 52 billion board feet 
only the pacific northwest and southwest among the services 
eight regions posted actual profits last year based on timber sales 
after payments were made to states for such things as schools and 
roads

oliver north has changed his story in the 
irancontra affair prevaricating in an attempt to help his 
former boss the judge in john poindexters trial contended 
thursday 
the accusation that north had lied under oath a contention 
that could suggest further legal problems for him preceded his 
expected leadoff appearance as a government witness against 
poindexter his former superior at the reagan administrations 
national security council 
poindexters lawyers tried to bar norths testimony however 
us district court judge harold greene ruled that prosecutors 
could ask north to testify as he did at his own trial that on 
nov 21 1986 he witnessed poindexter tear up a document signed by 
president reagan the december 1985 finding depicted us 
involvement in arms sales to iran as a straight armsforhostages 
deal 
north testified at his trial that he saw poindexter destroy the 
politically embarrassing document but the judge said north gave 
different testimony at a dec 13 pretrial hearing in the 
poindexter case 
at the hearing north said he only realized it was the finding 
that poindexter had ripped up after watching poindexters 
congressional testimony on national television in 1987 
no portion of the prosecutions case may be derived from that 
poindexter testimony which was given under a grant of immunity 
the court rejects as totally incredible the suggestion that an 
eyewitness to the almost ceremonial destruction of a state paper 
such as a signed presidential finding would not know that he had 
been such an eyewitness said the judge 
in a footnote the judge said that since north has changed his 
testimony several times a further recantation can obviously not be 
excluded 
the judge said the former white house aide was trying to avoid 
having to testify against his former boss when he made the 
statements at the hearing north said at the time that poindexter 
was the only one in the irancontra affair who didnt hang ollie 
north out to dry 
north appears to have embarked at that time upon the 
calculated course of attempting to assist his former colleague and 
codefendant by prevaricating on various issues greene said 
north told the truth at his trial rather than at the december 
13 1989 hearing the judge concluded 
poindexters lawyers asserted that north testified reluctantly 
about how his memory was affected by poindexters immunized 
testimony but greene disagreed 
norths insistence on having been heavily influenced by that 
testimony was enthusiastic rather than reluctant said the judge 
at the december hearing north repeatedly claimed that he 
could not distinguish between his own observations and the version 
of events described in anothers testimony yet it is unlikely 
that a witness who was a participant in the events as they 
occurred could not make such a distinction 
at his trial north testified that i saw the finding torn up 
i saw him tear it in two 
in december the former white house aide said 
i dont know for a fact that the document was the finding 
except what admiral poindexter testified to that the document 
that was destroyed that morning or afternoon or whenever it was 
was indeed the finding 
north was convicted of three felonies including aiding and 
abetting an obstruction of congress in connection with the november 
1985 shipment of hawks which now figures so prominently in the 
poindexter case 
poindexter destroyed the finding hours after he is alleged to 
have told members of the house and senate intelligence committees 
that he hadnt known about the missile shipment until january 1986 
his alleged statements to the committees form the basis for four of 
the five criminal charges against him 
the government says it will contend at poindexters trial that 
his knowledge of the signed presidential finding was his motive for 
concealing us involvement in the hawk missile shipment

the exxon valdez ran aground on a 
jagged reef and spilled its cargo of oil because the helmsman 
failed to turn the ship as far as he was ordered an expert 
testified thursday on behalf of the tankers skipper 
peter shizume who devised a complex computer program used to 
simulate ship accidents said the tanker would have gone past bligh 
reef in prince william with room to spare if the rudder had been 
turned only half as far as called for by the third mate 
i think the problem was the rudder was initiated late and not 
enough rudder was used shizume testified at the criminal trial 
of fired exxon skipper joseph hazelwood in the nations worst oil 
spill 
shizume who said he used various formulas to track the course 
of the tanker said it would have missed bligh reef by about two 
miles if the helmsman had turned 10 degrees right about 10 minutes 
before the ship ran aground and spilled nearly 11 million gallons 
of crude oil 
shizume from hicksville ny said as little as 5 degrees less 
than five minutes before the accident also would have saved the 
ship 
the third mate who was in control of the exxon valdez while 
hazelwood went to his cabin testified earlier in the trial that 10 
minutes before the accident he called for the helmsman to execute 
10 degrees right rudder 
the mate suggested that the helmsman robert kagan failed to 
follow the order because he had problems with steering and had once 
been reprimanded for steering too hard 
shizume said his study of the ships course recorder showed that 
kagans average turn during the critical period was 4 degrees 
what is your opinion as to what he was doing asked attorney 
michael chalos 
he looks like he was swinging the rudder back and forth 
apparently without any commands to do so shizume said 
shizume a physicist and engineer retired from sperry gyroscope 
co said he was hired to create the mockup system used at the 
national maritime research center at kings point ny the system 
is used for training captains and studying shipping accidents 
hazelwood 43 is on trial on four criminal counts stemming from 
the march 24 grounding of the exxon valdez in prince william sound 
he faces up to 7 years in prison and 61000 in fines if convicted 
on all four counts 
in other testimony a naval architect challenged the testimony 
of a prosecution expert saying the exxon valdez wouldnt have sunk 
if hazelwood had been able to work it off the reef immediately 
after the spill 
the prosecution contends that by engaging the engines and 
turning the rudder from side to side hazelwood put the ship in 
danger of capsizing and further damaged the part of the tanker that 
was resting on rock 
edward hoffman the naval architect said hazelwoods crew would 
have been able to keep the ship from capsizing by transferring sea 
water into oil tanks to balance the ships load 
hoffman also testified that he examined the wrecked exxon valdez 
at its dry dock in san diego and concluded that hazelwoods actions 
after it went aground didnt further damage to the tanker 
my opinion is that the explosive impact with the ship and the 
reef caused the majority of damage hoffman said subsequent to 
that the rise and fall of the tide caused further damage 
hoffman led off the second day of defense testimony after 
hazelwoods lawyers moved to center stage in the criminal trial

the mastermind of a plot to extort 10 
million from the du pont co in exchange for documents stolen from 
its lycra plant in argentina was sentenced wednesday to 6 years in 
federal prison 
us district court judge joseph longobardi sentenced two of 
52yearold bruno skerianzs accomplices raul armando giordano 
37 and antonio ruben inigo 40 to 3 years 
longobardi also ordered the three to serve three years probation 
and pay 100 to a du pont compensation fund 
prosecutors said du pont a wilmingtonbased chemicals 
manufacturer was given the choice of paying 10 million for the 
documents or having them sold to a competitor the documents were 
stolen from du ponts lycra plant in mercedes argentina 
lycra is du ponts trade name for spandex an elastic fiber used 
in such clothing as swimsuits and leotards 
a jury convicted the three argentines in december on one count 
each of conspiracy to extort and attempted extortion each count 
carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison a 250000 fine 
and five years probation 
a fourth defendant jose petrosino is fighting extradition from 
italy charges against maria i lorenzo de bianchini who testified 
for the prosecution were dropped 
before passing sentence the judge rejected a defense motion to 
dismiss the case 
were asking for as much leniency as possible based on their 
level of participation in the scheme said giordanos lawyer 
john s malik 
prosecutors said du pont also reached an agreement in which 
skerianz and his codefendants pledged not to work in spandex 
production for five years and du pont would sell spandex yarn for 
five years to a company chosen by skerianz 
the defense claimed skerianz had not attempted extortion because 
he and his cohorts had planned to manufacture spandex for radicci 
an italian textile manufacturer 
skerianz had worked for du pont more than 20 years ago and the 
others resigned in the fall of 1988 from the mercedes plant 
all except petrosini were arrested in february 1989 in geneva 
after an aborted attempt to return the documents for 10 million 
petrosino was arrested several months later 
du pont controls more than half the spandex market worldwide 
and sold more than 600 million of the product in 1988

reserve system opted to stay with his higherpaying current job 
frederick wolf former no 2 official at congress general 
accounting office withdrew after the treasury department failed to

administrative part of serbia

president najib of afghanistan said 
thursday that the military has been purged of mutinous soldiers 
but the renegade general who led a bloody coup attempt said from 
hiding he would keep fighting 
radio kabul put the death toll at 56 and said 200 people were 
injured in fighting since tuesdays air raid over kabul some 
travelers who witnessed the attacks said civilian casualties 
appeared low considering the ferocity of the battles 
the normally bustling markets of the capital opened again 
thursday and the warweary city was reported calm questions 
surfaced about the strength and loyalty of the afghan air force 
the key factor in najibs survival since the soviet union pulled 
its troops out of afghanistan last year 
shah nawaz tanai who as defense minister launched the coup try 
said in a taped message to his supporters thursday we have risen 
and our struggle will continue 
tanai defected wednesday to the moslem guerrillas battling 
najibs government but guerrilla leaders made clear thursday they 
have no desire to join forces with the hardline marxist 
hes no different than najib how can we extend our support to 
a communist said abdul rasul sayyaf leader of the radical 
islamic ittehad faction and prime minister of the guerrillas 
government in exile 
radio kabul said najib replaced tenai as defense minister 
tuesday and dismissed him thursday from the supreme defense council 
four other council members also were replaced because of 
national dishonesty said the radio monitored in islamabad 
they were identified as niaz mohammad momand and mir sahib karwal 
both politburo members gen nazar mohammad an alternate member of 
the politburo and a former defense minister and gen sayed aqa 
aka a brigadier general who fled to pakistan on wednesday 
according to the radio najib declared that mutinous troops had 
been purged from the armed forces 
and a diplomat based in kabul quoted the president as telling a 
news conference the microbes the radicals among us have been 
cleansed we dont have any more factions we are more united than 
ever 
according to the diplomat who refused to be identified further 
najib said protanai soldiers had been killed arrested or had 
surrendered he again declared his government was strong and urged 
western nations to revise their proresistance policies 
in his message tanai said he was inside afghanistan but he did 
not say where 
i am sending this cassette with my friend outside to be 
broadcast to you he said in comments translated by the 
guerrillas news agency from dari into english 
this is a call for afghanistans moslem people and the army 
and the real party members najib and his dictatorship will fall 
for this and for national unity we have risen up 
the tape was played to reporters who recognized tanais voice 
from military briefings news conferences and television 
appearances 
tanai was in at least temporary alliance with one of the most 
radical guerrilla leaders gulbuddin hekmatyar 
sibghatullah mojaddidi the moderate president of the 
guerrillas exile government rejected the tanaihekmatyar 
alliance we do not have any understanding or solidarity with 
either he said 
tanai and hekmatyar were bitter rivals during the 12 years of 
war after the 1978 coup that installed a communist government in 
afghanistan tanai had opposed najibs propsals to talk peace with 
the guerrillas and hekmatyar said he would only support an islamic 
government in afghanistan 
they appeared united in their desire to see najib ousted 
when the last soviet soldiers left afghanistan in february 1989 
after nine years of military intervention many governments 
including the united states and soviet union predicted najibs 
government would collapse within weeks or months 
but the afghan armed forces held their ground largely because 
of the afghan air force 
this weeks fighting resulted in heavy losses to air force 
aircraft said one western diplomat 
the air force was najibs only card its unlikely it will get 
back the strength it had anytime soon said the diplomat in 
islamabad who spoke on condition of anonymity 
tanai a battlehardened soldier popular among rankandfile 
afghan soldiers launched the coup attempt from bagram the 
countrys largest air base about 30 miles north of kabul 
about a halfdozen warplanes swooped down on the capital 
dropping bombs around the presidential palace and near crowded 
markets and residential areas in the old section according to 
diplomatic sources in kabul and islamabad 
i was very scared said harinder singh an afghan who was 
among 150 passengers aboard a kabulnew delhi flight on thursday 
the first flight since the attempted coup all of us thought we 
were going to die a bomb exploded in a taxi near me and i saw the 
driver being blown apart 
according to sources in kabul the last bombs were dropped on 
the city wednesday morning as protanai soldiers battled troops 
loyal to najib at bagram 
in moscow soviet television said late thursday that five 
artillery shells landed on soviet embassy grounds during the kabul 
fighting but no one was hurt it said nothing about damage 
the soviet tv reporter said a majority of the military backs 
najib and reported most of afghanistan was quiet but he said the 
situation in the near future is not simple he said tanai is 
from the khost region and is likely to use his connections there

president bush last month returned a call to 
talk about us hostages to a man he was told was iranian president 
hashemi rafsanjani but the call turned out to be a hoax the white 
house said thursday 
this was the first time this has happened said presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
he said the government has no idea who was behind the hoax 
fitzwater and other white house officials said that bush placed 
the call after a man identifying himself as an iranian government 
official called the white house to say that rafsanjani wanted to 
talk to bush about us hostages held in lebanon 
the call came in a number was given for us to call we were 
suspicious and began checking fitzwater said but ultimately 
the president needed to make the call as part of the check he did 
make the call 
the call first reported by cbs news came to a staff member of 
the white house national security council aides said 
the president has made it known hes willing to talk to iran 
at any time fitzwater said and the ball is in their court 
the bush administration has contended that rafsanjanis 
government has influence with the captors of eight americans and 
citizens of 10 european countries being held in lebanon 
fitzwater said that the administration has let rafsanjani know 
through diplomatic channels as well as publicly that were 
willing to talk whenever theyre ready and they have come back and 
said were not ready 
the caller said the iranian president wanted to speak to bush 
and various methods were used to check the legitimacy of the 
call said another white house aide stephen hart 
since the president has stated he would talk to anybody if it 
would help free the hostages bush agreed to talk to rafsanjani 
hart said 
fitzwater and hart declined to answer further questions about 
the affair such as how the hoax was discovered or what bush said 
to the caller 
asked if bush immediately realized that the voice on the other 
end of the line was not rafsanjani fitzwater said i cant tell 
you how we determined it was a hoax 
he said he didnt want to get into anything that goes to the 
point of how we check out phone calls 
however he indicated that the person on the other end of the 
line did not identify himself as a hoaxer 
cbs said the call came first to brent scowcroft national 
security adviser to the president and was checked out by various 
intelligence methods 
in his conversation with the unknown caller the president 
repeated us policy that goodwill will beget goodwill but there 
could be no quid pro quo for us hostages the network said 
bush first used the phrase goodwill will beget goodwill in 
his inaugural address 14 months ago 
recent days have seen a flurry of speculative stories about 
whether the hostages might be freed and the white house has said 
it was encouraged by recent comments of rafsanjani to the effect 
that a solution might be achieved soon 
the tehran times a newspaper close to irans president said in 
an editorial that 1990 would be the last year of captivity for the 
hostages 
secretary of state james a baker iii said on tuesday we are 
encouraged by the fact that there is speculation about a release 
of the hostages lets see if that speculation proves out 
the white house has said it was not negotiating directly with 
iran and it has said it would make no deals for the freedom of the 
hostages but a great deal is being done that is not 
publicized said mike kraft an official in the state 
departments counterterrorism office on wednesday

an air force lieutenant accused of 
having sex with a sergeant at a titan 2 missile silo was acquitted 
wednesday by an eightman military jury 
thank god 2nd lt naomi hayes attorney morgan chip 
welch yelled when the verdict was read after two hours of 
deliberations mrs haye dropped into her chair and sobbed quietly 
as supporters applauded 
im speechless mrs haye 33 told reporters wednesday i 
always planned on the worst and hoped for the best its easier to 
expect the worst its too defeating to get the other way around 
air force officials said mrs haye may be entitled to about 
75000 in back pay withheld since she was first charged in 1986 
with fraternizaion and adultery 
she was convicted that year of adultery and fraternization but 
the verdict was overturned by military appeals courts prosecutors 
retried her on charges of fraternization claiming she had sex four 
times with sgt thomas bush at their homes at a hotel and at a 
missile silo while he was on duty 
mrs haye now lives in guam with her husband patrick an air 
force sergeant 
the president of the jury col liegel john said he found bush 
unreliable 
there was a lot of inconsistencies and not enough there to 
prove her guilty john said there was no smoking gun 
prosecutor capt derek hill had argued that mrs haye and her 
husband tried to cover up the alleged affair and said she declined 
to deny the charge until several weeks after she talked to her 
attorneys 
the defense said bush who has married four times used his 
marital problems to get close to female acquaintances 
welch said bush was hustling women through an approach thats 
as old as the hills my wife doesnt understand me he wants 
counseling he wants them to mother him 
hes the only witness to allege sexual misconduct welch 
said ill be the first to tell you i believe mr bush is guilty 
of sexual misconduct i just dont know with whom 
in his closing argument hill said there was no reason for an 
enlisted man to lie about having an affair with an officer 
welch also took aim at prosecution witnesses who supported 
bushs testimony 
a prosecution witnesss staff sgt kim wilkinson testified 
earlier in the week that she caught bush and mrs haye in an 
embrace but two defense witnesses testified monday that ms 
wilkinson joked and talked often about sex 
she saw sex behind every door and every glance and every 
nuance welch said 
six of the eight jurors were needed to cast guilty votes to 
convict mrs haye under military law but the actual vote was not 
released wednesday mrs haye would have faced dismissal from the 
air force if found guilty

west german chancellor helmut kohl 
sought to calm fears among the nato allies on thursday by promising 
to keep them fully informed on plans to forge a new german state 
in what was seen as a dramatic gesture to the alliance kohl 
traveled to the headquarters of the north atlantic treaty 
organization to meet for nearly three hours with ambassadors and 
other officials of the 16 nations 
afterward he told reporters nobody has to be concerned that 
the germans would one way or the other want to go it alone 
this was a very important event for me weve had a very 
frank a very open conversation 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner a former defense 
minister in bonn called the closeddoor talks very intensive 
constructive fruitful and lively also very friendly 
he said the discussions marked the start of a formal sequence 
of consultations inside this alliance on the issue of german 
unification and the security questions this posed 
he said the allies unanimously supported efforts to join the two 
germanys and agreed the unified state should remain in nato he 
said they welcomed the resolution adopted thursday by the bonn 
parliament calling for a united germany to honor polands western 
border 
kohl came here to try to stop complaints from nato nations about 
being left out of talks on security aspects of a united germany 
several nato diplomats demanding anonymity praised his 
performance here 
it was a tour de force said one another said kohl came 
clearly wanting to get things back on track with the european 
allies 
in an interview later with the associated press woerner 
described kohl as being very frank not the usual diplomatic 
attitude 
other officials said detailed questions were asked about whether 
germany wanted to consult the allies what its goals were and how 
it intended to deal with the current territory of east germany 
after unification more than 380000 soviet troops now are 
stationed there 
the officials said the questions might have been sharper had not 
the german legislature dealt with the issue of polands borders 
kohl had drawn fire for his earlier reluctance to unequivocally 
state that a united germany would never lay claim to land ceded to 
poland after the third reichs 1945 defeat 
kohl told reporters as he left the building 
what is happening in germany at present must be embedded in 
the ongoing developments in europe 
german interests must be taken into account but also the 
interests of all our friends and partners and neighbors in east and 
west must be taken into account 
this means we need to have talks constantly that we need to 
consult very closely and that we need to cooperate very closely 
that was the idea behind my visit 
he said the 40yearold west german state deserved confidence 
and trust 
woerner said the allies would be consulted before and after key 
meetings of the two germanys and the four victorious world war ii 
allies britain france the united states and the soviet union 
he said soviet troops would likely remain on east german 
territory for years after unification 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said tuesday it was 
absolutely out of the question that a united germany would 
belong to nato east germany is now part of the warsaw pact 
military alliance moscow would like to see a neutral nation formed 
by the two germanys 
kohl said events were shaping the drive toward unification he 
said 115000 to 116000 east germans moved to west germany in 
january and february 
we want this process to be stopped he said we want these 
people to stay home we want them to see their future over there

president daniel ortega on thursday 
warned of civil war if the ussupported contra rebels fail to 
dismantle before april 25 when the administration of violeta 
barrios de chamorro is to take over the government 
in a speech before thousands of people celebrating international 
womans day ortega repeatedly spoke both of leading the 
sandinistas as an opposition force and about the sandinistas 
demand that the contras demobilize in the transition period 
there is a calm like those before the storm ortega said 
and we have the obligation of avoiding being swept away by the 
tempest of civil war popular insurrection violence 
ortega said thousands of weapons are in the hands of the 
people who he said would be willing to defend themselves against 
the contras 
since the feb 25 elections there have been reports of weapons 
being distributed to civilians nationwide and of people being 
trained and organized as sandinista paramilitary groups called 
sovereignty battalions 
the situation in the country is very tense very 
complicated ortega said 
he said contras continue to attack in nicaraguan territory 
with the complicity of the honduran government and the united 
states government 
about 10000 contras most of their force are based in 
honduran jungle camps near the nicaragua border 
contra leaders have said they will not lay down their arms and 
return to nicaragua before presidentelect chamorro is inaugurated 
and the sandinista peoples army and the interior ministry give 
over control of those two institutions to the new government 
thats something ortega repeatedly has said the sandinistas will 
not do 
i am convinced that in the same way that the contras say they 
will not disarm that the people are willing to grab the arms to 
finish the contras once and for all ortega said 
he also said he was not in a position to turn over to mrs 
chamorros united national opposition alliance the weapons now in 
the possession of the army and interior ministry 
i dont have any weapons to give up because the weapons belong 
to the people ortega said in his speech 
he also said the army and interior ministry troops considered a 
parallel army are what will give all nicaraguans security 
uno leaders have accused the sandinistas of funneling money into 
foreign bank accounts ortega however said in his speech that 
citizens have been cleaning out their accounts because of the 
increase in tension and uncertainty 
there were millionaire sums deposited in accounts but as the 
situation has become tense people have been withdrawing their 
accounts ortega said

at least three men killed a 
truck driver on thursday in a machinegun attack claimed by the 
irish republican army and a protestant paramilitary group said it 
killed an ira backer the day before 
two witnesses to wednesdays attack leveled charges of collusion 
between security forces and protestant paramilitary groups in this 
british province 
the ira unit in east tyrone said its members shot the 
unidentified driver who delivered construction materials to police 
stations and military bases it said his employer ignored warnings 
to stop working for security forces 
the ira has targeted construction firms in an effort to prevent 
repairs on bomb damage it inflicts on security bases the victims 
employer henrys of magherafelt earlier lost a director in a 
shooting and a manager in a bombing 
police said the man was driving a concrete mixer when he was 
attacked outside donaghmore village near dungannon 40 miles west 
of belfast the machinegunners fired at least 30 shots before 
fleeing in a car police said 
the outlawed protestant ulster volunteer force on thursday night 
claimed responsibilty for killing sam marshall 31 on wednesday 
shortly after he left the royal ulster constabulary base in lurgan 
20 miles southwest of belfast 
supporters of the mainly roman catholic ira identified marshall 
as a member of its legal political wing sinn fein he was 
imprisoned from 1976 to 1982 for terrorist offenses police said 
two survivors of the wednesday night shooting accused police of 
cooperating with the gunmen 
tony mccaughey 31 and colm duffy 22 said they were under 
police surveillance when the gunmen attacked 
the royal ulster constabulary denied the allegations of 
collusion with the killers 
the three men were out on bail after being charged with illegal 
possession of ammunition one of the bail conditions was that the 
three had to report to the lurgan police station twice a week on 
saturdays and wednesdays 
mccaughey and duffy said the bail conditions were known only by 
the police and their lawyers 
neither of us will be reporting back to the station 
mccaughey said we would prefer to go back to prison than go back 
to the ruc station 
duffy said a car followed them to the police station wednesday 
night and was seen again just after the attack he said it was an 
unmarked police car 
we want stevens to carry out the investigation and to come up 
with some answers to who owned it duffy said we have 
absolutely no qualms about talking to stevens 
john stevens deputy chief constable of cambridgeshire was sent 
to northern ireland in september to investigate a series of leaks 
from the northern ireland police force of lists of ira suspects 
the leaks stirred a furor in the province the implication being 
that secret intelligence is falling into the hands of protestant 
gangs and helping them choose assassination targets 
irish foreign minister gerry collins on thursday called for an 
investigation into the new charges of collusion 
duffy said soon after leaving the police station wednesday 
night two masked men armed with rifles pulled up in a red rover 
car and fired 40 shots 
police said marshall was killed instantly mccaughey and duffy 
were unhurt 
the british domestic press agency press association quoted 
unidentified sources as saying marshall had been warned by police 
recently that he was on a protestant paramilitary hit list 
the ira is fighting british rule in northern ireland it seeks 
to unite the predominantly protestant province with the 95 percent 
catholic republic of ireland under socialist rule

writers were within their rights to withhold their bylines under 
their current contract 
the labor dispute comes at a particularly sticky time for the 
postdispatch which is no longer the only daily newspaper in town 
thanks to last falls startup of the nonunion st louis sun by 
ingersoll publications co of princeton nj 
postdispatch unions have urged a boycott of the sun which on 
tuesday denied admittance to goodrick an attorney and a reporter 
from the st louis labor tribune 
the postdispatch is owned by pulitzer publishing co 
management and the union are at odds over a number of issues 
including the deletion of a 4 percent costofliving increase that 
was offered in a company proposal the union rejected last september 
the latest company offer would also deny sick leave to employees 
who contract illnesses through immorality 
other unresolved issues include a lengthy managment rights 
clause maternity leave union rights employee drug testing and a 
twotier wage system which would pay new hires lower wages 
goodrick said the union has not threatened a strike against the 
newspaper 
at this point weve tried to be very restrained and 
responsible he said our objective is to get an agreement a 
strike is one of the tools for that but we think there are other 
steps we can take before that 
id like to reach an agreement in the next couple of days 
goodrick said but if we dont we cant just sit around twiddling 
our thumbs we have to do something to motivate people

regardless of which war it was or how many years 
have passed the grunts the infantrymen whove fought in a war 
dont readily talk about it with those whove never been in one 
a common reason only other grunts can possibly understand what 
combat is like it takes an uncommon interviewer to draw these men 
out yet avoid a succession of war stories that become routine 
through repetition 
but bill moyers somewhow accomplishes the former while largely 
avoiding the latter in his from dday to the rhine an 
oldsoldier special which the public broadcast service is showing 
sunday 
in it moyers just a boy when world war ii ended takes a 
memorylane visit to the battlefields of france belgium and 
germany with a group of us army veterans who fought there in the 
last two years of the war 
now grayhaired and in their 60s and 70s most move slowly and 
talk quietly occasionally chuckling or grinning about the odd 
sometimes funny little memories that any war produces 
they recall the guy who spent a halfhour each day trimming his 
mustache the sound of gears cranking as a german tanks turret 
turned to fire and the army pilot who showed up at the normandy 
beachhead not long after dday in june 1944 he stood out he was 
all dressed up in his classa uniform 
its a thoughtful impressionistic show in which recollections 
of war are illustrated with old newsreels of combat or contrasted 
with scenes of today like french kids clambering over a sherman 
tank now a museum piece 
a rolling tour of the bloody past the program always is headed 
toward the rhine with occasional pauses for interviews in little 
towns or gently rolling fields where men once killed each other and 
where cows now peacefully graze 
the veterans include a medal of honor winner from san antonio 
texas jose lopez now 79 he won the nations highest military 
award when he was over 30 which is ancient for a combat 
infantryman 
but hed lied back then and said he was two years younger why 
he wanted to be a paratrooper why he shrugs so we could meet 
the enemy as soon as possible and get the thing over 
the vets inspect a museum and a graphic tapestry of a much 
earlier war the bloody battle of 1066 in which william the 
conquerers troops went to war in normandy 
moyers later asks one of the soldiers of world war ii a 
battalion surgeon then how the tapestry strikes him the doctor 
gently smiles 
it makes him think he says about how endless war is how 
its a part of everbodys life war and death and men fighting 
men 
there are the expected visits to us military cemetaries but 
also a stop at a neatly trimmed german military cemetery in france 
where the grave of one soldier who fought for hitler is simply 
marked ein deutscher soldat 
at times this 90minute documentary filmed and produced by 
david grubin drags a bit several stories go on too long they 
could have been edited more tightly 
it might have made a better show had moyers brought in a few 
german exgrunts heard their stories gotten their perspective 
they visit the old battlefields too 
but from dday to the rhine is a good effort flaws and all 
and what strikes you most about it is how quietly humble and 
plainspoken most of its old soldiers are 
their manner their lack of iwasthere bombast may make a few 
oldtimers think of ernie pyles musings on life after the war 
thoughts that the famed war correspondent wrote in france in august 
1944 
submersion in war does not necessarily qualify a man to be the 
master of the peace he wrote all we can do is fumble and try 
once more try out of the memory of our anguish and be as 
tolerant with each other as we can 
 
elsewhere in television 
today still is trying harder nbcs oncedominant today 
show last week was in second place again for the ninth straight 
week it trailed abcs good morning america in the ratings 
gma averaged a 45 rating today which had nbc sportcaster 
dick enberg subbing for the genial bryant gumbel from tuesday 
through friday got a 38 while cbs this morning had a 28 
each ratings point represents 921000 homes

for years people have squirreled away 
personal possessions in those impersonal rows of attached 
garagelike structures thrown up alongside the nations roads and 
highways 
we dont like to throw anything away said charles floss a 
representative of the west virginiabased parkline industries which 
manufactures buildings used by selfstorage facilities 
were all pack rats floss said 
these days selfstorage operators are benefiting from a new 
breed of pack rats businessmen theyre doing it by offering 
computerized surveillance systems climatecontrolled units 
facsimile machines and even landscaping around what one industry 
expert calls a bunch of garage doors 
in the past security and lighting were not big issues and the 
quality of management was not good said jim chiswell vice 
president of the sovran group in williamsville ny which manages 
33 selfstorage facilities nationwide 
now the focus is shifting to professional chiswell said 
were not just selfstorage operators were storage 
consultants 
oldtimers in the industry say self storage started about 40 
years ago but they dont agree on the exact location 
its believed the industry started in texas but theres 
evidence of it in florida and utah in the 1950s said hardy good 
publisher of mini storage messenger a trade magazine based in 
phoenix ariz 
self storage now is a 4 billionayear industry with an 
estimated 20000 of the structures spread across the country vs 
3500 a decade ago some have even sprung up in canada europe and 
australia 
some claim theyve become such an integral part of american life 
that you can watch the change in seasons by the comings and goings 
at selfstorage facilities 
in the spring you see trailers pull up with snow blowers and 
skis and out comes the back yard furniture chiswell said in 
new york city you can judge the change in seasons by women taking 
out huge garment bags of clothes that they cant store in their 
small apartments 
selfstorage operators say in the early years most business 
came from people storing household goods kitchen appliances 
sports equipment and assorted gadgets they never used but couldnt 
bear to throw away 
as people moved into apartments town houses and scaleddown 
houses that lacked basements garages and even attics the 
selfstorage industry boomed 
theres a primary need people have to store things floss 
said we dont like to throw anything away 
thats no longer the case says john logan a sociology 
professor at the state university of new york at albany 
people hanging on to things is what shows up more in peoples 
garages and attics keeping things for a long time for nothing more 
than personal attachment is a luxury logan said 
what you find in selfstorage facilities is more basic things 
people need to keep he said when people are actually paying 
for space theyre more likely to keep only stuff they need 
this has resulted in an evolution of sorts for selfstorage 
operators who say theyre gradually making the transition toward 
commercial storage 
selfstorage facilities are more sophisticated than their 
earlier counterparts offering climatecontrolled and builttosuit 
units lighted units pickup and delivery and copying machines 
climate control is necessary for people wanting to store 
computer equipment and business records and larger units can serve 
as miniwarehouses floss said 
cheap space is another selling point for example a 10 feet by 
10 feet space goes for an average of about 80 a month about a 
third the price of comparable commercial space in many areas 
selfstorage companies rent units ranging from the size of 
closets to spaces large enough for a car boat or a miniwarehouse 
the 10by10 space the most popular size is big enough to hold a 
few rooms of efficiently stacked household furniture 
or 30000 firecrackers thats what federal agents seized 
recently at a selfstorage facility in kent wash included in the 
haul were 10000 m1000 firecrackers each nearly equal to a half 
stick of dynamite

chase untermeyer says that being george bushs 
chief talent scout is rather like painting the golden gate 
bridge 
once you finish the job you have to start in at the other end 
and start painting it again says the 44yearold white house 
personnel director and bush protege 
from a crowded office in the west wing of the white house 
untermeyer and his staff assemble resumes and sort out the winners 
from the alsorans in the quest for presidential appointments 
with white house chief of staff john sununu the affable 
houstonraised and harvardtrained untermeyer makes the final 
recommendations to bush on 3500 jobs untermayer and his staff 
also ride herd on cabinet and agency heads in filling more than 
2000 other political posts 
untermeyer once a political reporter said in a recent 
interview that its sort of a rule of thumb in this business 
that every time you make an appointment you earn nine enemies and 
one ingrate 
there also has been some criticism of the speed with which the 
white house has filled appointments last september democrats on 
capitol hill accused bush of operating a swisscheese 
govermnent riddled with highlevel vacancies 
untermeyer defends the administrations performance saying that 
background checks are timeconsuming and that the criticism would 
have been far worse if we had slamdunked people into jobs 
i personally dont mind being the target of a bad news story 
or two in 1989 if we are spared in 1990 and thereafter a series of 
news stories about some cretin or boob or otherwise incompetent 
individual who was named to office by george bush he told the 
heritage foundation last year 
you can bet that the folks writing those stories would not 
say on the other hand the white house in 1989 acted with 
admirable speed in putting this fine citizen into office said 
untermeyer 
in the interview untermeyer said the opposition turned up the 
heat on the pace of appointments essentially because we had 
denied the democrats the socalled sleaze issue 
practically none of our nominees has come under any 
controversy whereas that happened all the time under president 
reagan 
however several bush nominees to major posts were defeated or 
forced to withdraw including john tower as defense secretary and 
william lucas as the justice departments civil rights chief 
in addition fred bush the chief fundraiser for the 1988 bush 
campaign but no relation to the president was rejected as 
ambassador to luxembourg after coming under scrutiny for contracts 
he had received from reagans department of housing and urban 
development 
untermeyer was executive assistant to thenvice president bush 
during the first two years of the reagan administration he then 
spent five years in the pentagon as a deputy and then assistant 
secretary of the navy for manpower and reserves responsible for 
recruiting training health and other matters for the navys 
600000 sailors and 200000 marines 
untermeyer who said he longs to leave personnel work and 
return to a policy rule has stayed off the social circuit 
partly to avoid being buttonholed by job seekers 
he routinely logs 12 to 14hour days customarily getting by on 
four or five hours of sleep a night 
at his desk on a recent sunday afternoon untermeyer 
acknowledged that 1989 had its grim points but it had its 
upside too i also met the woman that im now engaged to marry 
he and diana c kendrick 27 executive assistant to c boyden 
gray the white house counsel plan an october wedding 
it was a white house romance you might say that we met on a 
sunday working on paperwork which is exactly whats happening 
now

evangelist billy graham is holding a big evangelistic rally in 
berlin this saturday intended as the first ecumenical gathering of 
east and west germans in more than 30 years 
he says churches played a key role in overturning the autocratic 
east german government last fall 
this has given new hope to people he said in an interview 
before flying to berlin this week but the aftermath he said 
seems to have left a spiritual vacuum 
theres a spiritual vacuum and spiritual hunger both in east 
and west germany he said people want something to believe 
in 
graham said that like many others he had been astounded by the 
rapid swing away from monolithic communism last year by east 
european countries i didnt think it would happen in my 
lifetime he said 
it could bring about a long period of peace in the world 
graham said ending the us soviet soviet conflict and nuclear 
balance of terror that has endangered humanity for 45 years 
we ought to go to salt 10 and eliminate all these terrible 
weapons of mass destruction the chemical weapons and other weapons 
now on the drawing board he said theyre frightening 
church leaders both in west germany and longcommunist met with 
graham in berlin last month urging the joint rally at a time when 
german christians live between fear and hope 
peaceful demonstrations by the east germans last fall toppled 
the prolonged rule of communist boss erick honecker and installed a 
mixed interim government pending march 18 elections 
prospects also are being dicussed for reunifying the nation 
divided between east and west since world war ii 
church leaders on both sides said in a statement issued by 
grahams office that in the last decades billy graham has built 
bridges of understanding between east and west by encouraging many 
people to come to a living faith 
the rally which many thousands from both sides of the border 
are expected to attend is to be saturday afternoon at the plaza in 
front of the reichstag building next to the brandenburg gate 
im a little bit afraid i dont want to be political and 
must not say one word with the slightest hint of politics graham 
said ill just preach the gospel and tell of christian values 
and morals 
graham 72 has previously preached both in east and west german 
cities as well as in all the other eastern bloc countries except 
bulgaria and albania 
he met with german pastors in berlin last december on his way 
back from a visit with pope john paul ii and said the germans felt 
people there needed an interpretation of recent events from a 
christian point of view 
they said they wanted a religious figure someone wellknown 
and accepted on both sides to provide some christain word on what 
has happened graham said i told them i just didnt have the 
strength to to do all that i was determined to say no but after 
listening to the east berliners tell me why i had to come i had to 
give in after all theyve been through 
graham said the east german churches played a major part in the 
governmental turnabout there 
people didnt feel free to meet except in the churches he 
said thats where they met and began their marches 
however he said after the berlin wall came down last nov 9 a 
sort of lethargy has come over the churches 
they tell me people now are deserting the churches he said 
this is particularly a spiritual problem 
in the political transition going on in eastern europe he said 
religion is basic to freedom man is first of all a worshipping 
creature he has to have something to believe in a basis for 
life 
graham said that in his numerous meetings with soviet leaders in 
the past he had insisted that propagandizing atheism wouldnt 
work it goes against human nature people want the freedom to 
believe in god to worship god

twentytwo years after covenant house started 
sheltering children from the streets the nations largest program 
for young runaways is struggling with another troubled life its 
own 
torn by allegations of sexual impropriety that forced the 
resignation of its charismatic founder the 87 millionayear 
operation has postponed some expansion plans and steeled itself for 
a drop in donations 
the scrutiny also has revealed criticism from a new source 
social welfare professionals who question its style of service 
critics agree covenant house helps fill the urgent need of 
sheltering homeless youths each night about 2000 runaways sleep 
in its centers in six us cities latin america and canada 
but some say covenant houses main thrust shortterm stays in 
institutional settings represents triage rather than treatment 
others complain that its roman catholic philosophy precludes sex 
education that could help stem the spread of aids 
some critics accuse its counselors of harassing homosexual 
youths and others charge the organization with institutional 
arrogance saying it virtually ignores other privately operated 
programs 
they fill the hallways and then call the press in and say 
theres kids on the floor we need more money said marion 
reidel clinical director at the emergency shelter a much smaller 
program for runaways in new york theyre notorious for not 
networking with the other programs in town 
since december a series of former clients has stepped forward 
to accuse covenant houses 62yearold founder the rev bruce 
ritter of sexual misconduct 
one youth claimed to have received money and gifts from ritter 
and covenant house has conceded trying to start him off in a new 
life by giving him the identity of a dead 10yearold boy without 
asking the dead boys parents ritter has denied wrongdoing but 
franciscan officials ordered him to take a leave of absence while 
they investigated on feb 27 he resigned the next day 
prosecutors said they had found questionable financial 
transactions at covenant house but none meriting prosecution 
covenant house gets 95 percent of its funds from private 
donations relying on appeals written by ritter and mailed monthly 
to 800000 past or potential supporters 
donations fell recovered and fell again as the allegations 
surfaced and subsided now covenant house officials are uncertain 
and deeply worried about the effect of ritters departure 
theres a real question as to whether covenant house will be 
able to grow and expand as it has or whether covenant house will 
be put into a period of retrenchment for some time said frank 
macchiarola who served briefly as acting president before 
resigning also on feb 27 because of friction with the 
organizations board 
covenant house operates large shelters in new york new orleans 
houston los angeles fort lauderdale fla anchorage alaska and 
toronto and orphanagestyle shelters in mexico honduras 
guatemala and panama 
plans to establish a shelter in washington are on hold but 
expansions in los angeles and new orleans are proceeding and a 
counseling center in dallas just opened 
despite the organizations longstanding practice of spending 
almost all of each years income covenant house officials said its 
finances are basically sound and no cutbacks are envisioned 
but the criticism of its programs appears likely to continue 
we have this kind of mixed feeling toward the covenant 
house said fred griesbach head of the coalition for the 
homeless 
while the rate of aids is astronomical among runaways 
greisbach said covenant house does not encourage using condoms to 
stem the diseases spread but instead counsels abstinence 
theyre not going to deal with it in what i think is a 
rational way he said we think its counterproductive you 
need to talk about condoms about abortion about birth control 
that goes beyond abstinence 
macchiarola said covenant houses handling of birth control and 
sex education is guided by principle the policy we follow is 
church policy he said we have to proceed off what we think is 
right 
covenant houses main purpose is to provide emergency shelter 
for a few days or weeks to runaways who often return to the street 
but critics say smaller more intensive programs have more success 
helping youngsters find a new life 
young people are supposed to be in a familytype 
environment reidel said theyre not supposed to be 
institutionalized they dont belong in large buildings 
covenant houses manhattan shelter in tawdry times square 
fails to remove youngsters from the dangers and temptations of 
street life and is too big for effective individual counseling she 
said 
the manhattan shelter was designed for 250 youths but often 
sleeps more than 300 some on rollout pads in lounges macchiarola 
said covenant houses reluctance to refer youths elsewhere reflects 
its opendoor policy 
the moment our people think they should refer kids elsewhere 
is the moment weve taken a different attitude he said 
after a brief stay twothirds of the shelters visitors return 
to the street where some meet an early death from drugs disease 
or violence the others return to families find their own place to 
live or enter longterm residential programs 
covenant house also operates a 150bed longterm residence in 
new york and other organizations run similar smaller programs 
and there are advantages to that smallness said susan 
mullgrav special projects director at the city department of youth 
services its more personalized its more individualized 
yet given the scope of the problem with an estimated 100000 
to 300000 homeless runaway youths nationwide mullgrav and thers 
concede large shelters do fill the most urgent needs a bed a meal 
and someone to talk to 
covenant house has been necessary in spite of their 
programmatic problems because theyre one of the few agencies that 
has that number of beds said reidel it is better than 
sleeping on the streets

brazil is mired in its worst 
economic crisis as it takes the final step to full civilian 
democracy with the inauguration thursday of its first popularly 
elected president in 30 years 
he is the conservative fernando collor de mello who likens 
himself to a hunter with a single bullet left and a hungry tiger 
coming at him 
the tiger is inflation and collar says he has to kill it with 
one quick shot or be devoured 
but dont worry he adds confidently im an excellent 
shot and i wont miss 
inflation rose 56 percent in january and a record 73 percent in 
february with the projection of an annual rate of 71000 percent 
march is expected to be worse 
collor will replace president jose sarney who took over from a 
military government in 1985 but failed in a number of attempts to 
halt the nations economic and financial slide 
brazilians have lived for decades with inflation but have been 
protected by costofliving indexing of wages and bank accounts 
experts now say however such government protection may be at an 
end 
hyperinflation marks the demise of this socially exclusive 
elitist economic model it is the state of bankruptcy of the 
government edmar bacha an economist and former head of the 
governments census bureau said in an interview 
today bacha added this country of 150 million is what he calls 
a belindia a belgium and an india side by side 
the belgium half resembles a developed country with the western 
worlds eighthlargest economy and thirdbiggest trade surplus a 
world leader in the production of coffee sugar orange juice 
soybeans cotton and iron ore a producer and exporter of 
sophisticated goods such as computers cars aircraft and rockets 
the india part is marked by the third worlds largest foreign 
debt put at 114 billion 7 million street children 20 percent 
adult illiteracy sprawling shantytowns and epidemics of dengue 
malaria and yellow fever 
however the consensus is that inflation is the countrys most 
serious problem 
collors credibility and the viability of his government 
depend on how he deals with inflation said luiz antonio de 
medeiros president of the powerful metalworkers union all the 
other problems he will face income distribution the foreign 
debt poverty etcetera are secondary 
the economy has gone haywire at the hands of inflation 
in a rio department store a barbie doll costs more than 
februarys monthly minimum wage of 2004 cruzados 70 a linen 
shirt costs as much as six 3speed blenders identical knapsacks 
cost 600 cruzados 2150 at one store and 2400 cruzados 86 at 
another in the same shopping mall 
investors seek shelter in gold and illegal blackmarket dollars 
or in an extremely shortterm financial market known as the 
overnight which today pays 105 percent a month 
consumers rush to stock up on food clothes and electrical 
appliances before prices go up again 
violent crime is increasing and brazilians look anxiously to 
neighboring argentina where runaway inflation has led to the 
looting of supermarkets and military unrest as a example of what 
might be in store for them 
people are frightened said graciela treiyer the manager of 
an upscale leather goods boutique in rio de janeiro the 
government says inflation is 70 percent but we know its more 
things are just out of control 
an estimated 1 billion a month is leaving the country and 
muchneeded foreign investment has dried up 
one cant plan one cant contract one doesnt know how much 
supplies are going to cost or anything else with inflation so 
ridiculously high said william meissner president of the 
american chamber of commerce in rio de janeiro 
a growing number of brazilians are seeking financial safety in 
the united states western europe or japan 
we are not an island of prosperity with hyperinflation we 
are more like a continent of despair said sen roberto campos a 
former planning minister and exambassador to the united states and 
england 
some even are asking whether brazil was better off under the 
repressive military regime that ruled from 1964 to 1985 
sure weve got democracy now but what good is it when beans 
are 38 cruzados 137 a kilo said jose de oliveira a tax 
office worker who moonlights as a chauffeur at a car rental agency 
collors remedy is to drastically cut government spending he 
has promised to lay off workers close government ministries drop 
subsidies and sell off stateowned companies trade barriers will 
be lowered and protection for domestic industry eliminated 
however economists say brazil also will have to sharply reduce 
interest payments on its billiondollar foreign debt which amount 
to 12 billion a year 
collor says he will order the federal police to arrest the tax 
evaders middlemen and speculators he holds responsible for 
inflation 
the blame falls on the elite who take advantage of the 
economic and financial disorder to make more and more money in 
detriment of the vast majority of the population he told a 
recent news conference 
collor is banking on his popularity among the poor masses and 
his credibility as a popularly elected president sarney was 
chosen by an electoral college in december collor defeated 
socialist luis inacio lula da silva by 4 million votes in brazils 
first free presidential election since 1960 
however analysts say collor will meet stiff opposition from 
congress labor unions and the rich who risk losing longheld 
privileges 
the elite will use the unions economist bacha predicts 
inefficient and protected industries will claim theyll be forced 
to fire employees if the government allows imports its the same 
argument americans are used to hearing in relation to japanese 
competition 
congress is another stumbling block collors national 
reconstruction party founded just last year has only 26 seats in 
the 570seat legislature da silva his adversary in the election 
has pledged to form a parallel government with other leftists 
to oppose the new administration 
militant labor unions which backed da silva have threatened to 
strike if the government holds down wages or lays off workers 
collor doesnt have support in the organized sectors of 
society said eli diniz a political scientist at the university 
research institute of rio de janeiro he will have to negotiate a 
social pact to give his measures legitimacy or try a populist 
mobilization 
brazilians who have seen four antiinflation plans collapse in 
as many years under sarney are torn between hope and skepticism 
the people are rooting for collor and want to help but they 
will demand results said psychologist sigrid marques da silva 
castro 
in a february survey by the respected ibope polling institute 
68 percent of those questioned said they had faith in collor 
i hate to say it but im optimistic like a brazilian is 
optimistic said meissner of the american chamber of commerce 
brazils like a baby with a fever youre convinced the baby is 
going to die and two hours later its playing outside

floor in a rare moment of quiet 3yearold steven wallenda ii 
scribbles on a pad of paper he scrawls two overlapping circles and 
a long tail like a drumstick 
this is my mommys lung transfer he says matteroffactly 
tapping the the circles and this is her fake leg he adds 
outlining the tail 
running the pen from the circles to the tails end he says 
when you have cancer it goes real deep all the way down to your 
foot 
sixteen feet above deftly maneuvering a halfinch steel cable 
his mother 21yearold aerialist angel wallenda is oblivious to 
the worldly explanation of her illness 
she and her husband steven 34 gently traverse the wire 
testing its spring and memorizing the tricky parts in anticipation 
of the evenings event the final performance of the wallendas as a 
family and angels last chance to work on a high wire 
her husband the last of the clan still performing the feats 
that made the wallenda family famous set up the recent benefit at 
mansfield university to help defray the costs of his wifes ongoing 
battle with cancer the cancer a particularly belligerent breed 
forced the removal of her right leg below the knee in 1987 then 
parts of both lungs in 1988 
but it wasnt long before angel was back on the wire

educated guess 
doctors at city of hope medical center in duarte calif plan 
to operate thursday to remove the cancer that has reappeared on

heres proof that academy voters pay little 
heed to what a movie costs one of the contenders for best picture 
was produced for 3 million another for 8 million 
contrast those figures with the 50 million spent on batman 
which earned one academy award nomination for art direction 
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has a history of 
ignoring the cost factor in rewarding the best achievements of the 
film world marty with a budget of 343000 won as best 
picture of 1955 beating such bigbudget films as picnic 
mister roberts and love is a manysplendored thing 
the 1million rocky knocked out its rivals in 1976 other 
lowbudget winners chariots of fire 1981 and platoon 
1986 
oscar loves the cinderella story and this year it stars the 
irishmade drama my left foot 
we managed to get the picture made out of blind ignorance 
admits producer noel pearson we were two weeks into filming when 
we lined up the financing he had been a close friend of the 
films subject harddrinking christy brown who became an 
acclaimed artist and writer in spite of the cerebral palsy that 
virtually immobilized him 
pearson started the film with his own money plus 100000 pounds 
sterling apiece from a friend and from irish television everyone 
concerned with the film including star daniel daylewis worked 
for bare minimum an art gallery scene was filmed in pearsons own 
house he borrowed costumes from his theatrical company 
the film was made for just under 3 million depending on the 
rate of exchange said the producer we managed to do that 
because everybody was committed it was triumph of spirit over 
financing the latest estimate for the worldwide gross of my 
left foot 50 million 
driving miss daisy also demonstrates that a films budget is 
immaterial at awards time it was budgeted at 8 million amazing 
in view of the 20 million average for mainstream hollywood films 
how could richard and lili zanuck produce such an inexpensive 
film it is basically a twocharacter story and the two stars 
jessica tandy and morgan freeman are not highpriced dan aykroyd 
is but he took a lesser salary to play the straight role of the 
old womans son his change of character paid off with a nomination 
for supporting actor 
australian bruce beresford directed driving miss daisy on 
locations in and around atlanta and the zanucks tightly budgeted 
the locations the film about the long relationship between a 
cranky widow and her patient chauffeur has proved a huge hit both 
in awards nine oscar nominations the most this year and at the 
box office 603 million after 12 weeks in release 
two other nominees for best picture had average budgets and drew 
mixed reviews but their offbeat subjects somehow connected with 
the moviegoing public 
field of dreams invited audiences to swallow a whopper that 
an iowa farmer would build a baseball diamond in his cornfield 
where longdead major leaguers would play 
many critics spurned the fantasy but ticket buyers were 
attracted by its message of hope and the star power of kevin 
costner filmed for a reported 16 million field of dreams 
amassed a gross of 63 million 
dead poets society looked like an impossible sell the title 
seemed a turnoff although robin williams was a hot draw in the 
wake of good morning vietnam he played a relatively brief 
role as the english teacher who inspires students at a 1960s boys 
school to think creatively most of the screen time in the 20 
million film was devoted to the cast of unknown teenagers 
reviewers objected to williams as a latterday mr chips and 
found the tragic ending out of keeping with the rest of the film 
but dead poets society directed by another australian peter 
weir sold 94 million in theater tickets 
born on the fourth of july proved that film audiences are 
still concerned with the consequences of the vietnam war the film 
was the result of a long collaboration between oliver stone whose 
platoon was drawn from his own experiences in the war and ron 
kovic wounded veteran and antiwar activist tom cruise one of 
todays biggest draws in films and strong reviews helped 
contribute to the success of born on the fourth of july 597 
million in 10 weeks 
stone directed the film in the philippines which doubled for 
both vietnam and mexico and dallas which represented kovics home 
town of massapequa ny despite the complex production which 
ranged from battlefields to national political conventions with 
12000 extras the cost was reportedly 18 million

theres a halfcentury gap in age between 
jessica tandy and michelle pfeiffer who find themselves in 
reluctant competition for hollywoods highest prize the academy 
award 
their roles could scarcely be more different tandy as the 
cantankerous southern dowager in driving miss daisy pfeiffer 
as the smoldering chanteuse in the fabulous baker boys they 
are generally considered the frontrunners in the race for best 
actress 
but i wish the academy awards ended with the nominations 
instead of making us adversaries observes tandy when they 
pick the nominations they pick the best of the crop its a pity 
they have to single them out as one winner and four losers 
also considered the best of the crop are pauline collins 
the wry rebellious housewife of shirley valentine jessica 
lange the lawyer defending her father in music box and 
isabelle adjani rodins tragic model in camille claudel 
only lange is a previous oscar winner she was chosen best 
supporting actress of 1982 for tootsie 
for tandy 80 an academy award would add to the many honors she 
has achieved since her broadway debut in 1930 she has won three 
tonys for a streetcar named desire as the original blanche 
dubois the gin game and foxfire the latter two with 
husband hume cronyn the tv version of foxfire brought her an 
emmy 
the londonborn actress had no qualms about undertaking the part 
of miss daisy i like big roles i like to be there all the 
time 
at 31 michelle pfeiffer is cresting a career that might have 
been relegated to sexpot parts such as her early carhop in 
hollywood knights she proved herself as an actress in 
scarface the witches of eastwick married to the mob 
and dangerous liaisons for which she won a supporting actress 
nomination last year 
the fabulous baker boys was only a middling success but 
pfeiffer proved a striking presence from the moment she auditioned 
for lounge pianists beau and jeff bridges with more than you 
know 
concerning her newfound success the actress told an interviewer 
she knew it wouldnt last and she would again be offered boring 
parts ive had enough of those to know that i never want to do 
it again i mean id rather go back to checking groceries 
collins had the advantage of playing her nominated role scores 
of time in the london and new york theater though in a different 
form shirley valentine as a play was a onewoman show she won 
the tony for her bravura performance 
born near liverpool collins spent most of her career in the 
english theater and television americans know her as the 
downstairs maid in upstairs downstairs 
the film shirley valentine required her to swim nude in the 
aegean with tom conti no problem its not a big deal in europe 
nudity said the actress 49 my only qualms were that i wished 
i was younger and thinner but i aint 
lange applied her usual thoroughness as the chicago lawyer in 
music box studying court cases and reading briefs 
ultimately you can observe behavior but when you get down to 
playing the role it all has to come from the character she 
observed 
the actress has a reputation for willfulness on movie sets but 
for music box she relied entirely on the director costagavras 
i had such respect and confidence in costa that i didnt feel 
the need to get in there and make my opinions known she said 
except for driver quartet and the infamous ishtar 
adjani has appeared exclusively in european films and with great 
distinction her performance in francois truffauts the story of 
adele h brought her first academy nomination for best actress in 
1975 she has appeared in classics in the french theater as well as 
such films as nosferatu le vampire possession and 
antoinetta 
though most filmgoers consider her french adjani was born in 
bavaria in 1955 the daughter of a turkishalgerian father and a 
german mother she spoke german until moving to paris for her 
school years

its not often that someone tampers with a winner especially a 
winner backed by numbers 
but the folks at chevrolet while seeing their 2door s10 
blazer chalk up record sales years in 1988 and 1989 had their eyes 
on other numbers too numbers that showed baby boomers reaching 
their 40s and 50s this decade becoming the countrys most affluent 
chunk of people and most importantly buying 4door sport utility 
vehicles 
thus was born the 1991 chevrolet s10 4door blazer joining 
chryslers jeep cherokee the mitsubishi montero toyota 4runner 
nissan pathfinder and isuzu trooper in the fastgrowing 4door 
sport utility field another sport utility the ford explorer is 
due out this year 
the test s10 4door blazer readily showed why its a worthy 
competitor 
the blazer was spunky with its 43liter fuelinjected v6 
mated to a 4speed automatic transmission even in tough offroad 
conditions in 4wheeldrive the blazer was powerful developing up 
to 160 horsepower i was impressed by its good traction mud 
gravel and water flew as the big uniroyal steelbelted radials bit 
into the earth yet i felt perfectly at home with no worries 
antilock brakes at all four wheels a standard feature made 
for solid stops and visibility was tops thanks to the vehicles 
tall profile 
the dashboard was especially hightech for a truck it was 
digital with sloping bits of bright blue indicating the oil 
pressure and remaining fuel 
another nice feature was the styling of the rear seatbelt 
connectors they were located in recessed cutout areas in the 
bench seat which means a person can slide across easily no ouch 
from hitting stiff protruding seat belt holders 
the armrest between the front bucket seats was deep offering 
substantial storage room up further nearly under the dash was 
the gearbox for switching from 2wheeldrive to 4wheeldrive 
this shiftonthefly feature was easy and an adjacent diagram 
of the blazers innards confirmed you had moved into 4wheeldrive 
when the diagrams front two wheels lit up in bright orange the 
gear shifter for the automatic transmission is located on the 
steering column 
as in most sport utilities there was considerable road noise 
and there was a low rumble when the vehicle was in 4wheeldrive i 
also felt some jiggles while riding and because the vehicle had a 
higher center of gravity than a car it had some body roll and sway 
the 4door blazer is 6 inches longer than its 2door sibling 
and offers 25 percent more cargo space a longer wheelbase adds 15 
more inches of rear seat hip room too making the rear seat quite 
comfortable for even three adults 
chevrolet looks to produce up to 108000 of the 4door blazers 
in 1990 total blazer production is 180000 spokeswoman mary 
mcelyea said sales of the vehicles began in midjanuary 
recent buyers of 2door blazers have had a median age of 38 and 
annual household income of 50000 she said most had whitecollar 
jobs with 39 percent being college graduates 
seventythree percent were men and most were married for 
onethird of the buyers the blazer was their first purchase of a 
new vehicle she said 
the 1991 s10 4door blazer is base priced at 16905 that 
compares with the jeep cherokee 4door with sixcylinder engine and 
automatic transmission at 16405 the isuzu trooper with v6 
engine and automatic transmission at 14849 the 4door mitsubishi 
montero with v6 and automatic transmission at about 16400 and 
15500 for a toyota 4runner with v6 and automatic transmission 
consumer reports magazine said 198388 model s10 blazers with 
two doors and v6 engines ranged between average and much worse 
than average in reports of owner trouble a chevrolet spokesman 
responded that the plants producing blazers are among the highest 
quality plants in the company

mae timbimboo parry will never forget 
nights as a child at her grandfathers feet while winter winds 
moaned outside she listened in horrified fascination as he spoke 
of the bear river massacre 
six decades later parry the 70yearold tribal secretary to 
the northwestern shoshone traces her lifelong mission to reveal 
the truth about the armys slaughter of as many as 400 indians in 
1863 to the hours spent listening to yeager timbimboo one of the 
few survivors 
he was the best story teller he believed in passing his 
stories on to his grandchildren and he expected them to memorize 
all of them hed tell them over and over and over again parry 
said 
we sat on the floor and grandpa sat on the chair every few 
minutes he would ask are you awake are you awake she 
recalled 
and we would say yes if one of us fell asleep grandpa would 
just get up and leave so we stayed awake he wanted us to know who 
we were and where we came from 
yeager 12 when the soldiers attacked survived and lay still in 
the bloodspattered snow until a soldier realized he was alive the 
soldier let him live 
he must have been spared for this purpose if my grandfather 
had died it the truth may have been lost said parry who has 
passed yeagers stories on to her five children and more than a 
dozen grandchildren 
the account of the attack by the man who launched it col 
patrick connor was one of pitched battle and classic military 
envelopment against wellarmed and entrenched warriors a view 
reflected to the abiding anger of the northwestern shoshone on 
a historical marker commemorating the battle of bear river 
in the years after she first heard the bear river stories parry 
became a repository for the tribes oral history on the massacre 
eventually she blended her grandfathers stories with others in 
what is considered by historians to be an authoritative 1976 
monograph on file at the utah state historial society in salt lake 
city 
parry acknowledges that her lifes quest stems not only from the 
impact of her grandfathers stories but also from the debt she 
feels to the hundreds of kinfolk in unmarked graves 
on countless trips to the massacre site as a child and later an 
adult she said she felt an unseen presence 
there have been many times as a family we have gone up there 
and walked parry said we would talk about what happened 
this was where the soldiers came from this is where somebody swam 
the river this is where the lady dropped into the water and her 
baby drowned 
you really get a feeling that youre among them and they are 
with you she said you just feel you are not alone

mikhail s gorbachev promised the people a better 
deal and has brought them far greater freedom during five years in 
power but the shortages and discomforts that make daily life a 
struggle have grown worse 
the main thing is to make life better for people he told a 
western interviewer a few months after becoming communist party 
chief in march 1985 there is no goal more important to us 
five years later the soviet union and its former eastern 
european satellites enjoy a stunning degree of democracy 
president gorbachev has eased the fear of war he has freed 
political prisoners from jails and psychiatric hospitals 
little remains of communism in the communist partys new program 
except the spirit and methodology 
the party no longer enjoys unquestioned authority but 
gorbachev a master of the apparatus through which he rose is on 
the verge of gaining broad new powers in a strengthened presidency 
in the matters of personal comfort most important to the average 
citizen however gorbachev has not delivered 
food housing and consumer goods are in even shorter supply than 
when he took command of the kremlin nearly half the people 
questioned in a poll published this month said daily existence was 
harder than in 1985 
five years later the drudgery of renewal continues and isnt 
yet close to its objectives the proreform moscow news commented 
gorbachevs economic program has been a series of mistakes and 
halfmeasures he has delayed painful but critically needed steps 
like reform of a price structure that has no relation to costs and 
wastes resources 
only in recent weeks have legislators approved laws allowing 
farmers to lease land and individuals to own factories and other 
means of production even ardent supporters of those laws say they 
do not go far enough 
meat butter and other foods are rationed in many places in 
moscow a city of 9 million people 125 million are on waiting 
lists for better apartments 
jewels of imperial architecture are crumbling repairmen and 
snowplows seem to have vanished 
the leader knows it in a speech to the communist party central 
committee last month gorbachev acknowledged further disruptions 
of the consumer market a growth in shortages and lines and a fall 
in the purchasing power of the ruble 
we hoped to mount the peak of the crisis in 1989 but recent 
events have shown no change for the better he said 
on march 11 1985 when gorbachev followed the old ailing 
leadership that had presided for two decades there was much that 
needed fixing 
his predecessors left a nation near bankruptcy its 
infrastructure worn out and people dispirited it had plenty of 
missiles but no hot water in twothirds of the rural hospitals 
in the repressive soviet union of 1985 however few dared 
openly say anything was wrong 
gorbachev changed that under the banner of glasnost or 
openness he has introduced greater official honesty and an 
improved intellectual life 
last year he installed the beginnings of democracy with the 
first competitive elections and first working parliament in 70 
years in february he won agreement from the communist party 
leadership for a multiparty system 
newspapers and television which once provided endless paeans to 
the sacrifices of world war ii soldiers and hero laborers have 
been transformed 
the iron curtain has disintegrated once forbidden books have 
been published including alexander solzhenitsyns the gulag 
archipelago 
in 1990 it is expected that 8 million soviet citizens will 
visit the outside world where gorbachev has had his greatest 
success and may be more popular than at home 
reformers across eastern europe attributed their courage to act 
and their success to the soviet leaders promise of 
noninterference and his indications that the time for change had 
arrived 
by setting the satellites free and agreeing with the united 
states to eliminate mediumrange missiles he helped lessen the 
danger of war nato has reduced border patrols recognizing the 
diminishing risk of an attack by the warsaw pact 
on the horizon are treaties on reducing longrange nuclear 
weapons by 50 percent and withdrawing hundreds of thousands of us 
and soviet soldiers from central europe 
even soviet leaders more conservative than gorbachev regard such 
achievements with pride 
we have lifted the real threat of nuclear war said yegor k 
ligachev the leading conservative in the politburo when asked by 
reporters march 4 to name the successes of gorbachevs five years 
we were on the brink he said one step more and we could 
have found ourselves in a nuclear catastrophe 
regional and ethnic tensions are another matter ethnic 
conflicts have taken 500 lives in two years and nationalism arising 
from the new political freedom threatens to dismember the soviet 
union 
lithuanians talk of declaring independence this year perhaps as 
early as this month 
activist kazimieras uoka told the lithuanian review the soviet 
union was so sick that by summer the situation in russia will 
be such that our secession will be hardly noticeable 
gorbachev responded to the threat of anarchy by seeking strong 
new presidential powers including the right to declare war and 
suspend legislatures in the 15 republics 
after local and regional elections march 4 he told reporters 
the new powers were necessary because stability and order were 
breaking down he said disintegration of the soviet union would be 
a greater upheaval than chinas cultural revolution of a generation 
ago 
parliament member yuri afanasiev who is forming a more radical 
reformist opposition to gorbachev said the soviet leaders problem 
is a shortage of public trust not of power 
nobody listens afanasiev said in a television interview he 
said gorbachev talks about the need to transform a centralized 
empire into a voluntary union of independent nations but has not 
acted on it 
misgivings are increased by the fact that gorbachev has promised 
legal guarantees of human rights limits on communist party power 
and fully competitive democracy for nearly two years but has not 
translated the pledges into law 
many citizens were shocked by his televised fingerwagging 
tirade against radical reformers who denounced his proposed 
stronger presidency as dangerously close to dictatorship 
whatever his powers the hardest part of gorbachevs job lies 
ahead 
coal miners frustrated by miserable living conditions are 
talking of renewing their strike when the weather warms 
hoarding increases citizens fear civil violence and ethnic 
attack 
people are tired gorbachev told reporters on election day 
people can see how difficult it is to get the good things of 
life and how much more difficult it is under confrontation and the 
arms race problems of housing health care and the environment 
need to be solved

terry briggs has babysat housesat and 
dogsat learning along the way she couldnt just sit 
for eight years briggs worked at general motors corps buick 
city in flint birthplace of the largest us automaker in october 
1987 the company said she no longer had a job and that it probably 
wouldnt rehire her 
since then shes been trying to piece together a life on 
layoff a life of odd jobs overdue bills daytime tv handouts 
handiwork boredom and anxiety just when i think its not going 
to work somebody comes up with something said briggs 42 whose 
cheeriness belies her nagging nervousness about living from hand to 
mouth 
she is among thousands of americans who have been laid off from 
jobs in auto assembly component and supplier plants which are 
struggling because of a recession in the auto industry 
factories have closed work has dried up and people like briggs 
in the nebulous category of too young to retire and too old to find 
a new job are scrambling to pay bills 
for briggs working for gm has come back to haunt her 
the job search hasnt been good for me she says im a 
fat 40 yearold female and a general motors employee she says 
some potential employers shy away from gm workers because they 
are too spoiled they want money they want benefits 
pay and benefits can be worth more than 40000 a year to 
autoworkers who have some overtime many of those laid off often 
balk at the prospect of looking hard for a job that pays less 
barbara jubar a clinical social worker with catholic social 
services in flint where many autoworkers are unemployed says they 
often resist training for another profession 
why should i train to do something that is onethird of what i 
made before she says quoting a common response among her 
clients i think its just a reluctance to think more longterm 
clarence cobb of detroit was among 1700 workers who lost their 
jobs feb 2 when chrysler corp shut its famous jefferson avenue 
plant once a symbol of chryslers might but now relegated to the 
scrap heap hes a 22year oldtimer with chrysler but a youngster 
in the layoff ranks 
it hasnt set in yet cobb 42 says his wifes salary from 
her job as a district court supervisor in detroit helps pay the 
bills 
cobb watches a lot of tv soap operas are his favorites hes 
going to be a grandfather soon and thats sure to take up some of 
his time he said 
cobb might return to work next year when chrysler begins 
training employees to build a sportutility vehicle at a new 
factory rising beside the hulk of the jefferson avenue plant but 
his job prospects are uncertain 
its a waiting game right now cobb says 
for many autoworkers the waiting game is nerveracking partly 
because they dont know how long their money will last 
cobb briggs and others on layoff were eligible for unemployment 
and other payments including a supplemental unemployment benefit 
tailored for autoworkers and designed to yield up to 95 percent of 
their preovertime takehome pay with so many layoffs this year 
however the sub funds are shrinking 
i never got 95 percent of my wages briggs says they 
dropped it down to 75 percent the day i was laid off because of the 
strain on the sub fund i was ok while i still had the sub 
when her sub allotment ran out in april 1988 briggs says she 
filed for bankruptcy protection 
that was the most difficult thing ive ever done she says 
the humiliation just doesnt go away 
studies have documented increased cases of alcoholism drug 
abuse and family problems among laidoff workers mainly because of 
the stress a job loss puts on individuals and their relationships 
with loved ones 
to understand the process that a laidoff employee goes 
through you must understand that our jobs and our selfconfidence 
are very intertwined says dr nyk bartkiw director of 
outpatient services at a community mental health program in 
michigans genesee county where many laidoff autoworkers live 
the first reaction is that im a nobody i dont have a job 
anymore bartkiw says we have to help them get over that 
first step you are more than a job 
briggs has performed a constant juggling act trying to channel 
whatever income she can scrape together toward the final notice 
bill with the earliest due date 
she still owes money on her 1986 chevrolet nova a car that sits 
with a blown engine her apartment rent is supplemented by general 
assistance welfare money and her landlady is lending a hand with 
utility bills 
she used to sew but her assemblyline work led to carpel tunnel 
syndrome a handweakening affliction in factory workers who 
perform the same tasks repetitively clothesmaking is out 
other people pay some of her bills often on what amounts to a 
barter system if she paid the bills in cash it might endanger her 
benefits which include 99 a month in food stamps and assistance 
with her 200amonth payments for heart and diabetes medicine 
i have a friend who has a dog and when she goes away i go 
housesit and dogsit for her and then she pays my rent or 
whatever briggs says thats kind of hard because shes a dear 
friend and i really dont like her doing that 
briggs has given of herself too she recently helped deliver 
christmas baskets to the needy with other members of a masonic 
lodge 
man i was ashamed of myself for even worrying about me 
because every house i went to was worse than the last one she 
said i think the thing is that nobody cares about them there 
are a few of us who do but not nearly enough

five years time enough for a world to change years enough for 
a newborn to sprout into girlhood nights enough for a man caged 
to sink into dark despair and then sink deeper still 
five years ago this friday on march 16 1985 associated press 
correspondent terry a anderson was shoved into the back seat of a 
mercedes and driven off into the black hole of beirut he remains a 
hostage today longestheld of eight american and 10 other western 
hostages in lebanon 
anderson now 42 last spoke to the world 16 months ago in a 
videotape released by the moslem extremists who hold him in a gray 
track suit cleanshaven he looked stronger than in the past but 
the spirit was bleak 
as the end of my fourth year approaches he said i find 
it difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high 
now the end of his fifth year approaches 
hopes so often crushed are rising again andersons tireless 
sister peggy say recently returned from a middle east journey 
with ap officials and spoke of a feeling of hope rumors of 
secret talks are flying through europe the president of iran the 
nation believed to hold sway over the lebanese kidnappers says he 
feels the hostage crisis is moving toward a solution 
somewhere in the rubble of lebanon anderson and the 17 others 
are imprisoned apparently held in small rooms chained often 
blindfolded deprived of sunlight deprived of faith lost in a 
hopelessness that at one point drove anderson to pound and bloody 
his head against a wall 
the meaning of five years of inhuman captivity each year a 
neareternity is beyond imagining but a simple measure of time 
can be taken 
on the day anderson was kidnapped mikhail gorbachev was in his 
first week of power in moscow ronald reagan had not yet met a 
soviet leader marcos and duvalier still ruled chernobyl still 
operated the challenger astronauts still drilled for their fateful 
flight 
while anderson endured his pains wars yielded to peace enemies 
embraced as friends history remade the worlds landscape while 
anderson lay in chains his second daughter sulome was born and 
grew into a lively 4yearold a girl deprived of a fathers warmth 
the senior hostage is also the youngest hostage and perhaps 
the bestknown among an american group that also includes 
scottishborn poetryloving academic thomas sutherland accountant 
and moslem convert joseph cicippio adventurous schoolmaster frank 
herbert reed sometimewriter edward tracy journalism professor 
alann steen business teacher and diabetic robert polhill and 
math professor jon turner 
anderson the reporter now locked up by moslem militants in a 
makeshift dungeon had once huddled with fearful moslems in other 
basements under christian bombardment there to tell their story 
to the world 
a harddriving selfassured journalist the aps chief middle 
east correspondent covered lebanons endless tragedy with grit and 
aplomb jazz blared from his automobile tape deck as he dashed from 
crisis to crisis 
covering lebanon sometimes meant having to drive through one 
war to get to the war youre covering he explained 
anderson brought a broad reporting background to lebanon he 
covered desegregation in kentucky the struggle for democracy in 
south korea the fight for racial justice in south africa 
not taciturn but judicious with words not unfriendly but 
serious about the task at hand anderson took on journalism with 
the discipline of a marine his onetime calling i like where 
im at he told a nephew who interviewed him for a school 
assignment 
a day after anderson was grabbed off a beirut street by four 
gunmen an anonymous caller reported he was being held by islamic 
jihad islamic holy war an underground shiite moslem group 
that had begun kidnapping westerners a year earlier 
six other americans and britons were already held by islamic 
jihad and other shadowy bands in lebanon four eventually were 
freed the two others died in captivity 
in the months that followed other americans frenchmen britons 
and west germans one by one sometimes two by two were 
kidnapped by extremists trying to strike out at western governments 
they considered to be always on the wrong side of the mideasts 
many conflicts 
islamic jihads goal was a trade its hostages for 17 islamic 
jihad comrades imprisoned in kuwait for bombing the us and french 
embassies there otherwise it said it would execute its 
captives 
but president reagan vowed no concessions no deals 
periodically the hostage impasse seemed to move toward 
resolution as when negotiations on iranian assets frozen in the 
united states made major progress last year but the low points far 
outnumbered the high 
in june 1986 cancerstricken glenn anderson jr made a 
videotape appeal from his sickbed for his brother terrys freedom 
four days later he died four months earlier their father glenn 
also was lost to cancer terry anderson apparently has never been 
informed of either death 
in november 1986 the irancontra affair exploded it was 
disclosed the reagan administration had arranged secret arms 
shipments to iran via israel that apparently led to hostage 
releases the resulting political firestorm shut down this 
backchannel dealing 
one of the hardest blows came in january 1987 anglican church 
official terry waite a longtime mediator in the crisis dropped 
from sight in beirut a victim himself of the kidnappers 
at one point islamic jihad mocked those who dared hope 
what everyone expects soon is a mirage assumed to be water by 
a thirsty man it said in a statement in mid1988 
life as a hostage according to the freed men is a relentless 
monotony punctuated by moments of terror and dread 
they were moved periodically blindfolded and at night 
sometimes they were confined alone sometimes thrown into cramped 
rooms together they were chained to walls or fixtures and were 
allowed only brief minutes in a bathroom each day 
they fought the maddening monotony through exercise talk and 
reading of a battered bible and a handful of other overworked 
books sometimes they cried but they also dreamed prayed planned 
terry was always creating things his farm his restaurant 
his house said the rev lawrence jenco a released hostage 
terry anderson is a unique and gifted person 
the freed hostage who last saw anderson frenchman marcel 
fontaine released in 1988 remembers the americans courage 
when i was a little sick and dispirited fontaine recalled 
i said to terry that im not afraid to die but i dont want to 
die here and have them throw my body into the sea 
anderson thought a moment he said and replied i dont want 
to die anywhere 
family friends colleagues and other supporters gather friday 
in ceremonies in washington and elsewhere to reaffirm their faith 
in the eventual release of anderson and the other hostages 
and they will pray that anderson himself after five pitiless 
years may still find some faith and comfort in his own worn 
bible perhaps or even in his jailers koran the holy book whose 
sura 94 reassures the tormented that verily with every 
difficulty there is relief

the forest service said 56 of the 122 national forests with 
commercial timber sale programs returned more money than they spent 
last year those forests were primarily in california washington 
oregon arizona new mexico and the in the southeast 
total operating expenses for the timber sales program were 
7767 million in fiscal 1989 the service said 
the report said the kinds of wood harvested in different forests 
account for much of the regional variance in sales 
a possible explanation for the decline in region 8 southern 
is that a large amount of its timber volume is used for pulpwood 
the pulpwood market did not experience a large increase in value in 
fy1989 as did sawtimber the report said 
alternatively region 10 alaska experienced a large 
increase this is predominately due to improved markets and the 
renegotiation of timber sale contracts with the major purchasers on 
the tongass national forest 
through these renegotiated contracts significantly higher 
revenues are now being obtained the forest service said

question to which administration president 
bushs or ronald reagans do the following three statements apply 
more than 500 insolvent or nearinsolvent sampls are open for 
business losing an estimated 14 million a day 
beleaguered regulators hint that the administrations bailout 
probably wont be enough 
what was thought to be a crisis resolved is once again becoming 
a political liability for the president 
the answer is both the savings and loan crisis is back 
that was the situation in the waning days of the reagan 
administration in 1988 and that is the situation now six months 
after president bush signed historic sampl legislation in a rose 
garden ceremony declaring these problems will never happen 
again 
two years before president reagan had expressed similar 
sentiments when signing a 108 billion industryfunded rescue of 
the sampl insurance fund as it turned out that fell far short of 
the amount needed now its becoming clear the 50 billion provided 
by the bush bill wont be enough either 
bush got high marks from thrift executives editorial writers 
and even democrats for offering a comprehensive plan to handle the 
sampl crisis within three weeks of taking office and pushing it 
through congress by august 
but so far he is getting low marks on execution of the plan 
congressional democrats who had been somewhat muted because of 
the involvement of four democratic senators in the lincoln sampl 
scandal are criticizing the administration more forcefully 
savings and loans have reemerged as a political problem the 
democrats are back and the name of the game is assessing blame 
said kenneth a guenther executive vice president of the 
independent bankers association of america 
its not quite at the white house gate but its getting 
there he said 
the resolution trust corp a new bailout agency run by the 
federal deposit insurance corp has moved swiftly to put failed 
thrifts under government management by the end of february it had 
seized 382 institutions with 192 billion in assets 
but it has moved slowly in disposing of the institutions 
selling or closing only 49 mostly smaller thrifts it has sold or 
collected on about 25 billion in assets but its had a tough time 
getting rid of bad assets problem real estate and sour loans 
what we have is a bunch of rotting sampls out there and a bunch 
of assets being managed in a passive way said bert ely a 
financial analyst in alexandria va 
the longer the delay the more costly the cleanup he said 
after recent appearances before hostile members of congress 
administration officials promised to double the resolution pace to 
50 sampls a quarter 
to speed real estate sales the rtc released a 3000page 
inventory of 30000 properties anyone interested can obtain the 
list for 50 by calling 18004310600 
in the meantime analysts congressional critics and bailout 
officials themselves offer at least three reasons for the slow 
start 
first the sheer size of the task is unprecedented never before 
has the government tried to sell so much to so many 
whats happened in a nutshell is that congress has set up an 
organization overnight with responsibilities larger than 
citicorp the nations largest bank said rep jim leach riowa 
a member of the house banking committee 
second the cumbersome structure of the bailout apparatus 
designed to ensure the taxpayers money is spent properly is prone 
to delay 
an existing agency the fdic supervises the rtcs work but 
another layer of administration the rtc oversight board controls 
the purse strings and policy of the bailout its led by the 
treasury secretary and includes the housing secretary and federal 
reserve board chairman 
tension between segments of the bureaucracy erupted in public 
last month when daniel p kearney chief staff officer of the 
oversight board quit amid reports he resented interference from 
the treasury department 
congressional democrats also are upset because the white house 
has not filled many positions in the regulatory bureaucracy 
most notably the administration still has not found a permanent 
replacement for m danny wall as director of the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision he resigned three months 
ago under fire for his handling of lincoln savings and loan 
association irvine calif the nations largest sampl failure 
three of the top seven officials serving under wall have left 
their positions are vacant 
a third factor in the rtcs lackluster start was uncertainty 
over bailout funding beyond the 50 billion provided by last 
summers bill rtc officials temporarily need much more money until 
they can sell the assets of the failed sampls 
the administration did not approve such working capital 
until late february only weeks before the rtc would have had to 
stop work for lack of cash 
it is borrowing the money through the treasury after democrats 
on the house ways and means committee blocked the administrations 
plan to exclude the borrowing from the federal budget deficit 
another funding crisis looms private analysts complain the 
government even with working capital must spend far more than 50 
billion to cover failed thrifts losses 
in a tack reminiscent of the reagan administrations stance in 
1988 bush administration officials say the money will last until 
after congressional elections this fall 
similarly reagan officials in 1988 had insisted until after the 
presidential election that the 1987 rescue of the sampl insurance 
fund was adequate 
figures supplied to congressional banking committees at the end 
of january by rtc chairman l william seidman who also is fdic 
chairman suggest that 74 billion is probably a better estimate of 
the losses than 50 billion 
they can only go higher the industry as a whole is still 
deteriorating compiling losses of a magnitude not seen since the 
great depression

the industry lost 115 billion in the first nine months of last 
year on track to break the record 134 billion loss for all of 
1988 
meanwhile stringent new financial standards in last summers 
legislation are forcing savings institutions to shrink 
the rules require thrifts to back their lending with more of 
their owners money most cant raise the capital as a result 
they must trim their balance sheets 
excluding interest 74 billion in deposits poured out of sampls 
last year at first because the industrys problems had shaken 
customers confidence later because thrifts sold assets and no 
longer needed the deposits 
big is no longer beautiful in the savings and loan business 
said analyst kenneth h thomas of miami 
those that cannot downsize successfully an estimated 180 to 
250 will fail bringing the governments caseload to nearly 600 
institutions by the end of this year analysts predict fewer than 
2400 solvent sampls will remain down from 3200 only three years 
ago 
the survivors have little reason to welcome 1990 weak real 
estate markets have spread from the oilproducing states of texas 
oklahoma louisiana and colorado to nearby arizona and to the 
northeast particularly new england 
the demise of drexel burnham lambert inc and the nearcollapse 
of the junk bond market also threatens a handful of big thrifts 
a month ago centrust savings bank of miami became the first sampl 
to fail because of junk bond losses it was followed by imperial 
savings association of san diego which had the industrys 
secondlargest junk bond portfolio 
thomas said columbia savings and loan association of beverly 
hills calif with the largest junk bond holdings around 4 
billion is shaky too 
congress which produced the sampl bill in what for it was a 
headlong rush of six months likely will spend 1990 evaluating its 
handiwork rather than fixing it 
proposals for change abound and theyll get an airing this 
month in hearings before the house banking subcommittee on 
financial institutions chaired by rep frank annunzio dill 
builders complaining they cant get loans are pushing for 
relaxation of new restrictions on the amount of money an sampl can 
lend to one borrower thrift executives want congress to ease rules 
forcing them to concentrate more heavily in mortgage lending 
rep bruce vento dminn introduced a bill that would abolish 
the rtc oversight board sen bob kerrey dneb would make the 
rtc independent of both the administration and fdic 
reps charles schumer dny and leach want to do away with 
the thrift office and divide its duties 
sen richard bryan dnev submitted legislation to forbid 
financial institutions from selling their uninsured debt to their 
depositors 
debate also is starting on what many economists say is the most 
glaring deficiency of the legislation its failure to curb federal 
deposit insurance 
with accounts guaranteed to 100000 depositors have no reason 
to withdraw their money even when sampl and bank owners make wildly 
speculative investments the economists argue 
the treasury department congress general accounting office 
the fdic and trade groups all are working on proposals for reform 
unprodded by the administration however most legislators have 
little appetite for dealing with savings and loans during an 
election year 
those watching from the wings say the administration would be 
wise to press for change now rather than waiting until next year 
i think this administration still has the opportunity to 
distance itself from this problem said attorney john hawke a 
former federal reserve regulator now in private practice 
but its not going to be very long before it becomes their 
problem hawke said and at the next election all the voters 
are going to remember is the bush administration failed to clean 
it up

a republican congressman from upstate new york 
once was nominated for vice president on the grounds that he used 
to drive president lyndon b johnson nuts by that kind of test 
rep richard a gephardt may yet wind up on a democratic ticket 
the house majority leader seems to be the democrat most likely 
to succeed at provoking president bush and his lieutenants he did 
it again the other day with a speech accusing bush of visionless 
norisk leadership that has left foreign policy adrift at a crucial 
time of change 
the complaints built on democratic themes the bush camp had 
rebutted before but never so vehemently as when gephardt delivered 
them 
gephardt proposed increased us foreign aid to foster democracy 
in eastern europe and said washington should offer direct 
assistance to the soviet union in food and through loans and 
insurance for private investment 
bushs spokesman dismissed it all as pure politics said he 
didnt know whether the president had even seen the criticism and 
compared gephardt to maxwell smart the hapless spy in an old 
television comedy series that shows up in latenight reruns now 
can you believe he wants to raise taxes on the american people 
to give money to the soviet union said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater called the gephardt complaints just a political war 
general old political stuff but nothing substantive 
gephardt whose quest for the white house in 1988 peaked and 
crashed early in the season is becoming the point man for the 
relatively placid democratic opposition 
bush inadvertently broadcast his own annoyance last fall after 
gephardt led the house opposition to his capital gains tax cut i 
tell you im displeased with gephardt the way he made it so 
really kind of personal the president said in a telephone 
comment he didnt realize was on the air at a congressional press 
gallery 
the displeasure of a president can be a merit badge for an 
opposition leader sen barry goldwater said he chose the 
littlenoted rep william miller of new york to run for vice 
president in 1964 because he had driven lyndon johnson nuts in 
the past with his sharp tongue it didnt work johnson ignored 
him 
as majority leader and at 49 the man in line to succeed house 
speaker thomas s foley some day gephardt has renounced 
presidential candidacy although pledges like that dont 
necessarily last forever his leadership role and his secure 
missouri house seat he won his seventh term with 63 percent of 
the vote have built him a secure platform for challenges to the 
republican white house 
democrats have not spared bush their criticism but much of it 
has been lowkey gephardt was not in a speech at the center for 
national policy last week he escalated it into a frontal assault 
on bushs leadership vision and motives gephardt said bush bases 
his decisions on polls and politics 
the bush foreign policy is a policy adrift without vision 
without imagination without a guiding light save precious public 
opinion polls gephardt said but if he wanted to president 
bush could seize the day and marshal the american people into a 
mighty army marching for change 
there is no substitute for presidential leadership the 
congressman said 
gephardts proposals for increased aid to eastern europe and for 
measures to help the soviet economy were not revolutionary most 
had been discussed before and on some the real question is not 
whether it is when furthermore farm belt republicans were 
leading promoters of subsidized us wheat sales to the soviet 
union and that certainly is a form of aid 
the debate on aid to the infant democracies of eastern europe is 
over how much money to offer them and where to find it in a 
strapped federal budget gephardt argues as do many other 
democrats that bush should take the funds away from the pentagon 
why does he want to spend billions of dollars on armaments 
aimed at communists who dont want to be communists any more he 
asked 
that question and others like it will be major lasting issues 
as a divided government tries to deal with drastic change at home 
as well as abroad while gephardt may have made his point by 
raising them and by toughening the democratic challenge to bushs 
do polls risk nothing leadership it wound up as a oneman 
show he didnt try to line up other democrats in advance few were 
signing on afterward and some rejected the politically risky idea 
of aid to moscow 
bush and the republicans are not alone in keeping watch on voter 
opinion democrats can read polls too

call it skid wars the scientific quest for 
better ways to clear ice off roads is focusing on cracking it 
sabotaging it sandblasting it and even zapping it with microwaves 
roads that resist the tight grip of an ice patch are under 
study and under one strategy motorists would loosen ice just by 
driving on it 
the research is part of a 65 million program administered by 
the national research council an arm of the congressionally 
chartered national academy of sciences it is seeking alternatives 
to spreading salt which can pollute the environment and eat away 
at autos and prying ice with snowplow blades which takes lots of 
energy and chews up pavement 
scientists are aiming to design machines that remove ice while 
moving at 20 miles an hour as well as pavements that shed ice more 
easily results are preliminary but researchers say they see some 
promise 
one basic problem they face is that ice sticks tightly to a 
road both by chemical bonding and by interlocking with tiny 
crevices in the pavement 
ice binds more tightly to pavement than to itself which is why 
a snowplow blade can shear off the top of an ice patch without 
removing the layer that grips the road said albert wuori of the 
keweenaw research center of michigan technological university in 
houghton 
thats where the microwaves come in they can pass through ice 
and warm the pavement melting the thin layer of ice that touches 
the road surface 
all we want to do is destroy that bond between the ice and 
the pavement which then makes the rest of the ice very easy to 
remove wuori said trying to melt all the ice would take too 
much energy to be practical 
an experimental device with about 30 times the power of a home 
microwave oven has loosened ice from experimental pavement in the 
laboratory said jack monson of research associates of syracuse 
ny 
the process is too slow to be practical researchers hope that 
treating pavement surfaces with microwaveabsorbing materials will 
make them warm up faster and hasten the melting 
another strategy would use spikes to punch partway into icy 
patches and make them crack highpressure injections of antifreeze 
into the cracks might then be able to pry ice off the road said 
kazuhiko itagaki of the us army cold regions research and 
engineering laboratory in hanover nh 
if not injections of a deicer might weaken the ices grip on 
the pavement and make later removal easier wuori said 
research so far has shown pretty much success with a single 
spike plunger and it is now focusing on multiple plungers wuori 
said the holes would have to be punched inches apart he said 
still other approaches are more direct a sandblasting device 
has blown away strips of ice a halfinch thick in laboratory tests 
said mark osborne at the keweenaw center but it works much too 
slowly he said 
it might take multiple sandblasters or a rotary system like the 
brooms on street sweepers to cut a wide enough swath for practical 
use he said perhaps a sensor could let an iceremoval truck 
adjust the height of its nozzles according to the thickness of the 
ice so the spray will not harm pavement he said 
a similar device that uses liquid instead of air to carry 
abrasives has cut through four inches of ice without trouble said 
michael ohadi at the michigan school again a key challenge is to 
make such a system cover ground faster 
researchers have not given up on snowplow blades if they can 
work with less energy smaller trucks can be used saving on the 
sticker price and fuel consumption wuori said 
one energysaving goal is to make the bottom of the ice slab 
crack continuously ahead of the moving blade wuori said computer 
calculations are testing different blade shapes and angles of 
attack on the ice 
other studies focus on new kinds of pavement that would help 
break the grip of ice or prevent the stubborn bond from forming 
one plan involves motorists the weight of their vehicles might 
be deflected to shear ice off pavement computer calculations at 
the midwest research institute in kansas city mo show that 
patterns of ridges in the road might do the trick wuori said 
a similar strategy involves mixing bits of rubber with asphalt 
so that the pavement surface will bend a small fraction of an inch 
under the weight of a vehicle that action could tear ice away from 
the pavement wuori said 
researchers also are getting early glimmerings of success 
from mixing icefighting additives into asphalt before it is laid 
as pavement said bernard baum of springborn laboratories in 
enfield conn 
if the asphalt can resist strong bonding from ice icy patches 
will be easier to remove he said 
to be practical this special asphalt would have to work against 
ice for years the hope is that a continuing supply of additives 
would be available at the road surface brought up by migrating 
water and exposed as the surface wears down 
future work may find additives that can be spread on existing 
pavement which would be cheaper than mixing them in before laying 
asphalt he said so far the work has concentrated on asphalt 
which covers 90 percent to 95 percent of pavement in this country 
he said 
baum noted that to be useful icefighting additives would have 
to be environmentally safe and not weaken the pavement 
and one other thing 
you cant put anything on there that would be slippery he 
said

when babies fail to form trusting 
relationships with their mothers psychologists have long offered a 
quick answer blame mom 
now a new view is taking hold some infants especially fussy 
ones put up a barrier that has nothing to do with their mothers 
skills or compassion 
in short the new wisdom holds blame baby too 
the mother is off the hook at least in part said dr 
carroll e izard 
delving into infants emotions has become a rich field of 
research developmental psychologists are busy sorting out 
emotionally responsive infants from stoic ones tracking down the 
source of emotional responses inside their young heads and even 
measuring which side of babies faces break into the brightest 
grins and the deepest frowns 
izard a researcher at the university of delaware is 
challenging the traditional notion that mothers are entirely 
responsible for building secure relationships with their babies 
he has found that babies who respond strongly and negatively to 
noises and other stimulation in short the very fussy ones are 
also most likely to develop poor bonds with their mothers 
previous research puts the onus on the mother said izard 
im saying this is a twoway street characteristics of the 
infant contribute as well 
his study conducted on 81 infants found that those who cried 
the most who demanded the most attention and who put up the 
biggest fuss during mildly stressful situations during their first 
months of life also turned out to be the least secure at 13 months 
of age 
he and his colleagues found they could use an electrocardiogram 
to predict which newborns would go on to have insecure bonds with 
their moms those with the strongest vagal tone a measure of the 
influence of the brain on the heart later produced the highest 
insecurity scores on psychological tests 
in izards study a quarter of the babies formed poor bonds with 
their mothers other research has shown that such children are more 
likely to have psychological problems when they reach school age 
such as extreme shyness and difficulty playing with other 
youngsters 
the latest work suggests that the seeds for these social 
problems are sewn in a babys genes at birth 
izard outlined his findings recently at a meeting of the 
american association for the advancement of science in new orleans 
other researchers at the meeting described other ways of delving 
into the earliest emotions of childhood 
for instance dr tiffany field of the university of miami 
medical school has tested babies willingness to mimic grownups 
facial expressions of happiness anger sadness and surprise about 
20 percent it turns out are great apers bursting into wide grins 
and gaping surprise in response to adult cues another 20 percent 
stay stonefaced while the rest fall somewhere in between 
expressivity is something that is individually different right 
from the start she said 
dr nathan a fox of the university of maryland has found that 
different emotions are seated in different sides of babies brains 
he measured youngsters brain waves on eegs among other things he 
found that when babies smiled at their mothers the left side of 
their brains was usually more active while the right side seemed 
to be busier when they cried in anger 
he believes that learning more about how the frontal lobes of 
babies brains mature will provide important clues to understanding 
the development of differences in personality

poking through cold southern indiana mud for 
the delicate 10000yearold remains of an elephantlike creature 
was a rare thrill for a group of scientists who struck pay dirt 
it was rainy and this was a fresh construction site so you 
had awful mud it was an awful place to be working said donald 
cochran of the ball state university anthropology department who 
was among the scientists and volunteers who spent four days 
unearthing the remains of a prehistoric mammoth 
but it was a very exciting find he said 
the nearly complete skeleton buried 10 feet deep was 
discovered by a bulldozer operator preparing the way for a resort 
along the ohio river 
a call to the indiana state museum in indianapolis piqued the 
interest of ron richards the museums curator of paleobiology he 
immediately organized the excavating team 
what they found the remains of a shaggy 10foottall creature 
believed to be a jefferson mammoth will keep researchers busy for 
months richards says 
the most unusual thing was to have an investigative team go 
into action when it was found richards said these things were 
found for years and years and someone would just take a shovel and 
dig it up 
studying the mammoth where it died will yield unusual 
information he said for example screening soil around the 
mammoth revealed the teeth of a heather vole a mouselike creature 
now found in canada 
volunteers and department of natural resources employees filled 
out the crew of about a dozen people who worked to unearth the 
skeleton in january 
it was like digging through wet pie crust richards said 
the bones that were in good shape will be cleaned preserved and 
put on display at the museum probably in about a year he said 
a lot of the bones were very disintegrated he said it 
was hundreds of little pieces stuck together with mud 
it was rare to find such a complete skeleton he said although 
hundreds of mammoth teeth and bones have been found in indiana 
the find was disappointing in some ways however 
cochran was looking for signs that humans might have come in 
contact with the mammoth he came up empty 
theres been no good human association with them found east of 
the mississippi river he said 
the paleoindians wandered the area at the same time and their 
counterparts in the west are known to have hunted mammoths no 
evidence that mammoths were hunted has been found in the east he 
said 
but the investigation isnt over richards said the property 
owner two rivers inc is allowing scientists the time they need 
to continue their work expected to be finished by april

mighty enough to keep vampires at bay garlic 
has for thousands of years been considered a wondrous substance 
used to treat all sorts of ailments 
its real powers are less certain though studies continue into 
the possibilities that garlic can help lower blood pressure and 
cholesterol act as a painkiller and an antibiotic and help fight 
cancer 
some studies of garlic and heart disease included too few 
people said nancy ernst a nutritionist with the national heart 
lung and blood institute of the national institutes of health 
she also noted that because of garlics odor its hard to do a 
doubleblind study in which participants dont know whether 
theyre getting the real thing and some studies used high doses of 
garlic 10 or more cloves a day 
i think it would be a problem to suggest that people could get 
adequate cholesterollowering just by adding garlic to their 
diet ernst said 
i think we just really dont know she said i think it 
would be useful to have an answer so people dont think it has 
magical powers 
several researchers are studying the effects on cancer of garlic 
and onions or allium vegetables 
animal and in vitro experiments indicate that compounds in 
allium vegetables inhibit several types of tumors and decrease 
tumor growth and proliferation according to a study in the 
journal of the national cancer institute last year which found a 
reduction in stomach cancer risk among people in a province of 
china who regularly ate garlic and onions compared with those who 
did not 
michael wargovich of the md anderson cancer center in houston 
said the research so far clearly supports that the protective 
chemicals from foods will have to be part of the diet throughout 
life 
eventually he said food manufacturers may produce designer 
foods that include high doses of food components found to prevent 
cancer but for now he said he and his wife just try to follow 
the guidelines that are out there right now 
we dont know even as researchers how much is enough he 
said 
regardless of medical uses garlic enhances the flavors of many 
foods a raw clove has just four calories garlic contains almost 
no sodium or fat but has some fiber and protein 
it can make some people ill of course most people dont eat 
but a little although roasted garlic heads have become a popular 
appetizer roasting or any cooking reduces garlics pungency 
its not certain how cooking garlic affects its medical potential 
raw cloves can be sliced or smashed or forced through a press 
whole cloves can be sauteed to flavor oil but if they burn they 
taste bitter they also can be kept in vinegar to flavor it 
chewing fresh parsley helps counteract the bad breath garlic 
causes 
when buying garlic look for firm heads with tight skin it 
should be stored in a cool dark ventilated place except in very 
humid hot climates it should not be refrigerated 
folk medicine and lore long have depended on garlic to fight 
vampires cholera scorpion stings leprosy and much more 
the journal preventive medicine noted that a 35centuryold 
egyptian document considered garlic useful for treating heart 
disorders slaves building the egyptian pyramids were said to have 
eaten great quantities of garlic romans thought it an aphrodisiac 
garlic juice was used on bandages to fight infections during world 
war i 
part of it is just myth you could see if someone had garlic 
around their necks to ward away colds maybe people just didnt get 
in close enough contact to be susceptible ernst suggested 
but much of it is not myth 
eric block an organic chemist at the state university of new 
york has been researching garlic and onions as possible agents in 
the treatment of heart disease and has found and patented a 
compound from garlic called ajoene that is a pretty potent 
inhibitor of the formation of blood clots as effective as 
aspirin he said 
the garlic and onion were like detective stories waiting to be 
approached by a sleuth block said 
his laboratory work has yet to be tested on animals or people 
but block said he has no doubts about garlics power in fact one 
indicator of its power bad breath has kept him from testing his 
theories on himself 
im a department chairman and i have to do a lot of 
negotiating with parents students faculty he said its a 
social problem

federal law lets medicaid pay for 
many outofhospital services for aids patients but only six state 
medicaid agencies are doing so and red tape is to blame the rand 
corp says 
medicaid programs in california hawaii new mexico new jersey 
ohio and south carolina help pay for aids patients to obtain 
transportation as well as services from homemakers home health 
assistants and adult day care centers 
such services generally are less expensive and more convenient 
than hospitalization 
but for a state medicaid agency to pay for these services it 
must obtain a waiver under a 1985 federal law such waivers exempt 
the agencies from the federal requirement that medicaid offer the 
same services to all patients 
a study by the rand corp a private nonprofit think tank 
concluded that most state medicaid agencies fail to take advantage 
of the federal law because of complicated application and 
administrative requirements for getting waivers from the health 
care financing administration 
hcfa which sponsored the rand study should relax federal 
controls to help make the program more attractive to state medicaid 
agencies the study said

a university scientist said he may have 
discovered proof of what new mexicans have joked about for years 
that chili is addictive 
its not like a heroin addiction said frank etscorn an 
experimental psychologist at new mexico institute of mining and 
technology in socorro 
the key to his theory is capsaicin the substance that fuels 
chilis eyewatering pungency etscorn said recently the capsaicin 
causes the body to release endorphins natural painkillers that 
race for receptors in the brain he said 
we need a fix of red or green with a side order of 
endorphins said etscorn we get slightly strung out on 
endorphins but its no big deal 
as a natural substance endorphins are not truly addictive 
despite being more potent than morphine etscorn told participants 
at the annual new mexico chile conference 
many stimuli ranging from acupuncture to smashing a thumb with a 
hammer trigger endorphins he said 
etscorn a specialist in addiction said he cooks spicy dishes 
and often wondered why people craved painful foods about two years 
ago he began a research project with his students 
etscorn used a drug called naloxone used to counteract heroin 
overdoses the drug blocks receptors that respond to heroin those 
are the same receptors stimulated by endorphins etscorn said 
for one experiment etscorn gave a research subject five 
jalapenos 
it worked sweat was pouring off his nose off his chin his 
eyes were runny his nose was runny and i think there was smoke 
coming out of his ears he said 
we asked him tell us when the pain is starting to subside 
when the pain began to fade the subject was given a naloxone 
injection the pain increased as the endorphins were shut out 
etscorn said 
etscorn said he plans further research although detailed 
studies probably would use the active ingredient capsaicin rather 
than the whole chili

atampt plans to issue credit cards that would 
allow users to charge phone calls as well as the traditional items 
paid for with visa and mastercard industry sources and a company 
involved in the negotiations say 
under the plan american telephone amp telegraph co would issue 
socalled affinity visa and mastercards through a georgia bank 
to a group of its existing phone card holders 
with 40 million in circulation the atampt phone cards are the 
most widely held charge cards in the nation and give the company a 
huge roster of potential customers for the new cards 
us sprint the nations thirdlargest longdistance phone 
company in december began issuing a sprint visa card that combines 
the features of its phone charge card with those of the bank card 
atampt has been in negotiations with synovus financial corp a 
bank holding company based in columbus ga to issue the credit 
cards synovus said 
total system services inc a columbusbased credit card service 
company controlled by synovus would process the transactions from 
the atampt cards under the plan tss said tss is the nations 
secondlargest credit card transaction processing company 
atampt spokesman bruce reid on wednesday confirmed the 
negotiations 
were in a highly competitive marketplace and looking at a 
number of ways of enhancing the atampt credit card he said the 
card competes with similar cards issued by sprint and mci 
communications corp the secondlargest longdistance phone 
company 
reid also confirmed reports that atampt hired several credit card 
experts in recent months he declined to comment further on atampts 
plans 
neither mastercard nor visa usa inc would discuss the atampt 
proposal 
according to the wall street journal atampt will announce its 
credit card plans in an advertising campaign starting march 26 the 
journal said atampt would waive the cards annual fee for at least 
the first year and offer a lower annual interest rate than most 
other bank cards around 14 percent or 15 percent 
the current longdistance phone cards are not revolving credit 
accounts like mastercard or visa meaning balances must be paid in 
full each month 
several industry analysts said they believed atampt at one time 
considered issuing its own credit card to compete with mastercard 
and visa atampt would not comment on the speculation 
fierce competition in the creditcard industry may have 
dissuaded atampt from such a plan said robert morris iii of goldman 
sachs amp co 
sears roebuck and cos discover card was the last separate 
national card to break into the industry and the retailer endured 
several years of steep losses before turning the operation around 
american express began offering its optima revolving charge card 
to holders of its regular credit cards several years ago 
morris said atampt evidently believes it can increase the use of 
its phone network through the new credit cards in addition the 
company would get a share of the interest and fees charged to 
cardholders 
sprint said it launched its visa card in conjunction with state 
street bank and trust co in boston to help promote use of its 
phone network 
it was a way of targeting hightravel users who spend a lot on 
telecommunications said hal poel sprints director of card 
marketing 
with the sprint visa phone calls charged on the card appear on 
a customers monthly visa bill and can be charged to the visa 
account

glasnost and perestroika translate into burgers 
and fries for the mcdonalds corp which plans to further expand 
its fastfood empire in eastern europe 
weve been in eastern europe so were not reacting to recent 
political developments there mcdonalds spokesman chuck ebeling 
said wednesday weve been planning for this area for years 
but he added political developments there open up promising 
aspects for us 
the suburban oak brookbased company opened restaurants in 
hungary and yugoslavia in 1988 and is expanding its presence in 
both countries ebeling said 
mcdonalds also is eyeing east germany and czechoslovakia while 
poland is in its longterm plans he said east germany and 
czechoslovakia are likely for the next step in development but not 
necessarily this year he said 
michael kennedy an ids financial services analyst specializing 
in the restaurant business believes if anybody can succeed in 
eastern europe mcdonalds can 
im always in awe of mcdonalds management they are able to 
do things other people say you cant do kennedy said they are 
awfully bright and they see opportunities others dont 
innovation also has played a role for example to ensure 
frenchfry supplies for their new moscow restaurant mcdonalds 
took seedlings for a new strain of potatoes from holland years ago 
and planted them in russia 
the restaurants in hungary and yugoslavia as well as the first 
soviet mcdonalds which opened jan 31 in moscow have been doing 
well 
theres lots of pentup demand for consumer goods ebeling 
said mcdonalds is a welcomed addition something not otherwise 
available 
in eastern europe ebeling said its pretty much the same 
menu hamburgers french fries coke and milkshakes its simpler 
than the us menu breakfast is not served in eastern europe and 
theres not the same range of products 
still some us investors have been leery of the risk in doing 
business in eastern europe 
wall street wants overnight success kennedy said they 
want to know why does it take three or four years for a profit 
mcdonalds invested 50 million in russia and only has one 
store but five years from now they will have a major position 
and others will be left out in the cold kennedy said 
there are 350 million people in eastern europe and your eyes 
get big when you look at the consumer market over there he said 
but these people dont have any middleclass spending power and 
it will be a long long time until anything of significance comes 
out of it

the proposed 12 billion buyout of mgmua 
communications co by european film conglomerate pathe 
communications corp represents a bold step in the increasing 
globalization of hollywood 
with overseas markets growing at an explosive pace the merger 
if completed will yield a balanced enterprise combining mgmuas 
local film and television production with pathes worldwide 
distribution executives say 
mgmua said wednesday it had accepted the buyout offer by 
italian financier giancarlo parrettis pathe which controls more 
than 1000 theaters in five countries 
the deal concludes a drama in which an array of individuals and 
companies from ted turner to the walt disney co considered 
buying all or part of the legendary studio 
the thing that were just excited about is the total 
company mgmua chairman jeffrey c barbakow said in an 
interview we believe that were now ready to become real players 
in hollywood 
with this weve increased our library we have what i believe 
is the biggest number of screens in europe a studio facility in 
rome a laboratory in paris a couple of thousand hours of 
newsreels new distribution channels pathes cannon films he 
said 
barbakows assessment was shared by parretti pathes president 
and chief executive 
mgmuas unique library and strong distribution capabilities 
complement pathes existing business worldwide parretti said in 
a statement we are confident the transaction will result in a 
strong dual company structure which will be strongly competitive 
last year foreign revenue constituted about 38 percent of 
hollywood revenue up from 30 percent in 1980 according to the 
motion picture association of america 
fatal attraction grossed 189 million overseas more than 
the 157 million it collected domestically likewise rain man 
netted 233 million outside north america compared to 170 million 
inside 
the mgmuapathe deal is the latest prompted by an insatiable 
worldwide demand for american entertainment 
japans sony corp acquired columbia pictures last year 
australias news corp owns fox and the cbs rca and aampm record 
labels are owned by japanese west german and dutch companies 
respectively englands television south plc owns televisions mtm 
productions 
mgmua has profitable tv and home video divisions and a film 
distribution system in place it has been trying to start producing 
films again recently after a twoyear fallow period while its 
controlling shareholder beverly hills billionaire kirk kerkorian 
sought a buyer 
the marriage with pathe though may be one of the most unusual 
in hollywood history 
the cannon releasing group which pathe owns is a leading 
purveyor of exploitation films with upcoming releases including 
american ninja 4 lambada the movie keatons cop with 
lee majors and don rickles death warrant and stranglehold 
delta force ii 
mgmua on the other hand is one of hollywoods jewels with 
its mgm and united artists banners responsible for everything from 
the 1939 judy garland classic the wizard of oz to the 1988 
academy awardwinning rain man 
mindful of how a 15 billion buyout of mgm was aborted last 
year when australias qintex group missed a 50 million down 
payment barbakow said mgm already had commitments from pathe worth 
100 million to distribute pathe movies 
the deal also requires parretti to come up with 200 million in 
four monthly deposits of 50 million each with the first one due 
friday to be placed in an escrow account if for whatever reason 
this doesnt close then we have the money for damages barbakow 
said 
he said he was confident parretti could line up financing for 
the deal but declined to say where 
parretti was traveling wednesday and could not be reached for 
comment in the past he has financed deals with help from credit 
lyonnais group the international financial giant 
kerkorian was expected to retain the right to use mgmuas 
familiar lion logo for his airline and theme park ventures under 
the separate mgm grand company but his spokeswoman mary hardy 
could not immediately confirm that 
there were reports too that the studio would change its name 
but there was no announcement of what the new name might be 
mgmua communications has lost money in four of the last five 
years the studios only major release of 1990 stanley amp iris 
with jane fonda and robert de niro was a commercial failure 
pathe which became a strong us presence following parrettis 
purchase of cannon group in 1987 produces and distributes movies 
worldwide it has film production facilities in italy a processing 
lab in france and the rights to 500 movies and 2000 newsreels

the 225share nikkei stock average gained 32855 points or 098 
percent closing at 3369089

recouped more than 860 points by the end of morning trading 
the index stayed higher as market players expected little 
arbitrage selling in the afternoon although some nervousness 
remained in the market dealers said 
institutional investors buying in the afternoon session also 
helped the nikkei maintain its gains they said todays trading 
was moderate with an estimated 600 million shares traded on the 
markets first section 
we had expected massive arbitrage selling because today is 
the last day for trading future issues that are due in march 
nomura said 
arbitrage trading is a technique for making profits from price 
differences between the spot and the futures markets 
but the index kept coming back even with frequent arbitrage 
selling he said the market seems to have hit its bottom 
analysts have blamed computeraided largescale arbitrage 
trading in part for recent market losses in tokyo 
so far this year the tokyo stock exchanges key index has lost 
522489 points or 134 percent

the us currency fell against the yen in the morning session 
after active intervention by the bank of japan but rose back in 
the afternoon as participants began selling the yen to make up 
their short or oversold dollar positions traders said

dollar because of their short dollar positions in the last couple 
of days said yoshitsugu hanada a trader with mitsui bank 
the dollar briefly reached 151 yen monday but fell bellow 150 
yen the following day after coordinated intervention by members of 
the group of seven nations including the united states japan and 
west germany 
in early trading today many market players avoided 
dollarbuying because of continuing dollarselling by the bank of 
japan hanada said 
the central bank which does not comment officially on its 
market interventions was believed to have sold about 800 million 
today in an effort to support the yen traders said 
the price of benchmark 10year no 119 japanese government bonds 
closed at 8666 points marginally lower than the previous days 
close of 8667 the bonds yield was 7205 percent up from

shearson lehman hutton incs plan for 2000 
layoffs this month including about 20 percent of its investment 
banking corps is a speededup version of the painful retraction 
taking place on wall street analysts say 
shearson said wednesday that the firings will include about 200 
employees in its prominent investment banking division who will be 
gone from the firm by the end of next week 
analysts predict that shearson engulfed in turmoil recently as 
american express co seized full control of its struggling 
securities unit could lay off another 3000 people in the coming 
months 
because american express wants to turn shearson around fast 
analysts said they expect cuts to occur quickly and in bulk 
the last thing you want is uncertainty out there said 
lawrence eckenfelder an industry analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc as soon as they identify a division or business 
they dont want to be in i dont see why they wouldnt move quickly 
to get out 
eckenfelder and other analysts estimate that shearson will take 
a onetime charge of 450 million to 500 million against quarterly 
earnings to cover the cuts and reserves against bad loans 
the investment banking layoffs are deeper than had been 
expected shearson officials said 120 professionals 80 in 
corporate finance and 40 in public finance as well as 70 support 
staff would be laid off the division employs about 750 
professionals out of 1100 workers overall 
michael madden shearsons codirector of investment banking 
said the cuts are taking place in all areas of the department 
which handles a variety of corporate financing and advising 
activities but that shearson did not plan to quit any particular 
field 
in this climate with business in many specific areas and 
across the board down its appropriate to downsize and let your 
best people remain he said were trying to get as lean as we 
can so that in the new environment we can get as profitable as we 
can 
although shearson had planned to cut investment banking jobs 
the number grew after american express took greater control over 
the firm madden said 
wall street is contractacting in part because of a slowdown 
since the 1987 stock market crash and a decline in mergers and 
acquisitions because of a sharp decline in the junk bond market 
the industry has shrunk by more than 40000 jobs overall since 
the crash including more than 5000 in the collapse of onetime 
powerhouse drexel burnham lambert inc last month 
according to securities data co shearson announced just five 
acquisition deals worth 56 billion from jan 1 through tuesday 
compared to 19 deals worth 202 billion for the same 1989 period 
and 33 deals worth 382 billion in 1988 
industrywide the total value of deals announced was down 51 
percent from last year newark njbased securities data said in 
a reflection of the slow times shearson is number one in the 
market so far this year 
investment banking layoffs had been planned and some had 
occurred at shearson before late january when american express 
ousted chairman peter a cohen and began taking a larger role in 
the firms affairs 
shearsons new chairman howard l clark jr is a former 
american express executive he and top executives are deciding what 
areas to cut american express this week said it was buying back 
all remaining shares of shearson that it does not own boosting its 
stake from 61 percent the company also is injecting 1 billion in 
new capital to shore up shearsons finances 
shearson reportedly had planned gradual cuts in investment 
banking of 10 percent to 20 percent by may allowing laidoff 
workers time to search for new jobs 
but the new layoffs were expected to take effect immediately 
some employees in other departments who were told wednesday they 
were losing their jobs were given until friday to pack their 
belongings and personnel department staff placed boxes outside of 
offices to help them 
shearson is hampered by overcapacity from its 1988 acquisition 
of ef hutton amp co outstanding temporary loans that are in peril 
because of the junk bond markets collapse and a 11 billion real 
estate loans portfolio in a shaky market

the government allowed the dollar to plunge 
against the west german mark from october through january and 
stepped in only modestly to stem its rise against the japanese yen 
the federal reserve reported 
the quarterly foreignexchange report by the federal reserve 
bank of new york showed the fed and the treasury spent just 750 
million in the three months ended jan 31 all of it to buy 
japanese yen 
the relatively small purchases compared with record 
interventions during the previous two reporting periods the 
government sold a record 1192 billion in dollars during the three 
months ended july 31 and 5871 billion in the following 
threemonth period the government purchased both yen and west 
german marks during the periods 
what highlighted the most recent period was a divergence of 
the dollar against the various currencies said sam y cross a 
new york fed executive vice president who presented the report at a 
news conference wednesday 
the dollar gained 1 percent against the yen but plunged 85 
percent against the mark the dollar also lost more than 5 percent 
against the british pound and the swiss franc during the 
threemonth period 
but rather than characterize the dollar as weak against the 
mark cross noted the mark rose against all currencies in part 
for reasons affecting that currency alone so we didnt see a need 
to intervene to resist that rise 
the opening of the border between east and west germany in early 
november unleashed a swell of positive sentiment toward the mark 
on speculation that new immigrants would stimulate domestic demand 
and that liberalization presented greatly expanded business 
opportunities the fed said 
we were hearing in the market that there was an attraction to 
investments in germany and capital movements into the mark 
cross said 
but enthusiasm surrounding the west german currency battered the 
dollar which fell from 18415 marks at the beginning of november 
to roughly 16630 marks in early january its low for the period 
it has since recovered to the 17000mark level 
the japanese yen however was buffeted by uncertainty 
surrounding parliamentary elections and rumors of scandals 
involving members of the ruling liberal democratic party 
the dollar reached its low against the japanese currency just 
after christmas at 14170 yen but closed the period higher at 
14445 yen since then the dollar has continued to climb and is 
currently trading at about 150 yen 
the fed intervened on only five occasions in coordination with 
the bank of japan the bulk of the intervention 600 million 
occurred during three days in early january 
cross said the dollars downward trend against most key 
currencies was consistent with recent policy of the group of seven 
industrial nations at their september meeting in washington 
representatives from the united states britain west germany 
japan canada italy and france said they favor a relatively 
weaker dollar which is seen as helping reduce the huge us trade 
deficit 
the dollar received some support late in the feds reporting 
period when a sharp runup in oil prices due to severe cold weather 
and an unexpectedly large jump in january wholesale prices raised 
speculation that interest rates were not headed lower higher 
interest rates increase returns on dollardenominated securities 
increasing demand for the currency 
currency traders often are keenly aware of the activities of 
central banks in the open markets but the feds policy is to 
comment only well after the fact the fed does not provide any data 
on intervention by foreign central banks

a japanese auto parts maker today rejected american 
investor t boone pickens demand to review the companys financial 
records 
in a hearing in tokyo district court lawyers for koito 
manufacturing co argued that pickens demand was part of a 
greenmailing scheme rather than the exercise of a justifiable 
shareholders right 
pickens is koitos largest single shareholder owning 26 percent 
of the tokyobased firms shares 
it was the first hearing in a lawsuit the texas oilman filed on 
jan 13 following a long stalemate in his landmark battle for 
increased participation in the management of koito 
toyota motor corp koitos largest customer is the 
secondlargest shareholder with 19 percent 
pickens purchase of the shares has stirred speculation that he 
is trying to force koito to buy him back at a profit a practice 
known as greenmail pickens has denied the greenmail accusations 
lawyers for pickens maintained that his suit was based on a 
section of the japanese commercial code that permits holders of 
more than 10 percent of a companys stock to review its books 
the court set the next hearing for may 10 
pickens filed the suit after he was denied a seat on koitos 
board of directors at the companys annual shareholders meeting 
last july 
toyota and other friendly companies together hold nearly 60 
percent of koitos 1604 million shares each valued at 3100 yen 
or 2060 at current exchange rates on the tokyo stock exchange 
today 
in the united states pickens fight is considered by some 
people to be a test of the freedom of americans to invest in japan 
at a time when many japanese companies are buying up us companies 
and property

usx corp said today it has agreed to let 
shareholders vote on a resolution by takeover strategist carl icahn 
proposing the company sell 80 percent of its steel division 
the company said in a statement it opposes the resolution as not 
in the best interests of stockholders the resolution is 
nonbinding and does not say how shares in the division would be 
sold said usx spokesman william keslar 
we could sell it either through a public offering or 
shareholders he said it would be sold somehow 
keslar said shareholders could receive the proxy material within 
the next 10 days 
the announcement came as a deadline requiring advance notice of 
proxy fights against usx approached today 
icahn usxs largest shareholder did not immediately return 
calls seeking comment 
under a usx bylaw amendment approved in january icahn was 
required to tell the company by the close of business today whether 
he would nominate his own slate of directors at usxs annual 
meeting may 7 
under terms of the agreement icahn will not nominate directors 
or submit other matters for consideration at the meeting usx said 
chairman charles a corry had said the steel oil and gas 
giants 60day notice was adopted to prevent someone from raising 
havoc at the last moment 
usx stock fell 137 to 3562 a share wednesday on the new york 
stock exchange 
icahn who owns about 34 million or 1326 percent of the 
companys outstanding common shares has long been unhappy with usx 
management and believes the companys stock price is too low he 
has argued in favor of the sale of usxs marathon oil amp gas 
subsidiary which usx management does not want to sell 
in 1988 he waged an unsuccessful proxy battle at texaco inc 
hoping to unseat the oil companys board and force a restructuring 
to boost texacos stock price 
a wall street source speaking on condition of anonymity has 
said icahn was considering a similar step at usx 
but greg drahuschak vice president of butcher amp singer in 
pittsburgh said he does not expect icahn who also is chairman of 
trans world airlines inc to attempt a proxy fight 
a proxy fight is time and moneyconsuming he said you 
can bet your right arm if not both arms that usx would fight it 
vigorously and add to the expense 
i wonder if he can get the money this is not small 
potatoes he said 
drahuschak said icahns standing with shareholders may be 
weakened by usxs pledges to bolster the companys stock 
i think the company is now in a position to control its own 
fate he said 
the recent demise of drexel burnham lambert inc which financed 
takeover bids by selling junk bonds could also discourage him 
john jacobson an analyst with aus consultants in philadelphia 
said theres more skittishness about doing highly leveraged deals 
in general 
icahn is not an andrew carnegie whos trying to build a steel 
trust or an oil monopoly he said hes interested in making 
sure the investment he has in place pays off

robots resembling giraffes and elephant 
trunks snake around halfassembled hondas spewing sparks as they 
weld steel frames and produce a car in 14 hours 
only in japan no an identical factory is churning out hondas 
in ohio thousands of usbuilt hondas will be shipped to japan 
and thousands more of the japanbuilt hondas will be sold in the 
united states 
global is the theme in japans thriving auto industry 
honda toyota and nissan are building more cars abroad and slowly 
blurring the national origin of automobiles historically one of 
the most powerful symbols of a countrys manufacturing might 
the strategy makes sense to japanese auto companies because it 
can deflect or defuse trade tensions from countries growing hostile 
to japans barrage of exports the strategy also places 
manufacturing and assembly closer to buyers which can cut costs 
ultimately much of the profit still flows back to japan 
we do business according to our philosophy of manufacturing 
products in the market in which they are sold says honda senior 
managing director shoichiro irimajiri localization of research and 
production facilities means they can become new supply bases for 
hondas global sales channels 
honda says it is ready to export usmade hondas to europe for 
the first time 
in laborshort japan no one grumbles about exporting jobs to 
fill labor needs the auto industry must hire parttimers who can 
make more than 2700 a month irimajiri said during a tour of 
hondas 9monthold futuristic factory at suzuka in central japan 
conveyers glide silently raising or lowering cars automatically 
depending on the work to be done workers wear slogans on their 
white jumpsuits reading aim for zero accidents 
late last year a sister factory built from the same blueprints 
began producing in ohio one of the latest additions to the 
socalled transplant shops beginning to dot americas 
industrial heartland 
honda was the first japanese automaker to build cars in the 
united states a huge success last year americans bought more 
honda accords than any other car 60 percent of them usmade and 
late last year honda cars were outselling chrysler in the united 
states 
overall japanese car production capacity is likely to top 1 
million in the united states this year and in europe by 1998 
its an increasingly stark contrast to the problems besetting 
american automakers which have been laying off thousands of 
employees and closing factories for weeks at a time because they 
cant sell enough cars 
toyota foresees a 32 percent surge in overseas production this 
year to 650000 cars and mitsubishi motors which operates a 
jointventure plant with chrysler forecasts overseas production up 
33 percent to 410000 hondas production abroad will be up 17 
percent to 525000 nissans up 7 percent to 683000 and mazdas 
steady at 220000 
honda and toyota are following nissans lead in building 
factories in britain mazda is close to announcing a factory built 
jointly with ford probably in west germany chrysler is looking 
for an overseas partner to build a subcompact probably with 
mitsubishi motors 
earlier this month mitsubishis parent company announced it was 
negotiating a cooperation agreement with west germanys 
daimlerbenz group in what could provide the japanese conglomerate 
with an enormous advantage in setting up shop in europe 
none of the japanese have any kind of sales network in 
continental europe and its very expensive to set one up from 
scratch says rama krishna an auto analyst for the investment 
firm first boston asia youll see tieups between japanese and 
local or american manufacturers a lot more joint production 
designing and marketing 
many cars already have hybrid nationality nissans new nxcoupe 
was designed by americans at nissans design subsidiary in 
california and mazdas new navajo sport utility vehicle was 
designed and built by ford mazda builds ford lasers telstars and 
festivas in japan and toyotas joint venture with general motors 
in california makes toyota corollas and geo prizms 
a new twist is shipping foreignmade japanese cars back to 
japan hnda started importing americanmade accords in 1988 and 
toyota plans to start in 1992 mazdabuilt fords have been imported 
since 1988 and nissan may do the same from its plant in britain 
honda plans to import 50000 usmade hondas annually by 1991 
quintupling this years imports to japan 
its a totally realistic goal says honda spokesman bret 
anderson now we have the capacity to do it its also economical 
for us and not being done just because of trade frictions 
although japanese car exports to the united states are limited 
to 23 million a year they were still worth 209 billion in 1989 
exports ministry of international trade and industry figures show 
that represents about 40 percent of the us trade deficit with 
japan and has arouseed american protectionist passions and 
warnings 
we the great believers are having our pants pulled down an 
inch at a time by a centrally orchestrated totally committed 
economic aggressor chrysler motors chairman bennett bidwell said 
in a january speech we had better develop a healthy fear of 
economic subordination because we are faced with it 
in europe protectionism is rising as well with carmakers 
pressing for tighter quotas on japanese imports some europeans 
have even proposed that japanese cars built in europe should be 
counted as imports europeans spent a record 10 billion on 
japanese cars last year the japan automobile manufacturers 
association says 
japanese moves into north america and europe have contributed to 
a decline in car exports for the last four years but that trend 
partly disguises the earnings of japanese automakers from their 
foreign operations moreover the value of exports are expected to 
start rising again because of japans expensive new luxury models 
such as toyotas lexus and nissans infiniti 
toyota sold more than 16000 lexuses in the united states in the 
last four months of 1989 nissan got a slower start with sales of 
1700 infinitis but hasnt been selling them as long 
the rising value clearly worries some japanese auto executives 
because it could incite more trade backlashes nissan president 
yutaka kume said his company is attempting to counter the trend by 
importing more auto parts from abroad in what he called an 
internationalization program 
government trade officials also sensitive to hostile foreign 
reaction have asked automakers to keep investment in new plants 
and equipment from resulting in increased shipments overseas 
heightened exports could especially provoke a hostile response 
in the united states where the big three general motors corp 
ford motor co and chrysler corp all reported severe earnings 
declines last year 
by contrast toyotas earnings in the fiscal year ending in july 
were up 17 percent to 21 billion nissan reported a 77 percent 
earnings rise to 868 million in the fiscal year ended last march

us and japanese electronics industry groups 
proposed a joint plan thursday to boost us sales of 
semiconductors in japan 
a task force created by the us semiconductor industry 
association and the electronics industries association of japan 
recommended a variety of programs for increasing the us share of 
japans semiconductor market 
foreign semiconductor chips accounted for 129 percent of the 
japanese market in the last three months of 1989 according to the 
ministry of international trade and industry 
the task force composed of five japanese semiconductor user 
companies and six us suppliers called on nonjapanese chip 
makers to improve their sales and service in japan and to modify or 
redesign their semiconductors to meet japanese needs 
japanese companies have charged that us companies do not 
supply semiconductors that are suitable for the japanese consumer 
market 
the task force in a report said consumer electronics products 
account for more than a third of semiconductors used in japan but 
only 7 percent of those consumed in the united states 
the report said the five japanese user firms presented lists of 
the semiconductors used in some of their major consumer products 
us firms currently are able to supply about 6 percent of the 
semiconductors and after technical modifications to existing 
chips could supply about 12 percent of the japanese companies 
needs the report said 
the task force recommended that foreign suppliers be given a 
chance to demonstrate their technical and product development 
capabilities to achieve this it called for more exchange of 
technical information and for increased participation by foreign 
firms in the design of special semiconductors for products as they 
are being developed in japan 
semiconductors have been a focus of trade friction between the 
united states and japan since overcapacity in japan resulted in 
extensive pricecutting by competing japanese makers in the united 
states and elsewhere in the mid1980s 
in a 1986 bilateral semiconductor agreement japan pledged to 
stop selling chips in the united states at unfairly low prices and 
agreed to a goal of 20 percent of the japanese market for foreign 
semiconductors by july 1991 when the agreement expires japan has 
called the figure a target while us companies say it was a 
guarantee by japan 
in 1989 japanese makers held a 24 percent share of the us 
semiconductor market and 51 percent of the world market according 
to dataquest inc a us market research company

greyhound lines inc spokesman george gravely said 40652 people 
rode greyhound buses wednesday the largest number since the 
walkout began last friday the number of passengers wednesday was 
383 percent of the bus lines ridership on the same day last year 
tuesdays ridership had been 376 percent of last years figure 
there have been no negotiations between the company and the 
amalgamated council of greyhound local unions since talks broke 
down last week and the company said wednesday that talks would 
not be fruitful at this time given the present attitude of the 
union 
earlier today a striking driver said he was hit by a bus as it 
left the mobile ala terminal early today police said passengers 
on the bus reported pickets crowded around the bus as it left but 
the riders did not think the picket was hit the striking driver 
was treated for a bruised knee 
meantime two greyhound buses were seized at the uscanadian 
border near plattsburgh ny after they were found to be 
illegally transporting canadian security guards hired by the 
company an immigration spokesman said 
greyhound failed to get the special permission needed for 
canadian citizens to enter the united states to work as security 
guards said immigration and naturalization service spokesman duke 
austin 
when the first buses arrived at the border officials discovered 
two passengers were employed by greyhound as guards austin said 
the individuals and the two buses in which they were riding were 
seized he said 
it was not immediately known whether any charges were filed 
against the bus line or the canadians 
a greyhound representative in dallas said the buses would be 
held overnight at the border the buses are still there but were 
going to get them back said dana neal 
some 6300 bus drivers and 3000 maintenance and office workers

700 replacement drivers plus union members who crossed picket 
lines the company says about 350 union drivers are at work the 
union says 95 returned 
the cause of this strike is singular union spokesman jeffry 
nelson said wednesday the company has refused to negotiate with 
the union that represents its 9000 employees in good faith 
in other developments wednesday 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio and 10 other senators asked

the chairman of the commodity futures 
trading commission today urged the futures industry to become more 
vocal in supporting the agencys fight to retain jurisdiction over 
stockindex futures 
in a speech to the annual meeting of the futures industry 
association here wendy gramm said futures exchange officials and 
trading firms must let congress know they object to the possible 
transfer of authority over index futures to the securities and 
exchange commission 
you must speak out to address these issues to educate the 
people who do not understand futures and options markets she 
said 
they must be made aware of your commitment to continue to be 
world leaders in terms of liquidity innovation and integrity 
despite tough talk by both mrs gramm and the chicago mercantile 
exchange the largest market for index futures the merc recently 
has indicated a greater willingness to compromise on the 
jurisdiction issue which surfaced in the aftermath of the 1987 
stock market crash 
the merc said last month in an outlook for the 1990s that it 
wanted to resolve regulatory issues surrounding stockindex 
futures merc chief leo melamed underscored the point at a news 
conference monday to announce his retirement plans 
were willing to sit down and get these issues behind us 
because these issues constantly drag us away from the business of 
business and that ought not to be said melamed chairman of the 
mercs executive committee 
but melamed also said that if that compromise means we give 
and no one else gives forget it 
the sec which regulates stock trading appears to be gaining 
congressional support for shifting regulatory control over index 
futures to the sec from the cftc 
the idea also has gained favor on wall street on tuesday 
robert downey a managing partner of goldman sachs amp co and 
chairman of the securities industry association told a senate 
subcommittee the sec should regulate both markets 
index futures allow investors to buy and sell the cash 
equivalent of baskets of stocks without ever owning the stocks 
themselves the merc trades futures on the standard amp poors 500 
stock index 
the sec started the regulatory tugofwar after the october 1987 
crash which some experts believe was worsened by computerdriven 
program trading techniques involving both the stock and stockindex 
futures markets 
mrs gramm disputed that claim in an unusually pointed speech 
three weeks ago in which she said individual investors had been 
leaving the stock market since the late 1960s so stockindex 
futures which arrived in the 1970s were not to blame for the 
recession on wall street 
critics of stockindex futures also have called for government 
authority to set the amount of margin or downpayment that 
investors must put down to buy or sell futures contracts 
mrs gramm believes the exchanges should be allowed to continue 
setting their own margins

eastern airlines has refused an offer of 40 
million in concessions from its pilots union in exchange for 
getting strikers jobs back according to a newspaper report 
the report in thursdays editions of the atlanta 
journalconstitution quoted unidentified sources familiar with 
contract negotiations under way in washington 
last march easterns pilots and flight attendants unions struck 
the airline in sympathy with the striking machinists union 
although the sympathy strikes ended in november no former striking 
pilots and only 215 former striking flight attendants have been 
called back to work 
the machinists union remains on strike against miamibased 
eastern which has been operating under the supervision of a 
federal bankruptcy court since march 9 1989 
in a separate development wednesday the house sustained 
president bushs veto of a bill to have the government intervene in 
the eastern dispute dealing a blow to organized labor and 
democratic leaders also the justice department said it has no 
objections to easterns proposed sale of its valuable latin 
american routes to rival american airlines 
eastern says its pilot jobs have been filled by 800 pilots who 
refused to strike or who crossed picket lines and by 1000 new 
replacements leaders of the air line pilots association say about 
1400 former striking pilots want their jobs at eastern back while 
an equal number have retired or found jobs elsewhere 
on monday a federal mediator called alpa and eastern 
negotiators into a new round of talks the atlanta newspaper said 
spokesmen for the union and eastern said they couldnt discuss 
details of the talks but eastern alpa chairman skip copeland told 
the newspaper were willing to make enormous concessions 
the concessions totaled more than 40 million the paper 
reported 
the report said alpa has insisted that eastern honor its 
contract by awarding pilot jobs according to seniority a request 
that eastern has refused if that were done most former strikers 
would displace the replacement pilots 
it appears to be a philosophical impasse not an economic 
impasse copeland was quoted as saying what theyre trying to 
do is break the union 
if the national mediation board decides further negotiations 
wouldnt be worthwhile it can trigger a 30day period after which 
eastern could impose contract terms and the union could strike 
if that happened or if eastern asked the bankruptcy court to 
void alpas contract the union probably would ask members to vote 
on whether to return to the picket lines

treasury secretary nicholas f brady said 
today he will go to paris next month to meet with financial leaders 
of the group of seven industrial nations to discuss recent economic 
developments around the world 
before appearing at a house appropriations subcommittee hearing 
on the treasury department budget brady was asked about a report 
that he and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan would travel to 
paris on april 7 
definitely he replied 
asked further if the trip involved meetings with the g7 
leaders he said yes 
since the regular meeting of the g7 is scheduled for may 7 
brady was asked as he left the hearing whether there was any 
urgency for the preliminary meeting 
theres no special urgency he replied weve always had a 
meeting previous to the regular meeting and this was just the time 
that was picked last time it was in february and this time it is 
in april 
the meeting of finance ministers and central bank presidents 
from the worlds most powerful industrial democracies the united 
states japan west germany britain france canada and italy 
would be the first such session since the dramatic changes in 
eastern europe 
an official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
united states had proposed the meeting to discuss how changes in 
eastern europe are affecting currency markets and the economic 
coordination efforts among the major powers 
in recent weeks the value of the dollar on world markets has 
climbed sharply while the japanese yen and west german mark have 
declined 
a stronger dollar threatens to worsen americas already huge 
trade deficit since it would make imports less expensive for 
american consumers and us products more expensive on overseas 
markets 
the g7 countries have been coordinating efforts this week to 
sell dollars and buy japanese yen and west german marks in an 
effort to dampen the dollars climb but so far the government 
currency sales have had limited impact 
in addition to the recent volatility in exchange markets the 
g7 officials were expected to address the question of the 
unification of west germany and east germany some economists fear 
this development could worsen inflationary problems in west 
germany especially if a proposal to exchange the west german 
currency for the east germany currency on a onetoone basis is 
carried out 
the april 7 meeting of the g7 countries will be held just one 
month before a previously scheduled may 7 meeting in washington

the cartel is committed to a production ceiling of 22 million 
barrels per day for the first six months of 1990 aimed at 
maintaining a reference price of 18 a barrel 
iraqi oil minister essam chalabi in an interview with the 
bahrainbased gulf news agency said he did not expect the meeting 
to make any substantial changes in the existing opec accord 
it is a meeting merely designed to take stock of the market 
without taking any decisions in its connection chalabi was 
quoted as saying this is a chance for the oil ministers to 
exchange views on the conditions of the oil market 
he said the full meeting of all 13 opec member will convene may 
25 with frequent consultations on stabilizing the market and 
maintaining the current market 
iraqs earlier call for a gradual increase in oil prices through 
limiting production contradicted the stand of producers like kuwait 
and the united arab emirates who have been calling for higher 
production 
hisham naser oil minister of saudi arabia the largest opec 
producer met with the iraqi and kuwaiti oil ministers earlier in 
the week they announced an agreement on a common policy to smooth 
the way for the opec meetings but no details had been disclosed 
oil prices reached well above the 18 mark in recent months due 
to the high demand for winter fuel 
subroto said the usual drop in demand would be offset by 
anticipated oil requirements of reforming eastern europe 
the soviet union was unable to meet the eastern european needs 
of oil in the last few years and these states will start looking 
for alternative sources of oil supplies subroto said 
he referred to deals already concluded between eastern europe 
and some opec member states but he did not go into detail 
subroto also said declining production in the united states and 
the soviet union could create a huge boost in demand in the next 
five years forcing an explosion in world prices if production 
capacity was not increased 
subroto of indonesia urged industrial states to help invest up 
to 60 billion to develop production capacity to meet demand 
current production capacity is 27 million barrels a day

house members who helped sustain president 
bushs veto of a bill to create a commission on the yearold 
eastern airlines dispute say the measure wouldnt have helped the 
8500 striking workers 
why hold out false hope to those whove already been hurt so 
much minority leader robert michel rill said wednesday 
before a 261160 vote to override fell about 20 votes short of the 
twothirds majority needed 
the bill would have created a fourmember bipartisan commission 
to study the strike and recommend ways to resolve it 
rep tom delay rtexas challenged colleagues to be truthful 
about whether a commission would help resolve the complex matter 
now before bankruptcy courts 
look at our own deficit and answer that question for 
yourselves delay said 
white house spokesman stephen hart praised the house action 
we have long felt it was inappropriate for such action to be 
taken this lays the issue to rest we continue to feel the 
appropriate course of action in addressing the dispute is between 
labor and management hart said 
michel and other republicans said bush was right to halt 
government intervention because the strike by members of the 
machinists union had not created a transportation emergency in any 
region of the country 
noting that bush had vetoed the measure in december michel said 
democrats would have pressed the override sooner if they had 
considered the bill an emergency 
during the hourlong debate as about two dozen uniformed 
eastern employees watched from the gallery the legislations 
congressional supporters said it was the last best hope to 
save the carrier 
our government is turning its back on the working men and 
women of this country said rep james mcdermott dwash the 
president said there is no emergency but he doesnt have to fly on 
an airline thats on the verge of collapse 
minority whip newt gingrich of georgia one of 25 republicans 
who voted against bush on the issue said the matter amounted to 
a question of national policy the right of people to expect 
their government to look into situations like this 
gingrich has also said he felt he owed it to atlanta airport 
workers many of whom are his constituents 
rep bud schuster rpa said democrats had an uncontrollable 
urge to bash the president but were ignoring a warning from 
bankruptcy examiner david shapiro that congressional intervention 
might jeopardize the remaining 17000 jobs at eastern 
last week shapiro said in a report that there was evidence to 
suggest that texas air corp easterns parent company may have 
treated eastern unfairly in a dozen financial transactions 
the vote marked congress second veto confrontation with bush 
during this electionyear session the president won the first 
showdown in january when the senate narrowly upheld his veto of a 
bill protecting chinese students from deportation

elders ixl ltd on thursday announced a major 
restructuring under which it will spin off its agribusiness 
operations into a new public company and sell other assets while 
retaining its brewing business 
elders also said it would buy grand metropolitan plcs breweries 
for an undisclosed amount and enter into a joint venture with grand 
met to operate the two companies 8500 pubs elders had been 
frustrated in past attempts to expand its extensive brewing 
interests 
the announcement was made in sydney australia and a copy was 
made available in london 
the restructuring was intended maximize value for all elders 
shareholders by creating independent corporate entities focused on 
single businesses elders said 
elders chairman john d elliott said the reconstruction will 
position these companies to continue their growth strongly into the 
1990s 
elders ixl will become fosters brewing group ltd and focus on 
its brewing interests the announcement said its bestknown brands 
are fosters and courage 
elders said it would spin off its agribusiness operations by 
creating a new publicly held company called elders ltd and giving 
elders existing shareholders stock in the new company the spinoff 
requires shareholder approval elders said 
other assets including elders ixls interests in elders finance 
group and elders resources nzfp will be sold and the surplus cash 
will be distributed to shareholders over time it said 
harlin holdings pty ltd an australian company that owns 55 
percent of elders stock and supports the restructuring said it 
plans to reduce its interest in fosters brewing to below 50 percent 
and maintain its stake between 40 percent and 50 percent 
harlin will scale down its holding in the agribusiness company 
as well elders said without providing specifics and will retain 
representatives on the two boards of directors 
elders said it has reached an understanding with grand met 
the british food liquor and leisure group that owns pillsbury co 
of the united states to acquire grand mets four breweries 
the 5050 venture to operate pubs will be called inntrepreneur 
estates ltd and will operate elders more than 5000 pubs and 
grand mets more than 2000 pubs 
elders said it intends to make a definitive announcement on the 
brewery purchase and pub joint venture shortly it did not say how 
much it would pay for grand mets brewing interests but it said 
the purchase and the combination of the pubs would offset each 
other the two transactions would be cash neutral it said 
the deal with grand met requires approval from british 
regulatory authorities and of grand mets shareholders elders said 
last year the government blocked elders hostile bid of 16 
billion pounds or 26 billion for the british brewer scottish 
and newcastle plc for competitive reasons 
britains brewers have been seeking to restructure their 
operations since the government in an effort to encourage 
competition decided that brewers could own only 2000 tied 
pubs which sell the owners beers any pubs owned above that number 
have to be free houses selling whatever beer they like 
explaining the restructuring elders said its board of directors 
decided that elders market value does not reflect the value of its 
brewing operations and that the way to rectify that was to create a 
separate brewing company which was likely to be more attractive to 
shareholders 
the restructuring has been a longstanding objective it said 
fosters brewing will have strong competitive positions in 
australia canada and britain and significant potential for future 
growth elders said 
before the grand met deal fosters brewing would be the 
fourthlargest brewing company in the world the company said 
among other things the agribusiness company will be a leading 
provider of farm services in australaia the largest wool broker 
largest livestock sales and rural merchandise supply organization 
and a major provider of financial services to the rural industry

andrew c hove jr a small town nebraska 
banker and republican activist is the leading candidate to fill a 
vacancy on the board of the federal deposit insurance corp 
he was recommended for the job by treasury secretary nicholas f 
brady rep virginia smith rneb said thursday president bush 
is expected to make the appointment the post requires senate 
confirmation 
the fdic insures deposits in both banks and savings 
institutions its board supervises the resolution trust corp a 
new agency created in august to carry out president bushs savings 
and loan bailout 
the white house also received bradys nominee for director of 
the office of thrift supervision which regulates solvent sampls 
said an administration source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
and would not reveal the name of the person recommended 
assistant treasury secretary salvatore r martoche has been 
serving as acting director since tuesday replacing m danny wall 
who resigned three months ago under fire from congress 
however savings institutions in danger of failure have 
challenged martoches legal authority and the administration which 
until recently had been unable to find a candidate wants to move 
swiftly to appoint a permanent director 
hove 55 is viewed as a representative of small town and farm 
banks he served as mayor of minden from 1974 to 1982 and is a 
political supporter of smith and gov kay orr of nebraska 
bankings two principal trade groups the american bankers 
association and the independent bankers association of america back 
him 
the appointment would be a victory for fdic chairman l william 
seidman who at times has been at odds with the treasury department 
over the conduct of the sampl bailout 
i think hes a fine appointment well be very pleased to have 
him on this board if the president appoints him seidman said 
there had been speculation among industry insiders that treasury 
would use the appointment to gain control of the fdic board two 
treasury officials the thrift office director and the comptroller 
of the currency hold seats on the fivemember board since 
october seidman publicly campaigned for the appointment of an 
independent banker to his board 
this appointment looks potentially to signal a new era of good 
feeling and a closer working relationship between the fdic and 
treasury said kenneth a guenther executive vice president of 
the independent bankers 
i think it underscores a new recognition by treasury 
that you should have people other than wall street types in top 
positions of the government guenther said 
hove is chairman and chief executive of the minden exchange bank 
amp trust co minden neb a former aircraft carrier pilot he 
steered his bank through the farm depression of the early 1980s and 
served as president of the nebraska bankers association 
his appointment also likely would be viewed as win for small 
banks who are fighting suggestions within the administration to 
scale back federal deposit insurance

east german and foreign enterprises will be 
able to take stakes in private commercial banks when the country 
begins switching to a westernstyle banking system april 1 central 
bank director horst kaminsky said thursday 
kaminsky said the plan to switch to a western system approved 
thursday by the cabinet of the communistled interim government 
was an important move in making east germanys economy more 
compatible with west germanys with an eye toward eventual 
currency unification 
kaminsky who spoke at a news conference following the weekly 
cabinet meeting said foreign enterprises would be allowed to 
participate in the new banks but gave no details other than that 
the transformation would be gradual 
since the hardline communist leadership of erich honecker 
collapsed last fall the government has moved to make east 
germanys centrallyplanned economy more compatible with west 
germanys capitalist system as the countries move toward 
unification 
but east germanys economy has slowed drastically ahead of the 
countrys scheduled march 18 free elections which will seat a new 
parliament that could alter any decisions made by the interim 
government 
kaminskys proposal includes an autonomous central bank based 
on western models like west germanys bundesbank that will steer 
cash and credit in a mixed commercial banking sector 
kaminsky said a series of banks would be released from state 
ownership and an independent banking watchdog commission 
established 
the new banks would perform general commercial functions 
similar to west german banks he said they would include deutsche 
kreditbank ag genossenschaftsbank berlin ag deutsche 
aussenhandelsbank ag the east german foreign trade bank that 
already operates commercially abroad and cooperative banks for 
trades and crafts 
kaminsky said one consequence of the switch would be the 
emergence of a capital market and a stock exchange but he declined 
to say whether a bourse could be set up before the end of this year 
responding to questions about reports that east germanys 
foreign exchange reserves had dwindled recently from a total of 
176 billion to 940 million kaminsky said those rumors about 
our currency reserves do not represent the reality 
while admitting the uncertainty surrounding east germanys 
future may have unsettled some foreign creditors he stressed 
there is no cause for panic reports

top finance officials from the worlds seven 
major industrial countries will meet in paris early next month to 
discuss turbulence in global currency markets and the dramatic 
developments in eastern europe officials confirmed thursday 
the talks involving the united states japan west germany 
britain france italy and canada were seen as an effort to 
strengthen economic coordination at a time of dramatic change in 
world affairs 
treasury secretary nicholas brady who was instrumental in 
scheduling the meeting insisted that there was no special 
urgency for the gathering scheduled for april 7 
however the discussions will occur just one month before these 
same officials are scheduled to meet for a regular economic review 
session in conjunction with the spring meeting of the international 
monetary fund in washington 
currency markets have been especially volatile in recent weeks 
with the west german mark and the japanese yen falling in value 
against the us dollar 
analysts said the rising dollar threatened to worsen the huge 
american trade deficit by making foreign products less expensive 
for us consumers while making american goods more expensive 
overseas 
the dollars strength is of great concern to the 
administration said allen sinai chief economist of the boston 
co it constitutes a recession threat because it is a further 
risk to an already beleaguered industrial side of the us 
economy 
the dollars advance has occurred despite coordinated 
intervention by federal reserve and other central banks to push the 
currency lower 
some analysts suggested that since intervention has proved 
largely unsuccessful g7 officials might discuss coordinated 
changes in interest rates 
higher interest rates in japan and germany would tend to bolster 
those currencies while lower interest rates in the united states 
would make dollardenominated investments less attractive 
but federal reserve chairman alan greenspan who will attend the 
paris meeting has opposed further cuts in us interest rates 
because of inflationary pressures at home

campeau corp the financially distressed owner 
of us department stores operating under bankruptcycourt 
supervision said thursday it will not pay 52 million in interest 
due on loans from two major lenders 
failure to pay the interest due wednesday under special 
arrangements made last week postponing earlier payment deadlines 
meant campeau went into default on loans from olympia amp york 
developments ltd and edward j debartolo corp 
but the lenders have agreed they will not move to collect their 
collateral without notifying campeau nine days in advance 
the loans total 705 million two loans of 75 million and 150 
million were made by two subsidiaries of olympia amp york owned by 
the reichmann family of toronto the loan from debartolo a big 
ohiobased shopping mall developer amounts to 480 million 
campeau expects to continue discussions with olympia amp york 
and debartolo regarding the development of a longterm business 
plan for the operations of the corporation the company said in a 
statement released at its toronto headquarters 
word of the default followed intense discussions with the 
lenders late into the evening wednesday 
campeau spokesman richard w wertheim said a deal to defer 
payments for several weeks had been worked out wednesday with 
olympia amp york and was contingent on a parallel deal being reached 
with debartolo but the debartolo talks fell through he said 
debartolo has claims on campeaus californiabased ralphs 
grocery co chain but the ralphs shares are held by another 
campeau company federated stores inc which is under 
bankruptcycourt protection in the united states 
that means debartolo would have to line up with other creditors 
to seek the approval of a bankruptcy court judge to seize the 
ralphs assets wertheim said 
the collateral on the olympia amp york loans includes various 
properties 
neither debartolo nor olympia amp york have yet given notice they 
intend to seize assets he added 
our focus and their interest as well is on the longterm 
plan for the continued operation of the company wertheim said 
adding that our discussions with all lenders are focused on the 
long term not satisfying something on a daytoday basis 
he said there really is no question that we have the 52 
million to pay if we wanted to 
the olympia amp york and debartolo loans were used to help finance 
campeaus illfated acquisitions of the us retailing groups 
allied stores corp and federated department stores inc in 1986 
and 1988 but unlike most of the financing these loans were 
guaranteed by the torontobased parent 
allied and federated are currently operating under chapter 11 of 
the us bankruptcy act which gives them some time to reorganize 
under court direction when they filed for protection from 
creditors on jan 15 they listed 77 billion in debts 
it appeared unlikely that the outcome of campeaus discussions 
with olympia amp york and debartolo would have any direct bearing on 
the federated and allied bankruptcy proceedings 
wertheim said given the circumstances campeau has maintained 
good relationships with its bank lenders the inability so far to 
reach agreements with olympia amp york and debartolo on longterm 
loan payment deferrals doesnt imply campeaus collapse is imminent 
right now theres no plan for us to fold up our tents he 
said

its rate of involuntarydenied boardings by 60 percent compared 
with a year earlier robert fornaro northwests vice president of 
marketing planning said wednesday involuntarydenied boardings 
are the bumping of passengers who dont want to get off planes 
in the fourth quarter of last year northwest involuntarily 
bumped about 2200 passengers or 253 for every 10000 passengers 
boarded 
northwest has been steadily improving by that measure since the 
problem peaked last summer the airline says in the fourth quarter 
of 1989 it bumped about 2500 fewer people than in the same 
quarter a year earlier and the bumpings were reduced even though 
total passenger boardings rose 12 percent 
northwests 1989 rate of involuntary bumpings was 383 per 
10000 passengers boarded down from 426 in 1988 said northwest 
spokesman doug miller 
the airline also showed progress in the fourth quarter in the 
number of people who are bumped voluntarily that means they 
take a later flight because the carrier offers them incentives such 
as cash or coupons for free flights in the future 
it costs us a few more free tickets but thats the price you 
pay fornaro said 
most major airlines aim to hold overbooking to a minimum in an 
effort to reduce both voluntary and involuntary bumping but when a 
flight is overbooked they want to convert as many travelers as 
possible to the voluntary side by offering them the freebies 
northwest offers freebies to bumped passengers now but it 
hasnt offered enough to entice larger numbers of fliers to give up 
their seats voluntarily 
fornaro said it is especially difficult for northwest to cut its 
number of involuntary bumpings because it has large numbers of 
passengers on long flights over the pacific passengers on longer 
flights are generally less flexible in their plans than those on 
shorter hauls 
many travelers especially business fliers reserve seats on 
several flights to ensure they will have their choice of departure 
times 
that forces airlines to book more reservations than they have 
seats or risk having lots of empty seats

two small biotechnology companies that have 
devised an aids vaccine have seen their stock shoot higher 
following an official goahead for human testing of the substance 
stock in alpha 1 biomedicals inc of washington dc and 
celsci corp of alexandria va jumped after california health 
officials approved the first phase of human testing 
the approval announced monday was the first for human trials 
of the hgp30 vaccine in the united states according to the 
companies 
those involved in the tests cautioned it could take years for 
the development of a true vaccine 
nevertheless the price of celsci nearly doubled tuesday to 
266 from 156 monday while the price of alpha 1 shares nearly 
tripled that day to 769 from 288 both saw unusually heavy 
trading volume 
the prices of both issues which are traded on the national 
overthecounter system eased somewhat wednesday by late 
afternoon thursday celsci was trading at 209 a share and alpha 
1 shares fetched 488 
celsci and alpha 1 are 5050 partners in a joint venture called 
viral technologies inc which devised the vaccine the vaccine is 
synthetic it contains no live or dead aids virus components 
unlike many other aids vaccines under study meaning there is no 
chance it could induce infection with the deadly disease 
geert kersten vice president and treasurer of celsci said the 
price of his companys stock has been volatile since it went public 
in 1983 
its a very emotional stock he said 
kersten owns about 15 percent of the 32 million outstanding 
shares while celscis founder maximillian de clara of 
switzerland owns about 9 percent kersten said much of the 
remaining stock is believed to be held by individual investors he 
said 
managers and directors of alpha 1 which went public in 1986 
own about 15 percent of that companys 46 million shares said 
robert j lanham chief operating officer the rest is believed to 
be held by small investors he said 
both companies have lost money since their founding which is 
typical for biotechnology startups 
kersten said viral technologies began testing the vaccine on 
humans in great britain last may so far the results have been 
encouraging with the immune systems of those in the study 
producing the expected defensive response to the aids virus he 
said 
the vaccine targets a core protein of the aids virus which is 
found in all strains of the virus most other potential vaccines 
under study target the outer shell of the virus which can vary 
because the virus often is mutated kersten said 
several other companies also are testing an aids vaccine on 
humans including bristolmyers squibb co a joint venture of 
chiron corp and cibageigy and a joint venture of merck amp co and 
repligen corp said stuart weisbrod an analyst at 
prudentialbache securities inc

k mart corp on thursday blamed costs of an 
accelerated fiveyear plan to build new stores and renovate older 
ones for a 205 million loss in its fourth quarter 
chairman joseph e antonini said recently that costs of speeding 
up the 23billion expansion and renovation program now scheduled 
for completion in 1994 would cut into profits at the nations 
secondlargest retailer 
he said thursday that pricecutting and completing the expansion 
program were essential to keeping competitors at bay we 
anticipate sales and earnings in future years will benefit 
significantly from the acceleration of this program antonini 
said 
but analysts suggested the retailer is feeling pressure i 
think they feel that were going to lose confidence quickly if they 
dont make some kind of dramatic move said analyst sally schaadt 
at new yorkbased fourteen research 
k mart said its results translated to a loss of 10 cents a share 
for quarter ended jan 31 compared with a net profit of 3932 
million or 196 a share in the yearago quarter 
revenue for the period totaled 975 billion up 16 percent from 
842 billion the year before 
the company took an aftertax charge of 4161 million during 
the quarter to cover the restructuring program said spokesman 
orren f knauer without the charge k mart said fourthquarter 
earnings would have been 3956 million or 197 a share 
for the fiscal year profits fell 60 percent to 3227 million 
or 161 a share from 8029 or 4 a share revenue was up 8 
percent at 2953 billion compared with yearearlier revenue of 
273 billion 
the figures included a 4225 million aftertax charge in 
connection with the construction and renovation program 
k mart is the nations largest retailer after sears roebuck and 
co but no 3 walmart stores inc has surpassed k mart in 
profits recently reporting 11 billion in 1989 earnings on sales 
of 258 billion 
we have already opened several prototype stores and have 
enlarged and relocated many of our stores antonini said 
customer acceptance of the layouts fixturing and new merchandise 
assortments has been very good and sales results have exceeded 
expectations 
k mart also said thursday its february sales were up 147 
percent from february 1989 and sales on a comparable store basis 
for stores open at least one year were up 44 percent 
antonini said the increase included strong gains in clothing 
lines

currency trading was lackluster worldwide the day never 
really got started said bob morrissey a senior trader with the

traders said only one factor dampened activity the threat of 
central bank intervention dealers were surprised on wednesday when

than once thursday to sell dollars against the japanese yen but 
the action was modest compared with the previous session traders 
said 
still sentiment toward the us currency remains very bullish 
more and more people are seeing that the economy is not doing 
as badly as original expectations so there should be no real 
easing of interest rates morrissey said 
higher interest rates generally support the dollar by enhancing 
the value of fixedincome securities foreign investors typically 
major purchasers of instruments like us government bonds need 
dollars to make their investments 
further evidence of the strength of the us economy will come 
on friday when the labor department issues its unemployment report 
for february the consensus is for nonfarm payrolls to show an 
increase of about 240000 jobs 
separately officials confirmed that finance ministers from the 
group of seven leading industrialized countries will meet in early 
april in paris where they are expected to discuss global currency

imagine a child tv star turned successful movie 
director starting a company with a savvy hollywood producer who 
takes credit for helping launch the careers of michael keaton 
darryl hannah and tom hanks 
add a splash of comic instinct a public stock offering that 
raises 81 million distribution deals with a major film studio and 
a cable tv network 
the result is imagine films entertainment inc an independent 
production company created and cochaired by director ron howard 
and producer brian grazer 
imagine was launched as a public company in july 1986 and seems 
to be entering the 1990s on a steady footing at a time when some 
independents in the field are struggling 
imagines stock traded in the overthecounter market has been 
fetching 1450 a share recently up from around 1050 a year ago 
and a low of 2 after the market collapse in october 1987 the 
company started to turn a profit last september 
weve been incredibly lucky grazer said in a recent 
interview of him and partner howard a longtime friend we raised 
money from the public on no assets 
well not exactly howard and grazer are helping prove that 
talent can be packaged into a marketable security on wall street 
theres a very real strength said christopher dixon an 
analyst who follows the entertainment industry for kidder peabody 
amp co its a group of handson producers and directors who know 
their industry 
howard 35 has directed hit comedy films including night 
shift splash cocoon and parenthood but he is 
probably best known to a generation of tvweaned baby boomers as 
cute little opie on the andy griffith show and later as 
allamerican teenager richie cunningham on happy days 
i tend to be a bit ponderous a bit deliberate about what im 
trying to do where im going howard said sometimes you can 
stall out from that approach brian has great instincts hes a 
great selfstarter 
howard who began his acting career at age 18 months still 
projects the same boynextdoor wholesomeness he had on screen 
though his ginger hair is thinning and his suit is conservative 
bigtime success and his forays into wall street dont seem to 
have jaded him 
grazer 38 has the same ebullience he started his career 
developing tv projects moving into a producing deal with paramount 
pictures in 1980 he admits that in the early days many doors 
slammed on him and his zany ideas 
now the two entrepreneurs make it look easy 
its not that tough grazer replied when asked about the 
duos encounters with investment bankers and other financial 
operatives theyre fascinated with the way we work 
imagines business plan they tell financiers avoids risk the 
los angelesbased company aims to produce mainstream commercial 
films with high visibility high quality and broad appeal 
most importantly imagine has signed a deal with universal 
pictures for universal to distribute as many as 20 films produced 
by imagine and an agreement with showtimethe movie channel for tv 
rights for up to 30 movies that would run in theaters first 
in addition mca inc universals parent has invested 10 
million in imagine securities which give mca the right to convert 
into a 248 percent share of the company howard and grazer each 
own 176 percent of imagines shares 
the deals with universal and showtime a cable tv network owned 
by viacom international inc are designed to give howard and 
grazer extensive outlets for marketing their work without impinging 
on their creative control 
both speak passionately about imagine finishing each others 
sentences in rapid cadence both see hollywood analogies 
everywhere including a recent meeting they had with wall street 
financiers 
it was just like something out of trading places grazer 
said referring to the eddie murphydan aykroyd spoof of commodity 
futures trading 
dont assume howard is responsible for the creative side of the 
company and grazer only takes care of business it was grazer for 
example who came up with the concept for splash an innocent 
mermaid who comes ashore in new york 
so far imagine has produced the burbs starring tom hanks 
the dream team with michael keaton and parenthood 
starring steve martin and directed by howard all three were 
released last year parenthood the most popular and profitable 
of the trio grossed an estimated 96 million 
a newer project is cry baby described as a 1950s musical 
starring johnny depp of tvs 21 jump street due to be released 
in early april opportunity knocks is scheduled for release at 
the end of march and problem child is due later this spring 
in the fall nbc plans to launch a weekly tv series based on 
parenthood produced by imagine and universal 
in george lucass 1973 film american graffiti howard plays 
a high school senior in the throes of selfdiscovery hassled by a 
nitpicking male teacher at a school dance he snaps why dont 
you go kiss a duck or something 
with imagine howard seems to have told the conventional 
moviemaking establishment to do the same but this time hes hedged 
his recklessness by buttressing the company with solid financial 
backing

livestock and meat prices surged thursday for the third 
consecutive session at the chicago mercantile exchange amid 
concerns about tight hog supplies 
on other futures markets grains rallied but gold energy 
products and orange juice contracts all declined 
at the chicago merc the frozen pork bellies contract for 
delivery in march rose the daily limit of 2 cents after four 
contracts posted the maximum increases allowed in the previous 
session 
the market is reflecting an insufficent supply of hogs to 
satisfy packer needs said chuck levitt an analyst for shearson 
lehman hutton inc packers simply dont have the hogs they need 
and the consumer and investor are paying more 
the advance in cattle prices was mainly a spillover from the 
strong pork complex he said 
cattle settled 30 cent to 70 cent higher with the contract 
for delivery in april at 7727 cents a pound feeder cattle were 
25 cent to 85 cent higher with march at 8187 cents a pound 
live hogs were 05 cent to 65 cent higher with april at 5207 
cents a pound and frozen pork bellies were 37 cent to 200 cents 
higher with march at 5095 cents a pound 
frozen orange juice futures fell on the new york cotton exchange 
in one of the few down days since the december freeze in florida 
shearsons judy ganes blamed the drop on profittaking 
she also said that a florida growers report originally thought 
by traders to be 3 million boxes shy of the us agriculture 
department estimate last month left some traders wednesday with 
the wrong impression 
the growers figure didnt include 3 million navel oranges and 
gift fruit but matched the usdas estimate in other areas she 
explained 
frozen concentrate orange juice settled 10 cent to 100 cent 
lower with the contract for delivery in march at 190 a pound 
soybean and grain futures finished higher after opening slightly 
lower on the chicago board of trade 
purchases by iraqi investors in the soymeal cash market and 
rumors of chinese interest in soyoil helped push soybean prices 
higher said analyst mark weidner of cargill investor services inc 
wheat staged a late rally on news of chinas bid for 400000 
metric tons of us export bonus wheat and corn followed suit 
traders said 
wheat settled 2 cents to 3 cents higher with the contract for 
march at 383 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents higher with 
march at 242 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher 
with march at 145 a bushel and soybeans were 4 cents to 7 cents 
higher with march at 581 a bushel 
oil prices sagged for a third straight session on the new york 
mercantile exchange 
randall rothenberg an energy market analyst from dean witter 
reynolds inc said selling momentum overseas carried over into 
us trading 
crude oil settled 11 cents to 18 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in april at 2078 a barrel heating oil was 01 cent 
to 85 cent lower with april at 5534 cents a gallon and unleaded 
gasoline was 25 cent to 88 cent lower with april at 5614 cents 
a gallon 
a stronger us dollar sent gold and silver futures lower on the 
commodity exchange in new york 
gold settled 20 cents to 50 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in march at 400 a troy ounce while silver was 1 cent to 
12 cents lower with march at 511

the federal communications commission taking 
another big step towards a deregulated interstate longdistance 
phone business proposed thursday to loosen rules on atampt because 
the onetime monopoly company now faces significant competition 
the commission in a 40 vote adopted a staff proposal that if 
finally approved would give the american telephone amp telegraph co 
the freedom it says it needs to maneuver against some 500 
longdistance companies in the 55 billion longdistance 
marketplace 
the commission said it would study competition in the interstate 
longdistance arena and adopt necessary regulatory reforms but it 
tentatively concluded interstate services as a whole are now 
subject to significant competition and that competition in the 
provision of business services is particularly vigorous a key 
finding that must be made to deregulate atampt 
based on those conclusions the commission proposed a phasedin 
package of changes in certain business services extending later to 
800number services international calling and operator services 
the commission decided not to propose any changes to residential 
and small business services at this time 
the proposals are a victory for atampt which the fcc formally 
declared in 1981 as a dominant carrier that should be subject 
to regulation to prevent abuses to competitors or customers atampt 
won another victory last year when the fcc dumped its 20yearold 
rateofreturn regulation of atampts profits in exchange for a 
system that controls atampts prices within certain limits tied to 
the rate of inflation 
atampt has argued that it no longer is dominant and that it has 
lost 10 billion in business to competitors since the 1984 breakup 
of the old bell system prices have fallen 40 percent and its share 
of the longdistance market has dropped below 70 percent mci now 
has about 12 percent of the business us sprint about 9 percent 
and the rest is scattered among hundreds of smaller companies 
atampts arguments apparently fell on fertile ground at an fcc 
under new chairman alfred sikes who believes there is too much 
government intervention in the phone business 
the changes in market shares reflect the fact that competition 
has worked sikes said thursday 
sikes also said earlier this year the fcc would drop 
rateofreturn regulation on the interstate revenues of local 
telephone companies in 1991 and the commission issued proposed 
guidelines thursday for this new price cap regime 
besides capping prices the plan also would require the local 
phone companies to share any earnings above a certain level with 
customers 
atampt applauded the proposals for longdistance carriers saying 
the commission took a major step toward shaping policies based 
not on outdated orthodoxy but on future flexibility the fccs 
proposal validates atampts premise that everyone gains when all 
competitors are free to anticipate and meet customer needs 
competitors were less pleased with mci saying that while it too 
welcomed the fcc inquiry the fcc clearly recognizes that 
atampt can leverage its dominance to abuse competitors 
sprint said it was generally pleased with the fccs approach 
and that the fcc was appropriately moving towards deregulation 
where rules no longer are needed 
under current regulations atampt must make a public filing with 
the fcc each time it proposes to offer a new service or change the 
terms and conditions under which it offers any service already 
sanctioned by the fcc 
atampt says the public disclosure of its offerings and the length 
of time it takes to get fcc approval puts it at a disadvantage in 
todays fastmoving telecommunications marketplace 
the fcc apparently agreed proposing a streamlined filing 
process that would allow atampt to give one days notice for certain 
business services without submitting the cost data now required 
atampt also would be freed of some provisions of the new price 
cap regime the fcc imposed last year 
the fcc also proposed that atampt be permitted to offer certain 
business services to individual customers as long as they file 
contracts and summaries of their provisions within 30 days of the 
effective date of the contract 
the commission also proposed that all longdistance carriers be 
permitted to withdraw some of their facilities from the public 
phone network for use by private businesses 
the commission will ask public comment on its proposals and the 
opposition is expected to be strong from those who say atampt still 
has enormous market power and is likely to gain even more clout 
if it is deregulated

witnesses at a congressional hearing on junk 
bonds warned thursday that defaults in the highrisk securities 
were likely to grow but did not necessarily think congress should 
act to restrict them 
representatives from the bond rating agencies moodys investors 
service and standard amp poors corp were among those testifying 
about the future and possible dangers of junk bonds before a 
subcommittee of the house energy and committee 
a junk bond is a shaky debt it is the promise to pay of a 
debtor who is just getting by said james grant editor of the 
newsletter grants interest rate observer 
bonds are in effect corporate promises to pay back borrowed 
money at a later date while paying a regular fixed interest junk 
bonds however are noninvestment grade meaning that rating 
services like sampp or moodys give them a greater chance of default 
than more stable investment grade bonds to compensate they pay a 
much higher interest yield 
pioneered by financier michael milken at the firm of drexel 
burnham lambert inc junk bonds helped a number of small or 
fledgling companies expand while also assisting corporate raiders 
in financing huge corporate takeovers with little upfront cash 
but the 200 billion junk bond market has been rocked repeatedly 
in recent months by milkens indictment on racketeering charges 
defaults by corporate junk borrowers the withdrawal of many 
savings and loan institutions as buyers of the securities and the 
bankruptcy filing by drexels parent company 
the subcommittees chairman rep edward markey dmass said 
there were questions about whether plunging prices in the junk 
market and the collapse of drexel had endangered the longterm 
health of us companies that rely on highyield financing 
the risks of the junk bond market have been exaggerated by the 
press said david wyss chief financial economist with 
drimcgrawhill adding that drexels demise is a symptom of the 
problems in the market more than a cause of new problems 
thomas j mcguire director of moodys corporate department 
said the default rate for speculativegrade bonds which includes 
junk bonds has risen to 54 percent the secondhighest rate since 
1970 
and the outlook given the increase in lower rated issuers 
and the potentially unfavorable economic environment is for still 
higher levels of defaults in the early 1990s mcguire said 
mark bachman senior vice president of sampps corporate finance 
department said current problems in the junk bond market are by 
no means inherent in the nature of all noninvestment grade bonds 
but rather stem from the excess of financial leverage that came to 
characterize junk bonds issuers in the late 1980s 
both grant and wyss cautioned against trying to correct the junk 
bond market through legislation 
i would advise the subcommittee to be wary of pushing the 
market toward even greater stringency said grant 
legislation is more likely to worsen than help the problem 
said wyss leverage is a response to the incentives in the tax 
law and unless those incentives change attacking the symptoms 
will just cause problems elsewhere
