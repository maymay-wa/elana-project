chinese cities will begin offering direct 
subsidies to urban residents to help them cope with the soaring 
prices of pork and other food the official china daily said 
thursday 
in shanghai where vegetable prices almost doubled in the first 
three months of this year residents will each receive a monthly 
subsidy of 10 yuan about 270 as of may 1 the report said 
people living in beijing will receive a similar subsidy starting 
sometime in the next few months it said 
the direct stipends replace government subsidies to state food 
shops designed to keep food prices at an artificially low level 
that system has proved ineffective in stopping price increases as 
consumers demand more and better food and farmers turn to free 
markets where their goods command better prices 
the daily said that starting this month changsha city in 
southern china has subsidized residents 10 yuan a month for four 
main nonstaple goods pork vegetables sugar and eggs 
since then the price for fresh pork at state stores has risen 
from about 40 cents to 56 cents a pound and sugar has gone up from 
18 cents to 27 cents a pound 
retail prices nationwide rose 11 percent in the first quarter 
the first time the government has acknowledged doubledigit 
inflation prices of nonstaple food items increased by 244 
percent and vegetables jumped by 487 percent in the same period

about 17000 people many waving japanese flags 
braved a drizzling rain friday to give birthday greetings to 
87yearold emperor hirohito the worlds oldest and 
longestreigning monarch 
accompanied by crown prince akihito and princess michiko and 
other members of the imperial family the emperor made the first of 
three scheduled appearances on a veranda overlooking a cheering 
crowd in the imperial palace grounds missing was empress nagako 
85 who suffers back and leg ailments 
hirohito protected by bulletproof glass said in a brief 
speech thank you for celebrating my birthday with me today i am 
happy that so many of you have come today i hope you will all have 
a happy future 
his birthday is a national holiday 
it was the emperors second appearance in public since he was 
hospitalized last september after complaining of fatigue and 
nausea doctors performed a bypass then around an intestinal 
obstruction 
hirohito once worshiped as a living god also spoke to 
wellwishers at the palace grounds on new years day 
despite a slow recovery after the operation and rumors of ill 
health hirohito appeared relatively strong friday although he 
shuffled slowly as he walked commentators on japanese television 
said he seemed to have regained about 90 percent of the strength he 
had before the operation 
the crowd shouted long live the emperor and waved flags 
hirohito gave his characteristic frontandback hand wave in 
response 
after about 2 minutes the imperial family filed back into the 
palace led by the emperor 
hirohito has been on the throne since dec 25 1926 
he told a news conference this week he feels well after his 
surgery and needs years more to finish research in marine biology 
his favorite hobby 
hirohito said he had replanted an endangered plant species on 
the palace grounds and it is growing well because the imperial 
garden is similar to forest land 
the emperor also remarked that world war ii was his most 
unpleasant memory and urged the japanese to pursue peace 
the remarks were carried in japanese by the kyodo news service 
and translated by the associated press the annual news conference 
reduced from its usual 30 minutes to 15 because of concern about 
the emperors health took place monday but the reports were not 
released until his birthday 
i have recovered well i respect a doctors advice and am 
trying not to overdo it he said 
asked by the japanese reporters about his memories of world war 
ii the emperor said after all is considered the war was my 
most unpleasant memory i am pleased with peoples efforts for 
peace after the war hereafter i hope the people do not forget 
this matter and protect peace 
he would not say say what caused japan to go to war declaring 
i do not want to answer the question because this will involve 
criticism against persons 
in meetings with foreign reporters the emperor has expressed 
sorrow for certain things that happened in the war but said he 
acted as a constitutional monarch and had no personal role he 
denied planning the attack on pearl harbor but left many other 
questions unanswered 
foreign reporters were not allowed at the birthday news 
conference during which he answered eight questions 
hirohito praised yoshihiro tokugawa his former grand 
chamberlain who retired this month at age 81 after serving more 
than half a century 
he protected recordings of the emperors announcement of the 
defeat in the war the emperor said with his language 
abilities he prepared well for my friendly visits to europe and 
the united states 
soldiers entered the imperial palace aug 15 1945 planning to 
seize the recording so the war could continue tokugawa was beaten 
with a pistol but refused to say where it was hidden 
when the recording was finally played it was the first time 
most japanese had heard their emperors voice 
in it he urged his people to open an era of grand peace for 
the generations to come by suffering the insufferable bearing the 
unbearable he did not use the words surrender or defeat

a car careened across a playground and plowed 
into a crowd of children and adults about to leave an elementary 
school thursday killing a 4yearold girl and a woman and injuring 
eight others officials said 
at least four of the injured were in critical condition 
i called for 10 ambulances said jim crowe principal at 
cyrus h mccormick elementary school i told them there were 
bodies all over the playground 
witnesses said the car crashed through a chainlink fence and 
careened across the playground before running up a short flight of 
stairs to where the crowd was gathered in an entryway at the school 
i was standing outside the school picking up my son when i 
turned my head and saw the car coming towards the door said 
marcella diaz 30 whose children ages 8 and 5 attend the school 
i just screamed and picked up my son with my hands and ran away 
the car missed us by a yard and a half 
there were mothers screaming looking for their children 
said araceli hernandez whose niece lives with her and attends the 
school almost every child that was on the floor had their mother 
next to them 
the principal said the car pinned a child and an adult beneath 
it 
myself and a couple of the teachers and a janitor picked the 
car up and freed the bodies so they wouldnt be further crushed 
he said 
a woman driver reportedly left the car and walked from the 
scene the car still wedged in the entryway 
patrolman richard spielman said police were questioning a woman 
who was picked up in the neighborhood minutes after the accident 
no cause was given for the accident 
reuben fuentes a student at mccormick said the car belonged to 
his family and that his mother apparently had come to the school to 
pick him up i got on my bus i just saw my car i dont know 
where my mother is he said 
a 4yearold girl and a woman died at cook county and mount 
sinai hospitals spokeswomen said 
in critical condition in cook county hospital were a 7yearold 
boy and a 10yearold girl both with head injuries and two 
children ages 6 and 9 with leg fractures a 7yearold boy with 
head injuries was in fair condition 
a 29yearold parent was hit by the car and thrown into air but 
escaped serious injury said mount sinai spokeswoman dianne smith 
two children ages 6 and 5 were taken to the hospital one had 
head and neck injuries and was expected to be released and the 
other had bumps and bruises and was in good condition ms smith 
said 
the car smashed into the entrance where the kids were coming 
out said rose cepak 78 who lives nearby 
thirdgrade teacher james e bailey said he saw a youngster

separatist guerrillas who kidnapped 
23 lawmen freed an antiterrorism expert on thursday and ordered 
him to negotiate on behalf of the terrorists authorities said 
capt philippe legorjus chief of the french antiterrorism 
force in this frenchheld territory was released from a cave on 
the island of ouvea and told to pursue negotiations with french 
authorities official sources in noumea said 
they threatened to kill their remaining hostages if he did not 
return to the rebel hideaway a system of caves 110 miles north of 
here 
legorus five police officers and an assistant prosecutor were 
seized by the melanesian separatists wednesday as they sought to 
negotiate the release of 15 other lawmen who had been kidnapped on 
april 22 
the initial hostages were among 27 people kidnapped in a bloody 
attack at a police station that left four gendarmes dead twelve of 
those hostages subsequently were freed 
the attack was part of widespread violence aimed at halting 
sundays french presidential elections on the island 
police said all the remaining hostages are being held in the 
ouvea caves 
the melanesian separatists known as kanaks released legorjus 
to negotiate with french authorities in fayaoue a village on 
ouvea legorjus made at least one trip by helicopter from the cave 
on thursday 
when you open talks you take risks defense minister andre 
giraud responsible for order in the pacific archipelego said in 
paris 
meanwhile bernard pons minister for overseas territories said 
in noumea that he has asked the government to outlaw the kanak 
socialist liberation front which is seeking new caledonias 
independence from france 
it appears now that there is collusion between terrorist acts 
carried out in certain parts of the territory including the taking 
of hostages on ouvea and the kanak political group pons said 
membership in a banned group is a crime under french law 
in paris conservative premier jacques chirac referred to the 
kanak front as a terrorist faction that does not represent the 
new caledonian population 
i will do everything so that this group is reduced he said 
during a televised debate with socialist president francois 
mitterrand his rival in presidential runoff elections may 8 
what counts today is the liberation of the gendarmes and 
judicial offical mitterrand said but what counts tomorrow is 
dialogue 
chirac did not clearly say whether he supported outlawing the 
front 
such a ban must be voted by the cabinet which meets again 
wednesday mitterrand would have to sign the decree to make it law 
yeiwene yeiwene the no 2 leader in the kanak political group 
said banning the organization would not settle the crisis in new 
caledonia and will not stop the kanak people from taking the fight 
for independence to its end 
since friday last week electionrelated violence has left six 
people dead on new caledonia and at least 10 wounded 
native melanesians make up 43 percent of the population of 
145000 while 36 percent are europeans and the rest primarily 
asian or tahitian 
many kanaks desire independence while most europeans wish to 
retain ties to france 
an estimated 4000 french troops and gendarmes are in new 
caledonia 
a french police officer was shot thursday near canala on the 
east coast of the mainland according to the national police 
headquarters in paris he was listed in good condition at a noumea 
hospital 
the kidnappers have demanded the removal of police 
reinforcements from the islands they asked that mediators be sent 
from paris to discuss a new referendum on selfdetermination

in a swirl of old lace and memories about 
100 former residents and 300 relatives gathered wednesday to mark 
the night a halfcentury ago when four western massachusetts towns 
were submerged to provide drinking water for boston 
robert garvey the high sheriff of hampshire county dressed in 
top hat and tails and holding the 7foot mace of his office called 
the dance to order and read a proclamation from gov michael 
dukakis declaring 1988 a year of remembrance 
we had to limit ticket sales to 400 thats all the hall would 
hold said terry campbell secretary of a consortium of local 
historical societies that sponsored the remembrance ball at the 
university of massachusetts 
the dance tickets reprinted the blackbordered tickets to the 
firemens ball in 1938 at the enfield town hall where residents 
met to mark the last hours of the towns that were drowned to create 
the 38squaremile quabbin reservoir 
their steps might be slower and their hair turned silver but 
for former residents many in their 70s and 80s the memory was 
still fresh of that night when people jammed the little brick town 
hall hung with red white and blue bunting and draped in black 
and spilled into the streets 
the orchestra faintly sounded the strain of auld land 
syne muffled sounds of sobbing were heard hardened men were 
not ashamed to take out their handkerchiefs the springfield 
morning union reported in 1938 
fifty years later 38 people who attended the enfield party held 
hands and marched around the hall their reminiscences jotted down 
on their dance programs were read aloud between dance tunes 
we went to school at the enfield town hall we lived in the 
center of town thats the deepest part of the reservoir now 
said joy dickenson boch 
the towns of dana prescott enfield and greenwich home for 
2500 people were submerged at midnight april 27 1938 the 
reservoir took 20 years to build and cost 53 million and the lives 
of more than 20 workers 
it now provides drinking water for 25 million people half of 
the states population although its not the largest reservoir in 
the united states none larger has been built strictly to provide 
drinking water

a judge wednesday ordered the government to 
pay 42 million to a truck driver left braindamaged and paralyzed 
in 1984 when he was hit by a piece of nasa equipment being loaded 
onto his flatbed trailer 
us district judge robert m takasugi ruled that nasa employees 
were negligent in the accident involving gary spitzke 57 of 
suburban diamond bar 
the accident left spitzke a quadriplegic in need of 24hour 
care said his attorney howard krepack 
spitzke was working as a driver for a heavy equipment hauling 
company when the accident happened at a national aeronautics and 
space administration research facility near san jose krepack said 
the veteran trucker was helping to load a cargo lift trailer 
which is used in the space shuttle program onto his flatbed truck 
for transport to a southern california defense contractor when the 
load shifted and rotated knocking him off the flatbed krepack 
said 
the judgment was satisfactory to spitzke and his wife susan 
the attorney said 
they would prefer that it never happened or the 
alternative that they can make him well but unfortunately that 
cant be done he said

four hollywood unions spent 68 
million on treatment for 138 aids patients by early this year but 
a representative of producers and studios says the problem is no 
worse than in other industries 
nicholas counter iii president of the alliance of motion 
picture and television producers said wednesday he was sure that 
the figures from union health insurance funds were understated 
because some aids insurance claims may be reported as related 
diseases rather than aids 
counters remarks represent the first time anyone has attempted 
to compile statistics on the number of aids patients whose care is 
being paid by health insurance funds serving the entertainment 
industrys five major unions 
but he dismissed fears that aids can be spread by casual 
contact including on movie and television filming sets and said 
he was convinced the deadly disease which cripples the bodys 
immune system cannot be spread by socalled deep kissing by 
actors and actresses 
i dont see that this problem is any worse or any less in our 
industry than in all industries counter said at a conference 
titled managing aids at work 
he urged entertainment unions and companies to wage war on 
this disease on four fronts education prevention research and 
care 
the insurer providing coverage for one of the industrys five 
funds the american federation of television and radio artists 
aftra health and retirement funds refused to provide statistics 
on the number of its 22000 members who have aids or the cost of 
their care said alliance government affairs specialist dan 
goldberg who compiled the statistics for counter 
the 138 patients reported by midfebruary and the 6821000 
cost of caring for them represent statistics reported by insurance 
funds for the other four major hollywood union health funds 
counter said 
scientists say acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread by 
intimate sexual contact the sharing of needles by intravenous drug 
abusers and when passed from mothers to their unborn children

a new hightemperature record for 
superconductivity in materials that lack copper has raised hopes 
that such substances may one day make superconductivity practical 
scientists reported today 
a mix of potassium barium bismuth and oxygen showed evidence 
of superconductivity at about minus 406 degrees fahrenheit 
researchers from atampt bell laboratories reported in the british 
journal nature 
that temperature essentially equals the 1986 mark that focused 
world attention on superconductivity but it is well behind the 
current record for materials that contain copper the chief focus 
of superconductivity research 
superconductivity is the ability of some materials to conduct 
electricity without resistance improved superconductors could lead 
to powerful computers highspeed floating trains and other 
advances scientists say 
so far all known materials must be supercooled to 
superconduct and that limits their use so scientists are trying 
to find superconductors that work at higher temperatures even room 
temperature 
since the 1986 report of superconductivity at about minus 406 
degrees researchers have used copper compounds to superconduct at 
minus 243 degrees 
the performance by a copperfree compound indicates a whole 
new ballfield for study said paul fleury of bell laboratories 
still higher temperatures for copperfree compounds may yet be 
attained said bob laudise of bell labs 
the work shows copper can be replaced and by a broader list of 
potential ingredients than many theories would have predicted 
laudise said 
with so many possibilities the chances of getting something 
that will have all the desirable properties in one material will be 
enlarged he said 
those properties include ease of fabrication into wires and 
other devices and the ability to retain superconductivity while 
exposed to high currents or high magnetic fields he said 
the materials atomic structure suggests it may have one 
practical advantage over other known superconductors laudise said 
copperbased superconductors work best when the electrical 
current runs parallel to their stacked layers of copper and oxygen 
atoms but the new material has no such layers 
instead bismuth and oxygen atoms form interconnected sheets 
that extend along all three dimensions that suggests that it may 
carry current equally well in all three dimensions which could 
simplify making superconducting wires and other products laudise 
said 
studies of the earlier compounds had concluded that the 
copperoxygen layers were essential for their superconductivity 
the new material shows those layers are not always needed 
although the temperature in copperfree compounds may go higher if 
researchers can create bismuthoxygen layers said fleury 
the finding is likely to give us a much better insight into 
the nature of hightemperature superconductivity than would 
emerge from studying just the materials with copper he said 
the bell researchers were led by robert cava and bertram batlogg 
other superconductivity experts said the reports importance 
will depend on whether copperfree materials can perform as well as 
previous superconductors 
the more ingredients that can be used the better the chance of 
finding a roomtemperature superconductor said physics professor 
arthur j freeman of northwestern university this is a first 
step and a good one he said 
once again it just tells me weve just seen the tip of the 
iceberg for superconducting materials said brian maple of the 
university of california san diego

the agriculture department plans to act 
quickly on a federal judges order to rewrite its rules excluding 
sugar cane as a perishable commodity 
rewriting the rules could open the way for thousands of foreign 
field workers to become legal us residents an avenue barred to 
them if usdas original definition of sugar cane as a 
nonperishable crop were allowed to stand 
department officials said wednesday the courts decision was 
under review and modified regulations could be expedited although 
they declined to give a timetable 
us district judge thomas f hogan in a ruling released 
tuesday said the department arbitrarily and capriciously 
excluded sugar cane from the perishables list and to conduct 
further proceedings to determine the crops status 
the decision resulted from a lawsuit filed on behalf of sugar 
cane workers 
under the immigration reform and control act of 1986 the usda a 
year ago defined fruits vegetables and other perishable 
commodities which are produced as a result of seasonal field work 
the laws special agricultural worker or saw program allowed 
temporary legal resident status for foreign workers who formerly 
helped in the us production of designated perishable crops the 
law also provided avenues for alien workers to become us citizens 
by the departments definition those crops not only included 
fruit and vegetables but also wheat sugar beets and a number of 
other commodities sugar cane was excluded from the list of 
perishables 
hogan said al french the departments chief labor specialist in 
the development of the regulations had relied on a telephone call 
to a usda economist to determine the category of sugar cane as a 
crop despite the extensive written record on the matter 
based on this conversation and his own personal knowledge 
regarding the harvesting and labor practices in the sugar cane 
industry mr french concluded that sugar cane was outside the 
scope of perishable commodities hogan said 
the agency he added rejected the impact of weather condition 
on crops because of the difficulty in measuring the impact or the 
overinclusive nature of such a criterion 
french has been a special assistant for labor in usda since jan 
12 1987 and had held previous posts in florida with usda the 
florida farm bureau and as a labor relations consultant with 
management research institute 
although he declined to predict just when usda would make the 
changes to comply with the court decision french said were not 
going to drag our feet on this 
the sugar cane revision could be handled internally by the 
department or could involve a public hearing he said

federal quarantine restrictions to prevent the 
further spread of tiny bee mites have been reduced in mississippi 
and washington 
however the tiny killer mites varroa jacobsoni still remain 
a potential threat to the us bee industry the agriculture 
department said wednesday all or parts of 13 states remain under 
federal quarantine restrictions 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the revision for mississippi 
and washington retains only that portion of each state that must 
be quarantined to keep the varroa mite from spreading 
glosser said the statewide quarantine in mississippi was reduced 
to parts of adams franklin and wilkinson counties while the 
washington quarantine area was reduced to part of klickitat county 
varroa mites were discovered in the united states last september 
in a wisconsin apiary since then they have been found in 12 other 
states florida illinois maine michigan mississippi nebraska 
new york ohio pennsylvania south carolina south dakota and 
washington 
the original federal quarantine was effective on april 6 and 
restricted the interstate movement of bees and bee equipment from 
all 13 states 
glosser said the change in the original quarantine was partly 
because both mississippi and washington are enforcing restrictions 
on the movement of bees and bee equipment within their own borders 
the mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their 
developing larvae or brood it causes decreased brood deformed 
bees and a weakening of the colonys ability to pollinate plants 
and produce honey infestation can occur so gradually that the 
mites may not be noticed until severe damage is done

the agriculture department says a highly 
contagious viral disease of poultry and other fowl has been found 
in pet birds in michigan and nevada 
no domestic poultry has been involved in the outbreak james w 
glosser administrator of the departments animal and plant health 
inspection service said wednesday 
but laboratory tests confirmed exotic newcastle disease in a 
threeweekold spectacled amazon parrot and in a young yellownaped 
parrot owned by private individuals he said 
the birds and a number of others that were exposed to the 
infected birds were destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease 
glosser said the birds premises in west bloomfield mich and 
las vegas nev were placed under state quarantines federal and 
state authorities are tracing the disease to determine if 
additional birds or premises may have been exposed 
exotic newcastle disease can cause death rates of 50 percent to 
95 percent in poultry flocks officials say the disease poses no 
risk to humans who eat poultry or eggs but in some cases people 
who handle infected birds can contract the virus which in humans 
causes temporary eye inflammation and mild flulike symptoms

liberace could barely carry on a 
conversation in the two weeks before he died and was gravely ill 
the day he signed his revised will a nurse who cared for the 
glitzy entertainer testified wednesday 
the pianist couldnt even find his way back to bed from the 
bathroom on the day of the signing nurse norma garber said at a 
hearing on a request by associates of liberaces to remove joel 
strote as executor of his estate 
the testimony contradicted that of strote liberaces attorney 
who said that liberace sat at a table jan 22 1987 talking with 
him and going over the estate papers before signing them the 
papers named strote executor 
hed say yes to anything to please at that point said 
gerber he just wanted to please anyone and be left alone 
gerber said she cared for liberace from the day he signed the 
will until he died of aids 13 days later on feb 5 1987 liberace 
could not put on his glasses or hold a book during his dying days 
at his palm springs home she said 
he couldnt have a conversation he was too sick the motor 
coordination was going so hed have difficulty speaking she 
said he was so childlike he didnt know what he was saying 
the five seeking to have strote removed liberaces sister his 
former manager two housekeepers and a longtime friend were given 
a total of 1 million in the will the terms of which were made 
public wednesday

deathbed will strote drew up than in a will liberace executed in 
1982 liberace also left 50000 in trust to take care of his seven 
dogs which he often referred to as his babies 
strote has estimated the value of the estate at 11 million his 
manager of 37 years seymoour heller has estimated the figure at 
20 million

trusts he said he had liberace examined by a doctor first and the 
doctor was convinced liberace was in good condition and could 
understand the documents 
i wanted to make sure he was physically able to go through the 
documents and understand them strote said

at a fourth document a living will that would allow doctors to 
remove life support systems if they became necessary he said i 
just cant sign this strote recalled

entertainers assets and cutting expenditures which he said were 
running 100000 to 200000 a month more than the estate was 
generating 
i wanted to liquidate the property while his image and

privately owned housing for the poor could 
almost disappear within 15 years as owners default on mortgage 
payments or convert property to highrent apartments and 
condominiums a bipartisan commission says 
the national lowincome housing preservation commission said 
wednesday in a report to house and senate housing subcommittees 
that the cheapest way to ensure the poor have housing is to 
preserve and even fix up the current housing stock 
it suggested that the federal government earmark 113 billion 
over the next 15 years to keep owners from converting the housing 
and to help owners who are having trouble making mortgage payments 
an additional 64 billion should go toward continuing federal 
subsidies the commission said it also recommended an office 
should be set up within the department of housing and urban 
development to deal only with the issue 
everyone talks about the homeless as the tip of the iceberg 
said linda parke gallagher executive director of the commission 
we have described the iceberg we are going to have a new 
generation of the homeless 
gallagher said 70 percent of the people living in the subsidized 
housing have incomes below 50 percent of the median for their area 
these are very poor people she said 
if the stock of privately owned subsidized housing should dry 
up the poor may have no other housing options she said 
much of this countrys lowincome housing was built in the 1960s 
and early 1970s some of it is federally owned some stateowned 
the commission in the report called preventing the 
disappearance of lowincome housing discusses only privately 
owned properties subsidized by hud with mortgages insured by the 
federal housing administration that amounts to about 645000 units 
the commission argues that without federal action owners of 43 
percent or 280000 units will default and an additional 38 
percent 243000 units will prepay their mortgages in the next 
15 years 
gallagher along with an hud spokesman said the federal 
government in the past has had to deal with scattered cases of 
defaults 
both gallagher and hud spokesman thomas denery said that there 
also have been numerous instances of prepayments of mortgages by 
owners who want to free their properties from hud restrictions and 
rent or sell to higherincome people 
gallagher said the prepayment problem has been especially 
prevalent in boston new york philadelphia washington and 
california 
but the commission concludes that both the prepayments and 
defaults will accelerate in the next decade as federal rent subsidy 
contracts expire 
also accelerating the trend is the new federal income tax law 
which removed many of the tax incentives for investing in such 
housing 
everyone dealing with the project was surprised at the 
projected level of default gallagher said add that together 
with the prepayments and we see the number of units of lowincome 
housing going steadily downward 
demery who is assistant secretary for housing and federal 
housing commissioner said he supports the commissions basic 
premise that it is better to preserve existing housing for the 
poor rather than build new housing 
he also complimented the commission for trying to look at 
lowercost solutions to the problem although he suggested that 
there may be even less expensive ways 
demery said he opposes the commissions recommendation that a 
separate office to set up inside hud to deal with preserving the 
privately owned lowincome housing 
ive had people specializing in this for a year and a half 
he said the issue also has the focus and attention of an 
assistant secretary

as he comes closer and closer to being a 
former president ronald reagans thoughts seem to be turning to 
the men who have held the nations highest office before him 
in recent speeches reagan has invoked the memory of abraham 
lincoln john quincy adams lyndon johnson and theodore roosevelt 
to make serious or humorous points or both 
all presidents refer to their predecessors from time to time 
either favorably or not 
by custom each president gets to pick the pictures of former 
presidents that hang in the cabinet room reagan for instance 
replaced harry s truman with calvin coolidge 
now the president who leaves office next jan 20 is quoting 
the wit and wisdom of presidents past recalling how they dealt 
with the press and with their cabinets 
on march 22 addressing republican local officials at the white 
house reagan related a story that he said lincoln told when he 
found all but one of his cabinet officers were against him on an 
issue 
the story was about a man who fell asleep during a revival 
meeting just before the minister said all of you who are on the 
side of the lord stand up 
as the man slept on the minister intoned all of you who are 
on the side of the devil stand up 
at that point the sleeper awoke stood up and said i didnt 
exactly understand the question parson but ill stand by you to 
the end it does seem were in a hopeless minority 
reagan went on to tell the republicans that they might be in a 
minority among city officials who claim the gop has shorted them 
but their views are the majority beliefs in this united states of 
america 
on march 30 presiding at the swearingin of william l ball iii 
as secretary of the navy reagan told one about theodore roosevelt 
tr he said once told saint peter your choir is weak 
inexcusably weak you should reorganize it at once 
saint peter says all right and gives tr the job 
well said roosevelt ill need 10000 sopranos 10000 
altos and 10000 tenors 
but what about the basses asked saint peter 
dont worry about that said tr ill sing bass 
like roosevelt reagan said balls job now was to be a 
oneman bass section 
on april 13 addressing the american society of newspaper 
editors in washington reagan told stories about john quincy adams 
and lyndon johnson and their dealings with the press 
every morning before dawn adams would hike down to the 
potomac strip off his clothes and swim he said and one 
summer day a woman of the press under orders from her editor 
followed him and after hed plunged into the water she popped 
from the bushes sat on his clothes and demanded an interview and 
she told him that if he tried to wade ashore shed scream so 
adams hld the first press conference up to his neck in water 
i know how he felt 
of johnson he said that once when lbj was coming off the senate 
floor while he was vice president he grabbed a reporter for the 
new york times and shouted you ive been looking for you 
johnson pulled the reporter into his office started haranguing 
him and then about halfway through scribbled a note buzzed his 
secretary and gave it to her 
the secretary returned with another note which johnson glanced 
at and threw away when the reporter finally got away he saw 
johnsons note lying on a desk it said who is this guy im 
talking to anyway

advocates of petroleum development in the 
nations biggest wildlife refuge are gaining ground in congress but 
say they are fighting the clock to get their drilling bill enacted 
this year 
led by the reagan administration and the oil industry the 
advocates won another round against environmental groups on 
wednesday as legislation to allow oil rigs into the arctic national 
wildlife refuge was endorsed by the first house panel to vote on 
the issue 
the bill was approved 179 by the merchant marine subcommittee 
on fisheries and wildlife conservation and the environment setting 
the stage for expected approval next week by the full committee 
earlier this year the senate energy and natural resources 
committee voted 118 for legislation to allow development of the 
potentially extensive oil deposits in the coastal plain of the 19 
millionacre reserve in alaska the bill is awaiting floor debate 
the issue has provoked a major struggle in the 100th congress 
between environmentalists who want no drilling in the refuge and 
those who say the refuge offers the best chance to counter a 
growing national dependence on imported petroleum 
an interior department study says development can be carried out 
in an environmentally sound manner and could produce oil to rival 
the prudhoe bay complex about 70 miles to the west prudhoe bay 
accounts for about 20 percent of us production 
rep don young ralaska one of the major house champions of 
drilling in the refuge said wednesday that time is growing short 
young quoted house speaker jim wright dtexas as saying that 
because of a crowded calendar and time off for political 
conventions and reelection campaigns a drilling bill needs to get 
to the house floor by midjune to ensure approval by congress this 
year 
the house interior committee also has jurisdiction over the 
issue its chairman rep morris udall dariz is sponsoring 
legislation to declare the refuge permanently offlimits to 
petroleum development 
the interior water and power resources subcommittee is not 
planning to hold hearings on refuge legislation until early june 
in the past the interior committee has been more sympathetic to 
environmentalist positions than many other house panels 
the merchant marine subcommittee approved a plan drafted by rep 
walter jones dnc to allow phased oil leasing over a decade but 
bar development in a 260000acre are used for calving by a 
migratory caribou herd 
drilling in the refuge would be exempt from the refuge 
administration act of 1966s requirement that development be 
compatible with a refuges basic purpose of preserving wildlife 
habitat 
that law requires developers to prove compatibility a difficult 
task jones bill however would force opponents of developing the 
coastal plain to prove that such activity would have significant 
and adverse longterm effects on habitat also seen by subcommittee 
lawyers as a difficult task 
the bill would prohibit export of any petroleum extracted from 
the 15 million acre coastal plain and would require any ocean 
transport of this oil to be done on ships registered in the united 
states 
the legislation also would create a new 235 millionacre 
teshekpukutukok national wildlife refuge to the west of prudhoe 
bay and place a fiveyear moratorium on any petroleum leasing in 
the new refuge 
drilling foes repeatedly failed in attempts to amend the bill 
rejected proposals included variations on the theme of putting off 
a decision on the coastal plain until completion of a national 
energy policy study emphasizing conservation and renewables

george voinovich are off on one of the earliest us senate 
campaigns ohio has seen in years with both sides looking beyond 
tuesdays primary to november 
most of ohios incumbent congressmen are getting a free ride in 
their primaries but a hot race is on for the seat of retiring gop 
rep delbert latta and one incumbent democrat has a wellknown 
challenger 
voinovich has no opposition in the republican primary and 
metzenbaum a twoterm democrat is opposed by ralph applegate a 
political newcomer from columbus who has hardly been heard from 
since filing in february 
voinovich who early on admited that metzenbaum had the edge in 
name recognition already has spent more than 1 million much of 
it on media ads 
peter harris metzenbaums campaign manager said the senators 
roughly 840000 in spending this year was proof metzenbaum doesnt 
intend to let the mayor go unanswered 
lattas district seat in rural northwest ohio where democrats 
seldom win anything has drawn the incumbents son robert a 
bowling green attorney into a primary race against state senate 
president paul gillmor of port clinton and rex damschroder of 
fremont 
gillmor is known statewide after 21 years in the senate and an 
unsuccessful bid for governor two years ago 
the younger latta a candidate in his fathers conservative 
image has accused gillmor of being too liberal for the districts 
voters damschroder has raised far less money than either of his 
better known opponents 
in cleveland rep mary rose oakar who seeks her sixth term is 
pitted in the democratic primary against dennis kucinich the 
former cleveland mayor who has attracted large numbers of 
bluecollar votes in the past 
kucinich is relying on name recognition to help him in the

canadian prime minister brian mulroney came to 
washington seeking more us action to reduce the acid rain that he 
likens to dumping garbage on his country but he got no 
promises from president reagan 
during a onehour meeting on wednesday reagan held to the 
administrations 7yearold position that more research is needed 
before targets are set for reducing the pollution blamed for acid 
rain 
mulroney had used the meeting and a subsequent speech to 
congress to renew canadian pleas that the united states follow his 
countrys lead by setting specific pollutionreduction targets and 
timetables 
canadas program will cut pollution levels there to half the 
1980 levels by 1994 mulroney told congress 
but that is only half the solution because the other half of 
our acid rain comes across the border directly from the united 
states falling upon our forests killing our lakes soiling our 
cities mulroney said 
the reagan administration has rebuffed pleas from northeastern 
states as well as canada to set targets and timetables calling 
instead for more scientific investigation to establish the most 
effective cleanup methods before spending money on acid rain 
reduction 
a senior us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
that mulroney gave reagan some private ideas on how they might 
narrow their differences on the issue 
the talks however did not alter the administration view that 
there is little possibility an acid rain accord sought by mulroney 
will be reached before reagan leaves office next january the 
official said 
prior to his washington visit mulroney said the us acidrain 
emissions drifting into his country are tantamount to dumping 
garbage on canada using more elegant language in his speech to 
congress he said in effect the united states is doing the same 
to its own environment 
the one thing acid rain does not do is discriminate he 
said it is despoiling your environment as inexorably as ours it 
is damaging your environment from michigan to maine and threatens 
marine life on the eastern seabord 
he welcomed additional research into ways to reduce emissions 
from coalfired furnaces but said more action is needed 
canada will continue to press fully its case to rid our common 
environment of this blight and we shall perservere until our skies 
regain their purity and our rains recover the gentleness that gives 
life to our forests and streams and we hope the us congress and 
people will respond exactly the same way he said 
the cost of reducing acid rain is substantial but the cost of 
inaction is greater still he added 
while the leaders remained apart on the acid rain issue they 
joined in an appeal to both nations legislatures to ratify the 
uscanada free trade agreement designed to abolish tariffs and 
further enrich what is already the worlds biggest trading 
partnership 
mulroney noted that the united states sells more goods in canada 
than it does to britain france west germany and italy combined 
this is a good balanced and fair agreement the most 
important ever concluded between two trading partners mulroney 
said 
reagan and mulroney also said they do not believe the pact will 
be endangered by reagans threatened veto of a trade bill being 
considered in the senate the official reporting on their meeting 
said 
reagan also gave his permission for the canadian purchase of 
tightlyheld us nuclear submarine technology the canadians are 
considering the purchase of 10 or 12 nuclearpowered attack 
submarines from france or britain if they choose the british 
trafalgar class subs us permission will be required because 
the submarines use american power plants 
an amendment to current uscanadian agreements would also be 
required and thorough capitol hill discussion of the issue is 
likely 
john warner of virginia senior republican on the senate armed 
services committee said the presidents decision to transfer 
classified technology must rest on national security interests not 
political considerations 
he said congress will explore the issue extensively 
reagan and mulroney set aside their differences over acid rain 
and accentuated the positive at a white house state dinner 
wednesday evening reagan lauded his canadian counterpart as a 
good neighbor and a firm friend and mulroney reciprocated by 
calling reagan honest and wise

with a spray of rhetoric the house of 
representatives exterminated a bill that would have made the 
praying mantis south carolinas official insect 
there was little alternative when rep woody aydlette strode to 
the podium with his tongue firmly in cheek and suggested a 
downhome alternative the cockroach 
aydlette noted that the state already had plenty of symbols 
among them a state bird carolina wren a state flower yellow 
jessamine a state dance the shag a state fruit peach and a 
state dog boykin spaniel 
i dont think we need to name anything else but if you are so 
inclined and insistent on naming a bug i submit to your approval 
the cockroach of charleston or the palmetto bug aydlette 
said drawing belly laughs from his colleagues 
this things been around south carolina for 50 or 60 billion 
years and hasnt changed insecticides dont do much to it they 
race these things every year at the college of charleston they do 
fly in formation at night and we have heard tales of them hauling 
off small animals he said 
the charleston republican said he preferred just defeating the 
proposal but insisted on his choice of insect if the discussion 
continued 
the house decided to drop the subject of state symbols 
altogether

ah spring for most of the nation its a 
time of fragrant flowers and verdant renewal in alaska its when 
the ice breaks 
so momentous is the event that since 1917 nenana has held its 
ice classic an opportunity for area residents to predict the exact 
moment of the ice breakup on the tanana river 
this year three anchorage residents shared the 130000 prize 
for being the only ones out of 146300 entries to correctly guess 
when the 3to4footthick ice would begin flowing down the river 
1015 am wednesday 
it kind of took everyone by surprise said wayne taylor 
contest manager its the first time the ice has ever gone out on 
april 27 
the prize was split among dan nicoll a construction worker mac 
davis 43 an accountant and his 62yearold brother harry a 
retired postal worker who lives in sacramento calif the brothers 
have been buying ice classic tickets for about 20 years 
its a real suprise to us because the ice was 46 inches 
thick about 7 to 9 inches above normal taylor said but weve 
had a very warm spring temperatures overnight have been around 42 
degrees you can see the base logs of the tripod now they were 
buried 21 inches into the ice 
last year the ice went out may 5 at 311 pm the 155000 prize 
was split among 19 people

nicaraguan rebel leaders headed into talks 
today with their negotiating position weakened by a split between 
military and political chieftains according to us and other 
sources 
the contra chain of command remains intact only because an 
attempt by veteran rebel leader adolfo calero to oust military 
commander enrique bermudez a week ago was unsuccessful the sources 
said 
the dispute between calero and bermudez has been simmering for 
years and came to a head following the temporary truce signed last 
month by the rebels and nicaraguas leftist government 
a us official said that at a meeting last week in honduras 
the five contra directors split 22 with one abstention on a 
proposal for bermudezs removal another source said he was not 
aware a formal vote had been taken 
bermudez ostensibly takes orders from the fivemember civilian 
directorate but believes he should have more influence over the 
decisionmaking process according to the sources 
calero has maintained that civilian control over the movement is 
essential and sees bermudez as a threat to that objective 
according to a us official it would be a mistake to have 
ousted bermudez because he is the glue which holds the movement 
together with bermudez gone the official said the contras 
would splinter and cease to be a credible fighting force 
the sources all of whom insisted on anonymity said the 
mistrust among the contra leaders is expected to weaken their 
negotiating position at this weeks talks in managua 
although bermudez has expressed support publicly for the peace 
process the sources said he believes the agreement signed a month 
ago put the rebel fighters at a severe disadvantage 
the sandinista government and the contras agreed to a 60day 
ceasefire and to try to negotiate a permanent settlement 
thus far the two sides have agreed on the location of seven 
ceasefire zones to which the contras would transfer once ground 
rules for activities in these areas were spelled out 
but as todays talks were getting under way this remained a key 
area of disagreement and the contras have yet to resettle in the 
designated zones 
meanwhile organization of american states secretary general 
joao baena soares has written to secretary of state george p 
shultz that he believes us food shipments to contra rebels based 
in honduras are illegal 
baena soares is a member of the commission assigned to verify 
compliance with the temporary truce 
the dispute involves 479 million in humanitarian assistance 
approved by congress four weeks ago after the contras and the 
sandinistas signed their agreement 
the us agency for international development was assigned the 
task of managing the aid program and has sent 1256 metric tons of 
food by truck to contra camps in honduras starting last week 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega accused the united states 
last friday of concealing weapons and ammunition in the shipments 
aid denied that allegation asserting the trucks were inspected 
and found to be free of lethal equipment by members of the honduran 
clergy before the trucks departed the honduran capital of 
tegucigalpa 
the sandinista government insists that inspections can be 
carried out only by the verification commission 
in his letter to shultz baena soares said he believes the 
shipments do not fall within the provision of the instruments 
which regulate the deliveries of humanitarian assistance 
an aid official speaking wednesday only on condition of 
anonymity said there was nothing in last months agreement or the 
aid legislation which would preclude delivery of assistance to 
rebels in honduras 
the administration also has been worried about signs of 
increasing hunger among the thousands of rebel fighters many have 
crossed into honduras from nicaragua in recent weeks in search of 
food

house democrats say they are are pushing for 
arms control restrictions opposed by president reagan as a way of 
keeping the lid on the nuclear arms race 
but republicans such as rep william broomfield rmich argue 
that the restrictions have long been overtaken by events 
the fight is over democraticbacked proposals which are being 
considered as the house debates and votes on the annual bill 
authorizing the pentagon budget 
the restriction have been added for the past three years by the 
house and while some were later dropped during the lengthy 
congressional budget process several remained 
were pushing these things because we need to keep the 
pressure on keep pushing the white house said rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee 
rep norman dicks dwash said the restrictions are a way of 
keeping the lid on the nuclear arms race 
on wednesday the house

voted 252159 to ban any tests of star wars antimissile 
defense systems which would violate the narrow interpretation 
of the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
voted 240174 for a ban on spending for any weapons that 
would violate the numerical restrictions on various types of atomic 
weapons that are contained in the 1979 salt ii treaty president 
reagan says the soviets are violating the unratified treaty and he 
wont be guided any longer by its restrictions 
the house is also likely to approve restrictions on testing of 
antisatellite weapons and ban all but the smallest us nuclear 
tests aspin noted both amendments were also approved last year 
legislators on both sides noted that the amendments are 
virtually the same as the house has considered in past debates over 
the pentagon bill 
president reagan is committed to arms control and he has 
proved it convincingly and everybody has to acknowledge that 
said broomfield 
he referred to the treaty signed by reagan and soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev dec 8 which eliminates mediumrange nuclear 
missiles and to negotiations aimed at achieving a more 
farreaching pact calling for deep reductions in longrange atomic 
weapons 
referring to democratic critics of reagan broomfield said 
many of these true believers have been unable to recognize these 
new realitiessome of these amendments are three years old its 
time to put them out of their misery 
but aspin noted that the house is a partisan body and there 
are a lot of people here who feel very strongly about these 
issues 
he suggested that the restrictions have had an impact for 
example i think we would have violated the salt ii limits by much 
more than we have without the pressure from congress 
reagan said 18 months ago that the united states would no longer 
be restricted by the salt ii limits 
the restrictions were tacked onto a bill authorizing 2995 
billion in pentagon spending for the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
the total is about the same as this years defense budget and it 
resulted from last decembers budget summit between reagan and 
congress which was designed to lower the federal budget deficit 
the bill that passes the house will have to be reconciled with 
the separate measure which will be passed by the senate that 
chamber is moving more slowly on the pentagon budget which is now 
being written by the senate armed services committee

two primary sponsors of fair housing 
legislation say they believe the full house will act quickly on the 
measure which would strengthen the ability of the government to 
fight housing discrimination 
rep peter w rodino jr dnj chairman of the house 
judiciary committee said he would seek to send the bill to the 
floor within the next couple of weeks 
this is a priority item rodino said wednesday after the 
committee approved the legislation 269 
realistically we hope to have it up on the floor in two or 
three weeks said rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the 
judiciary civil and constitutional subcommittee this is civil 
rights legislation and this is an election year 
like legislation in 1980 that was derailed by the senate the 
house measure would empower the department of housing and urban 
development to levy fines and issue injunctions against those who 
discriminate in the sale or rental of housing 
currently hud can only attempt to mediate disputes the justice 
department can bring suits against individuals for a pattern of 
housing discrimination and private individuals can bring their own 
lawsuits if they feel aggrieved 
wednesdays vote came after three days of meetings in which the 
democraticcontrolled committee fought off republican efforts to 
gut or weaken the fair housing legislation 
senate sponsors of a similar measure which passed the judiciary 
committee there nearly a year ago dont want to move until the 
house has completed its work if the measure is to have any chance 
of passage this year the house must act promptly 
the reagan administration agrees that the housing laws need a 
better enforcement mechanism but opposes the plan in the bill the 
measure would establish administrative law judges within the 
justice department who would hear cases of alleged discrimination 
and then impose remedies 
the administration the national association of realtors and 
their allies in congress led by rep f james sensenbrenner jr 
rwis say this approach may be unconstitutional because it could 
result in the imposition of a stiff penalty without a jury trial

the stepbystep search for a defense in space 
against soviet ballistic missiles is on track and the first phase 
of the star wars program will be technically deployable between 
1995 and 2000 a senior us negotiator said today 
in a prepared speech to a major defense contractors group 
edward l rowny said research is not only alive but healthy and 
thriving in such areas as developing technology that can 
discriminate between soviet decoys and nuclear warheads targeted on 
the united states 
rowny who advises president reagan and secretary of state 
george p shultz disputed published reports that the 
administration was scaling back the program known formally as the 
strategic defense initiative 
recently he said six key sdi technologies were approved by 
defense secretary frank c carlucci for demonstration tests to 
validate they would help shield the country from soviet ballistic 
missile attack 
he acknowledged that an unpublished report by congress office 
of technology assessment last july identified some gaps in star 
wars technology but rowny a former army lieutenant general who 
has participated in negotiations for 20 years said development has 
moved quickly in the nine months since the report was submitted to 
the pentagon 
as an example he cited an experiment known as delta 181 that 
discriminated between decoys and warheads 
rowny said a highlevel panel directed by robert everett 
chairman of the pentagons senior scientific advisory group had 
recommended proceeding stepbystep as technology is developed 
for the star wars program 
rowny addressing a meeting of the american defense preparedness 
association urged the contractors to get the truth out about 
sdi 
he criticized reports in the washington post that the pentagon 
was sharply scaling back its efforts to fulfill president reagans 
dream of rendering ballistic missiles impotent and obsolete 
with a spacebased defense against them 
rowny said reports of sdis demise were dead wrong but he 
said progress in key areas will be slowed or aborted if congress 
continues to fund the program below required levels 
the first phase of the program would use kinetic energy and 
other futuristic technology to provide a partial defense against 
nuclear missiles 
rowny said deployment would greatly complicate the ability 
of soviet military planners to executive a successful first strike 
of ballistic nuclear missiles against the united states 
critics contend the program is fanciful extremely expensive and 
a major stumbling block in negotiations with the soviet union to 
reduce longrange nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 percent 
reagan hopes to sign a treaty with general secretary mikhail s 
gorbachev at the may 29june 2 summit meeting in moscow but rowny 
said the soviets were still trying to hold offensive reductions 
hostage to us compliance with sovietdefined limits on certain 
strategic defense research 
he referred to the stand taken by the soviets that the treaty 
contain a provision authorizing a suspension of the weapons 
reductions if moscow concluded the star wars program violated the 
1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
the reagan administration has dismissed the demand as 
unacceptable 
secretary of state george p shultz plans a final presummit 
meeting with soviet foreign secretary eduard a shevardnadze in 
moscow may 1112 
rowny said the soviets were pursuing a defense program that 
costs an estimated 20 billion or so a year including programs 
investigating many of the same advanced strategic defense 
technologies being explored in sdi

w david rust doesnt mind when people liken 
his research to that of benjamin franklin who pioneered lightning 
studies with a risky method involving a kite a string and a key 
rusts methods are a bit more modern but only a little less 
dramatic 
when a violent thunderstorm threatens the nations midsection 
rust and his fellow scientists set off in hot pursuit the aim to 
send weather balloons carrying packets of instruments into the 
heart of an electrical storm 
by measuring the the overall electricity in the storms and the 
charge on individual raindrops scientists hope to learn about the 
the differences in behavior between large and small storms said 
rust of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration 
that in turn can help in predicting what the storms will do 
and in issuing warnings rust said in a telephone interview from 
the national severe storms laboratory in norman okla 
rust said he hopes the work will help lead to better forecasts 
bridging the gap between basic ivorytower research and 
applications 
few would confuse his workplace with an ivory tower 
this years effort gets under way at the next storm which if 
were lucky will be tomorrow he said wednesday 
he will lead a sevenman team in a pair of vehicles chasing the 
huge storms that sweep across the middle of america hammering away 
with lightning and tornadoes 
when one is reported the team sets forth in a truck carrying an 
already inflated balloon in a box structure and a van which has 
been gutted and refitted with an array of instruments 
they try to locate the area under just the towering anvil cloud 
and there they set the balloon free 
the balloon is pulled into a large plastic tube to help hold it 
steady until release the team has released balloons in winds of 
more than 50 miles per hour usually the balloon has to be pulled 
to an area away from trees and electrical wires 
once aloft the balloon is tracked by radio instruments 
rust said lightning can interfere with the signals sometimes 
though most data gets through 
and some balloons become casualties of a trip into the storm he 
said 
last year when the research was started one balloon 
disappeared in conjunction with a lightning flash in the cloud 
rust said and others have been battered back to the ground by hail 
swirling around in the storm but most survive to send back 
information 
the project was launched last summer with rust and dr tom 
marshall of the university of mississippi seeking to follow up 
studies of small storms done earlier in new mexico 
two types of balloons are being used this year small 4foot 
diameter balloons with instruments to measure the general 
electrical field in the storm and larger 6 or 7foot versions to 
measure the charge on individual raindrops 
measurements like that have never been made in severe 
storms rust said 
were trying to understand the electric structure of 
thunderstorms in particular severe thunderstorms we want to 
know if they are significantly different from small thunderstorms 
or not 
the large storms have some unusual lightning characteristics he 
explained and the scientists want to know if that is tied into the 
rainfall patterns of the storms which is one reason they want to 
measure the electrical charge on raindrops 
severe storms tend to have a much higher share of intracloud 
lightning than smaller storms rust explained adding that this 
seems to be associated with intensification of the circulation in 
the storm and possibly with formation of tornadoes 
in addition the severe storms sometimes produce lightning 
strikes to the ground with a positive charge rather than the 
negative charge more commonly found in lightning he said 
there can be too much lightning though even for rust he 
admits having scrubbed a few launches last year when he considered 
it too dangerous 
we are very cautious when releasing a balloon in a storm 
environment he said we try to use good judgment

liberace seemed childlike two weeks 
before he died and was so ill he could barely speak and couldnt 
put on his glasses or read let alone approve of changes in his 
will said the nurse who cared for him 
the flamboyant entertainer who died feb 5 1987 of 
aidsrelated complications was a gaunt man who used what little 
energy he had left to smile at friends when they came to see him 
norma gerber testified wednesday 
it was just the disease it knocked everything out of him 
said the nurse who began caring for liberace 13 days before his 
death and the day he named attorney joel strote as his executor 
we would have minature conversations but he could only speak 
in syllables she said the motor coordination was going so 
hed have difficulty speaking 
her testimony contradicted that of strote who said the famed 
pianist sat at a table in his palm strings calif home that day 
talking with him and going over the estate papers before signing 
them 
liberaces sister his former manager two housekeepers and a 
longtime friend have filed suit to remove strote as executor with 
full control of the estimated 20 million estate 
hed say yes to anything to please at that point said 
gerber he just wanted to please anyone and be left alone 
he was so childlike he didnt know what he was saying she 
said in describing the entertainers dying days at his palm springs 
home 
according to provisions of the will made public wednesday three 
of the five received more in the deathbed will strote drew up than 
in a will liberace executed in 1982 
under the revised will liberace gave 650000 to his sister 
angie 250000 to his companion of seven years cary james 
60000 to seymour heller his manager for 37 years and 5000 to 
dorothy mcmahon the housekeeper at his palm springs home 
he also left james two expensive cars and gave a house 
furnishings and a car to the fifth plaintiff gladys luckie the 
housekeeper at his las vegas home 
james was not named in liberaces previous will and angie 
liberace was to receive 450000 under the 1982 document ms 
luckie who had been given the right to live in one of liberaces 
homes in the 1982 will was given the house outright in the 1987 
document 
liberace also left 50000 in trust to take care of his seven 
dogs which he often referred to as his babies 
strote has said that he has received more than 400000 in legal 
fees from the estate and the liberace trust and is billing his 
services including his time at the current trial at 250 an hour 
in his fourth day of testimony wednesday strote said 900000 
of the money owed the five plaintiffs had been set aside strote 
said he would seek to have the plaintiffs pay the extensive legal 
costs of the will litigation out of the 900000 if the judge rules 
in his favor 
strote defended the signing of the will and two trusts in the 
days before liberace died and a doctor who examine the entertainer 
was convinced liberace was in good condition and could 
understand the documents strote said 
i wanted to make sure he was physically able to go through the 
documents and understand them strote said 
strote said liberace signed the will and two trusts but balked 
at a fourth document a living will that would allow doctors to 
remove life support systems if they became necessary 
he said i just cant sign this strote recalled

first lady who helped dress the city in its spring finery of 
blooming tulips and blossoming dogwoods 
lady bird johnson deserves the national applause and 
appreciation for what shes done for the country says david 
northington executive director of the national wildflower research 
center in austin texas 
separate ceremonies were planned today in the house senate and 
white house rose garden to honor mrs johnson wife of former 
president lyndon johnson and founder of the wildflower center 
more events are planned friday marking her 75th birthday which

mrs johnson said earlier this month she was inspired to 
beautify washington as first lady after returning from trips abroad 
with her husband 
she said flowers light up a city the way lipstick does a woman 
and her interests in beautifying the environment widened with the 
years from the traffic circles and public buildings in washington 
to the coasts and the heartlands in between 
with a donation of 60 acres east of austin and 125000 mrs 
johnson in 1982 helped found the national wildflower research 
center an information clearinghouse where research is done on the 
role of native wildflowers in landscaping along the nations 
roadways 
proceeds from the jubilee celebration will benefit the center 
northington said activities include a blacktie dinner tonight a 
luncheon friday at the watergate hotel with leaders of the 
washington community a national concert and a reception by the 
texas state society and members of the texas congressional 
delegation 
the best way to honor her is to give a gift to something she 
started it is a little bit of everything that shes done all her 
life northington said 
proceeds will go to an endowment that supports research into the 
conservation and use of wildflowers and native plants he said 
mrs johnson has led the way in the planting of native 
wildflowers along roadways and northington said her efforts have 
really spread like wildflowers

federal railroad regulators say an accident 
that killed a veteran conductor last year and led to an ongoing 
rail strike in new england was caused by a faulty brake 
the nov 9 1987 accident at the lawrence mass freight yard 
has been at the center of a labor dispute between guilford 
transportation industries and unionized workers who charged that 
inexperience of a newly hired engineer led to the fatal accident 
about 1200 rail workers walked off the job three days after the 
accident to protest allegedly unsafe working conditions on the 
freight line the strike in its sixth month is against maine 
central and boston amp maine lines now under springfield terminal co 
both sides have attempted to use the tragedy to their 
advantage and the irony is that the report really doesnt support 
either position fra administrator john reilly said in a 
telephone interview wednesday 
the company is clearly liable for the faulty repair on the 
hand brake said but added we found nothing to support the 
labor allegation that lack of experience or training by the 
engineer contributed to the accident 
fra investigators were unable to conclude if richard hopkinson 
the veteran conductor and head of the threemember crew properly 
blocked the boxcar to prevent it from moving 
but the report said once the boxcar began to move hopkinson 
applied the hand brake without success reilly said a working brake 
would have stopped the boxcar and prevented the tragedy and that 
the problem could have caused the initial runaway 
investigators discovered that boston amp maine repair crews failed 
to install the necessary weld on the brake system during repairs 
earlier in the year 
after realizing the brake failure hopkinson who was on the 
runaway car radioed instructions to the engineer to speed up to 
the boxcar so the conductor could attempt to couple the two cars 
which were moving at speeds that reached up to 25 mph 
the report said the engineer who joined the strike did not 
contribute to the accident 
eugene lyden vice president of the united transportation union 
said he believes the report incorrectly dismisses the engineers 
role in the accident 
guilford vice president colin pease said the company was 
gratified by the report and agreed with its conclusions

many israelis are using the arabic word 
intefadah or uprising to describe the violent protests in the 
occupied lands and jewish and arab observers say the new 
terminology reflects a new attitude 
its an acceptance of the fact that were not just talking 
about scattered disturbances but a struggle against the occupation 
that involves everybody said palestinian editor khaled abu aker 
when palestinian unrest began in the west bank and gaza strip on 
dec 8 israeli journalists and army officials referred to the 
clashes between arab protesters and israeli troops as 
disturbances 
such language reflected the initial israeli perception that only 
a few activists incited by outsiders were involved in the 
protests while the majority of the palestinians remained passive 
but in the last few weeks more and more israelis including 
politicians and journalists have spoken about intefadah when 
describing the protests in which more than 170 arabs and two 
israelis have been killed 
in his independence day address to arab residents last week 
president chaim herzog urged palestinians to end the intefadah 
and said they must realize they are being misled by their leaders 
a recent routine news item on israels armed forces radio read 
since the start of the intefadah shopkeepers in east jerusalem 
have usually opened their shops for several hours in the 
afternoon 
its now part of the jargon everybody knows what intefadah 
means said israeli journalist joel greenberg 
the fact that they are using the palestinian term means they 
are accepting the palestinian definition added greenberg the 
west bank correspondent for the englishlanguage jerusalem post 
newspaper 
abu aker an editor at the proplo newspaper alfajr noted that 
in the first few weeks of the uprising the israeli censor 
routinely bluepenciled the word intefadah in his articles 
about three months ago they began to accept the word and we 
now use it all the time he said 
others rejected the political interpretation and said the use of 
the word intefadah was just part of the lively exchange between 
hebrew and arabic two closely related semitic languages 
hebrew and arabic speakers in israel and the occupied lands 
often curse in the others language and borrow greetings and terms 
of endearment from one another 
i dont think people go into the real meaning of the word 
intefadah said herzogs spokesman ami gluska people use it 
because they hear it

bolivia paraguay and peru are failing to give 
the united states full cooperation in the war on drugs a house 
committee said in voting to impose aid sanctions against the three 
south american countries 
the votes wednesday by the foreign affairs committee to penalize 
the three countries were largely symbolic since the legislation 
will unlikely clear other procedural hurdles and be passed by 
congress before a may 13 deadline 
but supporters said it would send a clear signal to the three 
governments that the united states is serious about combating the 
flow of illegal narcotics from abroad and some hoped the move also 
would score political points in their drugplagued congressional 
districts this election year 
while the panel voted to impose aid sanctions on those three 
countries it declined to penalize mexico or the bahamas both of 
which have been criticized for not fully cooperating with us 
antidrug efforts as the law requires 
house speaker jim wright was said by committee members to have 
intervened to head off sanctions against paraguay and peru which 
had lobbied hard against the action 
the bolivia resolution passed 2615 and the other two were 
approved by voice votes 
in backing the sanctions legislation the panel ignored warnings 
that penalties would only harm relations with allies and make it 
more difficult to secure cooperation in fighting the flow of drugs 
into the united states 
passing these resolutions would make us feel better said 
rep george crockett dmich chairman of the western hemisphere 
subcommittee we could go home and tell our constituents we 
struck a big blow against drugs 
but he said allies are tired of being treated like banana 
republics by their great northern brother the united states 
the chief sponsor of the sanctions bills rep larry smith 
dfla said they were the only way the united states has to get 
the attention of countries which are the source of drugs pouring 
into the united states 
only when we prod do we get any reaction argued smith who 
said peru and bolivia are the largest producers of coca leaves and 
coca paste used to make cocaine 
potentially at stake for bolivia is half its foreign aid 
package for which a total of 55 million has been requested by the 
administration for fiscal year 1989 perus 1989 administration aid 
request is 20 million and paraguays is 125000 
the senate voted overwhelmingly on april 14 to revoke president 
reagans certification that mexico is fully cooperating with 
antidrug efforts but voted against taking similar action on the 
bahamas the certifications for the other three countries have not 
been addressed in the senate 
under a 1986 law the president must certify annually that 
countries on a state department list of drug producing and 
trafficking points are fully cooperating with us antidrug 
efforts in order for them to receive continued us aid 
if the president does not make such a certification the 
countries can lose half their aid money and can lose trade 
preferences and support for loans from international development 
banks the president is given the power to head off sanctions by 
certifying it is in us security interests for aid to continue 
reagan certified march 1 that 17 of the 24 countries on the list 
were fully cooperating including the ones debated wednesday in the 
house committee the president certified another three countries on 
national security grounds and withheld certification from just 
three countries afghanistan syria and iran which get no us 
aid

a generation after opec learned the 
tricks of the oil trade from america a selfstyled envoy from the 
heart of us oil country has come to opec to see how the cartel 
works 
hes kent hance a handsome smoothtalking 45yearold former 
us congressman who currently is a member of the texas railroad 
commission which regulates that states large petroleum industry 
ensconced in his hotel room in central vienna hance patiently 
awaits word on a twicepostponed appointment to see rilwanu lukman 
the nigerian oil minister who doubles as president of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries opec maintains its 
headquarters in vienna 
hance says opec is a friendly group thats glad to have 
someone from the united states to have a dialogue with but he 
finds it hard to adapt to opec officials disregard for time 
schedules 
hed been told by lukmans aides that he could see the minister 
after an opec meeting that initially was set for 2 pm then 
rescheduled for 3 pm then 4 pm the session finally started 
about 5 pm 
he said he was still trying to adjust to what outsiders call 
opec time 
hance sees his mission as opening a dialogue with the cartel 
that many americans view as an enemy of the west and that the us 
government refuses to deal with 
were not in love with opec but we need to have input into 
decisions by an organization that controls about 35 percent of the 
worlds oil supplies he said in an interview on wednesday 
i look at whats happened to our texas economy since oil 
prices crashed in 1986 he said no one else is going to be 
speaking up for the state of texas and someone had to do 
something 
a republican he ackowledges that im subject to criticism 
for talking with opec about ways to stabilize oil prices in 
defiance of the stated wishes of the reagan administration 
he said the two other members of the texas railroad commission 
are too cautious to undertake such a controversial venture 
i was the one who thought of this idea last fall he said 
if i think of something that might work ill take a risk 
hance met on monday with fadhil chabili the opec deputy 
secretary general who administers the cartels secretariat he also 
held separate meetings with the oil ministers of venezuela and 
indonesia as well as with officials of nonopec oilproducing 
countries such as norway 
hance says he has been impressed by the opec oil ministers 
knowledge of the business 
they have a good understanding of oil he said what they 
just cant understand is why a country that is the no 1 oil 
consumer and the no 2 producer doesnt have an energy policy 
hance says the us government should be in direct and regular 
contact with opec as part of a national energy policy 
if i were a farmer and i grew carrots and thats all i did 
and there was one entity one person in the world that set the 
price of carrots i would want to know that person and have some 
input he said 
he says opec will become increasingly important to the united 
states in the next decade he predicted that 65 percent of american 
oil supplies would be imported by 1992 up from 40 percent now 
we have to have some imput rather than burying our heads 
in the sand and hope opec treats us okay he said how have 
they treated us without us input not very well 
he rejects suggestions that the united states should not deal 
with an organization whose marketrigging methods it dislikes 
we dont agree with the soviets theyre our enemies but we 
still have a dialogue with them

some of the nations financial markets are 
making changes aimed at reducing the risk of another collapse but 
the new procedures could instead prove harmful the chief of 
congress investigative agency says 
charles a bowsher comptroller general of the general 
accounting office told the senate agriculture committee on 
wednesday ways must be found to prevent a recurrence of last oct 
19 when the dow jones industrial average plummeted a record 508 
points 
but he said that because the nations stock futures and options 
markets are closely linked unilateral changes by individual 
exchanges are potentially dangerous 
because these changes have not been coordinated across 
markets they have potentially adverse implications for intermarket 
stability bowsher told the lawmakers these uncoordinated 
changes greatly concern us 
as an example bowsher cited the limits in daily price swings 
that the futures markets have adopted but that the stock markets 
have not implemented supporters say the restrictions could stop 
markets from overreacting during uncertain times but opponents say 
the limits could prevent investors from selling their holdings and 
cause panic 
such a disparity could cause an adverse transfer of buying or 
selling pressure from equity markets to the stock exchanges he 
said 
bowsher also complained there was still no structure to resolve 
problems among the markets and develop a contingency plan to handle 
the next emergency 
decisions about what constitutes a market emergency the types 
of actions to be taken and who will make the decisions are still 
not clear he said 
a white house working group consisting of the heads of four 
federal agencies is studying the problems faced by the nations 
stock and futures markets its eagerly awaited report is scheduled 
for release on may 18 
because that solution has not yet emerged the congress should 
continue to keep pressure on the various parties through continued 
oversight so that progress toward a truly coordinated solution 
remains on track bowsher told the committee 
panel chairman patrick leahy dvt circulated a proposed bill 
in february that would have created an intermarket coordinating 
council made up of the chiefs of the same agencies named to the 
white house group the treasury department federal reserve board 
securities and exchange commission and commodity futures trading 
commission 
while saying he is willing to let federal and industry groups 
work out solutions to the markets ills leahy said if the 
spirit of cooperation breaks down if they fail to make progress 
then im prepared to force action with legislation 
the ranking republican on the agriculture committee sen 
richard lugar of indiana complained that small investors are still 
too frightened to invest in the market six months after the 
socalled black monday and no single overseer has been created to 
prevent future crashes 
the whole pace has been extraordinarily leisurely given the 
seriousness of the problem lugar said

an unarmed missile blasted off today 
and hit its target thousands of miles away in the 10th successful 
test launching of a trident 2 submarine missile the navy said 
the 44foot threestage missile which has a 6000mile range 
roared off a land pad at 1252 am and propelled the warhead to 
the target in the atlantic the navy didnt say exactly where the 
target was located 
the only failure in the test launchings occurred jan 21 when 
the third stage had an electronic problem todays launch was the 
second since then 
trident 2 is an intercontinental range missile which is 
scheduled to become operational late in 1989 after nine more 
launchpad tests and between five and 10 submarine test firings off 
the coast here 
each trident submarine will pack 24 missiles each of which will 
be able to hurl 10 nuclear warheads to different targets

the world population could double to more than 
10 billion people within four decades say researchers who contend 
previous predictions of a slowdown appear to be wrong 
the overall world population is growing faster than had been 
projected in the late 1970s and early 80s said carl haub of the 
private population reference bureau 
the next billion could be added by 1998 said haub adding 
thats really fast 
the world population data sheet issued wednesday by the bureau 
said the doubling would occur if world population continues to grow 
at the current rate of 17 percent 
it took all of human history to raise the worlds population to 
1 billion which occurred in the early 1800s during the 
presidency of thomas jefferson 
more than a century was required to add the second billion by 
about 1930 according to the united nations fund for population 
activities three billion were here by 1964 4 billion in 1974 and 
5 billion in 1987 
there is a perception that world population growth was a problem 
of the 1970s haub observed in a telephone interview so we 
thought it was time to point out that its still growing faster 
than had been projected 
the 17 percent rate of annual growth given by the bureau an 
independent nonprofit research group is slightly higher than the 
16 percent projected by the united nations 
that doesnt sound like much haub pointed out but in a 
world of 5 billion people that difference represents 5 million 
more people per year 
population growth hasnt followed the smooth trend downward that 
had been expected in many developing nations haub said he noted 
in particular that china india pakistan and iran have high growth 
rates 
some of the larger countries have not followed a nice smooth 
path to the twochild family that we have been predicting said 
haub noting in particular china and india where previous 
reductions in births have not been maintained 
the doubling of the world population in 40 years depends on 
growth continuing at the 17 percent ate haub said a rate that 
varies considerably from countrytocountry and regiontoregion 
the more developed nations for example are growing at 06 
percent annually for an anticipated doubling time of 120 years 
the population data sheet shows on the other hand the less 
developed nations could double in just 33 years at a growth rate 
of 21 percent 
increasing fastest are kenya and the disputed territory of gaza 
currently occupied by israel each of which is expected to double 
its population in just 17 years at current rates of increase 
at the other end of the scale five countries are not growing at 
all austria denmark hungary east germany and west germany and 
italy at its current rate would not double its population for 
3465 years 
changes are hard to anticipate as various nations progress 
economically toward what population experts call the demographic 
transition 
in early societies high birth rates are generally balanced high 
death rates as economic conditions provide better medical care and 
nutrition death rates fall while birth rates remain high leading 
to rapid population growth 
eventually history shows birth rates also begin to fall in a 
transition to balance again as has happened in many more developed 
nations 
social religions and other differences from nation to nation 
however keep this change from being a smooth curve and help lead 
to the many variations around the world

new treatments that stop a heart attack in its 
tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly 
than ever before perhaps even three days after their attacks a 
study published today concludes 
doctors from the university of michigan medical center studied 
the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home 
early they found that these people had no unusual complications 
got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills 
it was an extraordinarily safe strategy said dr eric j 
topol the studys director there were no problems with any 
serious events 
topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent 
medical advances tissue plasminogen activator or tpa and 
angioplasty 
when given quickly after a heart attack tpa can dissolve clots 
in the hearts arteries and minimize damage angioplasty can 
produce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries with 
tiny balloons 
the report represents the latest in a steady threedecade trend 
of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever 
shorter stays 
however the study in the new england journal of medicine said 
more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted 
in the 1950s doctors often recommended that patients stay in 
bed for one to two months after a heart attack when president 
dwight d eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in 
1955 he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital 
however doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm than 
good patients got out of shape developed blood clots and became 
demoralized 
in the 1960s the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the 
1970s to two weeks now doctors typically keep heart attack 
patients hospitalized seven to 10 days 
in their paper the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart 
attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for 
early discharge none of them had irregular heart beats chest pain 
or heart failure treadmill tests showed no signs of heart attack 
damage 
forty patients were sent home after three days while the rest 
stayed seven to 10 days after six months of followup none had 
died and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar 
however people in the early discharge group were able to return 
to work about two weeks sooner than the others and their medical 
bills were significantly lower 12546 versus 17868 
the researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack 
patients were discharged after three days the annual saving would 
be at least 280 million 
in an accompanying editorial dr gregory d curfman a deputy 
editor of the journal cautioned that the study was not large 
enough to spot complications that might result from reducing 
hospital stays 
this single study he wrote is not sufficient to justify 
sweeping changes in current management practices for all patients 
who may at first appear to have uncomplicated heart attacks

a contender for the 
presidential nomination of the governing christian democratic party 
rejected president jose napoleon duartes suggestion he abandon the 
race for the sake of party unity 
julio rey prendes said on wednesday that he would continue to 
seek the nomination for the march 1989 elections the partys 
nominating convention which rey is thought to control is 
scheduled for friday 
duarte is limited by law to one fiveyear term 
in a broadcast message tuesday night duarte urged rey and 
archrival fidel chavez mena to step aside in the name of party 
unity duarte suggested the party close ranks around a third 
candidate abraham rodriguez 
rey said the convention was the only legal mechanism for 
deciding the christian democratic candidacy he referred to duarte 
as one member of the party 
he said he met with duarte on wednesday morning and that as soon 
as he left the presidents office chavez entered 
rey and chavez both party founders and former cabinet 
ministers have expressed confidence they will be selected at the 
convention 
at least two party activists have been killed and several 
wounded in confrontations between followers of rey and chavez since 
the internal campaign began last may 
duarte cited the infighting as a principal reason for the 
christian democrats loss to the rightist republican nationalist 
alliance in legislative and municipal elections march 20 
the alliance popularly known by its spanish acronym arena 
replaced the christian democrats as the majority party in the 
legislature and won twothirds of the mayoralties nationwide 
today our existence is threatened from within the party 
duarte said 
the future of democracy in el salvador is conditioned on the 
future of the christian democratic party there is no truly 
democratic opponent in the elections of 1989 the president added 
the only other party expected to field a presidential candidate 
is the national conciliation party a small conservative group 
duarte who is also the partys honorary president said the 
candidacy of chavez or rey would lead us to an electoral failure 
with grave implications for the democratic development of the 
country 
he suggested rodriguez also among those who founded the party 
in 1960 as a unity candidate

chunks of shrapnel from unexplained explosions 
are hurtling through space at 22000 mph and forcing designers to 
add tons of shielding to protect the proposed us space station 
and its crew 
nearly 7100 pieces of orbiting debris are being tracked by the 
us space command and more than half came from satellites or spent 
rockets that have blown up or broken up for unknown reasons a 
nasa expert says 
more than 90 satellites to date have shattered unaccountably 
but don kessler project scientist for debris studies at the 
johnson space center in houston said he doubts the cause is 
collisions with meteoroids or tests of secret antisatellite 
weapons 
they are like a time bomb waiting to explode kessler said 
in a telephone interview these explosions have occurred 
everywhere from one day after launch to three years 
space station planners faced with a considerable design 
problem are adding 2000 pounds to the shielding of each of the 
six modules occupied by astronauts 
the debris gets most severe at 500600 miles kessler said 
but usually unmanned spacecraft are at that altitude and dont 
require the same level of safety as a crew the space shuttle 
generally operates at altitudes of 150 to 300 miles and so will the 
space station 
when i first started working in this area very few people 
knew how their spacecraft were breaking up including the 
designers kessler said the space command knew they were 
breaking up but never took the time to identify why 
he said officials have long believed that frenchmade ariane 
rockets explode in space but their orbits are difficult to track 
with ground radar two years ago however an ariane was launched 
into an easytotrack orbit and kessler said it blew up after 
nine months the fragments of that explosion probably caused by 
over pressurization of gases number 450 
americans and soviets contribute to the space junk too six 
us delta rocket second stages exploded the last in 1981 three 
years after it was launched the cause was leakage of fuels that 
burn when they combine and the problem was fixed in later models 
such explosions cause an expanding cloud of debris a problem 
analogous to cars driving around a parking lot in random directions 
you can get hit from any direction and the most likely direction 
will be headon kessler said 
the 1 billion space telescope scheduled to be put into orbit 
next year will operate 300 miles high a study by the space 
telescope institute concluded the instrument should be designed 
differently because of the debris he said 
maj alex mondragon of the us space command in colorado 
springs colo said 5331 pieces of debris and 1759 working 
payloads were being tracked as of april 19 the objects ranged in 
size from the soviet mir space station to a screwdriver dropped by 
a spacewalking astronaut 
space shuttle challenger returned from a mission in june 1983 
with a chip in a cockpit window and chemical analysis showed the 
culprit was a flake of the paint used on rockets and payloads 
the few objects returned from space all have shown debris 
damage the palapa and westar satellites that were retrieved by a 
space shuttle crew were pitted but not damaged enough to keep them 
from functioning the solar max satellite repaired in orbit 
showed many hits some penetrating an insulation blanket and 
damaging the surface beneath 
a 3 millimeter particle has as much kinetic energy as a 
bowling ball going 60 miles an hour and if it hit an electrical 
component it would probably cause that system to cease 
functioning kessler said the average collision velocity would 
be 22000 mph he said

bahamian prime minister lynden o pindling is 
being investigated by two us grand juries probing payoffs by drug 
traffickers the washington times reported today 
the newspaper quoting sources it did not identify said grand 
juries in miami and jacksonville fla have heard testimony from 
witnesses who claim pindling received payments from cocaine 
traffickers to ensure safe passage of the drug through the bahamas 
pindling in an interview with the times denied the allegation 
he said the bahamian government has been working for years to stem 
the flow of illegal drugs 
the allegations against me are not true he said i would 
hate to think that anyone truly believes i am a crook 
a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office in miami did not 
return telephone inquiries wednesday about the case the newspaper 
said while a spokesman for the federal prosecutors office in 
jacksonville declined to comment 
the times said documents it had inspected indicated that 
between january 1977 and december 1983 pindling deposited into his 
personal banks accounts 35 million over his official income as 
prime minister 
however it also said two out of three commissioners on a panel 
named in the bahamas in 1984 to investigate allegations against 
pindling found no credible evidence linking him to drugrelated 
corruption

new evidence that chubby people have sluggish 
nervous systems may help explain one of the great injustices of 
dieting why some people burn up calories more quickly than others 
the study published today supports the theory that many fat 
people get that way because their bodies are extrafuel efficient 
earlier research has documented that obese men and women often 
have lower metabolic rates their bodies use up less energy even 
when they are doing the same things as ordinarysize people so 
they need less food 
the study published in the new england journal of medicine and 
directed by dr hugh r peterson of the university of louisville 
may help explain at least part of how this happens it shows that 
the fatter people are the more lethargic their sympathetic nervous 
system the internal thermostat that revs up the body in times of 
danger stress or exertion 
their findings are consistent with recent evidence that 
indicates there is a biological difference between obese and 
lean said dr lewis landsberg of bostons beth israel hospital 
this difference involves energy expenditure and the 
sympathetic nervous system is important in regulating energy 
expenditure he said what they find shows diminished 
sympathetic activity and that works into the overall equation 
dr jules hirsch of rockefeller university in new york agreed 
saying its another piece of the puzzle thats been unlocked 
breathing heart rate contraction of the pupils and other 
involuntary bodily movements are under the control of the autonomic 
nervous system this system has two main branches the sympathetic 
system and the parasympathetic system which balance each other 
in general the sympathetic system speeds things up often in 
response to an emergency or exercise the parasympathetic system 
does just the opposite slowing down the heart and other organs 
the sympathetic system prompts production of adrenaline and 
other hormones among other things these natural chemicals signal 
the bodys fat cells to give up some of their cargo so it can be 
burned as fuel 
petersons study measured adrenaline levels heart rates and 
other factors under the control of the nervous system in 56 healthy 
men of varying sizes it showed that the fatter they were the less 
active their sympathetic nervous systems 
other scientists have tried but failed to find such differences 
in fat people peterson said his findings should be replicated by 
other scientists and added that the possible meaning of his 
findings is speculative 
we have not proved that a disturbed autonomic nervous system 
maintains or causes obesity or causes some of the health hazards of 
obesity he said but certainly its titillating to think that 
might be the case 
peterson found that the parasympathetic system the other half 
of the internal control machinery is also turned down in fat 
people under his theory an active parasympathetic system might 
help make people fat while a lethargic one would keep them skinny 
however he theorizes that fat people have slow parasympathetic 
systems as well to balance their sluggish sympathetic systems 
they got fat and stayed fat because their sympathetic nervous 
system tone was turned down he said as a response to that 
they were able to turn down their parasympathetic nervous systems 
to reach a kind of equilibrium thats quite speculative but 
thats the way we think about it

democratic presidential contender michael dukakis 
has been wooing industrialstate voters by pointing to a 
plantclosing law in his home state of massachusetts and praising 
federal legislation requiring companies to notify workers 60 days 
before a plant shuts down 
but the federal law is considerably tougher than the 
massachusetts one and thats the way the massachusetts governor 
wants it 
the massachusetts law requests but does not require 
companies to provide workers with 90 days warning before a plant 
closing critics say the law lacks teeth 
dukakis economic development adviser alden raine says a 
notification requirement in massachusetts alone might lead 
companies to relocate so dukakis does not support such a plan 
because there is no notification requirement dukakis 
administration officials can offer no evidence the massachusetts 
plantclosing provision has accomplished its goal 
dukakis says advance warning of plant closings is a basic worker 
right 
anybody who doesnt understand that has really lost touch with 
the american people he said wednesday in springfield mass 
president reagan was in the same city last week threatening to 
veto the trade measure that includes the plant closing provision 
which won congressional approval on wednesday 
the irony is that he reagan chose to deliver that speech in 
the one state that has a comprehensive plant closing law dukakis 
said 
christopher donahue a spokesman for the administrations 
industrial services program could not say whether more companies 
are providing 90day notice now than were before the law took 
effect 
theres no way to know he said you can only suppose 
were doing better 
in recent campaign stops in pennsylvania however dukakis 
contended the law has saved 20000 jobs and 200 companies 
dukakis defends his claim saying troubled companies which 
receive state assistance must sign a nonbinding pledge to give 
advance warning of plant closings as a practical matter there 
are some very real sanctions for companies who fail to give 
notice he said 
former state rep thomas gallagher of cambridge was a member of 
the committee established by dukakis in 1983 as a result of a 
gubernatorial campaign promise to study the plant closing issue 
dukakis and his top aides gallagher said have been afraid of 
the hue and cry the business community would put up if they were 
ever treated roughly 
indeed industry lobbyist richard mastrangelo said at a 
legislative hearing this week on toughening the state law does 
this commonwealth wish to send the signal to every single employer 
or potential employer that says if you come into this state and 
cannot survive economically you will have to pay a penalty to get 
out 
according to state officials the plant closing law has not 
saved workers jobs but has helped some 24000 find new 
employment after plant closings the state worker retraining and 
relocation centers have found new jobs for about 77 percent of the 
workers who sought help the new jobs pay on average 92 percent 
of their previous salaries

the de beer diamond cartel said it will raise 
prices for rough gemstones an average of 135 percent because a 
weak dollar has increased demand for their products in asia and 
europe 
de beers based in johannesburg south africa controls 80 
percent of the worlds rough diamond market through its 
londonbased marketing arm central selling organization 
sales of diamonds are priced in dollars and have been boosted by 
the drop in the us currency which makes them cheaper to holders 
of japanese yen and european currencies 
de beers consolidated mines ltd said the price increases for a 
broad range of uncut diamonds will take effect may 3 
the increases are not weighted toward any particular 
category said spokesman richard dickson 
when de beers last raised its prices by an average 10 percent 
on oct 5 the biggest increases were for betterquality diamonds 
that was the only price increase in 1987 and followed a jump of 
145 percent in two steps in 1986 
de beers does not disclose its prices 
but as an example the wholesale price of a polished 
onecarat dflawless diamond the highest grade costs about 
15000 
the cartel sets prices for rough diamonds only it operates a 
pipeline of diamonds from its mines in africa and australia to 
dealers and cutters in the worlds major diamond centers antwerp 
bombay new york and tel aviv 
the rough market is strong the prices of polished diamonds 
are strong retail demand is good dickson said much of the 
motor for the momentum behind demand is coming from japan and 
southeast asia 
de beers enjoyed record sales of 3075 billion in 1987 up 23 
percent from sales of 25 billion in 1986 
diamond sales which slumped in the early 1980s jumped even 
though de beers cut supply after the oct 19 stock markets crash 
dickson said 
we carried that cautious policy through the early part of 
1988 we reacted very quickly what we wouldnt want to do is sell 
diamonds that the market couldnt absorb 
jewelry sales generally were strong at christmas he added 
the mood is optimistic and we would look foreward to 1988 
being a good year said dickson 
de beers holds about 10 sights or sales for 
international diamond dealers a year dickson said 
most of the worlds diamonds are industrial diamonds used 
mainly for drilling because they are so hard from 10 percent to 20 
percent are gems

hospital death rates in states with tightfisted 
governmental controls are up to 10 percent higher according to a 
study published today that prompted one doctor to comment you 
cant have a cadillac for chevy prices 
the study suggests but doesnt prove that patient care suffers 
because hospitals in more costregulated states may try to hold 
down costs by laying off staff eliminating services or spurning 
expensive equipment 
there is cause for some concern said stephen m shortell 
the studys director there is no need to frighten the public 
but there is something here that does need to be dealt with 
in efforts to lower medical costs many states have set up 
review procedures for hospital rate increases others have 
certificate of need programs these require hospitals to get 
approval for expansions or major purchases such as new diagnostic 
machines that cost more than a specific amount often 500000 or 
1 million 
the report did not provide statebystate breakdowns however 
shortell said that among the highly regulated states with the 
highest death rates were washington new york pennsylvania and 
massachusetts 
dr myron peterson head of pediatric intensive care at new 
england medical center in boston said shortells figures are 
hard to dispute 
he said he believes the public does not understand the 
consequences of cutbacks in hospital spending 
if people want to make the choice to cut costs and have less 
medical care thats all right but they ought to be told the 
truth peterson said you cant have a cadillac for chevy 
prices its common sense if you pay less you get less 
shortell a health services researcher at northwestern 
university published his findings in the new england journal of 
medicine they were based on the records of 214839 patients in 981 
hospitals in 45 states 
shortell and his coauthor dr edward fx hughes compared the 
actual death rates and the rates that would be expected based on 
the patients ages the severity of their illnesses and other 
factors 
they found that the ratio of actual to predicted death rates in 
states with the most stringent rate reviews were 6 percent to 10 
percent higher than in the least tightly controlled states 
in states with the strictest procedures for reviewing 
applications for certificates of need they found that the ratio of 
actual to predicted death rates were 5 percent to 6 percent higher 
than in those with more relaxed rules 
the researchers looked at death rates for 16 medical conditions 
including kidney and heart disease that account for about 40 
percent of hospital stays for medicare patients 
shortell noted that 38 states have certificate of need 
procedures although they vary in how severely they restrain 
hospital spending some of the programs he said permit such low 
levels of spending that it forces hospitals to go through more 
loops and discourages innovation some hospitals are not even 
applying to upgrade equipment it may mean that it has some adverse 
effect on patient outcomes 
in an interview shortell recommended a greater effort to 
monitor hospital death rates especially in highly regulated 
states to make sure there is no serious deterioration of patient 
care

a police officer has been found guilty 
of misconduct for leaving his post without permission to help his 
family during a flood and could be be dismissed this weekend 
the des plaines board of fire and police commissioners found 
clifford launius guilty wednesday of eight counts of misconduct but 
left the question of his possible firing for a hearing saturday 
after the decision defense attorney stanley jakala said he was 
optimistic the eightyear veteran would get to keep his badge 
he left his post we have never denied that jakala said 
when the commission considers the extenuating circumstances on 
saturday we hope he wont be fired 
a dismissal has been recommended by chief joseph kozenczak 
patrick lucansky the chiefs atttorney said launius is going to 
come in and show that maybe he did these things but really hes a 
nice guy and a good cop well try to show hes not 
the threemember board found launius 31 guilty on charges 
including insubordination and failure to perform required duties 
hearings during the past six months focused on launius decision

irans relations with syria may be 
jeopardized by a battle here between a damascusbacked militia and 
tehrans main lebanese ally 
the shiite moslem amal militia armed by syria defeated the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god in a fourday battle in 
south lebanon earlier this month it was a big setback for the 
fundamentalist hebollah which aims to set up an iranianstyle 
islamic republic in lebanon 
hezbollah believed to contain various shiite factions holding 
most of the 22 foreigners kidnapped in lebanon now faces an amal 
offensive in another stronghold the teeming slums of south beirut 
iran which considers syria its chief arab ally fears another 
sweeping attack by amal in south beirut where hezbollah enjoys 
relative freedom according to a shiite source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the iranians sent ayatollah ahmad jannati a conservative cleric 
close to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and deputy foreign minister 
hussein sheikholeslam to lebanon to work out a deal with amal 
according to shiite sources after a week of bargaining amal 
was still refusing to allow hezbollah back into the south 
they said the iranian team succeeded in forming a fiveman 
committee to try to prevent future clashes in south beirut and the 
bekaa valley it is led by sheikholeslam and includes amals 
leader lebanese justice minister nabih berri but jannati said on 
tuesday the committee was being obstructed 
the shitte source said that remark indicated that jannati 
hasnt even won a solid promise from amal that further crackdowns 
will be averted 
if hezbollah is defeated in south beirut a predominantly shiite 
area its zone of influence will be limited to the bekaa valley in 
east lebanon that region is controlled by the syrians who have 
about 25000 troops there under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping 
mandate syria the main power broker in lebanon has become 
increasingly alarmed at the challenge from hezbollah 
amal with syrian approval moved against hezbollah in south 
lebanon on april 4 after iran provided the fundamentalists with 
millions of dollars to fund welfare projects to win more shiite 
support 
the kidnapping in february of a us marine officer lt col 
william r higgins who was serving with a united nations observer 
group also angered syria amal launched a dragnet for the 
kidnappers and rounded up hezbollah supporters it claimed were 
involved in the abduction 
but there was no sign of higgins whose abduction was claimed by 
a group calling itself the organization of the oppressed on earth 
after four days of fighting this month in which at least 62 
people were killed hezbollah lost its strongholds in the region 
north of israels border 
amals seizure of the south stripped iran of one of the main 
areas in lebanon where it had free rein to spread its influence 
the source said 
iran is convinced that amal would not have cracked down on 
hezbollah in the south without syrian approval he added 
in beirut hezbollah is restricted to the southern slums syrian 
president hafez assad sent 7500 commandos with tanks into beiruts 
moslem sector in february 1987 to end three years of militia 
anarchy 
one factor inhibiting an attack on the slums is the belief that 
most of the missing foreigners are held there and would be in 
danger if the syrians tried to move in 
nine americans are among the foreigners seized in lebanon the 
longest held is terry a anderson the chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped on march 
16 1985 
syria is under mounting pressure from the arab world to break 
with persian iran the iranians have provided the syrians with 1 
million tons of free oil a year since 1982 but syria its own oil 
production rising after the discovery of new fields is becoming 
less dependent on iranian largesse 
embarrassed by the kidnappings syria has made clear that its 
patience with irans unruly allies is wearing thin

the soviet pullout from afghanistan could 
trigger new regional turmoil or even a preemptive strike against 
pakistans nuclear installations says pakistani opposition leader 
benazir bhutto 
there is great danger of afghanistan becoming another lebanon 
with different factions holding say in different parts ms 
bhutto chairwoman of the pakistan peoples party said wednesday at 
a news conference 
pakistanis generally expect the prosoviet government in kabul 
to collapse after soviet troops begin withdrawing next month and 
when this happens different resistance groups may start fighting 
each other for power if some solution is not worked out 
beforehand she said 
if there is a vacuum it will be difficult for pakistan to 
just ignore the situation she said on the other side there 
are persianspeaking afghans iran so far has not taken any deep 
interest in afghan internal affairs nonetheless it may find in a 
vacuum it is also tempted to exert its influence 
with an afghanistan settlement the nuclear issue threatens to 
become the most major foreign policy issue for pakistan bringing 
potential isolation and danger she said 
the danger comes from the threat of a cutoff of american 
economic and military aid erosion of credit with countries opposed 
to nuclear proliferation and vulnerability to preemptive action 
by outside countries she said 
the united states cut off aid in 1977 and 1979 because of signs 
pakistan was developing nuclear weapons us law requires denying 
aid to countries making nuclear weapons 
but the soviet intervention in afghanistan led to a swift 
turnabout with washington reluctant to damage ties with a 
government that has helped the afghan guerrillas 
while twice mentioning a potential preemptive strike against 
pakistan ms bhutto avoided pinpointing potential attackers two 
countries india and israel have been mentioned in occasional 
speculative news reports 
rather than aggravating to a point of conflict or preemptive 
action against pakistan i think one should use diplomatic skill to 
go to the root of the problem to secure our security ms bhutto 
added 
if india were willing to sign the nuclear nonproliferation 
treaty pakistan would also sign and there would be no 
problem but for pakistan to sign unilaterally is difficult 
politically she said 
pakistan president mohammed zia ulhaqs government has often 
denied pakistan is developing nuclear weapons but ms bhutto 
suggested the denials are ambiguous 
zia in a 1977 bloodless coup overthrew ms bhuttos late father 
prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto and declared a martial law that 
was lifted only in 1986 bhutto was hanged in 1979 after being 
convicted of ordering a political murder 
the peoples party founded by bhutto and later led by his widow 
and daughter is the most secular of several political groups 
emerging in the predominantly moslem country

an agreement banning the sale of unsafe 
threewheeled allterrain vehicles until they meet safety standards 
and requiring warnings for operators of the fourwheeled variety 
will be allowed to go into effect 
no decree designed to protect consumers has ever gone this far 
in meeting such a massive national consumer problem us 
district judge gerhard a gesell said wednesday after approving the 
agreements with some modifications 
the settlement between the consumer product safety commission 
and five manufacturers has been criticized by consumer groups and 
lawmakers as providing inadequate protection or compensation for 
owners of the vehicles known as atvs 
the consent decree bans the sale of threewheel atvs unless the 
manufacturers can devise performance standards that are approved by 
the cpsc 
the decrees also require warning labels on fourwheel models 
distributors must provide training in the safe use of all types of 
atvs to owners who purchased the vehicles after dec 30 1986 
they also require the manufacturers to spend 85 million to 
warn consumers about the hazards of atvs and promote training 
there are an estimated 24 million atvs in use in this country 
including 15 million threewheel models they have been blamed for 
1000 deaths and 300000 injuries requiring handling at a hospital 
emergency room 
one consent decree is with four japanese firms and their 
american divisions honda motor co ltd yamaha motor co ltd 
suzuki motors co ltd and kawasaki heavy industries ltd the other 
decree is with polaris industries a usbased manufacturer 
the revised consent decree eliminates a provision that allowed 
the cpsc to initiate a general recall only if it found new and 
substantial evidence the vehicles were hazardous 
it also bars the cpsc from initiating a socalled generic recall 
of atvs before dec 31 1990 the original decree empowered the 
agency to take such action a year after the agreement received 
court approval 
another modification requires the distributors to require 
dealers in new or renewed franchise contracts to warn customers of 
the hazards specifically to children of atvs and to ensure the 
vehicles bear the required safety labels 
the original decree had required the manufacturers to make their 
best efforts to get the dealers to implement these requirements

the woman accused of killing her husband with a 
cyanidespiked painkiller tearfully told a courtroom that she 
watched him collapse never knowing that he was dying 
babe i feel like im going to pass out stella nickell 
testifying wednesday at her us district court trial quoted her 
husband as saying before he collapsed at their home june 5 1986 
he squatted down shook his head she said he wouldnt 
answer me he stood up i pulled him back toward the door 
he put his hands on the couch to brace himself and collapsed 
when he didnt revive she said she telephoned for help 
mrs nickell 44 who is accused of killing her husband bruce 
and a woman with cyanidelaced excedrin capsules tearfully told 
the jury that she never talked of murdering him and had researched 
cyanide poisoning only after his death 
prosecutors expected to begin crossexamining mrs nickell today 
she is charged with causing two deaths by tampering and three 
counts of tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce 
shes the first person in this country to be tried on charges of 
causing death by tampering with overthecounter medicine if 
convicted she could face life in prison 
sue katherine snow 40 of auburn died after swallowing a 
cyanidetainted excedrin capsule two weeks after nickell 
prosecutors say mrs nickell poisoned other overthecounter pain 
relievers to make her husbands death appear the work of a random 
killer 
mrs nickell described her 52yearold husband as a loving 
goodnatured man with a sense of humor she denied telling family 
members her marriage was unhappy or had grown boring since she and 
her husband stopped drinking alcohol in 1979 
i believe that my feelings grew a lot stronger after the 
drinking stopped she said we got along a lot better 
she acknowledged periodic financial stresses including a 1983 
bankruptcy filing but denied that their money troubles threatened 
the marriage or that she saw collecting on his life insurance as an 
easy solution 
prosecutors contend she killed her husband in hopes of 
collecting up to 176000 in benefits and forged his signature on 
insurance paperwork 
she said she signed the forms with her husbands permission 
because he despised paperwork she said she thought he had only 
25000 in life insurance 
mrs nickells daughter cindy hamilton testified tuesday that 
her mother had discussed several possible ways to kill nickell 
mrs nickell asked wednesday if she had ever told her daughter 
that she intended to poison her husband with cyanide or that she 
had attempted to kill her husband replied no 
ms hamilton also testified her mother discussed copying the 
unsolved chicagoarea poisonings in which seven people died from 
cyanidelaced tylenol and also asked how to hire a hit man and 
where she could buy heroin 
and ms hamilton said her mother mulled the possibility of 
putting a cocaine overdose in nickells iced tea 
in other testimony wednesday fbi specialist carl e collins 
said 84 fingerprints belonging to mrs nickell were found on 47 
pages of deadly harvest a book about poisonous plants 
mrs nickell said her prints were found on the book because she 
hoped to protect her granddaughter and children for whom she 
babysat from any such plants around her suburban seattle home 
collins the prosecutions final witness also said her 
fingerprints were found in three encyclopedia volumes concerning 
poisons 
mrs nickell said she researched cyanide only after nickells 
death because i wanted to know what it was that killed my 
husband

law enforcement officials have a message for 
drug pushers living in public housing projects go out of business 
or get evicted 
us marshals seized apartments at city housing projects on 
wednesday as a joint federalcity force arrested the occupants on 
drug trafficking charges 
emanuel popolizio chairman of the citys housing authority 
said the seizure sends out the word to drug abusers get the hell 
out of our housing projects and get the hell out of the city of new 
york 
tenants had complained about drug trafficking prompting the 
investigation that led to the seizures officials said 
us attorney rudolph giuliani said the action was as far as i 
know the first in the nation using civil provisions of federal 
drug laws to seize the lease of a public housing apartment 
it will not be the last giuliani said at a news conference 
however norman siegel executive director of the new york civil 
liberties union questioned the evictions 
we believe seizing someones property or property interest 
because he has been accused of being a drug dealer is a serious 
violation of civil liberties siegel said it turns the 
presumption of innocence upside down 
giuliani said the apartments were seized the occupants removed 
and the locks changed under a federal civil statute that allows 
seizure and forfeiture upon a conviction of property used in 
the commission of drug law violations 
he said the statute had been used previously to seize private 
houses cars boats and planes 
the announcement came shortly before a police sergeant was shot 
to death in an apartment while searching for cocaine mary lee 
warren head of the narcotics unit in giulianis office said the 
shooting was not related to the eviction program 
marshals seized an apartment in a sevenstory building on 
manhattans lower east side and the cityfederal officers arrested 
its lone tenant sandra deanne 28 for heroin trafficking 
in a 20story building in the south bronx donald johnson 49 
was arrested for cocaine trafficking and his apartment seized 
both were charged with drug trafficking conspiracy and 
maintaining a location for narcotics use and distribution 
authorities said 
according to court papers both have previous narcotics arrests 
and each faces a maximum 60year prison sentence if convicted of 
all the charges brought wednesday 
one of ms deannes neighbors who would not give her name said 
drug dealing in her building was so rampant she was afraid to go 
out into the hall to put out the garbage unless her father was 
watching 
there were a lot of drugs and stuff she said it was a 
scary thing when you have children 
ms deannes sister maria said ms deanne was the mother of a 
6yearold boy and a 4yearold girl and had been a loving 
caring girl until drugs destroyed her 
police commissioner benjamin ward said the new tactic showed 
our intent is to raise the cost of drug trafficking to the 
level where it is no longer profitable 
mayor edward i koch said at the news conference that drugs were 
the scourge of america and fighting narcotics has the highest 
priority at city hall were never going to give in

president daniel ortega said that if 
government and rebel negotiators bargain in good faith when talks 
resume in managua an agreement can be reached to end the civil war 
in a statement issued on wednesday in miami enrique bermudez 
and other rebel military commanders declared their support for the 
threeday peace talks which were to resume today in the capital of 
managua 
but the leftist sandinistas and the usbacked rebels known as 
contras remain far apart on essential issues largely because of 
the vaguely worded peace agreement reached march 23 that they are 
trying to implement 
rebel leader adolfo calero leads the contra negotiating team and 
defense minister humberto ortega the presidents brother leads 
the government side contra leaders were to arrive in managua today 
on a flight from costa rica 
government security agents on wednesday took over the camino 
real hotel site for the talks and told guests to find other 
accommodations 
president ortega told reporters on wednesday if there is good 
faith on both sides to achieve peace in nicaragua a definitive 
ceasefire can be reached the 6yearold civil war has claimed 
26000 lives 
but he complained that the reagan administration continues to 
support the warmongering actions of military leader enrique 
bermudez we hope that peace will prevail over this policy 
ortegas comments came during a ceremony inaugurating the 
benjamin linder memorial park in managua linder an electrical 
engineer from portland ore was killed along with six nicaraguans 
on april 28 1987 when rebels attacked the small town of el cua in 
northern jinotega province 
the two sides contras and sandinistas have been in contact 
since their first meeting in managua two weeks ago 
deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco met privately with 
rebel leaders in miami this week to prepare the agenda and discuss 
points of friction such as us humanitarian aid to the rebels on 
the honduran side of the border 
one stumbling block in the talks concerns the rebels giving up 
their weapons neither the sapoa pact named for the southern 
border village where it was signed nor the central american peace 
plan ratified last august by the regions five presidents mentions 
that key issue 
the sandinistas say both plans imply the rebels must lay down 
their arms the contras say the agreements mean they will disarm 
once nicaragua is on the irreversible role to democracy 
the contras took up arms because there isnt any democracy 
said carlos huembes president of the democratic coordinate an 
umbrella organization of opposition groups its ridiculous that 
the sandinista front wants to first discuss a ceasefire they just 
want surrender 
in seven meetings over the past month sandinista and contra 
military representatives have agreed only to create seven safe 
zones in nicargua into which the rebels are to move 
they have not worked out resupply or operating conditions within 
the zones 
under the terms of the sapoa accord contras in the zones can 
receive only humanitarian aid through neutral organizations 
the sandinistas want the international red cross to administer 
those supplies 
last week president ortega accused the united states of 
violating the agreement by sending food and other supplies to 
contra fighters just across the border in honduras 
the sandinistas have proposed extending to july 1 a ceasefire 
that was to have ended a month earlier and want the rebels to turn 
their arms over to a verification commission the contras offered 
no counterproposal that was made public the government has pledged 
tentative measures aimed at satisfying at least in part rebel 
demands for democratization

commission 
the fcc formally scrapped the unpopular provision which would 
have added about 450 an hour to the cost for a computer user to

double the hookup price for some data bases 
in a statement issued wednesday the commission said it 
abandoned the idea in a vote last week because the information 
services industry is in a uniquely complex period of transition 
the commission found virtually no support for its original plan 
to increase the costs computer users said the increased costs 
would drive many of them off the computer networks and crush a 
fledgling industry 
rep edward j markey dmass chairman of the house

a nuclear regulatory commission headed by a 
single administrator instead of the current fivemember system 
should mean more responsibility and accountability at the top says 
the agencys chairman 
nrc chairman lando zech told the senate governmental affairs

transforming the nrc into an agency headed by a single 
administrator 
we do feel that the commission is functioning in a very good 
manner zech said we simply think it could function a lot 
better were frustrated as you can tell we are before you in 
a sense recommending that our jobs be eliminated we really do 
believe that this will better serve the interests of the american 
people 
under a bill sponsored by sens john breaux dla and alan 
simpson rwyo the nrc would be abolished and replaced by the 
nuclear safety agency the new agency would be headed by a single 
presidentially appointed administrator who must be confirmed by the 
senate 
breaux told the committee which was chaired by sen john glenn 
dohio there is a crying need to reorganize the nrc in order 
to rebuild the confidence of the american people

hot air balloonist per lindstrand is hoping to 
reach new heights this june with a 60000foot ascent over the 
south texas prairie 
the 39yearold swedish engineer who risked drowning in a 
recordsetting voyage across the atlantic last year will face the 
danger of decompression as he tries to go 4876 feet higher than 
ever flown in a hotair balloon 
the altitude record for hotair balloons is 55134 feet set in 
1980 by englishman julian nott in a flight from colorado 
lindstrand will make the voyage in an enclosed pressurized 
aluminum gondola navigating and maneuvering his 120foothigh 
balloon through instruments 
the balloon with a surface area of 35000 square feet would be 
made of a special foilcoated fabric that will improve the 
balloons heat retention 
the adventure scheduled to unfold about 27 miles north of 
laredo texas in early june was outlined at a news conference 
wednesday 
balloonists have been unable to get higher because a shortage of 
oxygen causes the burners that heat the air inside the balloons to 
extinguish at the high altitude 
lindstrand said new technology and techniques he has developed 
over the last five years should allow his balloons burners to 
continue well beyond 55000 feet 
the biggest risk is obviously highaltitude decompression 
lindstrand said 
a sudden capsule decompression at 60000 feet could cause the 
craft to explode outward because of the difference in air pressure 
even short of an explosion sudden decompression could cause 
lindstrand to lose consciousness within seconds and cause death 
within minutes organizers of the trip said lindstrand will be 
wearing a pressurized suit 
the most critical factor may be the weather he said 
robert b brice the projects weather expert said that nearly 
flat calm wind conditions will be needed to make the flight 
successful because the huge balloon will be extremely difficult to 
control as it comes in for a landing 
depending on wind conditions the organizers said the balloon 
may land as far as 100 miles from where it will be launched 
lindstrand said the plans call for the balloon to make a cold 
descent from more than 60000 feet to about 11000 feet when the 
burners will be restarted to proceed with a landing 
if the burners cant be restarted to further slow the descent 
lindstrand would abandon the capsule at about 4000 feet and 
parachute to earth 
lindstrand last year attracted worldwide attention with a 
recordbreaking flight across the atlantic from maine to ireland 
it was the first time anyone had made such a trip in a hotair 
balloon although three previous flights had been made in helium 
baloons 
the transatlantic trip almost ended in tragedy when the balloon 
descended from 27000 feet scraped along the irish countryside and 
then plunged into the irish sea 
lindstrand and fellow balloonist richard branson were forced to 
jump into the water and later were rescued lindstrand swam for 
more than two hours against strong currents before being picked up 
by the british royal navy 
lindstrands records as a hotair balloonist are for the fastest 
flight averaging 100 miles per hour the farthest flight of 3075 
miles and the longest flight of 31 hours 41 minutes

illinois sen paul simons income fell nearly 
9000 in 1987 but he nonetheless reported a gain in net worth 
during his quest for the democratic presidential nomination 
in a detailed financial statement released wednesday simon and 
his wife jeanne listed assets of 361978 and liabilities of 
219243 at the end of the year down from assets of 369777 and 
liabilities of 230886 in 1986 
the reduction in financial obligations boosted their net worth 
from 138891 to 142735 a gain of almost 4000 
simon said the couples income fell from 130624 in 1986 to 
121850 last year despite a senate pay raise boosting his salary 
from 75100 to 87483 
a comparison of financial statements for 1986 and 1987 showed 
royalties from the sale of books simon has written declined by 
13000 and his senate expense reimbursements last year were 
10000 lower 
however the declines were offset in part by an expense 
reimbursement of 3000 from simons presidential campaign

wildlife biologists blasted gaspowered 
cannons to frighten birds from nesting marshes where a 
175000gallon oil spill has killed at least 130 birds as a 
frantic cleanup continued under threat of rain 
a shell oil official meanwhile said wednesday that the 
spillage of thick crude in coastal wetlands about 40 miles 
northeast of san francisco occurred saturday after operators of an 
oil tank violated the companys written rules the unanswered 
policy question is how and why the plants practice came to deviate 
so drastically from company procedures plant manager ron 
banducci told reporters during a tour of the storage area at the 
shell refinery 
larry kolb principal engineer of the state regional water 
quality control board called the spill during the nesting season 
an ecological disaster in which damaged areas may take a year 
or more to recover 
kolb and other officials said they fear rain and high tides will 
spread the oil now largely trapped in peyton slough and shorelines 
of carquinez strait to environmentally sensitive bird sanctuaries 
farther north and west 
extra teams of the california conservation corps totaling about 
50 members arrived wednesday to help the 100 shell workers already 
involved in the cleanup of the patchy 12mile stretch of oil 
weve got a long way to go and were trying to get there as 
fast as we can capt larry broddrick of the state fish and game 
department said wednesday 
state wildlife biologists set up a dozen zon guns propane 
gaspowered cannons to scare birds away from peyton slough and 
marsh where about 80000 gallons of the oil have been trapped by 
manmade booms in the water 
by wednesday night about 400 oilcoated birds had been rescued 
from the marsh and about 130 of them had died according to capt 
dave zawadzki of the us coast guard at least two dozen turtles 
marsh mice and muskrats also were found dead 
the spill occurred when oil tank workers left the valve open to 
a line designed to carry rainwater off the top of the tank into the 
slough banducci said the line which passes through the tank 
ruptured and the oil escaped through it undetected according and 
kolb 
the refinerys procedures call for the releases of water to be 
regulated by manual control 
the wrong method was used only at tank 1256 the source of the 
spill and a twin that sits next to it said banducci rainwater 
for 173 other oil storage tanks is either collected in basins and 
checked before discharge or sent to a treatment plant 
this was most definitely not an individual operator error 
banducci said adding that a shell safety committee is evaluating 
the spill and will issue a report on how it occurred later 
kolb estimated the cleanup could cost shell 4 million or more 
including 3 million in penalties 
he said a temporary dam may have to be built at the mouth of the 
slough in case persistent high clouds turned to rain however rain 
was not expected through friday according to the national weather 
service

as contests go monday night winning lineup 
was a bust for sponsoring beatrice cos a boon for about 2400 
players and a few hours work for a few lawyers 
the attorney for most of those winning players said wednesday 
the first checks were in the mail from the 2 million settlement 
that stemmed from beatrices cancellation of the game two weeks 
ahead of schedule 
chicago lawyer lawrence leck who filed their classaction 
lawsuit said individual checks would range from 130 to 32000 
but lineup costs may have gone well beyond 2 million 
player frank maggio who said hed broken the games pattern and 
scratched clear 4018 winning entries worth more than 16 million 
reached a separate settlement with the company for an undisclosed 
sum 
the case was settled on terms that are confidential said 
atlanta attorney richard schneider who represented maggio in the 
earlier case 
the decision to keep everything confidential was a mutual 
one said beatrice spokeswoman kay carpenter from her los angeles 
office 
but maggio apparently did well enough to leave his job late last 
year and go into semiretirement at age 25 a friend said 
his lawsuit was filed against beatrice now known as bci on 
dec 26 1985 
maggio accused the chicagobased food and homeproduct 
conglomerate with breach of contract because it canceled the 
contest nov 29 nearly two weeks before the dec 6 deadline 
mentioned on the back of the game cards 
the promotion offered prizes ranging from food coupons to a 
super bowl trip for eight in a private jet or cash equivalents in 
a widely distributed newspaper advertisement beatrice said it was 
canceling the contest because it had learned the game could be 
manipulated 
that revelation came from maggio 
i told them what i had done offered to show them how id done 
it and told them i wanted to negotiate for less money than i had 
in winning cards at the time maggio said at the time 
i think they believed me he added but they kind of blew 
me off 
joining maggio as a plaintiff in that lawsuit was jim curl his 
friend and supervisor at the job he then held with proctor amp gamble 
inc in atlanta 
curls wife said he was out of town wednesday and wouldnt 
discuss terms of the settlement 
maggios close friends have been instructed not to speak to 
reporters 
but one friend who spoke on condition of anonymity said maggio 
had gone back north where hes from and is taking it easy 
he doesnt want to be found the friend said 
lineup required players to scratch the cards surface to 
correctly pick the winners and the number of touchdowns and field 
goals in eight televised national football league contests 
maggio said he broke lineup by finding there were only 309 
variations he then made a completely scratchedoff master card for 
each of the 309 by scratching clear the first game on a given 
card he knew which variation he held 
experts said beatrice made two basic mistakes with lineup 
first the company should have used a computer to generate an 
infinite variety of gamecard patterns 
secondly the cards omitted language that would have limited 
beatrices liability 
this ranks right up there with some of the big promotional 
foulups in recent memory richard blashek executive vice 
president for ventura associates international a new yorkbased 
contest and sweepstakesplanning service said wednesday

polls are pointing to a potentially close 
general election race between george bush and michael dukakis with 
jesse jackson more hindrance than help as a democratic vice 
presidential nominee 
voter opinions change in the course of a campaign and the 
recent round of surveys testing bush against dukakis with and 
without jackson may bear no resemblance to the outcome six months 
from now pollsters said in interviews this week 
but the polls do establish a benchmark from which future 
movement can be judged they said and taken in context the polls 
can highlight candidate strengths and weaknesses providing clues 
to the campaigns likely course 
were not clairvoyant this the way it is right now its 
april its not november its close in april said abc news poll 
chief jeff alderman if dukakis was trailing bush by 20 points 
we could say something now 
that lack of a big lead for the betterknown bush is one 
important result of the recent polls 
its not too early to know that its a close race said cbs 
news poll director warren mitofsky obviously things are going to 
happen between now and november that will change this thats what 
campaigns are all about but its fair to conclude that theres 
going to be a contest 
the biggest spread between the likely nominees was in a poll 
conducted april 2122 for time magazine dukakis had an 11point 
lead over bush 50 to 39 a gallup poll april 2123 showed a 
virtual tie bush 45 dukakis 43 as did a usa todaycnn poll april 
2021 dukakis 45 bush 43 
the margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points 
for each of the three polls 
history demonstrates that such early polls dont always predict 
the result in late may 1984 an abc newswashington post poll put 
walter mondale 11 points behind president reagan among likely 
voters immediately after the democratic convention mondale on a 
crest of good publicity pulled even with reagan in some polls but 
he lost in november by 18 points 
during the campaign mitofsky noted mondale came out for higher 
taxes a similar silly move could cost bush or dukakis just as 
dearly he said 
because many voters have not made firm choices thus far this 
year poll numbers are liable to jump around partly through 
differences in survey methods said andrew kohut gallups 
president he said that could explain the time polls relatively 
large lead for dukakis 
more important while polls are a pretty good indication of 
how voters feel today kohut said you have to keep in mind 
what today represents 
the polls were done shortly after dukakis big win in new york 
and thus amid considerable positive publicity for the massachusetts 
governor kohut noted in contrast there was little news of bush 
that week the result a favorable bias for dukakis 
that may change alderman said as dukakis becomes better known 
and undergoes more critical scrutiny the polls key message for 
the moment he said is that bush is not the shooin some analysts 
thought him to be 
one of the myths of the election was that the democrats cant 
win alderman said the democrats can win i think people are 
beginning to see that now 
there is less agreement among pollsters on surveys that suggest 
vice presidential candidates alderman said other polls have 
indicated that most voters solely consider the presidential 
nominee even the dramatic choice of geraldine ferraro as 
democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984 seemed neither to help 
nor hurt the ticket 
nonetheless the recent polls did indicate an impact if jackson 
ran as the vice presidential candidate while the gallup poll 
showed bush and dukakis about even when their names alone were 
given a proposed ticket of bush and rep jack kemp rny had a 
10point lead over a dukakisjackson ticket 5040 
the usa todaycnn poll asking about bush with an unnamed 
running mate against dukakis and jackson had the republicans up 
4942 the time poll done the same way had the democrats ahead 
4742 but had dukakis farther ahead of bush without jackson on the 
ticket 
i think its clear that jackson hurts the ticket said 
ia lewis pollster for the los angeles times also because 
opinions are not fully formed the proposition of a dukakisjackson 
ticket right now may be drawing uncritical support from both 
dukakis and jackson supporters he said 
what youre not measuring now is the people who like dukakis 
but not jackson or the people who like jackson but not dukakis 
lewis said

councils in an election boycotted by most opposition parties 
more than 15000 policemen were deployed in four provinces where 
28 million voters were eligible to select 155 council members 
during the campaign at least three people were killed by a 
guerrilla group 
only six of sri lankas 18 political parties took part in the 
election the other parties boycotted saying president junius r 
jayewardene should hold general elections before the district 
councils are formed 
elections in three more districts are scheduled for june 2 
balloting was postponed indefinitely in the northern and eastern 
provinces where tamil separatists are waging a civil war and where 
most of sri lankas 28 million tamils live 
leo perara deputy inspector general of police told the 
associated press that all possible security measures had been taken 
to frustrate any attempts by the outlawed peoples liberation front 
to disrupt the balloting 
the front an ultranationalist sinhalese group tried to 
disrupt the campaign by killing at least three people in recent 
weeks police said the front also was accused of the unsuccessful 
attempt on jayewardenes life in a grenade attack last august

lanka last july that aims to end nearly five years of guerrilla war 
by the islands minority tamils for an independent homeland the 
front contends that the accord makes too many concessions to the 
tamils

exchange for creation of the district councils which are to give 
people some say in local government affairs 
the largest tamil rebel group the tigers has rejected the pact

northwestern district the northcentral district and the uva and 
sabaragamuwa districts in the south

a former argentine general who was his 
nations most wanted fugitive for three years can be extradited to 
face charges in 39 killings that occurred during seven years of 
military rule there a judge ruled 
us district judge d lowell jensen on wednesday granted 
argentinas request for the extradition of carlos suarez mason on 
monday a federal judge here ordered suarez mason to pay 21 
million in damages to a lawyer who was tortured at argentine 
prisons under the generals command during the 1970s dirty war 
against leftists 
suarez mason faces a maximum sentence of life in prison 
jensen rejected suarez masons claim that the crimes for which 
he was wanted in argentina were political and therefore exempt from 
extradition the exception for political offenses does not apply to 
deaths that occurred to disarmed prisoners he said 
suarez mason has submitted no evidence to implicate any of the 
homicide victims in any sort of violent or revolutionary 
activity jensen said 
thus there is absolutely nothing in the record which would 
support a finding of a rational nexus between the homicides and any 
uprising which may have been occurring he said 
suarez mason 64 is not charged with personally committing any 
of the killings but he issued a secret 1977 order making his 
office responsible for choosing the targets of raids whose victims 
were often kidnapped and killed jensen said 
the former general also was responsible for the construction of 
detention centers used to hold civilians the judge said 
jensen refused to block extradition while the ruling is 
appealed but defense lawyers said they expected to get an 
immediate stay from the 9th us circuit court of appeals an 
appeal could take as long as a year 
this is merely a temporary setback said jt prada one of 
suarez masons lawyers he said suarez mason who listened to a 
spanish translation of wednesdays hearing on a headphone was a 
little bit upset you cant blame him 
jensen rejected four other murder charges sought by argentina 
ruling that the victims could not be identified 
under extradition law suarez mason can be tried only on charges 
for which extradition is approved the final decision on 
extradition is up to secretary of state george shultz 
justice has been done said horacio martinezbaca a former 
argentine lawyer who won the 21 million award in his civil suit 
martinezbaca had been held four years in suarez masons prisons 
and tortured 
two other civil suits by former argentinians are pending against 
suarez mason who contends he has no money 
suarez mason was argentinas most wanted fugitive during his 
three years of freedom before his arrest in january 1987 and is the 
highestranking former military officer currently facing trial by 
the civilian government he was not covered by the amnesty granted 
by the government to lowerranking military officials 
suarez mason commanded the first army corps and oversaw military 
prisons in the buenos aires district from 1976 to 1979 
he was summoned to a military tribunal after a civilian 
government came to power in late 1983 but fled he was arrested 
last year in foster city south of san francisco where he was 
living under an assumed name 
suarez masons lawyers offered two defenses against extradition 
that he was not responsible for his soldiers actions and that the 
actions were political and therefore exempt from extradition 
under the usargentina treaty because they were in response to 
alleged threats of a leftist takeover 
defense lawyers offered evidence of numerous attacks against 
government and military installations and business leaders before 
and after the 1976 military coup

swedens king carl xvi gustaf and queen 
silvia strayed from their royal schedule during a tour of 
disneyland to explore a ghost house and take an interstellar flight 
of fancy 
a quick tour of the magic kingdom had been scheduled for 
wednesday and at the outset the king appeared somewhat 
uncomfortable as he posed with minnie and mickey mouse and other 
cartoon characters 
but after riding disneylands pirates of the caribbean the 
couple warmed to the occasion showing an impromptu interest in 
other attractions 
they both had been here before but her majesty remembered 
what she called the ghost house and she wanted to see that again 
said disneyland spokeswoman carolyn long 
so the couple took an unexpected tour through the haunted 
mansion which long said is not really scary 
theyre the kind of ghosts you want to take home with you 
she said 
the king was drawn to disneylands star tours which 
simulates an imaginary ride through a universe designed by 
filmmaker george lucas 
they both were laughing it and they enjoyed it very much 
ms long said 
the tour started with a parade down main street during which the 
king and queen rode in a blackenameled horsedrawn carriage 
neither of them spoke to the crowds or to reporters during the 
visit 
the couple arrived in los angeles on monday for the last leg of 
their 17day 15city us tour celebrating the 350th anniversary 
of swedish immigration to america

the prosecutor and the defense attorney in 
bernhard goetzs attempted murder trial agree that the subway 
gunman received an illegal sentence and should be given a new one 
gregory waples assistant district attorney asked the state 
supreme courts appellate division on wednesday to send the case 
back to justice stephen crane for resentencing 
goetz a 41yearold selfemployed electronics technician was 
sentenced oct 19 to six months in jail plus 4 years probation 
for his conviction last year of thirddegree criminal possession of 
a weapon 
the weapon was a 38caliber revolver he used to shoot four 
teenagers on a subway on dec 22 1984 goetz said he shot the 
black teenagers because they were trying to rob him but they 
maintained they they were panhandling money 
three of the victims recovered from their wounds the fourth was 
paralyzed from the waist down and suffered brain damage 
goetz asked the apellate division to vacate the sentence and 
instead give him a year in jail because a quirk in the law would 
make him eligible for release in 60 days whereas he would have to 
serve at least four months of the sixmonth sentence imposed by 
crane 
waples said we agree with the defendant that this split 
sentence was illegal and must be vacated we also agree that this 
case should be remanded for imposition of a statutorily authorized 
sentence 
he said that by law the court must impose a definitive sentence

a protest strike virtually shut down arab east 
jerusalem and cities in the occupied west bank and gaza strip today 
despite israeli claims that the 5monthold palestinian uprising 
was on the wane 
following two infiltrations by arab guerrillas prime minister 
minister yitzhak shamir said on wednesday that guerrillas were 
trying to mount a spectacular attack on israel because the uprising 
was petering out 
today however east jerusalem streets were deserted in response 
to a strike call by uprising leaders even fruit and vegetable 
vendors normally active during strikes had closed 
in the gaza strip young palestinians whose faces were masked 
with checkered arab scarves stopped cars to ensure workers did not 
go to jobs in israel according to arab reports 
wrecked cars and huge rocks blocked roadways in the west bank 
town of bethlehem and oil was spread on some streets to discourage 
drivers bethlehems manger square normally busy with traffic and 
vendors was nearly empty 
an arab reporter noted that even bakeries were shut in nablus 
the west banks largest city 
in baghdad senior aides of yasser arafat on wednesday said the 
palestine liberation organization chairman traveled to the iraqi 
capital to meet with his commanders to discuss ways of escalating 
the palestinian uprising 
only scattered clashes were reported in recent days in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip where 174 arabs and two israelis 
have been killed since antiisraeli protests began dec 8 
protesters and israeli soldiers clashed twice on wednesday 
evening after moslems ended the sunrisetosunset fast that is kept 
daily during the holy month of ramadan according to reports 
jewish settlers and israel radio reported that arab residents in 
hebron stood on roofs and shouted slaughter the jews in a 
disturbance that lasted late into the night soldiers used tear gas 
to disperse the protesters no injuries were reported 
the incident began when youths stoned a group of jewish women 
walking through downtown hebron at 11 pm said miriam levinger 
who was in the group 
we were a group of about 15 women on a stroll when arabs began 
throwing stones at us mrs levinger said the army came 
immediately and fired tear gas at the arabs who disappeared into an 
alley 
earlier the army said arabs in the dheishe refugee camp near 
bethlehem stoned troops who responded with tear gas and rubber 
bullets 
a military spokeswoman said seven palestinians were taken to the 
hospital treated and released israel television said some 
suffered rubber bullet wounds and others fractures from beatings 
an army report on wednesday concluded that a 15yearold female 
jewish settler whose death in the occupied lands raised a furor was 
killed by a bullet from a careless israeli guard not by stones 
thrown by palestinians 
but the report also blamed arabs from the west bank town of 
beita for causing the april 6 confrontation with a group of israeli 
hikers during which two palestinians also died 
both guerrilla infiltrations this week were near mount dov in 
the golan heights on israels northeastern border in tuesdays 
clash three guerrillas and two israeli soldiers were killed in a 
fierce gun battle 
the two guerrillas killed on wednesday planned to take hostages 
to exchange them for arab prisoners held in israel using us 
ambassador thomas pickering as a negotiator said a military 
source citing documents found on their bodies the source spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
truck driver danny dahan 24 said the guerrillas fired at him 
and threw a grenade i jumped from the truck and it started to 
roll down and i hid behind it they fired at me while i crawled on 
the ground dahan told israel radio 
dahan ran about 1 miles before reaching an army post a soldier 
identified only as sgt sami told israel tv 
hundreds of soldiers combed the rocky terrain while two 
helicopter gunships blanketed the ground with fire to prevent the 
guerrillas from reaching nearby settlements said the military 
source three hours later troops spotted the guerrillas in a 
ravine we fired and they didnt have much choice but to die 
1st lt menny moses told israel tv 
the military source said the guerrillas were members of the 
prosyrian palestine liberation front headed by mohammed abbas 
who was blamed for the 1985 hijacking of the achille lauro cruise 
ship in which an american was killed in lebanon the prosyrian 
popular front for the liberation of palestine and the lebanese 
communist party both claimed responsibility

a woman who ran a red light was shot to death 12 
minutes later by police who mistakenly believed she had fired at 
them during a chaotic chase through harlem 
lydia ferraro 33 of fairview nj died in her car about 2 
am wednesday surrounded by 18 to 20 officers five officers fired 
13 times wounding her three times she was dead on arrival at a 
hospital police said 
assistant police chief mario selvaggi said no weapon was found 
in her car 
he said as many as 20 police officers answered a report of shots 
fired at police but the shots were from sgt john oconnor who 
tried to shoot out her tires after she refused to stop her car 
oconnor was suspended without pay for failing to be 
forthright in interviews with investigators after the shooting 
selvaggi said police later said he made a false statement 
regarding the firing of three shots 
selvaggi said oconnors use of the gun to try to stop the car 
appeared to violate police procedure which calls for a weapon to 
be fired only when officers are endangered by a suspect 
the incident began at 140 am when mrs ferraro ran a red 
light and refused to stop for patrol car officers who used a siren 
flashing lights and loudspeakers he said 
mrs ferraro a former drug addict enrolled in a methadone 
program slowly moved erratically up and down streets until at one 
point she ran up on a curb and stopped he said 
an officer tried to open her door but she sped off nearly 
pinning him against a wall said police spokesman peter odonnell 
after her car rolled over the sidewalk for about 60 feet and 
came off the curb oconnor fired three shots at her tires other 
officers radioed that shots had been fired and called for backup 
selvaggi said 
he said some officers might have been under the false impression 
that the shots were fired at the police officers and caused the 
transmission of a message that overdramatized the danger of the 
situation 
as other radio cars began responding mrs ferraro suddenly 
turned her car around and police converged on the scene he said 
one officer tried to pull her from the car but lost his grip and 
she lunged toward the passenger side police said somebody said 
three times watch out shes reaching for it selvaggi said 
a police sergeant and four officers opened fire hitting her in 
the cheek the left side of her body and her skull she was dead 
on arrival at harlem hospital 
no disciplinary action was taken against the officers who opened 
fire although they will be assigned to desk duties while the 
investigation continues 
the entire episode from the time she ran the red light to the 
time she was shot took about 12 minutes police said

japan and south korea today said a wideranging 
trade bill passed by the us congress would hurt world economic 
growth and they urged president reagan to veto the measure 
a top hong kong official however today said the british colony 
can live with the bill because some punitive provisions in the 
original version were removed or watered down in the final version 
taiwan also noted that the bill was less protectionist than 
other versions but added that it still requires the us government 
to retaliate against countries that violate bilateral trade pacts 
it leaves no room for negotiation said a statement from 
taiwans board of foreign trade taiwan said its trade surplus with 
the united states totaled a record 16 billion last year 
washington placed the figure at 19 billion 
the bill which was approved by the us senate on wednesday and 
passed in the house on april 21 now goes to reagan who has said he 
will veto it the measure toughens us retaliation against 
countries engaged in unfair trade 
japan strongly fears that if the bill is enacted in its 
present form it will have a serious impact on bilateral and 
multilateral economic cooperation and may hinder the development of 
the world economy japans chief government spokesman keizo 
obuchi said today 
the bill imposes trade sanctions against japans toshiba corp 
for its subsidiarys sale of sensitive equipment to the soviet 
union the sales violated rules of the coordinating committee for 
export control a parisbased group that regulates western 
hightechnology exports to communist nations 
joichi aoi president and chief executive officer of toshiba 
which stands to lose more than 50 million this year if the bill 
becomes law also expressed strong disappointment 
toshiba corp was neither involved in nor had any knowledge 
of the misconduct by toshiba machine co ltd aoi said in a 
statement thus we have been insisting that it would be grossly 
unfair to punish toshiba corp 
obuchis statement said the bills passage was extremely 
regrettable it added the government of japan strongly hopes 
that such a bill will not finally be enacted 
the united states says its overall trade deficit for 1987 was a 
record 1712 billion up from 1562 billion in 1986 the largest 
bilateral deficit was with japan a record 598 billion up from 
586 billion in 1986 
south koreas foreign ministry said in a statement that it hoped 
the us administration will take appropriate actions in line 
with its much publicized stand on the bill 
the statement by ministry spokesman kim hwangkyung said the 
bill contained provisions that might undermine an orderly growth 
of international trade 
kim also warned that the bill will hamper not only the 
liberalization efforts of the south korean government but also 
the smooth growing of the koreaus economic and trade 
relationship 
he said korea fully understands the united states trade deficit 
problems and has been making serious efforts to open its own market 
the bill would affect current international trade negotiations 
and lead the world economy to a probable downturn kim added 
little progress has been reported in recent us negotiations 
with seoul over american access to south korean markets the united 
states ran a trade deficit of nearly 10 billion with korea in 1987 
in hong kong director of trade michael sze said the trade bill 
is a much better bill than the original one and many of the 
provisions which we were concerned about have either been improved 
or dropped completely 
so from hong kongs perspective i think its a bill that we 
can live with sze told governmentrun radio television hong kong 
the united states ran up a 65 billion deficit on 145 billion 
in trade with hong kong last year 
although us officials have praised hong kongs dutyfree 
policies they want the colony to raise the value of its currency to 
make hong kong products more expensive and less competitive in the 
us market

of an agreement by members of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries and nonopec producers now meeting in vienna to 
limit oil production 
the dollar would fall if a strong deal emerges from vienna as 
the united states is a major oil importer said a trader in rome 
but another trader said the presence of texas railroad 
commissioner kent hance at the vienna meeting indicated that an 
agreement to cut oil production wouldnt be completely negative for 
the us economy

the leader of south koreas top 
opposition party said today that the government lost parliamentary 
elections because voters believed it was dragging its feet on 
democratic reforms 
kim daejung leader of the party for peace and democracy also 
accused the united states of imprudent and inconsiderate 
statements amounting to interference in south korean affairs and 
said antius sentiment is rising 
kim vowed parliamentary investigations into alleged official 
fraud and corruption 
but he also told reporters that his party would be sincere and 
humble in our attitude to any kind of negotiations with the 
government if it allows a healthy and constructive climate to 
arise 
kim said he did not expect any political instability here before 
the 1988 olympics open in seoul on sept 17 he indicated his party 
would be willing to defer some issues until after the olympics 
he also said his party would seek common ground with the two 
other main opposition parties in pressing for greater democracy 
the release of political detainees and the revision of immoral 
laws 
kim mentioned the national security act under which some 
dissidents have been accused of favoring communism 
kim and a leader of the reunification democratic party said they 
would consider a proposal by former prime minister kim jongpil 
leader of the third opposition party to coordinate activities 
kim jongpils new democratic republican party won 35 seats in 
tuesdays elections those seats could give a majority in the 
299seat assembly to either the government party or the combined 
main opposition parties 
the government party has 125 seats kim daejongs party 71 and 
the reunification democratic party of kim youngsam has 59 
the elections gave a sharp boost to kim daejung 62 a 1971 
presidential candidate who spent long periods in prison or under 
house arrest and then was seen as a fading figure after finishing 
third in presidential balloting last december 
president roh taewoo won in december with 366 percent of the 
vote after kim daejung and kim youngsam both insisted on running 
and split the opposition vote six months earlier as governing 
party chairman roh had announced democratic reforms following 
massive antigovernment protests 
kim daejung told a news conference that despite pledges of 
greater democracy rohs administration had delayed in registering 
new newspapers until after tuesdays election did not release all 
political detainees and seemed to be reneging on promises to allow 
the election of mayors and provincial governors 
kim also reiterated charges of massive government fraud in 
presidential and parliamentary balloting but said voters had not 
been swayed by government power and money this time 
kim said more than 1000 political detainees remained in custody 
and without their release i dont believe there will ever be 
political stability in this country he said his party never has 
demanded the release of communists 
he said he had not studied us suggestions that south korea pay 
more of the cost of stationing american troops here under a defense 
treaty but said it has been a great political gamble for me to 
defend the united states 
kim said the united states supported the roh government for 
selfish interests and had interfered in korean politics by 
describing the december elections as fair and by saying in an 
official report that south korea no longer had a human rights 
question 
this is an imprudent and inconsiderate position kim said

police and school officials cant explain 
what triggered a threemonth spree of car thefts now linked to 10 
teenagers who are accused of using tools made in a high school 
shop class 
normally you dont find that kind of operation in a small 
town like ours metamora police chief mike walters said wednesday 
walters said most of the 2500 residents of metamora about 15 
miles northeast of peoria were stunned by the allegations against 
the teens who were arrested tuesday at rural metamora high school 
theyre surprised at the number of kids involved and the 
amount of property taken he said 
the students face felony charges that include vehicle burglary 
and conspiracy to commit vehicle burglary police said 
their names were withheld because the two girls and eight boys 
who have no previous police records are juveniles ranging in age 
from 15 to 17 two of the youths face 27 counts each of burglary 
and conspiracy 
the group has been linked to 33 burglaries in peoria and 14 in 
tazewell and woodford counties in addition police said the group 
is responsible for a residential theft in tazewell county 
police estimated the value of the threemonth crime spree 
exceeds 10000 
two individuals were making tools for their friends to gain 
entry to vehicles peoria police capt lawrence burwell said 
wednesday 
the tools resembled the slimjims used by police to enter 
locked cars burwell said the devices were used in most of the 
burglaries although some vehicles were entered using coat hangers 
or by simply breaking windows he said 
the thieves usually took money radar detectors and stereo 
equipment and some items later were sold to friends and relatives 
burwell said the investigation by local police was still active 
they went out at night and on weekends driving around and 
looking for something good he said 
it appears two of them made the tools in shop class but there 
is no link to anyone else at the school burwell said 
metamora principal martin stromberger was concerned mostly with 
the ties to his schools shop class he cited a lack of parental 
guidance for the arrests and said the schools role in the incident 
was minimal 
we dont have a course on burglary tools stromberger said

immigration commissioner alan nelson said 
today xtending the may 4 deadline for illegal aliens to apply for 
amnesty would send a very bad signal to people below the border 
the senate is considering a measure passed by the house that 
would extend the deadline to nov 30 sen phil gramm rtexas 
stopped attempts to bring the issue to a vote wednesday 
extending it would send a very bad signal to people below the 
border nelson said on cbs this morning 
he said the long lines of aliens applying as the deadline nears 
are the result of people leaving it until the last minute not 
because of a flaw in the program 
nelson estimated between 17 million and 18 million people 
would apply under the program before the deadline with the number 
gaining legal status swelling to 3 million as eligible relatives 
are allowed to enter the country 
an immigration rights advocate darlene kalke accused the 
commission of failing in its efforts to inform immigrants about the 
program 
theres a lot of confusion a lot of fear said ms kalke 
also interviewed on cbs 
if gramm or another senator continues today to block the vote 
the soonest the senate could move to cut off debate would be friday 
gramm said there has been a mammoth increase in the number of 
people entering the country illegally in the past year because 
word spread that a tough new immigration law would not be enforced 
if we came in now and changed the law on the very eve of it 
going into effect the net result would be to cast further doubt on 
the credibility of the law and that would bring numerous people 
across the border illegally gramm said 
we extended the deadline for taxes why not amnesty asked 
sen edward kennedy dmass the may 4 deadline has turned out to 
be too short and too harsh a refusal to extend it is cruel and 
vindictive 
the house passed the extension 213201 last week a majority 
much too small to override a threatened presidential veto 
president reagan signed the landmark immigration law in november 
1986 and no changes have been made since then 
the law carefully balanced a legalization program for illegal 
aliens with penalties for employers who knowingly hire undocumented 
workers 
under the law aliens who came to the united states illegally 
but have lived here continuously since before jan 1 1982 were 
given one year to apply for temporary residency as the first step 
toward permanent status that 12month deadline is may 4 
those who favor the extension of that deadline argue the 
immigration and naturalization service reacted too slowly at the 
beginning of the amnesty period and did not spread the word to the 
immigrant communities to apply for temporary residency 
in addition many illegal aliens were thought to fear appearing 
at an office of the ins the agency that also deports those here 
illegally 
the law specifically prohibits the ins amnesty employees from 
sharing their records with enforcement agents 
during house debate the chief sponsor of the extension rep 
romano l mazzoli dky said 12 million aliens have applied for 
the general amnesty program and 729000 have received temporary 
residency cards another 400000 have applied for a spearate 
agricultural amnesty program that is not affected by the extension 
legislation

more than a dozen people have offered to 
adopt a toddler who was found wandering in traffic a month ago but 
state officials are continuing their search for his relatives 
despite a flood of calls to state social workers since a judge 
allowed the 18monthold boys picture to be published last week 
investigators say they still have few hard leads 
it is so sad said gwen mckenzie a child abuse and neglect 
investigator with the states department of health and 
rehabilitative services this isnt something that happens every 
day 
if there were relatives out there they would have called 
she said either someone knows this boy and is not coming forward 
or he is not from this area 
the only clue authorities have is a confusing account by a man 
who says hes little kennys uncle and that the boys father 
left a skid row bar last month bound for washington state on a 
borrowed motorcycle 
he doesnt seem to know very much about the boy lakeland 
police detective miles watson said wednesday we want to find the 
father so we can verify this is not some boy who was kidnapped 
somewhere else in the country 
hrs officials have listed the toddler with child find in 
tallahassee and the national registry for missing children in case 
the child was abducted in another part of the country and parents 
are searching for him 
the toddler has been in protective custody since march 25 when 
he was rescued from traffic the next day michael smokey kwil 
reported his 18monthold nephew missing from the same area 
kwil told lakeland police he first saw the boy on march 23 in a 
bar the child was with kwils halfbrother david skaggs he told 
police during the night skaggs borrowed a motorcycle and left 
kwil said 
kwil has told differing stories about what happened to the boy 
but watson said it appeared the child wandered away from kwils 
trailer not far from where he was found in traffic 
a misdemeanor child abuse charge has been filed against kwil 
if responsible relatives are not located the courts could put 
the boy for adoption in about six months ms mckenzie said more 
than a dozen people had already called by wednesday offering to 
adopt the little boy

government warplanes bombed a food 
relief station in droughtstricken northern ethiopia and killed at 
least 50 people after the area fell into rebel hands two western 
sources said 
but the sources disputed a claim by the rebel tigre peoples 
liberation front that the government used naplam in the april 8 
attack near wukro in tigre province 
the guerrilla group said 31 people mostly children were killed 
or wounded in the bombing which hit a kindergarten 
but the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity wednesday 
night said at least 50 people were killed and many more wounded in 
the attack which occurred at a food distribution center run by the 
genevabased international committee of the red cross 
a red cross representative was at wukro the day of the attack 
but left before the attack the sources said they said the 
warplanes stuck about 30 minutes after monthly food allotments had 
been distributed to 5000 to 8000 peasants and that thousands of 
drought victims were milling about 
thats why so many people were killed said one of the 
sources who quoted eyewitnesses who said the attack on the 
civilians was intentional 
they flew over and looked at them and came back and hit 
them said the source 
neither of the sources could say how many bombs were dropped or 
what type of aircraft were used in the attack the ethiopian 
military normally uses sovietmade mig figthers 
wukro came under rebel control in midmarch during the same 
time rebels operating in neighboring eritrea ethiopias 
northernmost province also scored major victories 
government troops retreated to the major towns in the two 
provinces but officials have said a major campaign is planned soon 
against the rebel movements 
the government pullback and the april 6 expulsion of foreign aid 
workers from the north has severely crippled the effort to save 
more than 3 million northern ethiopians from starvation 
the government said it ordered foreigners out of the north to 
keep them from getting caught in the middle of the fighting 
the tigre peoples liberation front has been fighting the 
central government in addis ababa for 14 years in a campaign to win 
more rights for the region in eritrea the seccessionist eritrean 
peoples liberation front has been fighting for 27 years in 
africas longest civil war

federal drug investigators have teamed with 
eastern airlines officials to find out how 1 million worth of 
cocaine got to national airport hidden in the toilet holding tanks 
of a jet from miami 
drug enforcement administration special agent mario perez said 
it is not the first time drugs have been hidden in the toilets of 
planes but it is unlikely that a normal passenger could have done 
it 
the plane eastern flight 806 originated in barranquilla 
colombia and landed in miami for unloading and us customs 
inspection before going on to washington where the drugs were 
discovered early wednesday its final destination was to be kansas 
city 
so far we dont know where the drugs either originated or were 
to be picked up said dea special agent john wilder but he 
concurred with perez that it appeared to be an inside job 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said the airline was 
cooperating fully with investigators but it was too soon to 
speculate how or where the drugs got on board 
she said there have been arrests of eastern personnel on drug 
smuggling charges in the past but not recently 
the cocaine was discovered by a maintenance crew searching for 
the source of a leak in a toilet in the forward portion of the 
plane 
five packages of 85 percent pure cocaine the size of bricks and 
wrapped in plastic were found in the tank 
a drugsniffing dog brought in by dea agents and airport police 
found another five packages in the rear toilet holding tanks 
officials said the 10 kilograms of cocaine had a street value of 
more than 1 million 
in this area it was one of the larger amounts that has been 
seized perez said 
he said the plane would have been checked in miami by us 
customs officials who normally board all aircraft coming into the 
united states and search for evidence of drug smuggling 
i dont know if they use canines though he said 
ceremsak said eastern security personnel also participate in 
searches of planes from out of the country but she would not 
specify whether drugsniffing dogs are used 
we believe the persons who were to receive it knew that it 
was there and were to go to the aircraft when it was serviced 
said perez 
no arrests were made immediately 
this could have been a major drug supply route and the 
shipments could have gone on for awhile said wilder we just 
dont know how long its been going on

homosexuals seeking full recognition by the 
united methodist church praised a statement by the denominations 
bishops calling aids a disease not a sin but say they expect 
no further advances from the churchs quadrennial meeting here 
the delegates to the general conference will use the language 
of faith when they talk about our living and our loving but the 
odor in the air will be that of fear the rev morris floyd a 
spokesman for affirmation united methodists for lesbiangay 
rights said wednesday at a news conference 
the methodists 100member council of bishops in a statement 
issued last week declared that aids was a disease not a sin 
and that god does not wage germ warfare on the human family 
but the council also repeated the churchs official disapproval 
of sex outside of heterosexual marriage and continued to deny 
leadership roles to homosexuals in the church 
nearly 1000 delegates are attending the twoweek general 
conference that began monday and runs through may 6 the united 
methodist church with 96 million members is the secondlargest 
protestant denomination in the united states it also has members 
in europe africa and the philippines 
language in church law that calls homosexuality incompatible 
with christian teaching and says that selfavowed practicing 
homosexuals are not to be accepted as candidates ordained as 
ministers or appointed to serve in the united methodist church is 
scheduled to be debated monday 
affirmation has 31 chapters nationwide and 32 methodist 
congregations have affirmed their openness to full participation by 
homosexuals spokeswoman mary gaddis said gaddis a lesbian said 
she did not expect the church to grant equal status to homosexuals 
during the conference 
the chances are zero in the next 10 days she said in 10 
years thats a possibility 
most methodists like most other people think they dont know 
anyone who is lesbian gay or bisexual said floyd the only 
information they have about us is based on myth and stereotype 
with little more connection to reality than the racisminspired 
image of little black sambo bears to black americans 
church leaders have responded to such charges by saying that 
they are on record as insisting that all persons are entitled to 
have their human and civil rights ensured 
the churchs book of discipline published in 1984 goes on to 
say homosexual persons no less than heterosexual persons are 
individuals of sacred worth who need the ministry and guidance of 
the church in their struggles for human fulfillment as well as the 
spiritual and emotional care of a fellowship 
the move to delete the restrictive language from church doctrine 
has been opposed by several conservative groups including good 
news an unofficial caucus that represents itself as the center of 
scriptural christianity in the denomination 
floyd was put on involuntary leave of absence for several years 
by bishop jack tuell of los angeles after floyd acknowledged that 
he was homosexual in 1984 tuell agreed to appoint floyd to his 
current job as executive director of a mental health center in 
minneapolis serving lesbians and gay men

diligent coverage by us journalists in panama 
is crucial to combat a misinformation campaign engineered by gen 
manuel noriega and his crackdown on panamas opposition press said 
panamas ambassador to the united states 
the enemies of democracy are acutely aware that if they are to 
succeed in their designs of world domination freedom of the press 
must be fought juan bautista sosa said in a luncheon address to 
the 102nd annual convention of the american newspaper publishers 
association here wednesday 
as we have seen in the case of panama freedom of the press 
has become not only the biggest obstacle to the totalitarian regime 
but also its most formidable foe 
earlier wednesday the publishers heard from soviet spokesman 
gennady gerasimov the commander of the us pacific command and 
various local experts on the asiapacific region 
the anpa which represents 1400 newspapers also conducted its 
annual business meeting which included formally electing officers 
and directors to its 22member board the threeday convention 
attracted more than 2000 people representing 90 percent of the 
us daily newspaper circulation 
the united states should communicate with noriega but cannot 
negotiate the future of panama sosa said after the speech 
representatives from the us state department are conversing 
with noriega but theyre not negotiating with him while the us 
definitely has legitimate concerns in panama what were facing is 
basically a panamanian problem and requires a panamanian 
solution he said 
with panamas economy in shreds and noriega still in power three 
months after being indicted by the united states on drug charges 
the us government has been forced to rethink its strict 
conditions for his ouster 
michael kozak the state departments deputy assistant for legal 
affairs held secret meetings with noriega recently sosa said 
kozak was expected to meet again with noriega next week 
us economic sanctions alone would not topple noriega but us 
military action against noriega at this time would be too drastic 
sosa said 
noriega is defeated for all practical purposes sosa said 
and a move by the us military might give him ammunition by 
fueling his claims that he is a national hero defending his country 
against the united states 
sosa remains loyal to president eric arturo delvalle who was 
ousted by noriega two months ago 
gerasimov said that greater freedom of information in the soviet 
union has given soviet citizens not only a better view of the 
world but an improved sense of history 
we have a real information explosion in our country now he 
said 
soviet journalists are now allowed to write about issues 
affecting their country such as prostitution and drug abuse and 
literary magazines that publish works by formerly dissident authors 
have seen huge gains in circulation he said 
we write about soviet history where we have a very many 
dark pages he said 
the climate for foreign journalists also has improved with the 
number of foreign correspondents almost doubling during the past 
five years he said 
there are 51 american journalists in moscow compared with 35 
soviet correspondents in new york and washington said gerasimov 
head of information for the soviet foreign ministry 
gerasimov who sometimes uses his dry wit to chide americans 
made a reference to former white house spokesman larry speakes 
admission in a book that he falsely attributed quotes to president 
reagan 
as i understand it i will be standing right there at white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwaters side to keep track of what 
reagan says at the upcoming moscow summit gerasimov said 
i am sorry for larry speakes because he cannot make from the 
book the money he lost from merrill lynch where he was forced to 
resign from a public relations job gerasimov said 
his speech was followed by a military briefing by adm ronald j 
hays with gerasimov still present the commander of the pacific 
command and two aides outlined an increasing soviet military 
presence in the pacific as well as us military capabilities there 
in the first talk in a general session devoted to the topic of 
asia and the pacific in the year 2000 victor hao li the 
president of the eastwest center here said that by the next 
century east and southeast asia will produce about 20 percent of 
the gross world product as recently as 1960 he said north 
america produced 36 percent with east and southeast asia 
contributing only 11 percent 
we must significantly alter our world outlook and adjust our 
national orientation to take into account the political economic 
and cultural forces of asia and the pacific he said

it was fairytale night for real at the royal 
ballet when the leading ballerina in swan lake was hurt during 
her performance danced on in pain then had to be replaced by a 
dancer who didnt know the role 
oh i loved it they were shouting at me from the wings and 
miming what i had to do but i couldnt dance and watch them as 
well so i just danced the substitute 20yearold viviana 
durante said after a sensational performance wednesday night 
it was a bit of a surprise to find a different ballerina in my 
arms in the middle of the third act said jay jolley of payson 
utah who was dancing the lead male role of prince siegfried in the 
classical russian ballet set to music by peter ilich tchaikovsky 
lets just say the fourth act was very vocal there was more 
talking than dancing going on but viviana was very cool very 
together he added 
there were gasps from those in the audience who could see it 
when the crisis began at the royal opera house 
maria almeida in the dual role of odetteodile danced tiptoe 
into the scenery on her left as she was going offstage after being 
transformed back into a swan at the end of the second act 
she fell against a sharpedged step and crashed to the floor 
but rose quickly and appeared to be unhurt as she disappeared into 
the wings 
miss almeida began the third act but was replaced by miss 
durante who stepped into the role just as she had to do the famous 
32 fouette turns a grueling series in which the dancer spins on 
one leg while whipping the other around her body 
miss durante received bravos and it was clear at that point that 
not everyone realizedthere had been a substitution 
the management then told all 
before the curtain went up for the fourth act anthony dowell 
the companys artistic director told the audience that miss 
almeida had been dancing in severe pain and was unable to complete 
the third act 
there was no understudy in the house and we have been ringing 
all the ballerinas in town who know the role but this is one of 
those nights when only their answering machines are answering he 
said 
there were cheers when dowell announced that italianborn miss 
durante who had danced as a peasant girl in the first act and as a 
cygnet in the second had frantically tried to learn the leading 
role in about five minutes 
it has been one of those alltooreal broadway showbusiness 
nights dowell said the audience thought it was terrific stuff 
and cheered 
miss durante received a standing ovation at the end and was 
showered with the daffodils and narcissi that fans had brought for 
miss almeida 
the angolaborn miss almeida 24 is widely admired she was 
promoted from soloist to principal dancer in september after six 
years with the royal ballet 
dowell said the extent of her injuries would not be known until 
after an xray today i just dont know how she danced so well in 
such pain and then to have someone else jump up and save the day 
thats theater

president najib vowed today that 
anticommunist rebels would never take over the afghan government 
and that soviet military advisers would remain in afghanistan 
indefinitely 
najib said negotiations with usbacked rebel forces in 
pakistan were continuing but he said the alliance of seven rebel 
groups has taken an illogical rigid stand in negotiations on a 
coalition government 
najib who spoke at a news conference for foreign journalists 
said the afghan government was confident it could stave off the 
insurgents after soviet troops withdraw if outside interference 
ceases a reference to us aid to the rebels 
the military cooperation of the soviet union with afghanistan 
began 23 years prior to the april revolution najib said 
referring to the sovietinspired coup 10 years ago that installed a 
marxist government 
he said soviet military assistance would not stop after the 
pullout of kremlin troops scheduled to begin on may 15 according 
to an accord signed in geneva this month 
it is not our position to stop cooperating with the soviet 
union especially when the situation is not settled yet he said

a fire described as the citys 
biggest since world war ii swept through a crowded shantytown near 
an oil storage area today and destroyed more than 1000 homes the 
fire chief said 
at least four people were reported injured in the blaze which 
spread thick black smoke over large sections of the capital no 
deaths were reported 
the governmentrun philippines news agency said an estimated 
3000 families were left homeless 
firefighters concentrated on preventing the flames from reaching 
the oil tanks rather than on saving houses and angry residents 
responded by pelting the trucks with stones they piled their 
belongings in the street and began fighting the blaze themselves 
with buckets of water 
the flames spread to within 24 feet of the stateowned petroleum 
company compound said col oscar pascual deputy fire chief fire 
chief brig gen ernesto madriaga said a shift in the winds 
prevented the fire from reaching it 
during the early stage fire threatened the depot because 
there was a strong wind blowing in that direction he said 
however wind direction changed and the fire near the depot was 
placed under control 
madriaga estimated that more than 1000 dwellings mostly 
squatter shanties were razed before the fire was brought under 
control after 4 hours the cause of the blaze had not been 
determined 
hundreds of people huddled around the mounds of personal 
belongings as scattered fires continued to burn into the night 
there was no immediate estimate of damage but madriaga said the 
blaze was possibly the biggest in manila since world war ii 
he said flames destroyed a candy warehouse and virtually every 
building in a 25acre area along the pasig river which runs 
through the heart of manila 
oil companies such as shell caltex and the staterun philippine 
national oil co maintain storage tanks in the area the 
presidential palace is about 1 miles away on the other side of the 
river 
firemen said they were unable to move trucks into the crowded 
shantytown alleys and concentrated their efforts on keeping the 
fire from the oil tanks 
troops armed with m16 rifles were sent to the depot after the 
residents began throwing stones at the fire trucks 
madriaga said the injured included three civilians and a fireman 
who was struck by a water hose 
antonio santos operations manager of the national oil company 
said the squatter area was too congested for even the best 
firefighters to have been able to battle the flames very well 
shanty homes in the philippines are normally made of wood 
cardboard and other flammable materials and are packed sidebyside 
mary bayani 27 whose home was destroyed said she was 
attending a bible study class about 3 pm 3 am edt when she 
heard children shouting fire fire 
she said the smoke seemed far away but we started just the 
same bringing our things out 
i saved our clothes and some kitchen utensils she said 
but we have no rice and no money 
mrs bayani said her husband rogelio worked in the burnedout 
candy warehouse and will probably lose his job 
we will stay here during the night she said but i dont 
know what we will do tomorrow

the price of imported goods one of the main 
inflationary threats facing the us economy rose 12 percent in 
the first three months of the year a slight improvement from the 
end of last year the government reported today 
the labor department said the first quarter increase followed a 
16 percent rise in import prices in the last three months of 1987 
and credited the slowdown to continued declines in energy costs and 
a more stable dollar 
the price of oil and other imported energy products fell 8 
percent during the first quarter without this decline overall 
import prices would have risen by 23 percent almost twice as fast 
as the actual overall increase 
at the same time the cost of american products being sold 
overseas rose by 14 percent during the first quarter a drop from 
a 2 percent price increase in the final three months of 1987 this 
change was credited to a big slowdown in the cost of exported food 
products which rose only 06 percent in the first quarter after 
shooting up by 91 percent in the fourth quarter 
american grain prices rose 31 percent following a 142 percent 
jump in the fourth quarter as a drop in wheat prices helped to 
offset continued increases in rice and corn prices 
the price of american meat products rose 51 percent following 
six months of declines while the index for fruits and vegetables 
fell for the fourth consecutive quarter 
on the import side foreign cars and machinery which account 
for nearly onehalf of all us imports rose 17 percent in the 
first quarter after increasing 27 percent in the fourth quarter 
during the first quarter the dollar declined in value against 
other currencies by 14 percent this was a substantial slowdown 
from a 58 percent plunge in the dollars value during the fourth 
quarter it reflected the massive buying of dollars on foreign 
currency markets which the united states and other countries have 
been doing this year to brake the greenbacks fall 
overall consumer prices rose 44 percent last year up from a 
11 percent rise in 1986 a turnaround in the cost of imported 
energy and higher import prices generally were blamed for much of 
the worsening in inflation last year 
this year many economists are looking for a further rise in 
consumer inflation of between 4 percent and 5 percent as the weaker 
dollar continues to push up the cost of imports 
the reagan administration led by treasury secretary james a 
baker iii launched an effort in september 1985 to drive the value 
of the dollar lower in an effort to shrink the countrys huge 
foreign trade deficits in february 1987 the major industrial 
countries switched course and started a coordinated effort to keep 
the dollar from falling further 
however that effort failed last year as market forces continued 
to batter the dollar on the assumption that continued high monthly 
trade deficits pointed up a need for a stilllower dollar to reduce 
americans appetite for imports

a navy ship was towing the stricken uss 
bonefish to port today after salvage crews found the bodies of 
three crewmen aboard the submarine apparently killed when 
explosions and fire filled the vessel with toxic smoke and gases 
the bodies were found wednesday aboard the 30yearold 
dieselelectric sub the navys atlantic fleet command said the 
navy refused to say when the bodies would be returned to grieving 
relatives ashore 
salvors from the uss petrel and uss hoist cautiously vented 
toxic fumes from the fire before the salvage crew could enter and 
the hoist take the crippled submarine in tow 
chief petty officer joseph c mowery said today that the 
submarine was expected to arrive in charleston south carolina in 
two to four days depending on the weather 
charleston is the bonefishs home port and 87 of the subs 
surviving 89 crew members have been taken there 
the navy refused to say if the bodies of lt ray everts 30 of 
naoma wva petty officer 1st class robert w bordelon jr 39 
of willis texas and petty officer 3rd class marshall t lindgren 
21 of pisgah forest nc were removed from the sub 
the bonefish was forced to the surface sunday about 160 miles 
off the florida coast after an explosion rocked the 219foot 
vessels forward battery compartment 
navy officials have said the three were last seen in the 
vessels control room and might have died while saving their 
shipmates 
that was his job getting people out said bordelons 
brother david in willis texas that was his responsibility and 
bobby is the kind who would help anybody 
lindgrens mother joyce said her son was a super boy a 
super son and became a super man when he went into the navy he 
dearly loved it and ive never heard anyone describe their job as 
gloriously as marshall did 
only two of the 22 crewmen suffering smoke inhalation from the 
accident remain hospitalized in the naval hospital in jacksonville 
fla both are in satisfactory condition and are expected to be in 
the hospital a week 
the 30yearold bonefish is one of the navys few remaining 
dieselelectric subs driven by diesel engines while on the surface 
and by batterypowered electric motors while submerged 
recharging those batteries generates hydrogen gas which can 
explode if allowed to accumulate 
the bonefishs initial explosion occurred while the sub was at 
periscope depth the sub was able to surface and cmdr john wilson 
42 the ships captain ordered the crew evacuated in the face of 
heavy smoke and toxic fumes 
they were taken off the sub by helicopter and whaleboat from the 
aircraft carrier john f kennedy and the frigate uss carr both of 
which were participating in exercises with the sub 
the last battery explosion aboard a navy dieselelectric sub was 
in 1949 off the norwegian coast when the uss cochino went down 
after a similar series of explosions during a gale 
the crew was successfully evacuated to the submarine uss tusk 
but seven tusk crew members died in the rescue

a louisiana house committee voted unanimously to repeal a law 
that requires people getting married to be tested for exposure to 
the aids virus a day after an illinois legislative committee 
approved a bill to repeal a similar law 
the louisiana law has chased hundreds of young couples to 
neighboring arkansas mississippi and texas to be married said 
rep alphonse jackson chairman of the house committee on health 
and welfare he said some physicians and laboratories charged as 
much as 200 for the tests 
the day before the vote wednesday in baton rouge the illinois 
house human services committee voted to repeal that states law 
both laws went into effect jan 1 
although the illinois repeal faces continued opposition from 
legislators who say it is premature louisiana committee members 
predicted easy passage the louisiana repeal is backed by 
physicians hospitals and even the author of the testing law 
committee members said they had no idea how many positive cases 
were discovered as a result of the tests because louisianas 
confidentiality laws prohibit disclosure of such information 
in illinois repeal supporters said that premarital testing 
uncovered one case of acquired immune deficiency syndrome for every 
4000 people tested 
dr louise mcfarland a physician with the louisiana department 
of health and hospitals acknowledged that the test is not 
foolproof 
a negative means theyve not had a chance to build up 
antibodies but it doesnt mean the virus is not there she said 
a direct test for the virus which attacks the bodys immune 
system and leaves it susceptible to fatal cancers and viruses is 
being developed but will be expensive mcfarland said 
mcfarland also said that those getting married arent in the 
highrisk groups which include homosexual men and drug abusers who 
share needles

three republican house members asked 
colleagues today to oppose a package of sanctions against south 
africa which they say amounts to a scorched earth policy that 
will hurt blacks 
the three reps doug bereuter of nebraska dan burton of 
indiana and william broomfield of michigan wrote a letter to 
members of the democraticcontrolled house foreign affairs 
committee as the panel prepared to vote on the sanctions package 
the package would impose tough sanctions on south africa such as 
prohibitions on all us investment on all imports from that 
country excluding strategic minerals and on us exports to the 
nation except donations to relieve human suffering 
supporters of the bill including rep william gray dpenn 
and howard wolpe dmich say the sanctions are needed because the 
limited restrictions imposed on south africa in 1986 have failed to 
reform the apartheid system of segregation 
but the gop members say the sanctions have backfired in some 
cases and tightening them will worsen the economic situation for 
blacks 
apartheid is breaking down despite not because of 
sanctions they said in a threepage letter they claim the 
sanctions have hurt us interests and stricter bans will throw 
black south africans out of work 
they cite a study by the new jersey division of investment 
which said new jersey lost 365 million in pension funds because of 
divestment measures 
the gop letter claimed that a study by cosatu the south african 
black labor union estimated that 2 million more south africans 
would be out of work by the year 2000 if sanctions are increased 
the three republicans urged their colleagues to support their 
substitute measure which does not repeal the 1986 sanctions but 
attempts to target us assistance to blacks 
among other things the substitute would provide housing loan 
guarantees to blacks and encourage us businesses to help the 
black business sector 
they said the substitute would lead to positive developments in 
the black community in contrast to the dellumswolpe legislation 
which takes a total scorched earth approach

jesse jackson won vermonts presidential 
caucuses according to official democratic party results released 
today 
jackson edged michael dukakis by winning 596 of the state 
convention delegates elected at local caucuses last week dukakis 
won 582 delegates while 120 were elected uncommitted albert gore 
won four delegates 
the percentages were 46 percent for jackson 45 percent for 
dukakis and 9 percent uncommitted 
craig fuller executive director of the state democratic party 
said the official tabulation had been slowed by mistakes found in 
some community caucuses he said for example that in several 
communities more delegates were elected than had been allocated to 
that town 
the delegates elected april 19 will attend the state democratic 
party convention next month at which time 14 of the states 19 
delegates to the national convention will be elected the remaining 
five spots belong to gov madeleine kunin a dukakis supporter and 
four party officials 
in vermont more than in any other state white people did not 
hesitate to vote for jesse jackson liz blum the jackson state 
coordinator said today it shows how independent and thoughtful 
vermonters are 
dukakis had won vermonts nonbinding presidential primary on 
march 1 receiving 56 percent of the vote to jacksons 26 percent 
blum said she feels jackson did better in the caucuses because it 
takes more of an effort to go to a caucus 
william wasserman the dukakis coordinator said jackson 
outorganized the dukakis campaign they organized in the 
smallest of communities as well as the larger ones that showed 
real persistence real dedication to detail 
blum said the jackson campaign would try to use its clout at the 
state convention to elect at least half of the delegates to the 
national convention and to pass resolutions supporting the equal 
rights amendment and calling for reducing the military budget by 
20 million and redirecting the money to a comprehensive 
cradletograve health care system

a politburo member appeared today at the 
huge lenin steel mills where management declared a strike by 
thousands of workers illegal and reportedly threatened to call in 
riot police to end the threeday walkout 
organizers said 16000 workers or half the work force were on 
strike at the mills outside the southern city of krakow to demand 
higher pay it is polands largest work stoppage since martial law 
stifled the independent solidarity labor union 6 years ago 
negotiations at the lenin works broke off early today 
alfred miodowicz a member of polands communist party politburo 
and the head of the allpoland trade union alliance was at the 
mill and said another government official deputy prime minister 
zbigniew szalajda also was expected szalajda is the governments 
industrial policy chief 
the personal involvement of two senior officials indicated a 
high level of official concern about the strike which comes only a 
few days before official may day celebrations an annual time of 
protest for government opponents 
miodowicz who began his career as a steel worker at the lenin 
plant in nowa huta outside krakow is the head of the union 
alliance created in 1982 to take solidaritys place 
asked by a western reporter about the possibility of using force 
to break the strike miodowicz said i dont think that will be 
necessary 
in other developments about 100 people staged a brief rally in 
krakow in support of the strike solidarity activists in the 
southeastern polish city of stalowa wola reaffirmed their call for 
a strike friday at an 18000worker heavy machinery plant there 
the government has raised prices 42 percent so far this year as 
part of a program to make the economy more marketoriented and 
there is widespread discontent that wages are lagging behind 
inflation 
the 16member strike committee was formally notified by a 
prosecutor today that their strike was illegal and company foremen 
were distributing forms in which each worker was asked to declare 
in writing whether or not he was on strike 
but the committee said it would ignore the prosecutors letter 
and told workers not to sign the forms said zygmunt lenyk an 
opposition activist in krakow 
amid signs of increasing tension at the plant negotiations with 
the strike committee that began at midnight lasted just 15 minutes 
and one committee member said they were told by a director that if 
a political solution was not found soon the zom0 special riot 
police will take over 
on wednesday the strikers rejected a government offer that 
nearly met their demand for a 50 percent pay increase 
management later told strike leaders that if no agreement was 
reached it would not be responsible for the security of the 
strikers solidarity adviser jacek kuron said today in warsaw 
stanislaw handzlik a strike committee member said by telephone 
that more than 12000 strikers were at the plant this morning 
organizers said workers were rotating inside the plant staying two 
shifts then going home for one 
outwardly the plant appeared calm with no banners and little 
activity 
the government was to enter talks today with city transit 
workers in lodz torun and grudziadz who are seeking higher wages 
on monday transit workers in the northwestern city of bydgoszcz 
staged an 11hour strike and won a 60 percent raise a day later 
the strike began at the lenin mills organizers said it was 
spontaneous 
the labor troubles are polands most serious since the yearlong 
heyday of the nowoutlawed solidarity trade union movement which 
ended with the governments december 1981 crackdown strikes of 
occupation were then violently broken up by riot police and 
hundreds of union supporters interned 
solidarity chairman lech walesa in a statement issued from his 
home in the northern port of gdansk on wednesday urged poles to 
put pressure on the authorities and called for the restoration 
of solidaritys legal status 
the strikers at the steel mills have demanded the government 
double the current 15 compensation for the price increases for 
industrial workers retirees teachers and health workers 
for themselves they demanded an immediate 50 percent raise in 
their average 105 monthly pay kuron the solidarity adviser said 
they turned down a management offer of a 50 raise to be phased in 
by october 
strikes over higher prices have a long tradition in postwar 
poland and caused government shakeups in 1956 1970 and 1980

the senate today approved a ban on federal 
money for programs that distribute clean needles to drug addicts 
unless the surgeon general finds that such methods will curb the 
spread of aids 
the amendment to an aids research and information spending bill 
was a compromise reached after the senate rejected two outright 
bans pushed by sen jesse helms rnc the conditional ban was 
approved on a voice vote after a 7027 vote to modify the outright 
ban 
the aids bill sponsored by sens edward kennedy dmass and 
orrin hatch rutah is attracting a plethora of controversial 
amendments ranging from the cleanneedle ban to restrictions on 
federally funded aids education materials 
public health authorities in some places are trying to stem the 
rapid spread of aids among drug addicts by allowing them to turn in 
dirty needles which may be contaminated and receive clean ones 
its far too early to make a final judgment on the 
needleexchange program the results are mixed there hasnt been 
adequate research said kennedy sponsor of the compromise 
amendment 
the amendment says money under the bill could not go for clean 
needles for individuals for the purpose of using illegal drugs 
unless the surgeon general finds such programs help stop either 
drug addiction or the spread of aids 
after the vote helms condemned the compromise saying surgeon 
general c everett koop has already said needleexchange programs 
may be a good idea its just a matter of time before federal 
money is spent on them helms said 
earlier today the senate voted 5937 against a broader helms 
ban the second time in two days it had rejected similar versions 
of his amendment lawmakers said both versions could have deprived 
drug addicts with aids of intravenous feeding experimental drugs 
and other treatment 
the kennedyhatch bill authorizes 665 million for state and 
federal information and education campaigns home health care for 
aids patients new hiring at the national institutes of health and 
special projects targeted to drug abusers and minorities it also 
authorizes openended research spending expected to bring the 
total to about 1 billion 
aids testing confidentiality and discrimination are addressed 
in a separate bill that has not reached the house or senate floor 
but they were among the issues senators planned to raise with their 
amendments 
one of the most controversial proposals was a helms attempt to 
renew a ban on federal money for education or information materials 
that promote encourage or condone homosexual activities a similar 
helms provision adopted last year on a 942 vote is due to expire 
sept 30 
denouncing an educational aids videotape aimed at gay men helms 
said wednesday i will strongly oppose the use of taxpayers 
money to advocate or condone sexual activity outside of monogamous 
marriage 
at least one senator who supported the helms amendment last year 
said he was leading a crusade against it this year 
sen alan cranston dcalif said he is convinced the amendment 
is having fatal consequences because aids service organizations 
have not received new money since last november he said the 
federal centers for disease control had asked them not to apply for 
funds until the situation is clarified 
we must oppose every attempt to censor vital lifesaving 
information about aids he said 
the senate agreed by voice vote wednesday to another helms 
amendment to overturn the district of columbias ban on aids 
testing for insurance applicants 
helms said diabetics and many other groups of people are unable 
to get health insurance because of their conditions his amendment 
prevailed on a quick voice vote despite arguments by others that 
congress should not override a law passed by the dc city council 
the vote against the original helms cleanneedle amendment was 
6618 
several senators said the amendment was written so broadly it 
would have denied hospices hospitals nursing homes and 
researchers the use of hypodermics and syringes and they said the 
federal government shouldnt tie the hands of states cities and 
researchers trying to curb the spread of the fatal disease among 
intravenous drug users

the hijackers of a kuwaiti airliner left 
algeria without getting what they wanted and no concessions were 
made to obtain the hostages release the algerian ambassador said 
today 
ambassador mohammed sahnoun also said that while his government 
would have liked to apprehend the hijackers such a move would have 
damaged its credibility as a mediator in international crises such 
as attempts to obtain the release of american hostages in lebanon 
the united states has been pressing algeria for information on 
the deal it worked out last week for the release of 31 hostages 
held by moslem extremists in algiers 
us officials said they do not have clear indications that the 
proiranian hijackers left algeria despite reports that they were 
flown last wednesday from algiers to syria and then made their way 
to lebanon 
sahnoun addressing reporters at the national press club said 
the hijackers went back without achieving anything 
he declined to divulge details saying that would be breaking 
algerias word to the hijackers and would damage its role as a 
mediator who has negotiated dozens of disputes over the past 25 
years 
we have a skill that we put at the disposal of the 
international community he said this is not always 
understood he added in apparent reference to demands by the 
united states and other countries that algeria help capture the 
hijackers and bring them to trial 
we delivered what we could deliver namely the hostage 
release he said 
there was a price to pay we are not entirely satisfied that 
the men went free sahnoun said but this was a minimum price 
compared with what they wanted 
the hijackers did not get what they wanted the release of 17 
suspected terrorists imprisoned in kuwait he added 
there have been reports that kuwait cancelled the death sentence 
against three of the 17 but sahnoun insisted that no concessions 
were made 
the americans basically understood the algerian position he 
said 
algeria has been asked to help in efforts to obtain the release 
of some 20 hostages among them eight americans believed held by 
proiranian groups in lebanon he said 
algeria had in the past supplied information it obtained about 
the hostages to their families sahnoun said

a court ruling may allow performers who sold 
the rights to their work in films to make more money once those 
movies are released on videotape 
the us 9th circuit court of appeals held wednesday that a 
license giving a movie studio the right to show a film on 
television does not necessarily apply to videotape sales 
the court ruled in a case brought against paramount pictures 
corp it involved the rights to the song merrygoround 
written by larry fisher and used in the 1969 film medium cool 
paramount officials declined to discuss the decision but 
industry attorneys said it may result in the renegotiation of tens 
of thousands of licenses and contracts 
mainly affected will be movies made in the 1950s and 60s after 
television was invented but before the videocassette recorder 
became popular enough for video rights to be included in contracts 
attorneys said 
this will cause music publishers to reexamine their contracts 
from the 1950s and beyond to see if they granted rights to 
television only said attorney evan s cohen who successfully 
argued the case 
there are probably a lot of contracts around just gathering 
dust said david carson an entertainment law specialist many 
people may want to dust them off now 
in the paramount case a licensing agreement allowed the 
filmmaker to use the song in television and theater showings of 
medium cool paramount argued that videocassette display is 
the equivalent of exhibition by means of television said 
judge proctor hug jr 
but hug wrote for the court we cannot agree 
though videocassettes may be displayed by using a television 
monitor it does not follow that for copyright purposes 
videocassettes constitute exhibition by television 
a similar distinction caused several jackson browne songs to be 
pulled from the 1982 film fast times at ridgemont high when it 
went into videotape production the studio had not included 
videotapes in the original agreement and was unable to negotiate 
rights with browne later said the singers attorney peter paterno 
how much money is at stake over such renegotiations is unclear

state security agents arrested at 
least eight opposition leaders and sought others today hours before 
a planned mass demonstration against the rule of gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
the arrest of all leaders of the national civic crusade was 
ordered wednesday night by panamas attorney general under a law 
prohibiting tumultuous meetings aimed at intimidating or 
threatening others 
the us southern command told american servicemen and their 
dependents in panama to reduce the amount of time they spend in 
public areas citing the probability of demonstrations against 
noriega 
the command also ordered defense department schools on the 
pacific end of the panama canal to close at noon edt said capt 
nancy laluntas a pentagon spokeswoman 
the attorney general carlos a villalaz said the order applied 
to the 35 directors of the group plus an unspecified number of 
neighborhood leaders of the planned demonstration 
many crusade leaders have been in hiding since their 
headquarters in a panama city hotel was raided following a mass 
demonstration on march 28 more than 40 people were arrested in 
that sweep including eight foreign journalists 
all but one of those arrested last month were released within a 
few days the exception was carlos gonzalez de la lastra a top 
leader of the group who was held for 10 days and then fled into 
exile in venezuela 
the national civic crusade is a coalition of about 200 
professional labor business civic political and other groups 
that has been seeking noriegas ouster since june it is supported 
by the united states where noriega is under indictment on drug 
trafficking charges 
noriega is leader of the nations defense forces and controls 
the government the united states has imposed sweeping economic 
sanctions on panama in an effort to force noriegas ouster the 
sanctions have created a severe cash shortage in panama 
the national civic crusade announced plans last week for a 
demonstration this afternoon along more than 30 blocks of the 
capitals main commercial avenue largely through handbills and 
word of mouth it had been urging a massive turnout 
the group has been unable to mount a largescale demonstration 
since last months rally and march by an estimated 10000 
supporters was smashed by riot police and soldiers using water 
cannons tear gas shotguns and rubber truncheons 
police arrested a number of opposition leaders a few days before 
another planned mass demonstration last oct 22 none were held for 
more than four days but the demonstration collapsed for lack of 
leadership and apparent fear of arrest by supporters 
the attorney general said raids on several offices and homes by 
state security agents earlier this week had turned up what he 
called crusade plans for urban violence aimed at destabilizing 
the country 
among offices raided were those of the panama industrial 
association the panamanian odontological association and the 
national medical commission all three organizations complained 
that the raids were conducted without proper search warrants 
among those arrested was enrique marquez presidentelect of the 
panama canal society of professional engineers the society isued a 
statement calling his detention one more proof of the constant 
violation of human rights by the defense forces of the republic of 
panama

their steps may be a bit slower their 
eyes dimmer but oh how they remember the night 50 years ago when 
residents danced away the last hours of four towns that died to 
provide drinking water for boston 
more than 100 former residents the oldest in her 90s and 300 
descendants of the swift river valley towns gathered wednesday for 
the 50th anniversary of the last dance at enfield town hall 
and they remembered the night of april 27 1938 when the towns 
of dana prescott enfield and greenwich flickered out of existence 
at midnight to create the quabbin reservoir 
the reservoir took 20 years to build and cost 53 million and 
the lives of more than 20 workers today it provides drinking 
water for 25 million people half of the states population 
its not the nations largest reservoir though none larger has 
been built strictly to provide drinking water but for 2500 
people the land under the water had been home the ball marked the 
end of that life 
my mother was crying the older people were heartbroken 
recalled lucille webster thresher dancing with harrison her 
husband of 50 years they were the last couple married in enfield 
they remember the ball 
there was such a crowd at town hall that night we young people 
couldnt get in she said we climbed the fire escape and 
looked in the windows 
a hush fell over the crowd in the ballroom at the university of 
massachusetts as the bell that had once hung in the dana town hall 
struck midnight 
robert garvey the high sheriff of hampshire county dressed in 
top hat and tails led the former residents in singing auld lang 
syne just as the dancers had in 1938 
men who had been young then bowed their heads tears glistened 
in many eyes as the sound of taps echoed across the stilled 
ballroom 
our home was in the center of town it now lies under the 
deepest part of the reservoir said joy dickinson bock a south 
hadley elementary school teacher who was in grade school back then 
my parents had six children and they couldnt afford to go to 
the dance but we kids went down to the town hall and watched the 
people arriving she said 
her brother richard dickinson came from indianapolis for the 
event as did three sisters and another brother 
i wouldnt have missed this for the world said trudy ward 
stalbird terry 78 of enfield as 38 former residents who had been 
at the farewell ball led the grand march around the hall 
many of the women wore heirloom pins and other mementos of 
parents and grandparents some wore black as did many of the women 
at the dance 50 years ago 
their reminiscences jotted down on their dance programs were 
read aloud between dance tunes 
my son is 50 now he was one of the last babies born in 
enfield said gladys hanks of somers conn 
she and her husband roy 75 married others when they lived in 
enfield they did not meet again until they both began attending 
the weekly teas held for former residents at the quabbin visitors 
center 
they were married on valentines day in 1987 
we didnt think we ought to waste any time she said

a california condor chick inspired by 
recordings of vulture hisses and grunts was slowly chipping its 
way out of its shell today san diego wild animal park officials 
said 
everything is proceeding fine park spokeswoman martha baker 
said this morning the chick is moving around inside the shell 
and the condor keepers can hear the chick tapping 
what were trying to do is provide a natural stimulus to the 
bird to assist it in hatching spokesman tom hanscom said 
wednesday 
the chick the first ever of the nearly extinct species to be 
conceived in captivity began its threeday struggle to break free 
of its bluegreen egg early wednesday 
a successful hatching would raise the population to 28 all 27 
california condors are in captivity 14 at the wild animal park and 
13 at the los angeles zoo 
baker said park officials still expect the chick to hatch friday 
or saturday if the chick hasnt emerged from its shell by 4 am 
saturday keepers likely will help it out hanscom said 
meanwhile keepers are playing recordings of bird noises and 
gently tapping the egg with a light metal rod every two hours to 
simulate what condor parents would do to encourage the youth he 
said 
the chick has settled into a rhythm of pecking and resting 
punctuated by cheeps and appears to be strong and healthy said 
bill toone curator of birds at the park 
at this point it will continue to push at the pip hole and 
situate itself so that it will attempt to cap the egg hanscom 
said referring to the chicks chipping all the way around the egg 
so it can push the upper third of the shell away from the rest 
the egg is being watched on a remote television monitor but 
keepers are reluctant to help the chick because of the danger that 
blood vessels linked to a surrounding membrane will rupture which 
could cause fatal bleeding 
since 1983 there have been 14 successful condor hatchings at 
the wild animal park and the affiliated san diego zoo involving 
eggs taken from the wild all of those hatchings occurred with 
human help although one of those chicks died of an infection 24 
hours after birth 
the egg was laid march 3 at the parks condorminium after 
its parents engaged in the first captive mating in the history of a 
15year program aimed at saving north americas largest land bird 
california condors which are scavengers have wing spans of up to 
10 feet 
state and federal wildlife officials overseeing the condor 
program decided to remove the remaining condors in the wild to 
focus efforts on a captive breeding flock the last known 
california condor in the wild was captured in april 1987

the state thats home to the grand canyon 
and the petrified forest will soon acquire another natural wonder 
a spectacular 2mile cavern kept secret for years for fear it 
would be vandalized 
the legislature and gov rose mofford on wednesday rushed to 
enact legislation allowing the state to acquire the cavern 
discovered 14 years ago near benson in southeast arizona 
mrs mofford perched a spelunkers helmet atop her beehive 
hairdo as she signed the bill passed by lawmakers only an hour 
earlier 
the caves existence had been a closely held secret since it was 
discovered in 1974 because its owners feared vandals would destroy 
its beauty 
it is a major natural resource find said state park board 
director kenneth travous who has twice squeezed through the tiny 
opening to view the cavern 
its fabulous travous said walt disney couldnt have 
done any better for the state of arizona your imagination goes 
crazy when you get down there 
the cavern is about 13000 feet long with rooms the size of 
football fields and ceilings from 50 to 100 feet high thousands of 
stillgrowing stalagmites and stalactites ranging from a few inches 
to 60 feet are found throughout its also home to a colony of 700 
bats 
in about three years travous says about 100000 to 150000 
people a year will get to travel by elevator to see the cave 
officials plan to use state park revenues to acquire the site for 
16 million within a year from the arizona nature conservancy 
which soon will buy the site from the family of the late james 
kartchner a cochise county rancher and educator 
i imagine i walked over this thing i dont know how many times 
hunting deer but never realized the cavern was underneath said 
rep gus arzberger whose district includes the cave 
the state on friday sent park rangers to guard the site on an 
emergency basis as word of the caverns existence began to leak 
out the bill was quickly enacted wednesday to allow the state to 
continue to oversee the land 
the caverns codiscoverer randy tufts 39 said that finding 
it along with gary tenen 37 was a once in a lifetime discovery 
for the caver 
people go out and hunt and hunt and hunt for caves 99 times 
out of 100 you never find anything tufts said 
tufts said he and tenen wanted the cavern turned into a park 
because that would be the best way to protect it from vandals 
because it is near a major highway tufts said it was inevitable 
that other people would find it 
tufts said he had been into the cavern hundreds of times 
its very colorful the variety of formations is very 
wide and it still is an actively changing cave tufts said 
four of kartchners 12 children attended wednesdays legislative 
session and billsigning dean kartchner a physician said family 
members were aware of the cave but not its splendor 
we climbed in it there were rattlesnakes and we climbed back 
out with no idea of the magnificence of the structure 
kartchner said

the soviet union today accused the united states 
of violating the afghan accords by sending new arms to rebels 
fighting to topple the communist government in afghanistan 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim p perfiliev said the 
united states was violating its obligations as a guarantor of the 
geneva agreement on a soviet troop withdrawal from afghanistan 
at a news briefing perfiliev said that if news reports saying 
the united states was resupplying afghan guerrillas are true 
washington would be violating its pledge not to interfere in 
afghanistans internal affairs 
a us official told the associated press in islamabad 
pakistan on wednesday that washington was airlifting arms to the 
guerrillas to replace weapons destroyed when a pakistani ammunition 
depot exploded april 10 
perfiliev also declined comment on a pravda article that raised 
the question of whether the soviet union would accept prosoviet 
afghan refugees in the event of a rebel takeover he said he had 
not seen the article 
the communist party daily newspaper today published a report on 
afghanistan that was highly unusual in depicting the concerns of 
afghan party and military officials about the implications of the 
soviet troop withdrawal scheduled to begin may 15 
the soviets have an estimated 115000 soldiers in afghanistan 
more typical reports in the staterun media have said the april 
14 geneva agreement which commits the soviets to a pullout 
increases opportunities for a peaceful settlement in afghanistans 
10yearold civil war 
but many western observers doubt the marxist government of 
president najib which was unable to defeat a widespread insurgency 
with soviet aid will be able to withstand guerrilla attacks once 
the soviets are gone 
in questions and replies you could sense the deep alarm 
evinced by those people who have actively fought the 
counterrevolution what will become of them when we leave wrote 
col p studenikin a pravda special correspondent 
there have been reports that the soviet union has issued cards 
to top members of najibs peoples democratic party and government 
to allow them to board sovietbound planes if the guerrillas gain 
the upper hand those reports have never been confirmed 
the afghan civil war has forced more than 5 million people to 
flee chiefly to neighboring pakistan and iran few of them if 
any back the najib government 
studenikin wrote that some people have asked whether the soviets 
have agreed to take 500000 afghan refuguees 
the article titled the road home gave clear indications of 
the joy and relief felt by soviets as their countrys military 
involvement in afghanistan which began in december 1979 is about 
to end according to western estimates as many as 10000 soviet 
soldiers have been killed 
pravda said it had received thousands of letters from its 
readers about the withdrawal which soviet officials have said 
privately should be concluded by the end of the year 
studenikin wrote i feel like telling all of them who will 
soon be taking this road home the whole country with 
impatience awaits your return

a federal judge today barred the national 
girl scouts organization from withdrawing the charter of an 
innercity council that serves more than 2000 girls 
parents and troop leaders of the hudson county council oppose 
the plans of the national organization to transfer jurisdiction of 
their scouts who are mostly members of minority groups to mainly 
white suburban councils 
us district judge harold a ackerman ordered the national 
organization to show why the hudson county council should not 
receive a new sixyear charter 
the parents said they found it particularly galling that the 
national group would try to end their charter when pictures of 
hudson girl scouts and troop leaders have appeared on a nationally 
distributed poster extolling the girl scouts as an integrated 
organization 
the national organization has said the charter should be 
withheld because of declining membership and financial difficulties 
the girls would be better served by councils with strong 
management systems and better resources said national 
spokeswoman bonnie mcewan in new york she refused to comment 
further on the hudson county case 
however ms mcewan said she did not know of any other time the 
girl scouts had sought to remove or withhold a charter from one of 
the nations 335 local councils which include nearly 3 million 
adult and scout members 
councils are responsible for organizing troops recruiting 
leaders and providing services for the troops ms mcewan said 
the hudson county parents argued that they can best provide 
wellintegrated and familylike scouting groups in the innercity 
setting of their hudson river waterfront communities 
pictures of the local scouts and troop leaders also have 
appeared on girl scout cookie boxes and a 75th anniversary 
commemorative stamp the council said 
they liked all those ethnic backgrounds said maria deblois 
a girl scout mother and troop leader i dont understand why 
they want to split that up 
mrs deblois nine other mothers and the council sued girl 
scouts usa in federal court here the suit also accuses the 
national organization of seeking to distribute proceeds from the 
635000 sale of a hudson council campground

george bush the republican presidential nominee in all but 
name expressed eagerness to debate michael dukakis and challenged 
the democratic frontrunner to fire away dukakis did just that 
and so did jesse jackson who criticized both men today in ohio 
jackson falling further behind dukakis every week in the 
democratic race received cheers at a steubenville rally with a 
speech focusing on fighting drugs and saving jobs 
i dont want to manage reaganomics as dukakis does or keep 
reaganomics as bush does jackson said i want to reverse 
reaganomics and reinvest in america 
this is a tight race it is closer now than ever before 
jackson said a day earlier as he campaigned in ohio where 159 
delegates are at stake in tuesdays contest he had a series of 
stops set around the state today 
indiana and the district of columbia also vote tuesday offering 
79 and 16 democratic delegates respectively 
 
 
bush now has more than enough delegates to assure him the gop 
nomination his boss president reagan is holding off on a formal 
endorsement but the white house indicated that one is near 
republican party and administration sources said reagan planned 
to play a lowkey role at the gops convention in august to avoid 
upstaging bush the sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the president would address the convention on opening night 
monday aug 15 and then leave the next morning for california 
on the democratic side dukakis remained reluctant to describe 
himself as the likely nominee despite a string of wins and a 
widening delegate lead any reference to a fall faceoff with bush 
is cautiously qualified with an if 
but dukakis was sounding increasingly relaxed and confident he 
sent the boston bruins hockey team a telegram wednesday following a 
win over the montreal canadiens that advanced them to the 
semifinals in the stanley cup series 
having enjoyed a few wins myself lately i can well imagine 
how you feel the governor wrote maybe your winning formula 
will rub off on me as i enter some playoffs of my own 
the massachusetts governor said there was no question that 
if nominated he would debate the republican nominee 
ive already agreed to he said id be delighted 
bush said he too was ready i will have debates and i look 
forward to it he told cnn 
the vice president has criticized dukakis for lacking foreign 
policy experience the massachusetts governor retaliated wednesday 
by questioning bushs role in one of the most misguided 
adventures in the history of american foreign policy the 
irancontra affair 
i cant imagine what they in the white house were thinking 
of when they proceeded to do business with a terrorist nation 
dukakis said in springfield mass 
where foreign policy is concerned he added later its your 
values its the quality of the people you pick thats what 
makes for strong international leadership 
bush in washington said he expected dukakis to try to make the 
irancontra affair a campaign issue let him fire away he said 
dukakis in new jersey for a fundraiser on wednesday night 
also attacked the reagan administration record on environmental 
issues saying its about time we had an administration that did 
something about the environment 
and questioning whether bush backed reagans threat to veto a 
trade measure that won congressional approval on wednesday dukakis 
said i think the vice president would be well advised to stop 
criticizing others for a while and address some fundamental issues 
facing this country 
reagan objects to a provision of the bill that would provide 
workers with 60 days notice before a plant shuts down 
massachusetts has a plantclosing law but it does not require 
companies to notify the state of impending shutdowns and critics 
say the measure lacks teeth 
in other developments 
the federal election commission earmarked 2 million in 
matching funds to current and former presidential candidates on 
wednesday the candidate who has received the most matching funds 
overall 86 million is pat robertson who technically remains 
a republican candidate although bush has the delegates needed to 
nominate 
robertson has congratulated bush on wrapping up the nomination 
and pledged to help elect a republican 
a commission formed by the major political parties said four 
cities and dates have been tentatively chosen for presidential 
debates this fall they are annapolis md sept 14 
winstonsalem nc sept 25 omaha neb oct 11 and pittsburgh 
oct 27 however the commission said the candidates have not yet 
made commitments

an unemployed handyman convicted of 
strangling seven women while having sex then leaving their bodies 
to rot in and near his apartment told a judge today he did not 
want a jury to decide whether he should get the death penalty 
i want you harrison marty graham said when common pleas 
court judge robert latrone told him a jury could be called in to 
set the sentence 
graham 29 was convicted wednesday of murder and abuse of 
corpse charges he had waived a jury trial but under pennsylvania 
law retained the right to have a jury for the sentencing portion of 
the case 
graham lured the women to his apartment with the promise of 
drugs then strangled them during sex according to his own 
confession to police 
he deserves everything he gets said camilia deshazor 
parker the mother of one of grahams victims robin deshazor i 
still hate him 
leroy artison the father of another victim sandra garvin 
said im just numb the way i feel is that theres nothing that 
can be done for my daughter she is gone 
grahams mother lillian seated in the first row of the city 
hall courtroom sat quietly and refused to comment later graham 
did not testify during the trial which started march 7 
latrone who heard the case without a jury deliberated for six 
days before rendering his verdict and assistant district attorney 
roger king said afterwards that the state would actively seek the 
death penalty 
in his confession admitted into evidence graham said the bodies 
began piling up in his bedroom and he began having problems with 
maggots he also said birds eating body parts on his roof made 
sleeping during the day difficult 
the bodies were found last aug 9 and 10 after graham was 
evicted from his apartment because of a putrid stench he lived in 
a druginfested north philadelphia neighborhood where he was known 
as a handyman 
police pried open a nailed door to find six rotting bodies in 
grahams bedroom leg and foot bones on the roof of his apartment 
house and a torso in the basement of a neighboring house 
graham surrendered to police aug 16 at his mothers urging 
defense attorney joel s moldovsky tried unsuccessfully to have 
the statement suppressed arguing the confession was made in 
violation of grahams constitutional rights and that graham was 
beaten by police during 17 hours of interrogation 
moldovsky also asked latrone to find graham innocent by reason 
of insanity characterizing the defendant as both psychotic and 
mentally retarded

the fbi has disbanded a task force investigating 
the case of a teenager who was mysteriously assaulted because 
agents have found no evidence the teenager civil rights were 
violated according to a report published today 
meanwhile tawana brawleys mother and a spokesman for the 
family insist miss brawley will tell her story of the 
stillunexplained assault to the public not to a state grand jury 
unless a federal grand jury probe is launched 
glenda brawley the victims mother said wednesday the family 
would go to jail rather than force miss brawley to honor a request 
to testify contained in a letter from the grand jury that mrs 
brawley called dumb 
the 16yearold teenager will ignore the monday deadline set in 
the letter and will tell her story to the public at the end of this 
week if no federal investigation is launched the rev al sharpton 
said wednesday 
family members have described the incident as a sexual and 
racial assault on the teenager last fall 
but three of the four agents investigating the case for 
violations of federal law have been reassigned since last week 
leaving behind one agent to compile a report according to todays 
middletown times heraldrecord 
sources close to the investigation say the fbi report wont be 
complete for another month 
sharpton said the grand jury had written to miss brawley and her 
mother glenda asking the youngster to come forward and warning 
that the panel could take action to try to force her to tell her 
story if she refuses to cooperate 
its dumb glenda brawley said of the grand jurys appeal 
weve been through all this before what makes them think were 
going to all of a sudden bring tawana down there and talk to them 
we think the federal government would move in much more 
impartially than mr abrams has shown us at this point said 
sharpton referring to state attorney general robert abrams who is 
the special prosecutor for the brawley case 
the fbi has had an agent assigned to the case since the then 
15yearold black girl was found nov 28 outside her familys 
former apartment in wappingers falls and the other three agents 
were added in february 
after a fourday disappearance the teenager was found huddled 
in a trash bag with racial slurs scrawled on her torso and feces 
smeared on her body she told family members she was a victim of a 
sexual and racial assault involving six white men one of whom 
flashed a policelike badge

federal prosecutors are increasingly concerned 
about vacancies at the top of the justice department which attorney 
general edwin meese iii has been unable to fill for nearly a month 
us attorneys held a lengthy discussion about the vacancy in 
the departments no 2 post concluding in an informal vote that 
they want one of their colleagues rather than someone from outside 
the department to fill the position said three department 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the consensus at tuesdays meeting at the justice department was 
that robert ulrich the us attorney in kansas city should be 
chosen by meese to become deputy attorney general said the sources 
ulrich is chairman of the us attorneys advisory committee 
but was not in the room at the time of the discussion by the 
panels 15 or so members said the sources 
the sense at the meeting was that the us attorneys wanted 
ulrich said one source they want someone who knows and 
understands us attorneys and who can hit the ground running 
the sources said the us attorneys had not presented their 
views to meese who was in california on wednesday and that it was 
unclear whether they would do so 
neither ed meese nor anyone else has offered me the position 
of deputy attorney general ulrich told the kansas city times 
from his home wednesday night he declined further comment 
the post of deputy attorney general became vacant last friday 
with the departure of arnold burns who resigned march 29 telling 
colleagues meeses refusal to resign in the face of a nearly 
yearlong criminal investigation was damaging justice department 
operations criminal division chief william weld resigned with 
burns for similar reasons 
the concerns by us attorneys about the toplevel justice 
department vacancies come amid a report that a group of president 
reagans advisers and friends have joined forces to oust meese 
reagan reacted heatedly when reporters queried him about the 
wall street journal report which said nancy reagan supported the 
effort 
i thought the story was totally inaccurate said reagan who 
when asked what might prompt him to get rid of meese said well 
if he had a complete change of character 
the journal said white house officials sounded out former 
defense secretary caspar w weinberger as a possible successor to 
meese but that weinberger rejected the proposal 
in an interview with cnn weinberger said i did not have any 
suggestion that mr meese should leave and under no circumstances 
whatever would i even take the office if it should be offered 
its never been offered 
meanwhile the los angeles times reported today that aides to 
vice president george bush and white house chief of staff howard 
baker were privately involved in efforts to force meese from office 
the newspaper did not identify the aides but said they have 
spread the word among republican supporters in congress that meese 
by remaining in office is weakening the reagan presidency and 
could jeopardize bushs election campaign to succeed reagan 
at the justice department spokesman patrick korten said meese 
had flown to california to attend a funeral on wednesday and had a 
full work schedule thursday 
the attorney general not only has a full schedule for the rest 
of the week but for the next couple of months he is preparing for 
events in july and august there is no question in my mind that he 
intends to fulfill his obligations as attorney general for the 
foreseeable future korten said 
meese has made two unsuccessful bids to fill burns post 
st louis attorney john shepherd withdrew from consideration 
amid allegations by a former bookkeeper at his law firm that the 
two had an affair and reports about his membership in allwhite 
and allmale clubs shepherd denied the bookkeepers allegations 
but said the ensuing strain on his family had become intolerable 
earlier former federal appeals court judge arlin adams rejected 
meeses overtures to become deputy attorney general saying he had 
a heavy caseload at his philadelphia law firm 
the office of deputy attorney general is vital to the effective 
functioning of the 93 us attorneys offices the deputy makes key 
budget decisions that affect the offices and settles disputes 
between them 
the advisory committee is an administrative group designed to 
keep the attorney general in touch with activities in the various 
us attorneys offices around the country

a painting attributed to impressionist 
auguste renoir was sold privately for 17 million despite doubts 
as to its authenticity 
experts say the painting of a naked woman reclining on a green 
cushion was too erotic to be a real renoir the 19th century master 
is best known for idealizing the female form which he portrayed in 
cozy indoor settings as well as in the sunwashed outdoors 
the sale originally was to be handled by claude dassonval 
director of the septentrion gallery in the northern french town of 
marcqenbaroeul dassonval said he withdrew his services after the 
owner refused to have it formally examined by recognized experts 
and she the nude was in too provocative a pose to have been 
the work of renoir he said 
he declined to provide the names of either the seller or the 
buyer 
dassonval said experts first thought the work was renoirs 
nude on a green cushion last sold in 1933 the painting has 
been in a private collection since then 
they changed their minds after comparing photographs published 
in the auction catalogue with the painting in roubaix

a family reunion led a deputy us marshal 
to renew an investigation into four 1980 killings that has resulted 
in the arrests of three people one of them his own brother 
the break in the investigation into the slayings of four elderly 
people began at a 1986 reunion when olbert hiett took a sawedoff 
shotgun from his brother charles hiett because it was an illegal 
weapon 
district attorney robert field who recounted the chain of 
events said hietts nephew jerry hiett was arrested for 
allegedly starting a fire later that year in talladega national 
forest and a 38caliber pistol was recovered 
olbert hiett then realized that the two guns matched the 
descriptions of guns used in four slayings at a rural house on jan 
3 1980 the victims were james columbus roberts 79 mack roberts 
73 mae bell roberts 77 and floy roberts 63 and two of them 
were bedridden when shot to death 
ballistics tests confirmed olbert hietts suspicions and 
charles and jerry hiett and anthony bell were arrested this week 
charles hiett 51 was arrested on one count of hindering 
prosecution and one count of possession of a sawedoff shotgun 
cleburne county sheriff jack norton said jerry hiett 39 was 
charged with five counts of perjury bell 29 was arrested 
wednesday on charges of firstdegree perjury 
norton refused to comment on the timing of the arrests or 
whether the three were suspects in the killings im just going 
to say they are people whom the grand jury saw fit to indict on 
those charges norton said 
the arrests came on indictments returned tuesday by a county 
grand jury the three men were being held in county jail in lieu of 
100000 bond each 
field said the grand jury will reconvene may 31 and that more 
indictments might be returned 
authorities said that olbert hietts seizure of the shotgun 
provided the first major break in their investigation 
without him there would be no case us marshal thomas 
green of huntsville said its an unusual story my deputy has 
been involved in this indirectly since 1983 and directly involved 
since 1986 
olbert hietts niece teresa loveless said she is not angry at 
him although he has worked to put her father charles hiett in 
jail 
this isnt a vengeance thing she said they didnt have 
any falling out or anything like that my uncle is a lawman and he 
is just doing his job my father is just telling the truth thats 
all there is to it 
police believe the motive in the killing was 1500 in cash kept 
in a trunk the trunk was stolen and recovered two years later in 
woods three miles from the roberts home

more than 1700 people likely will die in 
the next seven years from illnesses caused by the bhopal gas leak 
the 1984 disaster that already has killed nearly 3000 people a 
report said thursday 
the predictions were contained in a 285 million plan by the 
madhya pradesh state government for providing relief to both future 
and past bhopal victims and their families 
the sevenyear plan is based on a projected annual death rate of 
250 people among those targeted for financial help are 509 women 
widowed by the tragedy and 27 orphans the state report said 
the worlds worst industrial disaster already has killed at 
least 2998 people the report said a figure higher than the 
previously reported death toll of 2800 
it said the deaths were conclusively attributed to the 
effects of the toxic methylisocyanate gas that was released on 
dec 3 1984 from a plant owned by a pesticide subsidiary of the 
union carbide corp based in danbury conn 
the central indian states study said another 816 deaths were 
being investigated for links to the gas leak 
the indian government has said in the past that it expected the 
death toll to rise but thursdays report was the first time it has 
detailed the anticipated scope of the casualties 
it is not possible to assess the longterm damage said the 
report released by the states chief minister arjun singh in the 
state assembly 
india already has spent 46 million to assist disaster victims 
many victims develop respiratory problems that progress to the 
point where they cause death others became more prone to other 
diseases whose symptoms include fever vomiting and diarrhea 
the government said it also is conducting surveys to determine 
if the children of women exposed to the gas have a higher incidence 
of birth defects 
the report calls for the creation of a special group to study 
the longrange effects of the gas 
the indian government is suing carbide for 3 billion in 
damages the civil suit is still being heard in bhopal the state 
capital 
the government also has begun a criminal case against the 
company several of its subsidiaries and current and former company 
officers 
the madhya pradesh high court recently upheld an order by the 
bhopal civil judge mw deo that union carbide pay 192 million 
in interim relief to the gas victims 
robert d kennedy chairman of union carbide said wednesday the 
company has not yet decided whether to appeal the high court ruling 
india contends that the gas leak was caused by negligence the 
company has said it resulted from sabotage by a disgruntled 
employee 
efforts to reach an outofcourt settlement in the case failed 
in november although both sides agreed to continue talking 
according to sources close to the talks last year union carbide 
offered slightly more than 500 million to settle the case 
about 540000 people have filed claims for damages and the 
indian government is sorting through them to determine which are 
valid 
the relief plan released thursday calls for spending 110 
million on medical relief 17 million for economic 
rehabilitation 522 million for social work and 657 million 
for environmental improvements 
additional money would go to a disaster management institute and 
the longterm medical study 
the plan also sets aside 192000 per year to be distributed as 
financial aid to victims families the government pays a lump sum 
of 770 for each death

secret documents seized from lt col oliver 
l norths office could expose people in very difficult 
situations to torture and death in the middle east if publicly 
disclosed the prosecutor in the irancontra case said today 
at a hearing on providing classified documents to the defense 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh told us district judge 
gerhard a gesell that some of the documents contain information so 
sensitive that a person known to have seen it would be in endanger 
by travel to the middle east 
there were documents found in col norths safe he shouldnt 
have had under government security regulations walsh said 
the material included compilations of highly sensitive 
information that is usually scattered in bits and pieces throughout 
other documents 
why he had them i dont know walsh said 
gesell has ruled that the defense is entitled to see 300000 
pages of classified material collected by walsh so that lawyers for 
north and three codefendants can determine if any of the documents 
would help their case 
between 5 and 10 percent of the material is extremely sensitive 
and government security experts are concerned about releasing it 
for inspection by at least one of norths codefendants 
businessman albert hakim walsh said 
as advocates we have no interest in this whatever walsh 
said indicating a rift with the reagan administration over 
disclosure 
but government security experts are concerned about giving full 
access to hakim a security consultant who deals with governments 
in the middle east and asia he said 
i dont see why he would like to have in his possession that 
type of information when he is traveling in the middle east 
walsh said hes put in jeopardy by that kind of information 
the restriction sought by government security officials would 
also apply at least temporarily to retired air force maj gen 
richard v secord another defendant charged in the case according 
to court papers lawyers for hakim and secord however could see 
the material 
walsh said the government had no objection to north and his 
former boss onetime national security adviser john m poindexter 
examining all the documents being placed in a secure facility for 
defense lawyers to work with the material 
colonel north doesnt pose the problem because most of these 
documents hes seen anyhow walsh said 
north and his three codefendants are charged with conspiring to 
illegally divert profits from the usiran arms sales to the 
nicaraguan rebels 
gesell said resolving the issue might involve a month of secret 
hearings 
meanwhile presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters today that the white house is cooperating in every 
way and said well find a way to make everything available that 
we can as long as it is approved by this screening procedure 
we intend to work with the court in the same way that we have 
in the past fitzwater said and i would just add that the 
intelligence agencies interagency committee that reviews the 
security classifications has received 70000 pages of documents 
from the independent counsel fortythousand pages have been 
cleared for production to the defense without restriction 
the spokesman said were operating very rapidly and we are 
concerned about methods and sources being divulged to witnesses who 
are not cleared to know those things but this new procedure will 
allow the courts and the independent counsel to make decisions on 
any documents that are in dispute 
according to court papers filed this week by hakims lawyers 
the sensitive information the government seeks to protect includes 
documents that would expose hostages in the middle east to death if 
released 
disclosure would also compromise us intelligence gathering 
military planning and sensitive foreign policy initiatives 
according to a letter walshs office sent to the defense earlier 
this week 
on wednesday gesell accused the reagan administration of 
intentionally withholding secret documents and threatened to 
dismiss the charges if the material is not made available to the 
defense 
walsh so far as i know is making every effort to produce the 
documents gesell said 
the responsibility lies with the attorney general and the 
white house i want to find out promptly what is taking place and 
what is going to take place 
justice department spokesman patrick korten denied there was any 
deliberate footdragging in preparing the documents for defense 
review 
there is certainly no attempt being made to impede the process 
in any way korten said were talking about a large volume of 
material here that needs careful examination

jerry lucas played on the us olympic 
basketball team and was elected to the nba hall of fame but he 
says hes having more fun pursuing his lifelong dream teaching 
children how to remember 
lucas in omaha wednesday on a promotional tour has been in the 
memorytraining business since he wrote his first book on the 
subject in 1974 
he teaches memory in much the same way children learn things 
before they go to school its a matter of creating mental images 
rather than the simple repetition of intangible words he said 
you see something you identify it and you have a picture in 
your mind once you have a picture its stored in your mind you 
dont lose it lucas said there was nothing i found that could 
not be made tangible even differential calculus and other 
formulas 
lucas said he hopes memory training eventually will 
revolutionize teaching in the united states he said he is working 
with the governors of alabama and north carolina to see about the 
chances of implementing some of his methods in the classroom

monitoring a us test 
the two sides are scheduled to monitor each others tests

alcohol and history apparently dont mix 
in plymouth 
bowing to outcries from local restaurateurs and a descendant of 
pilgrims town officials have rejected a request to serve liquor at 
the plimoth plantation historical site 
i can hardly see how a pina colada goes with a 17thcentury 
dinner my forefathers would have jumped over in their graves 
said karen howland a descendant of pilgrims before selectmen 
tuesday unanimously turned down the bid to serve alcohol at the 
200seat restaurant opened in october 
several restaurant owners told the board that approval of the 
liquor license request would draw away patrons and clash with the 
historical atmosphere of plimoth plantation a recreation of the 
pilgrims early 17thcentury settlement 
they come in here under the guise of being a historical and 
educational enterprise and they want to have liquor and compete 
with us said george white whose wife owns the 1620 restaurant 
in plymouth 
but plimoth plantation director david case said a liquor license 
would help attract conventions and large functions at a time when 
government aid for museums is dwindling 
this is one of the few resources we have to pay the freight 
said case 
richard ehrlich the plantations assistant director said the 
restaurant will continue to operate without a liquor license but 
may later apply for a permit to serve beer and wine

lt gov bob jordan is favored to defeat 
four opponents including an exku klux klansman in tuesdays 
democratic gubernatorial primary but faces a tough battle to unseat 
popular republican gov jim martin this fall 
martin hoping to become the first republican governor of north 
carolina this century to serve consecutive terms is unopposed for 
the gop nomination 
turnout likely will be lower than normal because of the absence 
of a closely contested gubernatorial primary and because north 
carolina had a separate presidential primary march 8 as part of 
super tuesday observers say 
the candidates have campaigned vigorously but the public seems 
to have paid little attention in several polls more than 50 
percent of those surveyed did not know enough about the contenders 
for lieutenant governor to choose a favorite 
the biggest draw tuesday could be the race for lieutenant 
governor with jordan forgoing a reelection bid to challenge 
martin five democrats and three republicans are running for the 
states secondranking office 
jordans four opponents include billy martin a servicestation 
employee not related to the governor bruce friedman an 
antinuclear activist from sylva carroll w crawford of mount 
ulla who said he quit the klan in 1987 but remains sympathetic to 
some of its causes and james t lloyd of salisbury all are 
political unknowns and none has waged a visible campaign 
jordan has urged his supporters not to be complacent strange 
things can happen when turnout is low he said this is an 
opportunity to test our organization 
but his campaign activities have been geared toward the general 
election 
jordan has put forward major policy initiatives on economic 
development and school dropout prevention including a 
controversial plan to withhold drivers licenses from minors who 
quit school he has attacked martin as a governor who has done 
little of substance and has tried to take credit for democrats 
accomplishments 
north carolina doesnt need a governor who is content to be a 
passenger or a backseat driver jordan said in january after 
driving an 18wheel truck from his family lumberyard in mount 
gilead to raleigh to dramatize his handson management style 
martin a former sixterm congressman and davidson college 
chemistry professor has pointed to glowing economic statistics 
during his term and questioned jordans leadership skills 
in my first three years over 300000 new jobs have come into 
north carolina jobs from poultry to high tech martin said in a 
campaign television commercial aired in march 
newspaper polls since january have shown martin with leads 
ranging from 16 to 30 percentage points jordan has questioned 
those findings and martin says the race will tighten as jordans 
name recognition improves 
jordan committed what observers called a potentially serious 
gaffe in march telling black newspaper executives he agreed with 
them on some issues that he wouldnt discuss publicly because he 
could not win without the white redneck vote in eastern north 
carolina 
martin described the remark as something jimmy the greek might 
say a reference to the former television sports commentator 
fired after making controversial remarks about black athletes 
jordan said he hadnt meant to be derogatory and considered 
himself a redneck

strikes in poland pose a new challenge to 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev just as he seeks to ease 
eastwest tension by declaring that he will withdraw from 
afghanistan and loosen controls in eastern europe 
gorbachev is counting on better relations with the west to give 
him breathing space for badly needed economic reforms in the soviet 
union 
a new polish crisis would pose a dilemma for him 
if gorbachev is perceived in the west as backing violent 
suppression of strikes in poland it could spoil the mood at the 
summit meeting with president reagan in moscow on may 29june 2 
if unrest in poland gets out of hand as it did in 1956 1968 
1970 1976 and 198081 gorbachev may come under renewed pressure 
from kremlin hardliners who oppose his efforts to ease 
international tensions and carry out economic reforms at home 
the last thing that the soviets want particularly as they 
withdraw from afghanistan is the specter of national revolt in 
poland it could cast them as imperial said janusz bugajski an 
expert on poland at the center for international and strategic 
studies in washington 
the polish unrest is not yet as serious as the demonstrations 
that wracked soviet armenia and azerbaijan earlier this year said 
a state department analyst and the situation is not as serious as 
it was in august 1980 when nationwide strikes forced polands 
communist authorities to bargain with the independent solidarity 
trade union 
but the situation is really developing pretty fast said the 
state department analyst who spoke on condition that he not be 
identified 
and the polish government spokesman jerzy urban said he would 
not be surprised if the labor unrest spreads 
the reagan administration has not publicly commented on the 
latest polish unrest although historically it has been an 
explosive issue for reagan he reacted harshly to the military 
crackdown in 1981 imposing economic sanctions 
reagan took the sanctions off after polands communist 
authorities released political prisoners in 1986 and this spring 
the two nations exchanged ambassadors for the first time since 
martial law 
the polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski has been trying to 
carry his own brand of economic reforms including reduced 
subsidies on food and other necessities 
but the reforms were economically painful for a nation which for 
a decade has suffered shortages of meat and other necessities the 
workers responded with wage demands and in some cases where those 
demands were not met with strikes 
solidarity although outlawed since october 1982 still exists 
as a nationwide organization with regional and factory chapters 
lech walesa the solidarity chairman issued a statement 
wednesday urging poles to put pressure on the authorities and 
called for the restoration of his unions legal status 
so far jaruzelski has balked at restoring solidarity or other 
opposition demands 
it was jaruzelski a soviettrained career military officer who 
crushed solidarity in the most recent demonstration of the 
socalled brezhnev doctrine that policy named after the late 
soviet leader leonid i brezhnev held that the soviet union would 
intervene with force if a client state showed signs of abandoning 
socialism 
gorbachev hinted last year that he was backing away from the 
doctrine and issued a statement in yugoslavia on march 18 saying 
that eastern european nations are free to follow any paths to 
socialism 
his statements are viewed as part of a wider kremlin campaign to 
reduce tensions with the west a step which us analysts view as a 
necessary prerequisite to diverting resources from the military to 
the civilian sector 
gorbachev apparently has the upper hand over more conservative 
members of his own politburo led by egor ligachev but unrest in 
poland could tip the balance and imperil the reforms 
in 1956 reforms by kremlin leader nikita khrushchev promoted 
revolts in poland and hungary which in turn led to an unsuccessful 
attempt to depose him in 1957 
kremlin conservatives managed to dump khrushchev seven years 
later and halted his fight against the legacy of josef stalin a 
battle which is at the center of gorbachevs own reform drive 
the poles too are students of history and they can be 
expected to take to the streets in large numbers next week to 
celebrate may 1 the international workers day and may 3 the 
anniversary of polands constitution of 1791 
solidarity and its backers traditionally use those anniversaries 
to stage massive demonstrations of opposition to the communist 
government

cbs citing the writers strike and the 
possibility of a strike by craft workers said today it would 
postpone the opening of its fall television season until at least 
the end of october 
cbs third in the nielsen ratings for the first time in its 
history had planned to begin new fall programming on sept 5 that 
would have given it an earlier start than nbc which took first 
place in the season just completed and secondplace abc 
notice of the postponement was sent to cbs affiliate stations by 
thomas f leahy president of the cbs television network 
gene jankowski president of the cbs broadcast group stated 
today that given the continuing strike by the writers guild of 
america and the uncertainty over the iatseteamsters negotiations 
in the film industry this summer the previously announced sept 5 
start date for the 198889 season is no longer feasible leahy 
said in the statement 
we are looking forward to a new season start date at the end 
of october 1988 further details and an exact start date will be 
forthcoming the statement said 
the writers struck the film and television industry on march 7 
there are no negotiations at this time 
iatse the international alliance of theatrical and stage 
employes represents the various crafts in the film industry from 
stage hands to cameramen to makeup artists 
abc will not announce its fall season start date until it 
reveals its new schedule on may 23 said a network spokesman 
brandon stoddard president of abc entertainment said during a 
news conference on april 18 that he did not know when the season 
would begin 
our schedule is okay so far said nbc spokesman jay 
michelis but it will all depend on how long the strike lasts we 
will announce our fall schedule on may 18 
nbc has an advantage because it will telecast the summer 
olympics from korea from sept 16 to oct 3 it will also telecast 
the world series in late october 
brandon tartikoff president of nbc has said that for all 
intents and purposes nbc would not begin its fall schedule until 
after the world series 
a strike by movie and television actors in 1980 caused a delay 
in the opening of that years television season for all three 
networks

the indiana supreme court ruled thursday 
that secretary of state evan bayh meets the residency requirement 
for governor clearing the way for him to run in next weeks 
democratic primary 
in a unanimous decision the court upheld an earlier shelby 
circuit court ruling that bayh did not lose his hoosier residency 
when he lived in washington in 1983 and 1984 the state 
constitution requires that candidates for governor must have lived 
in indiana for the five years preceding the election 
the five justices concluded that bayh always intended to return 
to his home state 
bayh the 32yearold son of former sen birch e bayh has been 
the leader in public opinion polls matching him against his 
opponent former kokomo mayor stephen j daily in next tuesdays 
primary he also leads in polls against republican lt gov john m 
mutz who is unopposed for the gop gubernatorial nomination the 
gop has controlled the indiana governorship for 20 years 
the legal battle over bayhs residency was triggered when 
republican gov robert d orr instructed the gopcontrolled state 
election board to consider bayhs eligibility to hold the 
governors office orr is barred by state law from seeking a third 
term 
bayh filed a lawsuit the next day seeking a ruling affirming his 
eligibility he said he filed the suit because he feared he 
couldnt get a fair ruling from the election board which has one 
democratic and two republican members 
the election board dropped its inquiry after a trial was 
scheduled quickly on bayhs lawsuit

that was retrieved during an autopsy on mccormick 
wednesdays slaying was the third drugrelated killing of a 
police officer in two months and had prompted renewed calls from 
police commissioner benjamin ward and mayor edward i koch for the 
death penalty for cop killers 
she shot a cop she knew she was shooting at a cop and she 
killed a cop as far as im concerned she should be taken out and 
executed i dont care whether its a deterrent kill them all 
and let god sort them out ward said

thousands of emaciated young men 
and boys fleeing sudans civil war are flowing monthly into 
ethiopia refugee camps that already shelter 250000 sudanese un 
officials said thursday 
many of the refugees who walk up to four months to reach the 
camps carry little or no food and they barely are surviving when 
they arrive said wairimu karago a un high commissioner for 
refugees representative in ethiopia 
when they come in the camps theyre not even able to stand 
said ayodele fowler head of the ethiopia desk in the commissions 
office in geneva theyre walking skeletons 
the commission estimates 20 percent of the refugees die en route 
only the strongest survive the trip said miss karago 
hundreds more die in the camps but the death rate is down to 
about one third of its peak of three deaths per every 10000 people 
per day of several months ago when emergency supplies could not 
meet the sudden influx 
the camps are in a remote area of western ethiopia all but one 
are accessible by road but it takes trucks carrying relief 
supplies six days to make the trip from the northeastern red sea 
port of assab 
although miss karago said the un group tried to call attention 
to the crisis last year it was overshadowed by a massive drought 
relief effort aimed at saving the lives of 7 million 
starvationthreatened people 
the situation is complicated by ethiopias preoccupation with a 
civil war in the north which has crippled relief operations 
fowler said there is a critical need for more trucks to carry 
food and suplies to the camps 
the refugees basic food needs mostly in the form of grain 
would largely be covered by a un world food program donation of 
8 million in grain announced wednesday he said 
nevertheless fowler appealed for another 32000 metric tons of 
supplemental and therapeutic food many of the refugees eat nothing 
but acacia tree leaves during their treks 
a western diplomat who visited the itang and fugnido camps in 
march said some of the worstoff refugees compared poorly with 
pictures of nazi concentration camp victims and were as bad or 
worse as anything seen in ethiopia during the 198486 famine 
tubercular coughs sounded throughout fugnidos inpatient 
medical unit where four or five of the refugees looked as if they 
would not survive the day and only one was observed moving slowly 
crawling in his naked state towards a water jug said the 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
since november 8000 to 10000 refugees have been arriving each 
month and swelling populations at a camp in itang and forcing the 
creation of camps at dimma fugnido and assosa 
the refugees are primarily 10 to 15year old dinka and nuer 
tribesmen who say they are fleeing conscription and atrocities in 
southern sudan where mainly christian and animist rebels are 
fighting the moslem government 
their most common tale is of government troops entering villages 
and killing the men and boys and raping the women and girls before 
taking them for sale into slavery according to officials who have 
visited the camps 
the young women and boys arriving at the camps either have 
escaped the attack or fled before the onslaught 
the current movement of displaced sudanese into ethiopia bagan 
in 1983 when the rebels took up arms against the government 
following the collapse of a peace agreement however people have 
been fleeing periodic conflicts in southern sudan since the 1950s

althea gibson the first black american tennis 
champion thursday presented her five wimbledon trophies to the 
smithsonian institutions national museum of american history 
who could have imagined who could have thought the 
60yearold gibson said at smithsonian ceremony here stands 
before you a negro woman raised in harlem who went on to become a 
tennis player and finally wind up being a world champion in 
fact the first black woman champion of this world 
and believe it or not i still am she said 
the eldest of five children gibson described herself as a 
born athlete noting her 200 bowling average and membership in 
the mysterious five girls basketball team before she met fred 
johnson the onearmed tennis coach who taught her to play 
among those attending the presentation was dr ea eaton of 
wilmington nc who with another black physician decided to 
prepare the gangly 17yearold harlem teen for the world of tennis 
whites and rackets 
she was a fine player but she had too many rough edges to go 
into those tennis clubs eaton remembered so my friend said if 
i would send her to school he would take her to the tournaments a 
few months later althea got off the train in wilmington with her 
bag tennis racket and the saxaphone suger ray robinson had given 
her 
although gibson was the first black woman to compete in the us 
championships at forrest hills ny in 1950 and at wimbledon in 
1951 it was not until 1956 that she began to win major tennis 
tournaments throughout europe including the womens doubles 
championship at wimbledon 
for the next two years gibson captured both the singles and 
doubles championships at wimbledon causing her to be voted the 
woman athlete of the year for 1957 by the associated press during 
this period she also was awarded the banchees award of 
sportsmanship the babe zaharias award as woman athlete of the year 
and the pigskin club sterling athlete award 
although the trophies will be held in storage a harry c lee 
tennis racket and a tennis dress she used in one of her 
championship matches were placed on public view immediately 
following her retirement in 1960 gibson toured with the harlem 
globetrotters served on the new jersey athletic commission and 
became a professional golfer she currently is special assistant to

the back however after drawing up another plan ricupero was 
again rejected this time because there was not enough parking 
ricupero said he was rejected because he moved to bennington 
from massachusetts five years ago and is considered a 
flatlander 
john cronin iii chairman of the zoning board and also a 
massachusetts native called ricupero a troublemaker and 
suggested he hire an engineer to address problems with the plan

the rev charles west believes in modern 
means of delivering his churchs message 
for more than a month members of the first baptist church have 
been hearing west remind them to attend choir practice and show up 
for parish meetings 
the preaching comes via a telecomputer a machine programmed to 
dial phone numbers and deliver wests message of the day 
one person cant make the calls this machine does in the same 
time frame west said it takes no breaks for lunch or a drink 
of water if somebody hangs up it doesnt get mad 
on the day before easter for example all 525 church members 
picked up the ringing phone and heard this hello this is pastor 
west calling i trust youre ready for easter dont forget to turn 
your clocks up 
it also gave other information about church services and had 
room for parishioners to leave a message 
west conceded that a taped message sounds impersonal but said 
its a good way to keep in touch with his growing congregation

the pentagon said the missiles iran fired 
at three us warships last week were not chinesemade silkworms 
but left unanswered a question that puzzles american officers here 
if not silkworms what were they 
senior naval officers said they were unaware of anything in 
irans arsenal that might be easily confused with the silkworm a 
dangerous but fairly primitive weapon based on a 30yearold soviet 
design 
if they have something new and different you would expect it 
to be better one said noting that the projectiles were thwarted 
with relative ease by the warships antimissile defenses four 
fell into the water and the fifth was seen to hit an oil platform 
iran deployed mobile silkworm batteries along its shore of the 
strait of hormuz about a year ago it threatened to fire them at 
ships in the narrow gateway to the persian gulf but never had rom 
warships or aircraft 
one clue being examined was an iranian c130 aircraft that was 
airborne at the time american officers suspect it reported 
locations of us ships to missile batteries 
some diplomats and officers said they believed washington would 
play down or deny the firing of silkworms to avoid the need for 
retaliation that might escalate conflict in the gulf where iran 
and iraq have been at war since september 1980 
thats what i think and thats what a lot of other people 
think a western diplomat said he noted a us warning to iran 
last year that even an indication of hostile intent would draw 
swift response 
us officials including caspar weinberger then defense 
secretary said such intent would include using the missile 
batteries firecontrol radar to track navy ships or other 
usflagged vessels passing through hormuz 
some arab leaders are understood to believe the united states 
having dealt a severe blow to irans naval forces in the clashes 
april 18 wants to avoid further armed conflict 
american forces attacked two iranian oil platforms and sank or 
disabled six naval craft that day in raids described as a 
measured response to hostile acts including the mining of gulf 
waters and firing on us helicopters 
in the course of operation praying mantis as the 
retaliatory raids were called the guided missile frigate jack 
williams destroyer obrien and guided missile destroyer joseph 
strauss came under missile attack near the strait 
they took evasive action and fired chaff rockets to confuse 
the radarguidance systems of the incoming projectiles all of 
which flew wide 
one missile was seen by crewmen on the jack williams fantail as 
it crossed behind the ship and hit a distant oil platform it 
passed close enough that a helicopter pilot dived into a net for 
safety and a crewman fired at it with an m60 machine gun 
officers of the jack williams identified the missiles as 
silkworms but pentagon officials said wednesday they concluded 
from strong indicators that they were not they said the 
inquiry was continuing 
officials did not describe the indicators but one said 
known silkworm sites and a storage area at the bandar abbas naval 
base were under constant surveillance and if they had moved 
one out we would have seen it 
a navy spokesman in manama said he could not comment on the 
pentagon findings that gets into an area we cant discuss 
here he said 
the report from washington was no surprise to navy officers in 
the gulf some had said they were stunned and mystified by the 
efforts of officials in washington within hours to debunk the 
reports of silkworms 
everything we know says thats what they were a senior 
officer said at the time another declared angrily i know 
silkworms were fired just as well as i know my own name 
after hearing that adm william crowe chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff was quoted by a congressman misquoted it turned 
out as denying the missiles were silkworms one officer pointed 
to the rank on his collar and laughed 
see that he said do you think im going to argue 
capt donald a dyer commander of surface action group delta 
the threeship unit led by the jack williams was asked again the 
day after the missile was fired what kind he thought it was 
i dont know he said with a shrug all i know is it was 
big it was fast and it came from iran

the shooting of three miami policeman in a month 
along with a skyrocketing murder rate had authorities here 
demanding a change in floridas liberal gun law thursday and the 
state legislature appears to be responding 
only hours after miami motorcycle patrolman james hayden was 
wounded twice with an automatic pistol during a routine traffic 
stop a state house criminal justice subcommittee voted 43 
thursday to recommend an amendment to the state constitution to 
require a sevenday coolingoff period for gun buyers 
on wednesday the full senate had approved another bill that 
tightened up gun law loopholes allowing some convicted criminals to 
get concealed weapons permits 
the current relaxed gun law approved last year over the 
protests of urban police agencies all but eliminated coolingoff 
periods banned local gun control ordinances and allowed most 
floridians to carry a concealed weapon 
opponents including miamiarea police and city officials say 
it encourages a wild west atmosphere they blame for a surge in 
violence 
you liberalize gun laws and people feel they are at liberty to 
go out and shoot each other and shoot policemen an angry miami 
police sgt david rivero said thursday were headed the wrong 
way 
miami had an 18 percent increase in gunrelated crimes between 
october and march compared with the same period before the law was 
passed and ominously gun thefts were up 30 percent said rivero 
the murder rate in dade county after having dropped last year 
has soared again hitting the 100 mark in april four months ahead 
of the 1987 rate 
were going to have to see a lot more people killed and maybe 
a lot more policemen killed before the legislature makes a 
change said metrodade police spokesman al hidalgogato 
miami mayor xavier suarez on thursday called for a new law or a 
state constitutional amendment giving local communities the right 
to regulate guns 
we need extensive background checks and a coolingoff 
period said suarez under the current state law counties can 
impose a limited twoday coolingoff period but police say its so 
vague that its meaningless 
wednesday nights wounding of hayden who was listed in stable 
condition thursday occurred in the same neighborhood where veteran 
police officer victor estefan was shot to death march 30 after 
stopping a car there have been no arrests in either shooting 
the same day estefan was killed a florida highway patrol 
trooper was wounded on interstate 95 in dade county and killed his 
attacker on april 5 a miami undercover police officer was grazed 
in the head by a gunman later identified as an escaped prisoner 
if the bill passed thursday by the criminal justice subcommittee 
is later approved by the full house and the senate the question 
will be put to voters on the november statewide ballot the measure 
would not need approval by gov bob martinez to be placed on the 
ballot 
house majority leader ron silver a democrat from north miami 
beach sponsored the proposed constitutional amendment because he 
said floridas image has been tarnished by the gun law 
ive traveled across this county said silver no longer 
are people asking us about the sun beaches and weather but 
they are talking about what are you doing about the gun situation 
in florida 
marion hammer a lobbyist for the florida arm of the national 
rifle association said silvers bill was prompted more by 
emotionalism than by a need to protect public safety 
waiting periods have nothing to do with fun and sun in 
florida said hammer director of the unified sportsmen of 
florida 
police concede that none of the recent police shootings and few 
other gunrelated slayings can be tied directly to last years gun 
law but they contend the law has put more guns on the street and 
created a mentality that makes using a gun more acceptable

democratic leaders of congress urged president 
reagan on thursday to reverse course and sign a sweeping trade 
bill but the white house said flatly that he will veto it 
reagans opposition to the bill centers on a provision requiring 
companies to give workers 60 days notice of plant closings or 
major layoffs and he offered his laborleader background as a 
reason 
as an old labor union president i suggest thats a matter 
that belongs in the managementlabor contracts between the unions 
and the people the president told reporters as he greeted 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney for lunch 
reagan served as president of the screen actors guild from 1947 
to 1952 and in 1959 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the presidents veto 
message would clearly indicate what would be acceptable to the 
administration in a replacement bill 
we would hope then to be able to work with the leadership 
come up with a bill as rapidly as possible that everyone could 
support and pass fitzwater said 
however democrats said reagan should sign the existing bill and 
suggested there might not be enough time to produce another measure 
this bill isnt dead yet senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva told reporters on capitol hill the ball is in the 
white house court if there is a demise of this bill it will occur 
at the white house not here 
byrd said the senate has only about 90 legislative days left 
this year and a heavy schedule asked if it would accept changes 
drafted by the white house he said were not spoonfed from the 
white house 
i hope the president will rethink his position and come down 
on the side of the american people byrd said 
also pleading for reagan to sign the bill house speaker jim 
wright dtexas said there has to be a warm side to the 
president i cant believe it falls on deaf ears or a flinty 
heart 
the measure the product of three years of congressional work 
won final approval on a 6336 senate vote wednesday but the total 
fell short of the twothirds margin needed to override a veto 
besides the plantclosing provision the lengthy bill would 
increase the power of the us trade representative to act against 
other countries that use unfair trade practices make it easier to 
curb imports repeal the windfall profits tax on oil companies and 
increase agricultural subsidies 
the japanese and south korean governments urged reagan to veto 
the measure saying it would hinder international trade the 
european economic community warned of retaliatory action if the 
bill became law 
fitzwater said the bill is not expected to reach the oval office 
until the middle of next week after which reagan will have 10 days 
in which to act 
in the veto message the president will lay out his generic 
concerns about the bill undoubtedly will specify that we would 
like to see plant closings eliminated from future consideration of 
a bill the spokesman said 
he will have a message that will pretty clearly indicate 
what would be acceptable to the administration and use that as a 
framework for then discussing a new bill with the leadership of 
congress 
while the plantclosing provision had been the most 
objectionable feature to the administration fitzwater said the 
white house had other problems with it he refused to spell out 
what other changes the administration would demand to make the bill 
acceptable however 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said there are a 
lot of good things in that legislation so if a couple of necessary 
corrections are made and the bill comes back im really quite 
confident the president would sign it

jesse jackson narrowly won vermonts 
presidential caucuses according to official democratic party

of the state convention delegates elected at local caucuses last

120 were elected uncommitted 
the percentages were 46 percent for jackson to 45 percent for 
dukakis 
craig fuller the executive director of the state democratic 
party said the official tabulation had been slowed by mistakes 
found in some community caucuses an unofficial associated press 
count on the night of the caucuses had jackson ahead 589 delegates 
to 581 for dukakis 
the 1304 delegates elected april 19 will attend the state 
democratic party convention next month at which time 14 of the 
states 19 delegates to the national convention will be elected 
the remaining five spots belong to gov madeleine kunin a dukakis 
supporter and four party officials 
it is not sure how the 14 will be split since the vote at the 
state convention is by secret ballot 
fifty people going one way or the other could make a real 
difference in whether it is 77 or 95 said ron squires of 
brattleboro the vice chair of the party

delegate to the national convention remains committed to sen paul

prime minister brian mulroney must be wondering 
what he has to do to grab a headline his washington summit took 
secondbilling at home thursday to a dramatic rebellion in the 
opposition liberal party 
while mulroney was urging congress to curb acid rain in a speech 
sen daniel moynihan termed the best hed heard from a foreign 
leader newscasts in canada led with liberal leader john turners 
fight for survival 
a silverhaired lawyer who took over from former prime minister 
pierre trudeau in 1984 but has never had wholehearted support 
turner emerged wednesday from a daylong battle with detractors to 
reject demands for his resignation 
a group of 22 of the partys 39 members of parliament had urged 
him to step down as the country heads into an election campaign 
i will stay as long as it takes to become prime minister 
said a defiant turner 58 
mulroney a progressive conservative may have been miffed at 
coming second on the news but the outcome of the liberal squabble 
could help him in the election he must call in the next year polls 
indicate that former trudeau cabinet member jean chretien waiting 
in the liberal wings is twice as popular as turner 
the conservatives liberals and socialist new democratic party 
are running neckandneck in the polls with mulroneys party on 
the upswing 
there was more political turmoil in the headlines from manitoba 
province where the countrys only socialist government was 
resoundingly defeated tuesday but none of the three main parties 
won a majority 
the conservatives led by premierelect gary filmon took 25 of 
the 57 seats in the provincial legislature and will form a minority 
government may 9 but mulroneys party had hoped for a more 
convincing win to start a national trend and the big winners 
tuesday were the liberals who took 20 seats and hold the balance of 
power 
liberal leader sharon carstairs a former winnipeg teacher 
became the only woman opposition leader in canada and is poised to 
become the countrys first woman premier if the conservatives 
falter 
the result appeared to doom one of the biggest achievements of 
mulroneys first term the meech lake constitutional accord he 
negotiated with all 10 provinces last year 
the accord would bring quebec back into the constitutional fold 
ending a sevenyear boycott by recognizing the frenchmajority 
province as a distinct society 
but mulroney paid a price for that historic clause he agreed to 
decentralize federal powers giving the provinces more say over 
spending programs and appointments to the supreme court and senate 
without consulting all party factions turner endorsed the 
accord but many leading liberals oppose it including carstairs 
and trudeau who emerged from retirement to argue passionately that 
it could fracture the nation 
last year 11 liberal lawmakers defied turner and voted against 
the accord in parliament last week the liberaldominated senate 
refused to ratify the measure and sent it back to the house of 
commons with nine amendments 
the accord also requires ratification by all provinces and so 
far only three have done so new brunswick is firmly against it 
and manitoba premierelect filmon lacks the votes to push it 
through 
in essence meech lake is dead said carstairs 
turner withstood a similar political ambush in 1986 emerging 
with a 76 percent approval rating from a national convention but 
the unrest surfaced against last summer and this year 
he told reporters his mandate came from the entire party not 
just members of parliament and he intends to fulfil it 
sheila finestone a liberal lawmaker from montreal termed the 
resentment against turner a festering sore that had to be 
thrashed out but she hoped members would now rally behind him 
however there was speculation that some of the rebels who are 
upset over meech lake and the partys 4 million debt may quit the 
liberal caucus to sit in parliament as independents 
obviously it will be very dificult to work together said 
one dissident john nunziata of toronto 
defections could endanger turners position as official 
opposition leader since the liberals have 39 seats in parliament 
and the new democrats 33 if seven liberals resign new democratic 
party leader ed broadbent would take over turners role

the october stock market crash threw 7000 
people out of work on wall street but the rest of new york citys 
jobgenerating economy largely continues to boom according to 
figures released thursday 
unemployment in the city reached an 18year low at 47 percent 
in the first quarter of the year said samuel m ehrenhalt 
regional commissioner of the federal bureau of labor statistics 
the national unemployment rate for the quarter was 62 percent 
the improvement in the city showed up across the board with 
joblessness down not only among white men but also among blacks 
hispanics women and teenagers 
none of these figures however declined to the levels of 1968 
when city unemployment was only 31 percent 
it is clear that concerns about imminent and substantial 
economic decline following last octobers crash have not become 
reality ehrenhalt said in a statement some experts had 
predicted the city would lose as many as 50000 jobs in its 
financial services sector 
although wall street has lost 7000 jobs in the six months since 
october in the two years before that it had added 30000 jobs to 
reach an alltime high of 160000 people working in the financial 
district 
also since october another 4000 jobs were lost in the 
everdeclining manufacturing field 
but overall since the october crash privatesector jobs were 
up by 10000 thanks mainly to an addition of 14000 service 
industry jobs and 5300 jobs in construction ehrenhalt said

secretary of state george p shultz told 
congress on thursday that under the right circumstances jordan 
would accept his proposal for a limited mideast peace conference 
but shultz said he failed to enlist the soviet union during his 
talks last week in moscow and that the peace conference remains the 
centerpiece of israeli prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
objections to the us plan for negotiations 
i didnt achieve any breakthrough shultz told a senate 
appropriations subcommittee that is considering the 
administrations request for 38 billion to operate the state 
department and international organizations in the fiscal year that 
begins oct 1 
shultz had hoped to open arabisraeli negotiations next sunday 
the united states the soviet union britain france and china 
would serve as sponsors for direct talks between israel and a 
mixed delegation of jordan and palestinian arabs 
so far only egyptian president hosni mubarak who is not 
directly involved has publicly supported the proposal 
but shultz said under the right circumstances such a 
conference would be agreeable to jordan he acknowledged 
however that they havent said so in so many words 
king hussein of jordan has insisted on superpower participation 
in mideast negotiations while shamir wants to exclude the soviets 
for an active role 
hussein seeks international backing for any deal he may make 
with israel while shamir is skeptical that the soviets who 
usually back arab positions would play a helpful role in reaching 
a settlement 
shultz stressed his goal was direct negotiations between israel 
and the arabs 
however he said down the road the united states the soviet 
union and the three other permanent members of the united nations 
security council would deal with questions of international 
guarantees and refugees 
these are issues international groupings deal with best 
shultz said 
the us plan calls for two stages of negotiations 
in the first arrangements would be made to provide some 
selfrule for three years for the 15 million palestinian arabs who 
live on the israeliheld west bank and in gaza 
in the second stage beginning dec 1 negotiations would be 
held on the 40year arabisraeli conflict syria egypt and lebanon 
could then join the discussion 
shultz also said president reagan was near a decision on whether 
to expand the protection of american warships to neutral shipping 
in the persian gulf 
the us navy is already guiding kuwaiti oil tankers flying the 
american flag through the troubled waters and has clashed with 
iranian forces there 
defense secretary frank c carlucci was returning thursday night 
from a meeting with north atlantic treaty organization defense 
ministers in brussels the president will decide fairly soon 
shultz said 
critics have expressed concern the united states is being drawn 
into the war between iran and iraq 
rep claude pepper dfla on thursday offered an amendment to 
the pentagon authorization bill to exclude the use of coast guard 
vessels from duty in the persian gulf as the pentagon has 
recommended 
pepper contended the vessels were needed to intercept drug 
traffic closer to home

federal investigation of the taxexempt status of robertsons 
religious broadcasting network 
us magistrate rebecca b smith extended a showcause order for 
two weeks until may 12 for documents originally requested by the 
internal revenue service last december 
assistant us attorney raymond jackson said americans for 
robertson and james f patterson the groups former treasurer 
have turned over most of the information requested jackson has 
asked for additional materials including bank records for 
robertson groups in texas michigan and virginia 
robert l odonnell attorney for americans for robertson said

robertson a former television evangelist from virginia beach 
founded the nonprofit taxexempt cbn and was its president until 
last october when he announced his candidacy for the republican 
presidential nomination the cable networks operations were turned 
over to one of robertsons sons 
the freedom council established in 1981 with seed money from 
cbn received nearly 3 million from the network in 1985 according 
to former council officials that was the year robertson began 
setting up his political organization 
in papers filed with the irs seeking taxexempt status the 
freedom council said it was created to educate christians on how to 
get involved in politics 
critics contend the council acted as a front for the robertson 
campaign by organizing political neophytes from fundamentalist or 
charismatic churches as robertson volunteers 
the freedom council disbanded in 1986 shortly after americans 
for robertson was formed bob slosser president of cbn university 
headed the council at the time and marc nuttle americans for 
robertsons initial acting director and robertsons campaign 
manager through most of the primaries served as a paid council 
consultant 
under federal law taxexempt entities cannot raise money for or 
support political candidates the loss of taxexempt status would 
mean contributors could not deduct their donations from income 
taxes

an educators group on thursday urged schools 
to take a more active role in teaching students right from wrong 
saying recent increases in teenage suicides drug abuse and 
pregnancies show the need for commonsense moral values 
the association for supervision and curriculum development said 
in a 47page report that too many schools have shied away from 
teaching moral values for fear of offending students but the 
group contended there are some common values like honesty 
compassion and altruism that all americans believe in no matter 
what their religious beliefs 
theres a great deal of concern across the country about the 
morality of adults from the insider trading scandal on wall street 
to the irancontra affair said ron brandt executive editor of 
the associations publications theres obviously a good deal of 
lying and cheating going on in our society and students are 
picking up on that 
brandt added we dont mean to imply that the schools have a 
total responsibility for teaching moral values but they do play a 
role 
the association founded 45 years ago is a group of teachers 
principals and school administrators involved in writing school 
curricula and deciding what gets taught it estimates it has 
100000 members 
its report moral education in the life of the school said 
concern about moral education has been triggered in the past few 
years by the substantial longterm increase in emotional 
problems among young americans and cites dramatic rises in the 
rates of murders and suicides among young men increases in the 
rate of outofwedlock births to adolescents and higher rates of 
teenage drug use 
these data indicate that by some measures at least young 
people show more selfdestructive and other destructive behavior 
today than they did two or three decades ago the report said 
at the same time the report said educators grew more wary of 
even trying to identify common moral values 
but educators may have gone too far in avoiding controversy the 
report said it said recent gallup polls have shown that the 
american public rates drug use and lack of discipline as the two 
top problems facing the public schools 
evidently the public wants some moral education 
association executive director gordon cawelti said and with 
family breakups the schools are the last remaining place with 
moral influence 
the report suggested that schools ask parents local business 
leaders and religious and ethnic groups to help put together a list 
of values that should be taught in the schools it provided one 
list put together by the baltimore county md schools that 
included values like courtesy equality of opportunity loyalty 
compassion patriotism and truth 
values like these constitute our democracys moral heritage 
the report said in most communities substantial majorities can 
be mobilized to support statements of principle that include 
similar values 
cawelti said that those values then can be taught through 
community service projects and even in history and literature 
classes where there are themes through the ages of moral and 
immoral behavior

president reagan signed a multibilliondollar 
education measure expanding services to students thursday but 
expressed regret that current supreme court jurisprudence is 
hostile to provisions outlawing pornographic telephone messages 
in a signing ceremony attended by the bills sponsors and 
supporters in congress reagan said the measure reauthorizes and 
improves a wide variety of federal programs at the elementary and 
secondary school level 
at the same time it recognizes a fundamental truth that the 
primary responsibility for educating these children lies with the 
local communities and the states and not with the federal 
government he said 
noting the ban on telephone pornography the president said i 
commend congress for joining the administrations longstanding 
effort to combat hard core obscenity 
i am bound to note however as much as it displeases me that 
current supreme court jurisprudence is unfriendly to parts of this 
bill he said and i hope that the courts and the congress will 
work with the administration to do as much as is permitted by the 
constitution to enforce the provisions of this statute 
the american civil liberties union opposed the ban on telephone 
pornography saying that although born of concern for children it 
intrudes on the privacy and free speech rights of american adults 
no court has ever upheld a complete ban on nonobscene 
socalled indecent speech barry lynn legislative counsel to 
the aclu said after senate passage of the measure 
the signing ceremony was attended by rep augustus hawkins 
dcalif and sen robert stafford rvt the principal sponsors 
of the bill and by republicans and democrats in both houses who 
joined them in sponsorship 
the act authorizes up to 83 billion in spending next year on 
elementary and secondary school programs with more than half the 
money going to disadvantaged children at risk of failing 
it contains new programs to prevent dropouts and help high 
school students with weak skills and greatly expands drug abuse 
education and magnet schools new money also was earmarked for 
math science and foreignlanguage programs 
the bill a compromise between the versions passed by the house 
and senate was approved by voice vote in the senate and by a vote 
of 3971 in the house with rep philip crane rind voting 
against it 
the largest single program in the measure will pay for tutoring 
and other services to disadvantaged children who are in danger of 
failing academically school districts could receive basic grants 
totaling up to 47 billion in the 12 months beginning oct 1 a 
400 million increase over current spending 
other initiatives in the bill include 50 million for even 
start to jointly educate poor preschool children and their 
illiterate parents 50 million for dropout prevention 
demonstration projects and 200 million to improve basic skills of 
high school students 
from the beginning we worked with congress educators and the 
public to assure legislation that would assure basic education for 
americas youth reagan said

bakers and street vendors joined a protest 
strike thursday that virtually closed down the occupied territories 
and arab east jerusalem israeli army gunfire killed one 
palestinian and wounded two 
the effectiveness of the strike was at odds with declarations by 
israeli authorities that the 5monthold rebellion in the west bank 
and gaza strip had begun to ebb 
underground palestinian leaders called the strike in a bulletin 
issued last week and it appeared to be as widespread as dozens of 
others since the 15 million palestinians in the occupied lands 
began what even the israelis now call the intefadah the 
uprising 
arab reporters said bakers and street vendors who usually 
operate during strikes joined this one in most areas 
an army spokesman said troops shot and killed a 20yearold arab 
when they were attacked by hundreds of protesters after entering 
the village of malek near the west bank city of ramallah the 
soldiers were apparently going to conduct a search 
the spokesman said the troops were attacked with stones and a 
firebomb and fired in the direction from which the firebomb came 
killing the palestinian 
the killing raised the arab death toll in the rebellion to 175 
an israeli teenager and a soldier have also died 
in hebron on the west bank about 100 young palestinians set 
tires ablaze in front of the municipal building and shouted for the 
resignation of mayor abdel majid zir arab witnesses said zir was 
appointed by israel 
a 20yearold protestor raed shuhkee was wounded by gunfire 
when israeli troops dispersed the crowd with tear gas rubber 
bullets and live ammunition the witnesses said 
dozens of arabs blocked the road to ebween a village near 
ramallah with rocks and burning tires then threw stones at israeli 
soldiers who arrived in three jeeps a villager reported 
the villager who would not give his name said a 23yearold 
man was shot he spoke to a reporter at ramallah hospital where 
the victim was being treated for a gunshot wound in the right leg 
army spokesmen confirmed a protester was wounded in hebron and 
another near ramallah but said they were investigating 
hundreds of palestinians have been wounded since the violence 
began dec 8 
israel radio said the army bulldozed an orange grove outside 
bethlehem after a jeep skidded off a nearby road on which 
palestinians had spread oil 
soldiers followed footprints from the road to the orange grove 
the radio said reporters who went there later found bulldozer 
tracks and a halfacre of uprooted orange trees 
in south lebanon just across israels northern border israeli 
troops and their christian militia allies fired flares and 
conducted searches overnight to try to close the route palestinian 
guerrillas used to enter israel on tuesday and wednesday a un 
official said 
soldiers and militiamen of the israelibacked south lebanon army 
set up roadblocks and questioned hundreds of lebanese in the search 
for collaborators said the official speaking on condition of 
anonymity the militia is the armys surrogate in the security 
zone israel maintain north of the frontier 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said wednesday the two border 
crossings were an attempt at something spectacular to spur the 
rebellion in the west bank and gaza which israel has occupied 
since the 1967 middle east war they led to firefights in which 
five guerrillas and two israeli soldiers died 
predictions of a calming in the territories followed several 
days of comparatively little violence and thursdays strike was 
generally peaceful 
arabs blocked roads with wrecked cars and stones in several 
cities in gaza and the west bank and taxi and bus stands were 
empty in east jerusalem witnesses in gaza city said young 
palestinians wearing checkered arab scarves over their faces 
stopped cars to keep workers from reaching jobs in israel 
palestinian flags outlawed by israel flew in the center of 
bethlehem manger square usually crowded was nearly deserted

health officials said thursday that the blue 
substance injected into some grapefruit in rome was not poisonous 
and they revoked a nationwide ban on sales of the citrus fruit 
the health ministry had ordered a seizure of all grapefruit in 
italy and triggered an alert in 11 other common market countries 
when they reported tuesday that they found six grapefruit poisoned 
in an apparent act of sabotage aimed at israeli exports 
but the ministry said thursday that lab tests determined the 
substance was methylene blue a nontoxic biological stain also 
used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning 
none of the other grapefruit seized was found to be tainted it 
was not known whether the six tainted grapefruit actually were from 
israel 
authorities found the six tainted fruit in a rome supermarket 
after a caller warned a rome newspaper that grapefruit there had 
been poisoned the caller claimed responsibility for the 
organization of metropolitan proletarians and oppressed people 
a group not previously heard of 
a poster pasted on the outside of the supermarket urged a 
boycott of israeli products 
the week before an organization that said it supported the 
palestinian uprising in the west bank and gaza strip claimed to 
have poisoned israeli grapefruit on sale in milan and called for a 
boycott of israeli products laboratory checks found no trace of 
poison 
health minister donat cattin ordered the nationwide seizure when 
three laboratory mice died after eating blue pulp from some of the 
grapefruit 
but officials began to doubt the grapefruit had been poisoned 
because all the other rats mice and guinea pigs used in additional 
tests on wednesday survived 
health officials speculated that the first three mice may have 
died from the fiber in the fruit 
grapefruit is not a food for mice said israel adato an 
israeli ministry of agriculture official sent to italy to assist in 
the inquiry

nato defense ministers thursday vowed 
to upgrade shortrange nuclear arms following the accord to ban 
intermediaterange missiles and an earlier decision to remove 1400 
nuclear warheads from europe 
in related comments defense secretary frank carlucci called a 
move in denmark to firm up the countrys antinuclear stance a 
fundamental challenge to natos defense strategy 
washington will not end its very firm policy of not 
confirming or denying its warships carry nuclear arms he said 
we cannot have that policy whittled away at in any way shape 
or form carlucci said 
the danish parliament adopted a motion april 14 demanding 
warships be reminded not to carry nuclear arms each time they visit 
a danish port denmarks minority centerright government has 
called for early elections over the issue 
british defense secretary george younger said britain too will 
never say if its navy ships are nucleararmed or not 
he and carlucci spoke after a twoday meeting at which the 
defense ministers agreed to continue to seek improvements in natos 
nuclear arms in europe 
nato is studying how to upgrade shortrange nuclear arms after a 
1983 decision to remove 1400 nuclear warheads from europe and the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty to remove groundlaunched 
mediumrange missiles 
the agreement was signed dec 8 by president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev 
some tactical arms are now being modernized including artillery 
shells and jets carrying both nuclear and conventional arms 
carlucci said 
on introducing by the mid1990s new groundtoground and 
airtoground missiles he said there are no particular 
deployment decisions that need to be addressed at this point 
but nato will proceed at a measured pace to improve its 
nuclear arms in europe carlucci added 
in a communique the defense ministers said 
for the forseeable future nuclear forces will continue to play 
an integral role in providing for deterrence their presence in 
europe is therefore essential 
it added nato will keep these arms uptodate where 
necessary 
carlucci briefed the allies on intelligence reports that moscow 
continues to upgrade or redeploy nuclear arms not covered by the 
inf treaty 
sources said moscow has deployed more than 4000 tactical 
aircraft 25 to 30 percent of which are nucleararmed also it is 
retargeting missiles such as the longrange ss24s and ss25s 
officials said 
the soviets younger said were undoubtedly busy keeping their 
weapons systems uptodate 
the ministers called the inf treaty a milestone in our efforts 
to achieve a more secure peace at lower levels of arms 
they restated their support for superpower efforts to halve 
their strategic nuclear forces hopes have faded that a start 
treaty can be signed at the may 29june 2 ussoviet summit in 
moscow 
carlucci said that given the progress in eastwest arms control 
negotiations the danish parliament resolution to tighten up the 
countrys antinuclear ban came at a particularly unfortunate 
point in time 
nato secretarygeneral lord carrington said the motion would 
obviously lead to very great difficulties in the alliance if 
implemented 
danish defense minister bernt johan collet told the nato 
ministers that early elections had been called for may 10 to seek 
a political mandate for continued full nato membership for his 
country 
a poll published thursday showed that most danes want to have a 
nuclearfree zone in scandinavia and nearly half would favor the 
idea even if it meant leaving nato

a lawyer for rko general inc defended the 
companys integrity thursday and urged the federal communications 
commission to reverse an initial decision to revoke its 14 radio 
and television station licenses 
attorney timothy dyk told the three sitting fcc commissioners 
that an administrative law judges charge that rko general has 
demonstrated a pattern of dishonesty with advertisers as well as 
the commission is undeserved 
since the fcc stripped rko of its license for wnactv in boston 
in 1980 the company has recognized it had made a serious mistake 
and has been candid with the commission dyk said 
the regulatory agency refused to renew rkos license for the 
station on grounds that the company had filed false financial 
statements with the fcc and lacked candor in its dealings with the 
commission 
the wnac proceeding begun in 1969 and another involving 
khjtv los angeles begun in 1965 ultimately called into question 
all of rkos radio and tv licenses in jeopardy are the licenses 
for broadcast properties the company estimates are worth 400 
million to 500 million 
fcc commissioner james h quello in an opening statement before 
dyks presentation noted that he had voted with the minority in 
the fccs decision to revoke rkos license for wnactv and called 
the action the harshest and most unwarranted decision in the 
history of the commission 
the commission is considering the recommendations of 
administrative law judge edward j kuhlmann who in an initial 
decision last august cited rko for fraudulent billing practices 
overcharging of advertisers and destroying an internal audit report 
in characterizing the extent of the alleged improprieties 
kuhlmann said no case ever before decided by this commission 
presents dishonesty comparable to rkos 
dyk said rko took misconduct seriously and relied on a 
system of audits and outside controls to assure management that the 
company owned by akron ohiobased gencorp and its stations were 
complying with fcc rules 
problems however occurred because of manipulation and 
evasion of the system by individuals within the company a 
consequence for which rko cannot be blamed for negligence he said 
but commissioner patricia diaz dennis asked how can there be 
so much manipulation and evasion of the system that didnt come to 
the attention of management 
attorney nathanial f emmons representing fidelity television 
inc of norwalk calif one of the companies that challenged rkos 
fitness to hold a broadcast license estimated that rkos radio 
networks advertisers were defrauded of 13 million from 198084 he 
said rko misinformed advertisers ran spots at times other than 
those agreed and falsified ratings data 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick asked dyk why the problem at 
radio networks coming after the wnac license revocation doesnt 
suggest that management reforms were grossly inadequate 
dyk conceded that there was this terrible problem at radio 
networks but he said rkos conduct violated no fcc rules or 
policies and noted that the company reported the problem to the 
commission 
this company has been under an absolute microscope in one 
hearing after another and inquiring into its activities and i 
think it is very very significant that in its actual broadcast 
operations what the stations were doing in their broadcast 
operations there wasnt any significant impropriety and that 
should be the most importand thing he said 
the stations involved are khjtv khjam and krthfm los 
angeles whbqtv and whbqam memphis tenn woram and wrksfm 
new york wrkoam and wrorfm boston wgmsam bethesda md 
wgmsfm washington kfrcam san francisco waxyfm fort

the international labor organization will soon 
call on israel to correct working conditions and improve wages and 
trade union rights of palestinians living on the israelioccupied 
gaza strip and west bank the head of the united nations agency 
said thursday 
the conditions under which palestinian workers are being 
employed are not satisfactory ilo directorgeneral francis 
blanchard said the gaza strip has become a hellish place 
everyone agrees its bad including the israelis 
blanchard made the remarks in an informal meeting with several 
reporters as a palestinian protest strike against israels 
occupation virtually shut down east jerusalem and cities in the 
occupied territories 
he said he is preparing a report partly based on a visit to the 
trouble spot that would put the 150membernation ilo at its 
convention in geneva in june as calling on israel for several 
reforms 
blanchard a french civil servant during world war ii described 
what he saw in his visit to the occupied territories last week as 
surrealistic as surrealistic as the time when germany was 
occupying france 
what is visible is the occupation he said the army 
the restrictions the regulations the repression the ilo has 
nothing to do with a political settlement but as far as the labor 
field is concerned it might try to do what it can 
blanchard acknowledged his organization falls short of being a 
tribunal and has no sanctions that it can impose for violations of 
its 161 internationally recognized labor standards 
but we have lots of means of exercising pressure in the moral 
sense he said 
while israeli authorities have tried to cope with arabs who live 
in the occupied territories but commute daily to jobs in israel 
several problems and distortions remain blanchard said 
among the 100000 palestinians who work in israel no more 
than 47 percent have regular employment he said there are 
bound to be differences when it comes to wages especially where 
parttime workers are concerned 
blanchard said his report will recommend seeking new assurances 
from israel to both end discrimination against arab workers and 
provide additional assistance to them 
he acknowledged it is difficult to differentiate between labor 
and political rights in the current turmoil but said it would be a 
mistake to wait until a peace agreement is concluded before 
addressing the worker rights issues 
in the gaza strip and to less extent on the west bank the 
situation calls for dramatic and urgent actions on bringing real 
development he said we cant remain in the status quo the 
two have to move in parallel 
although israel has recognized palestinian labor unions and even 
has some arabs in the leadership of its own labor movement their 
effectiveness has been set back by the recent uprisings 
the palestinian trade unions are being prevented from 
discharging their responsibilities because of measures taken by the 
military blanchard said israeli labor leaders show a lot of 
compassion to palestinian workers but the government needs to do 
more to make it possible for the palestinian unions to operate

prices of imported goods climbed 12 percent 
in the first three months of the year a slight slowdown from the 
octoberdecember quarter because of lower energy costs and a more 
stable dollar the government reported thursday 
the labor department said the januarymarch increase followed a 
16 percent rise in the final three months of 1987 for the past 12 
months import prices have risen 71 percent 
the price of foreign oil and other energy products fell 8 
percent during the first quarter if this drop in energy prices was 
removed import prices would have risen a much faster 23 percent 
in the past three months 
foreign cars and machinery which account for nearly half of all 
us imports rose 17 percent in the first quarter after 
increasing 27 percent in the fourth quarter 
analysts said the latest government statistics confirm their 
view that the weaker dollar which makes imports more expensive is 
responsible for about half the inflation the country is now 
experiencing 
consumer prices rose 44 percent in 1987 and analysts said that 
increase would have been only about 2 percent without the rise in 
import costs 
the dollar has been going down and we dont think all of that 
has been passed through to consumers yet said david wyss an 
economist with data resources inc of lexington mass foreign 
producers had been eating much of the dollars decline in lower 
profits but they cant do that anymore 
the import price report said that from january from march the 
dollar lost 14 percent of its value on a tradeweighted basis 
compared with a 58 percent plunge in the octoberdecember quarter 
the reagan administration led by treasury secretary james a 
baker iii began working with us allies in september 1985 to 
drive the value of the dollar lower in an effort to shrink the 
countrys huge foreign trade deficits a weaker dollar makes 
american goods more competitive on overseas markets while driving 
up the cost of imports to americans 
in february 1987 after the dollar had fallen by almost 50 
percent against the japanese yen and the west german mark the 
major industrial countries switched course and began trying to keep 
the dollar from falling further 
that effort was unsuccessful in 1987 because stubbornly high 
merchandise trade deficits made investors believe the dollar had 
not dropped enough to cure the countrys trade problems only two 
weeks ago the dollar fell sharply because of a widening of the 
february us trade deficit 
while the us merchandise trade deficit hit a record high of 
1712 billion last year us trade representative clayton yeutter 
said thursday that a new analysis by his office showed that the 
countrys trade deficit has actually fallen by 232 percent since 
mid1986 when the effects of the weaker dollar are removed 
he said the monthly trade report which does not factor out 
inflation has masked the improvements that have been occurring in 
volume terms 
but wyss said financial markets will continue to react to 
monthly trade figures in current dollars until they start showing 
significant improvements as well 
us export volume is growing very rapidly but unfortunately 
not fast enough to overcome the sharp increases in import prices 
he said 
the labor department report said the cost of american products 
being sold overseas rose by 14 percent during the first quarter a 
drop from a 2 percent price increase in the final three months of 
1987 this change was credited to a big slowdown in the cost of 
exported food products which rose only 06 percent in the first 
quarter after shooting up by 91 percent in the fourth quarter 
american grain prices rose 31 percent following a 142 percent 
jump in the fourth quarter as a drop in wheat prices helped offset 
continued increases in rice and corn prices 
the price of american meat products rose 51 percent following 
six months of declines while the index for fruits and vegetables 
fell for the fourth consecutive quarter

government and are trying to shake their image of being rightwing 
extremists 
the party which won at least 30 of the 60 seats in the national 
assembly in legislative elections march 20 has big hopes of 
winning the presidency next year 
if it does washingtons policy toward el salvador will have to 
change drastically party president alfredo cristiani told the 
associated press in an interview 
relations will have to be based on mutual respect no more 
coming down here and saying heres so many millions of dollars and 
this is what you have to do said cristiani 
the party whose full name is the republican nationalist 
alliance previously held only 13 assembly seats so the election 
outcome was a devastating setback for president jose napoleon 
duartes christian democratic party 
one seat remains in dispute but the assembly is to be installed 
as scheduled sunday 
arena also won twothirds of the municipal races at stake in 
march including longtime christian democratic stronghold san 
salvador 
the conservative party once was best known for its controversial 
founder cashiered army major roberto daubuisson 
cristiani a 40yearold georgetown universityeducated 
businessman has been a major factor in the effort to leave behind 
the partys image of neofascist thugs 
but the public relations project intended to present arena as 
moderate suffers setbacks 
retired army col sigifredo ochoa perez an arena leader and 
legislatorelect recently called for insurrection against what 
he termed this ominous government this treasonous high command 
he accused the armed forces leadership of selling out to north 
american intervention 
cristiani said the state department and the us embassy have 
waged a constant campaign against arena founded in 1981 
we have always felt under tremendous attack from the 
government of the united states he said 
robert white who was us ambassador in el salvador in the late 
70s and early 80s once called daubuisson a pathological 
killer arena alleges that the us embassy backed what the 
rightists claim was fraud in elections won by the christian 
democrats in 1984 and 1985 
arena won the march elections by broadening its appeal beyond 
the rabidly anticommunist landed oligarchy it represented in the 
early 1980s 
cristiani has emerged as a leader since daubuisson a former 
major in army intelligence decided in 1985 to share the limelight 
he daubuisson recognized that his figure and all that had 
been said about him were prejudicial to the partys image said 
the strapping softspoken cristiani who exports coffee and 
distributes pharmaceuticals 
he expressed the desire to no longer be a preponderant figure 
and the party made the principal decision to become a political 
institution that does not depend on the charismatic image of one 
man that it should open up said cristiani 
arena has been routinely referred to by local and foreign media 
as far or extremerightist 
but if you had to place us in the north american political 
spectrum were closer to conservative democrats or liberal 
republicans than to conservative republicans cristiani said 
critics of the party say daubuissons continued prominence as 
well as ochoas provide room for doubt about the partys professed 
commitment to democracy 
cristiani said arena favors establishment of a private banking 
sector parallel to the nationalized system and a private role in 
the staterun enterprises that export the countrys main crops 
coffee sugar and cotton 
an arena government would try to resume the stalled dialogue 
with leftist guerrillas but if that failed military pressure 
would be increased 
some 65000 people have been killed in the eight years of 
fighting and the economy is crippled by inflation and unemployment 
estimated at 40 percent

anxiety about drug trafficking and foreign 
economic power match fear of the soviet union as the top concerns 
of americans according to a survey issued thursday by a group that 
includes pollsters for michael dukakis and george bush 
given a choice of seven national security goals 22 percent of 
those surveyed picked combatting international drug traffic as the 
no 1 priority another 18 percent said correcting americas 
growing trade imbalance was the most important goal reducing us 
and soviet long range missiles was chosen by 15 percent of those 
surveyed 
keeping communist governments out of central and southern 
america was the no 1 national security desire of 13 percent of 
those quizzed containing soviet agression was the chief concern of 
12 percent stopping the threat of nuclear weapons topped the list 
for 11 percent and combatting terrorism was the priority for 5 
percent 
the poll said 59 percent of the american people believe economic 
competitors like japan pose more of a threat to national security 
than traditional military adversaries like the soviets 
it was the fourth poll in a series called americans talk 
security a 10survey collaborative effort by four organizations 
including martilla amp kiley of boston dukakis pollster and 
market opinion research of detroit which works for bush martilla 
amp kiley conducted the latest poll but the questions and analysis 
were approved by all four organizations 
by a margin of 3to1 americans believe economic power is more 
important than military strength in determining a countrys 
influence in the world 
asked about us relations with the soviet union 61 percent 
said they were improving 4 percent thought they were getting worse 
and 34 percent said they were remaining the same 
seventysix percent said they had a favorable general 
impression of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and 66 percent said 
gorbachevs policies will eventually create a more free and open 
society 
asked if us policy should focus less on the soviets and more 
on other threats to our security 48 percent sought less focus on 
the soviets and 42 said the focus should remain on the soviets 
the pollsters for the leading presidential candidates said they 
found encouraging results in the survey 
tom kiley who polls for dukakis said the democrats are pleased 
that the survey shows a broadening prism through which 
americans look at security issues 
fred steeper whose market opinion research company works for 
bush said he was bouyed that 61 percent of americans chose 
improved efficiency as the key to reducing the trade deficit 
compared to 24 percent who chose fairer trade practices 
that result is a blow against a protectionist stance 
steeper said 
the ats poll was based on a march 2227 national telephone 
survey of 1004 americans the margin of error was 3 percent ats 
said

television authorities on thursday rejected a 
government request to postpone screening a program on the shooting 
of three unarmed irish republican army guerrillas by british 
commandos in gibraltar 
the program by londons thames television shows a witness 
saying two guerrillas had their hands raised as if to give 
themselves up when they were shot 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe asked lord thompson 
chairman of the controlling independent broadcasting authority to 
postpone the thursday night broadcast until after an inquest into 
the march 6 shooting of the guerrillas who had been on a bombing 
mission in the british colony 
the foreign office said that the hourlong program death on 
the rock featured people due to testify at the inquest and 
complained that their accounts would influence the hearing 
but the broadcast authority said the material was unlikely to 
prejudice the inquest and that postponing the program would give 
the ira more oxygen of publicity 
the show was the result of a sevenweek investigation which 
included interviews with 150 residents of apartments overlooking 
the area where the guerrillas were shot according to thames tv 
the british commandos decision to shoot the guerrillas instead 
of trying to arrest them angered the irish government and was 
criticized by british opposition parties and amnesty international 
the londonbased human rights organization has begun its own 
inquiry 
howe has said that the guerrillas made suspicious movements 
before they were shot a foreign office spokesman who by custom 
was not identified said thursday that howe stood by that statement 
the governments request to postpone death on the rock 
touched off a noisy debate thursday in the house of commons 
conservative jerry hayes said he was opposed to tv companies 
raking through the gutters of gibraltar finding people to rubbish 
our security forces and was tired of people weeping tears for 
an active ira unit that was plotting a massacre 
but kevin mcnamara the opposition labor partys northern 
ireland spokesman said the government was trying to block an 
examination of its conduct and policies by hiding behind the 
theory of an inquest 
those three guerrillas were unarmed he said they 
should have been arrested they should have been charged 
the gibraltar killings triggered a fresh outbreak of violence in 
northern ireland in which nine people including two british 
soldiers died 
the mainly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province 
with the catholic republic of ireland

heavy export demand for wheat and corn and 
the virtual stagnation of the covered hopper fleet since 1982 
created a shortage of railroad grain cars to move farmers grain 
an agriculture department transportation official said thursday 
although car shortages appear to be easing somewhat in recent 
days steps need to be taken to avoid a repetition of the crunch 
that occurred earlier this year said martin fitzpatrick jr head 
of the departments office of transportation 
fitzpatrick released a study showing a severe disruption of 
grain shipments in the united states this year through midapril 
because of shortages of covered hopper cars used by railroads 
the study was requested by reps jim slattery dkan and 
virginia smith rneb fitzpatrick said he planned to cite the 
study further at a hearing monday in kansas city mo conducted by 
a house energy and commerce subcommittee 
fitzpatrick said the actual number of cars available for grain 
movement has been both shrinking and aging since 1982 when the last 
significant number was added to the nations railroad fleet 
there also has been a large surge in export wheat sales under 
the agriculture departments export enhancement program during the 
past few months big sales to the soviet union in particular have 
added to the railroad grain traffic 
under eep exporters can sell wheat or other designated 
commodities to an approved foreign country at reduced prices and 
then collect subsidies from usda in the form of governmentowned 
surplus grain or other agricultural products 
fitzpatrick told reporters there were many reasons for the 
problem and that usda policies regarding exports were not to blame 
he said the overwhelming reason for eep was to give us 
negotiators leverage in multinational trade talks under the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade and also to reduce us surpluses 
and to boost farm income 
those goals i think are ahead of the goal of keeping the 
railroad car supply adequate he said 
at another point fitzpatrick said of usda programs we 
believe we are not the problem in any way because we believe we 
are doing our job were pround of what weve done 
fitzpatrick said that because of shortages of covered hopper 
cars some local elevators were unable to take delivery of grain 
from farmers grain merchants had difficulty completing sales and 
railroads hiked rates and restricted use of their cars in certain 
markets 
also he said the departments commodity credit corp 
received limited response to its weekly auctions of surplus 
wheat because of the car shortages 
fitzpatrick was asked whether the rail car shortages had 
interfered with shipments of grain to seaports to the extent that 
ships were kept waiting on grain to load 
we do not believe that to be the case as a general rule he 
said but there may have been some specific circumstances when 
that happened in the last six months its not a trend it is not 
a significant problem down the road 
although reasons are not clear why the hopper car situation has 
improved the last 10 days fitzpatrick noted that export demand has 
slackened somewhat and delivery dates have eased also he said 
railroads had received overbookings for cars from grain companies 
and many of those now are being reconciled

the mother of harrison graham pleaded for 
the life of her son thursday telling the judge who will impose 
sentence that graham did not kill the seven women whose bodies were 
found in and near his apartment 
i dont think you should take his life said lillian graham 
jeter wiping tears from her eyes he didnt kill those people 
the real murderer is still out there im asking you to listen to 
your heart 
her testimony came during a hearing before common pleas judge 
robert latrone who will decide whether to sentence graham 28 an 
unemployed handyman to life imprisonment or death in the electric 
chair 
i dont want to appear heartless but i have determined his 
guilt latrone said referring to his verdict of guilty on 
wednesday to seven counts of first degree murder and seven counts 
of abuse of corpse i can well understand how you feel but we 
are considering what the punishment might be 
the hearing concluded at midafternoon the judge did not specify 
when he would rule 
latrone had found that the prosecution proved that graham killed 
seven women between january and august 1987 and kept their rotting 
remains locked in a room in a house he rented in north 
philadelphia rejecting an insanity defense latrone also found 
graham knew what he was doing when he confessed to strangling the 
women as he had sex with them 
the bodies were found after graham was evicted because of the 
stench coming from his apartment 
assistant district attorney roger king said death was the only 
punishment justifed for such sadistic murders 
rose harriell mother of one of the victims barbara mahoney 
said i believe he should die i believe he should have a hard 
death nothing can bring back my daughter and i am angry about 
that but i would be angrier yet if he just sits in jail and gets 
fatter and fatter 
before thursdays sentencing hearing began the judge told 
graham he could have a jury of 12 persons decide his fate graham 
waived that right on the advice of his lawyer joel muldovsky 
graham had also waived a jury trial but under state law retained 
the right to have a jury decide the sentence 
latrone asked graham several times whether he understood the 
right he was giving up and each time graham said he knew what he 
was doing 
i want you to decide the sentence graham said 
muldovsky proceeded to call witnesses to keep his client from 
frying in the electric chair he doesnt deserve that 
youre talking about a creature of habit who went back and 
back and back king argued referring to what he called the 
arrogant series of sex stranglings 
said camelia deshazor parker mother of another of the victims 
said he deserves everything he gets 
the first defense witness was pauline williams who was grahams 
foster mother for five years 
marty is a child in a mans body she said marty is 
retarded he was never raised to hate he was raised to be 
obedient marty is alive i want him to stay alive

jesse jackson charged thursday that democratic presidential 
frontrunner michael dukakis had tried to manage reaganomics 
rather than reverse it dukakis called on president reagan to put 
partisan politics aside and drop plans to veto trade legislation 
all was quiet on the republican front where vice president 
george bush gained a mathematical lock on his nomination with the 
delegates earned in tuesdays pennsylvania primary the vice 
president was in washington with his next campaign trip set for 
friday to indiana 
massachusetts gov dukakis spent most of the day in his 
statehouse office in boston where he met with spanish president 
felipe gonzalez marques while his campaign organization welcomed a 
trickle of additional delegates to the fold 
the converts included two delegates formerly backing sen albert 
gore jr of tennessee and one supporter of sen paul simon of 
illinois both men have suspended their campaigns but have said 
they intend to hold onto their delegates until the party convention 
dukakis leads jackson by more than 400 delegates in the 
associated press count and holds more than 1250 of the 2081 
needed to win the nomination aides say they hope he will command a 
nominating majority by the time the primary season ends on june 7 
dukakis released a letter he sent to reagan urging him to sign 
the trade bill which contains a provision requiring a 60day 
notice to workers before a factory can be shut down 
mr president i believe that our record trade deficit 
requires that we put partisan politics aside and take action that 
will be in the best interest of all americans he wrote 
later in a statehouse news conference dukakis said he would 
make the trade bill an issue in his campaign against bush 
i think the issues of workers being laid off what is 
happening to the industrial base of this country and the failure 
of this administration to do much to deal with that and what a new 
president would do to work hard with business and labor and 
community leaders to restore our competitive edge and rebuild our 
industrial base will be very much one of the major issues he 
told reporters before leaving for a campaign trip to ohio and 
indiana 
bush has expressed support for reagans decision to veto the 
bill 
jackson campaigned across ohio which holds its primary next 
week and vowed to remain in the race 
his rhetoric held a slightly sharper antidukakis edge than 
before the pennsylvania primary which jackson lost in a landslide 
i dont want to manage reaganomics as dukakis does or keep 
reaganomics as bush does he told an audience in steubenville 
ohio i want to reverse reaganomics and reinvest in america 
jackson also fended off suggestions from his own campaign 
manager than he has given up on gaining the nomination in view of 
dukakis string of primary victories in connecticut wisconsin new 
york and pennsylvania in the past month 
we intend to come out of california and new jersey on the 
final day of the primary season in search of a management team and 
a running mate jackson said that is authoritative fresh 
clear without fear of contradiction 
he said any suggestions otherwise do not represent the spirit 
of the campaign although he said campaign chief gerald austin 
had been an effective manager who would stay on the job 
austin was quoted in published reports as saying of jackson i 
think he thinks winning isnt just winning primaries its winning 
delegates and getting votes 
dukakis a year after entering the democratic race marveled 
that he was the frontrunner 
the remarkable thing is that the two leading candidates for 
the democratic nomination are a firstgeneration american from 
massachusetts and a black guy who grew up poor in south carolina 
he said that i think says an enormous amount for this 
political system of ours 
in other developments 
jackson drew praise from atlanta mayor andrew young at a 
meeting of black public administrators in fort worth he said 
jacksons strong candidacy has performed a psychological 
miracle for minorities seeking a leader but he added it 
really doesnt help at all if hes not elected president its not 
just a matter of feeling good jesse ran to see some good done for 
poor people and black people 
campaign officials for former television evangelist pat 
robertson who has ceased active campaigning in the republican 
race were given an additional two weeks to provide the internal 
revenue service with financial records the irs is conducting a 
probe of the taxexempt status of robertsons religious 
broadcasting network 
final results from the vermont democratic caucuses last week 
showed jackson edged out dukakis with the support of 46 percent of 
caucusgoers to 45 percent for his rival if the division held it 
would translate into eight national convention delegates for 
jackson and six for dukakis

the united states must give highest priority 
to curbing demand for illicit drugs from latin america if it 
expects to win the war against narcotics smuggling a hemispheric 
committee said thursday 
in a report the group said efforts to curb trafficking through 
eradication and interdiction have failed and that the united states 
should refocus its attention to educating potential users to the 
dangers of drug addiction 
the report was prepared by the interamerican dialogue a 
nonpartisan group of 62 noted citizens from the united states 
latin america and canada 
as long as the profit margin for cocaine is 12000 percent 
from production cost to street value the lure of trafficking will 
be irresistible the panel said in the 50page report which 
covered a variety of hemispheric issues primary attention must 
shift to demand 
the commission is chaired by sol m linowitz a former us 
ambassador to the organization of american states and daniel 
oduber a former president of costa rica other members include two 
other former latin american presidents and more than a dozen former 
cabinet members from the united states and latin america 
the report said efforts to reduce the supply of drugs from latin 
america to the united states are bound to be inadequate and the 
high profit margin for drug smuggling will buy all the protection 
the drug lords need 
the reagan administration initially concentrated its efforts on 
stopping drug smuggling at its source but recently has said more 
attention must be given to reducing demand 
on thursday reagan directed his national drug policy board to 
provide recommendations within 30 days on how to increase the 
federal effort against drug suppliers and users said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
we dont have much time the president was quoted as telling 
agency heads who took part in the meeting but i want to do all i 
can to expand the drug fight 
fitzwaters statement said reagan was briefed by board members 
on the status of existing efforts to interdict drugs coming into 
this country and to reduce the demand for drugs within the 
country 
the president was told that our nation must be intolerant of 
drug users that half the murders in the district of columbia are 
drugrelated that gangs in many cities are being financed through 
drugs and that the government needs to be as tough as the law and 
the constitution will allow in fighting drug use it said 
the statement said the board outlined the extensive 
interdiction effort now under way along united states borders using 
united states military and other civilian assets 
it also said that dr ian mcdonald the presidents special 
adviser on drug abuse policy told reagan there are nearly 23 
million drug users in this country 
reagan said in a speech last february as significant as 
stopping smugglers and pushers is ending the demand for drugs is 
how in the end well win 
the report also recommended that the united states help other 
countries design and implement their own drugcontrol policies 
rather than apply pressure and threaten sanctions if these 
countries do not adopt us prescriptions 
under law the administration is required to impose economic 
sanctions against countries which do not cooperate in curbing drug 
flows into the united states 
this year reagan found that syria iran afghanistan and 
pakistan were not offering such cooperation but no sanctions were 
applied because none is a us aid recipient 
many members of congress are clamoring for sanctions against 
other countries and on wednesday the house foreign affairs 
committee voted in favor of taking such action against bolivia 
peru and paraguay 
discussing central america the report said governments and 
insurgent movements in the region should strive to convert their 
military strife into peaceful competition 
nicaragua el salvador and guatemala must convince guerrilla 
forces in their countries that laying down their arms will open the 
way for full participation in national affairs the report said 
it also criticized the united states for not working in concert 
with other latin american countries to arrange a settlement in 
panama 
unilateral us economic sanctions and other pressures against 
panama have hindered efforts by latin american and european leaders 
to promote a negotiated end to panamas crisis and mobilized 
widespread latin american resentment to us policy the report 
said

a deputy us marshals family reunion two 
years ago led to a break in a 1980 murder case and an indictment 
this week against his own brother and a nephew 
investigators had worked for years with little progress in 
solving the slayings of four elderly people during an apparent 
robbery 
then in 1986 the deputy marshal olbert hiett attended a 
family reunion and took a sawedoff shotgun an illegal weapon 
from his brother charles hiett 51 
later that year jerry hiett a nephew of the hiett brothers 
was arrested on charges of starting a fire in talladega national 
forest and a 38caliber pistol was taken from him district 
attorney robert field said 
olbert hiett then realized that the two guns matched 
descriptions of weapons used in the 1980 slayings of three brothers 
and a sister james columbus roberts 79 mack roberts 73 mae 
bell roberts 77 and floy roberts 63 two were bedridden when 
shot to death in the rural mars hill community 
field said that ballistics tests run on the guns in 1986 
confirmed olbert hietts suspicion that the weapons were used in 
the slayings 
charles hiett was arrested tuesday on charges of hindering 
prosecution and possession of a sawedoff shotgun other than the 
one seized at the reunion and jerry hiett 39 was arrested on 
perjury charges said cleburn county sheriff jack norton anthony 
bell 29 was arrested wednesday on perjury charges 
the three men were being held in the county jail on 100000 
bail each 
the indictment returned by a county grand jury accused charles 
hiett of interfering with the murder investigation by altering the 
second shotgun to make it appear that it was used in the slaying 
charles hiett gave criminal assistance to bill hiett and jerry 
hiett by intentionally hindering the apprehension prosecution 
conviction or punishment of bill hiett and jerry hiett for conduct 
constituting a murder 
however neither bill nor jerry hiett has been charged with 
murder bill hietts relationship to jerry and charles was not 
immediately known 
the grand jury listened to evidence that was surrounding the 
mars hill case norton said thursday three people were 
indicted im not going to say that the people who are in my 
jail are not suspects and im not going to say they are 
im just going to say they are people who the grand jury saw 
fit to indict on those charges 
he declined to comment on why the indictments were not returned 
sooner 
field said the grand jury will reconvene may 31 and more 
indictments might be returned 
bill hiett was convicted earlier and sentenced to 20 years in 
prison for possessing an illegal weapon the sawedoff shotgun 
charles hiett is alleged to have altered he is free on bail while 
he appeals 
without olbert hiett there would be no case us marshall 
thomas green said its an unusual story 
olbert hietts niece teresa loveless said she is not angry at 
him although his efforts put her father in jail 
this isnt a vengeance thing she said they didnt have 
any falling out or anything like that my uncle is a lawman and he 
is just doing his job my father is just telling the truth thats 
all there is to it 
mrs loveless said her father is not guilty of anything all 
he has done is tell the truth my daddy has nothing to hide so 
whether it is to his brother or to the sheriff or anyone else he 
will say the same thing to them 
police have said they believe the motive was 1500 in cash kept 
in a trunk which was stolen and recovered two years later in woods 
three miles from the roberts house 
verlin roberts who discovered the bodies of her brothers and 
sister said she was pleased to hear of apparent progress in the 
investigation 
im kind of surprised she said i had waited so long and 
hadnt heard anything i thought maybe it wouldnt ever be solved

a poor junk dealer who taught himself 
to paint churned out 2500 copies of masterpieces and sold them for 
a pittance to an art ring which netted up to 23 million by 
reselling them as originals police said thursday 
the fake picassos and other paintings were sold throughout the 
country during a 13year period in one of europes biggest art 
scandals prosecutors said at least two of the pictures hang in 
museums 
artist edgar mrugalla 49 sold nearly all of them for 
relatively low prices to art dealerships in dusseldorf and 
wiesbaden police said 
picasso himself would have been proud of his work said 
wolfgang engelen the police officer in charge of the 
investigation we were told repeatedly by art experts that he 
is a genius 
this case is unique he added i have never seen anything 
like it 
the dealers sold mrugallas works at huge markups and kept the 
money netting between 17 million and 23 million police said 
mrugalla was living in poverty when he began cooperating with 
police earlier this month they said 
one of mrugallas fakes is hanging in a west berlin museum and 
another is in a small museum in northern west germany engelen 
said the rest are in the collections of private dealers or art and 
auction houses 
engelen said mrugalla copied from the works of more than 50 
artists including pablo picasso germans george grosz and max 
beckmann and austrian oskar kokoschka 
police said the fakeart ring that marketed mrugallas works 
was believed to include about 25 people 
engelen said one of the ringleaders was in jail but he declined 
to say how many other arrests have been made 
he said mrugalla rarely attempted to sell any of his fake art 
works himself but passed them along to the duesseldorf and 
wiesbaden dealers 
it was not immediately known whether mrugalla was aware of the 
prices his works were commanding 
he is free on his own recognizance but could face charges of 
forgery and fraud 
mrugalla never had formal art training the masscirculation

the special inspection of eastern and 
continental airlines has uncovered no grossly unsafe conditions 
so far although planes were ordered out of service briefly because 
of safety infractions about 5 percent of the time officials said 
thursday 
the federal aviation administration began its planebyplane 
ramp inspections april 13 and so far has made more than 2000 
inspections at the two airlines faa administrator allan mcartor 
told reporters he said inspections would continue through midmay 
both airlines are owned by texas air corp the countrys 
largest airline company which also is under a special review by 
the federal government 
transportation secretary jim burnley said the separate 
inspection into the management and financial practices of texas air 
by his department is half completed and everything is going very 
well burnley did not elaborate on any of the findings so far 
burnley and mcartor met with reporters to announce a series of 
organizational changes at the faa aimed primarily at centralizing 
more authority in the agencys washington headquarters over its 
various regional offices 
but many of the questions turned to the faa and department 
probes of texas air and its two airline subsidiaries 
mcartor said there have been about 1000 ramp inspections of 
aircraft at eastern and about the same number at continental so far 
with many of the aircraft inspected more than once at various 
airports the two airlines together have about 580 planes 
he said roughly 7 to 8 percent of the inspections at eastern 
and 3 percent of the inspections at continental have resulted in 
aircraft being taken out of service although in some of the cases 
the corrections were made quickly and flights were not delayed 
these are not unusual percentages said mcartor adding that 
they likely would be what we would find at other airlines 
undergoing a similarly intense series of ramp examinations in some 
cases he said continental corrected problems before they came to 
the attention of faa inspectors he said 
so far we have not found anything we would consider to be 
grossly unsafe on any aircraft mcartor said he described the 
problems found by inspectors as minor and said they ranged from 
dents and small tears in the aircraft skin to minor leaks and 
hydraulic gauges not being fully charged 
but mcartor said that while such problems individually may not 
cause a plane to be unsafe he was concerned about them in the 
aggregate if not corrected 
were dealing with the margin of safety here mcartor said 
adding that if such problems are not corrected that margin could 
erode 
burnley and mcartor ordered the special review of eastern 
aircraft on april 13 after the faa became concerned of continuing 
safety violations at the miamibased airline eastern also was 
assessed with a proposed 823000 fine because of earlier 
violations 
four days later burnley ordered the ramp inspections expanded 
to include the houstonbased continental as well saying that the 
faa is considering leveling about 1 million in civil penalties 
against that airline the faa has not provided details on what kind 
of problems were found that would lead to such penalties

one way to improve global farm policy would be 
to unhook or decouple government subsidies from specific levels 
of food production a report by the national center for food and 
agricultural policy said thursday 
the policy of decoupling would lead to more efficient 
production of agricultural goods and lower production costs when 
compared to current farm policies the report said 
some form of decoupling for american farmers has been advocated 
unsuccessfully in congress for several years one example would be 
to sign up farmers in a crop program and provide benefits without 
tying them to specific acreage or production levels 
as defined by the center a part of the independent washington 
think tank resources for the future decoupling would mean 
providing government support to farmers in ways that do not 
distort production prices consumption resource allocation or 
trade 
multilateral decoupling would also eliminated worldwide trade 
distortions and give the united states advantages on those 
agricultural products now having a competitive edge the group 
said 
even unilateral decoupling was said to offer positive effects 
including increased general economic efficiency lower production 
costs greater competitiveness in international markets and 
improved environmental quality 
consumers would also gain as prices dropped the report 
said however those sectors currently receiving the highest 
levels of government support those primarily in sugar dairy 
rice and wool would decline in size 
the report added livestock and feed grain sectors on the 
other hand would be least affected by decoupling because of their 
already favorable competitive position in world markets the 
effects on government and taxpayers remain uncertain depending on 
the magnitude of the transition payments made to disadvantaged 
farmers 
decoupling doesnt set well with some farm groups the national 
farmers union for example says it is tantamount to putting 
farmers on welfare by substituting direct federal payments for 
price supports 
a statement issued by nfu at its recent annual convention said 
farmers want federal program payments to help recover their cost 
of producing food these payments are actually subsidies to 
consumers that pass through the hands of farmers

three congressmen said thursday they are 
striving to block federal highway money for a shopping center to be 
built adjacent to a major civil war battlefield in northern 
virginia 
rep robert mrazek dny has introduced language into a 
supplemental appropriations bill that would prohibit federal 
highway money from being used for road improvements near the 
manassas national battlefield park 30 miles west of washington 
developers plan to build a 12 million squarefoot shopping mall 
adjacent to the battlefield 
mrazek and other selfproclaimed civil war buffs in congress 
said the project will violate the sanctity of the battlefield 
the battlefield that helped shape the america we know today 
should not be the sight of a taco bell or a mattressland said 
mrazek we should not be building on top of a lot of union and 
confederate soldiers who still lie today where they fell in 
battle 
the battlefield is where two significant civil war clashes were 
fought known in the north as the battles of bull run and called 
the battles of manassas in the south 
the first battle fought on july 21 1861 was the initial major 
confrontation of the civil war and a surprising confederate 
victory helped convince union officials that the war would be a 
prolonged effort 
the second battle a bloody affair aug 2930 1862 that saw 
24000 casualties was a costly victory for confederate forces 
union forces that had been as far south as richmond two months 
earlier were driven back into the nations capital 
supporters of the development plan claim that the project will 
not violate the battlefield but mrazek and rep mike andrews 
dtexas said the project will be built on the spot where 
confederate gen robert e lee had his headquarters for the second 
battle 
mrazeks amendment passed by the house appropriations 
transportation subcommittee would block use of federal money for 
highway projects needed to improve access to the rural battleground 
rep bruce vento dminn said mrazeks plan is a stopgap 
measure intended to allow the interior department to use money from 
a special fund to purchase and protect the 600acre land parcel 
the congress is certainly acting in the national interest so 
that this hallowed land can be saved said vento who chairs an 
interior and insular affairs panel that deals with national 
parklands this is an awkward but necessary move

canadian prime minister brian mulroney said 
thursday he won assurances from congressional leaders that they 
will not derail uscanada free trade legislation out of pique 
with president reagans plan to veto the omnibus trade bill 
mulroney ending two days of meetings with administration and 
capitol hill leaders told reporters i am leaving with the 
assurance that congressional consideration will proceed on schedule 
despite the uncertaintly surrounding the omnibus trade bill 
the schedule calls for congress to put enabling legislation for 
the uscanada free trade agreement on a fast track as soon as 
the administration sends the bill to congress sometime after june 
1 
the agreement hailed by mulroney and reagan as historic 
provides for eventual elimination of tariffs and other steps to 
stimulate what is already the worlds highestvolume bilateral 
trading relationship 
the pact is separate from the overall trade bill adopted 
wednesday but there have been muted threats on capitol hill that 
implementation of the uscanada pact eagerly sought by reagan 
might be slowed as a protest over his planned veto of the trade 
bill 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva and sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee have 
said they would not hold the canadian accord hostage and these 
assurances were given to mulroney in meetings on thursday the 
canadian leader said 
in those discussions and in his second meeting with reagan in 
as many days mulroney reasserted his plea that the united states 
set specific timetables and targets for the reduction of acid rain 
which carries pollution and kills lakes and forests 
i told the president what i told the leadership of the senate 
and the house that a treaty on acid rain between canada and the 
united states is inevitable just as surely as summer follows 
spring he said 
the reagan administration says more scientific investigation is 
needed before it makes a commitment to specific cleanup goals 
mulroney said he and reagan decided that secretary of state 
george p shultz and canadian external affairs minister joe clark 
would give priority to discussions of an eightpoint canadian 
plan for narrowing the differences but he acknowledged the plan 
contains the provisions already rejected by the administration 
still he asserted that by airing the problem in washington he 
had advanced canadas cause on the issue and he reacted testily to 
a news conference questioners suggestion he was returning to 
ottawa emptyhanded 
look it were looking at a very complex matter he said 
were moving it forward well see what happens what do you do 
do you declare war interrupt relationships or do you actively 
work as ive been doing to persuade americans of the value and 
legitimacy of the canadian position 
we were nowhere in 1980 and in 1984 and were slowly but 
surely trying to move it along he said 
mulroney also confirmed reports from the united nations earlier 
this week that canada would contribute personnel to a multinational 
un team that will observe the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan 
under the plan canada would provide about a halfdozen of the 
50member contingent which would observe soviet compliance with 
its pledge to pull its estimated 115000 troops from afghanistan by 
early next year 
mulroney said the decision to contribute was in keeping with a 
traditional canadian commitment to un peacekeeping operations 
the prime minister used his news conference to take a dig or two 
at his political opponents at home 
asked if reagan had expressed reservations about us 
willingness to let canada buy submarines containing closely held 
us nuclear propulsion plants if the socialist new democratic 
party gains power in the next election mulroney said we dealt 
with realistic matters

an opposition leader accused the 
united states thursday of imprudent and inconsiderate 
statements that interfere with south korean politics 
prosecutors meanwhile arrested the former mayor of seoul on 
graft charges in the continuing investigation of alleged corruption 
under the administration of former president chun doohwan 
about 1500 students hurled firebombs during a demonstration 
against the government and the economic aggression of the 
united states in demanding freer markets for us goods in south 
korea 
kim daejung leader of the main opposition party told a news 
conference the united states had supported the government of 
president roh taewoo who succeeded chun in february because of 
selfish interests 
he said the united states interfered in south korean politics by 
receiving roh on a visit shortly before the december presidential 
election expressing confidence that the election would be fair and 
issuing a favorable report on south koreas performance on human 
rights 
this is an imprudent and inconsiderate position he said 
roh won the presidency with 366 percent of the vote opposition 
support was split between kim and his rival kim youngsam 
former mayor yum bohyun of seoul appointed by chun was 
charged with peddling influence and taking bribes prosecutors said 
a construction company offered yum 160000 and the former 
presidents younger brother chun kyunghwan 270000 in 1985 when 
seeking a contract to build city parks 
chuns brother was charged march 31 with embezzling millions of 
dollars 
the corruption probe has been seen as part of rohs effort to 
distance himself from the authoritarian chun government which was 
the target of huge public protests last summer 
south koreas three main opposition parties which defeated the 
government democratic justice party in elections tuesday and won a 
majority in the national assembly accuse the rohs administration 
of exposing only part of the alleged corruption 
they want the investigation expanded the constitution that took 
effect in february gives the national assembly investigative powers 
the three parties have ruled out a merger but are considering 
ways to coordinate tactics in the assembly 
kim jongpil head of the new democratic republican party has 
proposed a liaison office kim daejung who leads the party for 
peace and democracy and kim youngsam of the reunification 
democratic party said they would consider it 
of the 299 national assembly seats kim daejungs party has 71 
the followers of kim youngsam 59 and kim jongpil a former 
conservative prime minister 35 the government party has 125 
seats the other nine seats are held by smaller parties 
in the student demonstration at seoul national university 
protesters shouted yankee go home and demanded that the united 
states end its pressure on south korea for trade concessions 
they also demanded removal of nuclear weapons they claim the 
united states is storing in south korea the pentagon will not 
comment on whether it keeps nuclear weapons in this country 
students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police shouting 
overthrow the dictatorship which permits us economic 
aggression police responded with tear gas no injuries or 
arrests were reported

new opposition developed thursday on capitol 
hill to sending coast guard boats to the persian gulf while the 
coast guard commandant defended the proposal by saying it wouldnt 
hurt antidrug efforts at home 
rep mike lowry dwash introduced a measure in the house that 
would ban use of the coast guard in the gulf 
the reagan administration should use the coast guards scarce 
resources to fight the war on drugs not the iraniran war lowry 
said 
sen brock adams dwash told his colleagues it would be a 
mistake to send lightly armed coast guard vessels into the wartorn 
gulf 
lowrys proposal will be considered next week as an amendment to 
a bill authorizing the pentagon budget for the fiscal year starting 
oct 1 
rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed services 
committee said the restriction will win in a breeze its no 
contest 
the rising public fear about the nations drug problems means 
the restriction will win aspin explained taking the boats off 
drug duty and putting them into the gulf wont be popular with the 
public he said 
the pentagon is considering sending six coast guard boats to 
help navy warships patrol the gulf the coast guard vessels are 
designed for shallow waters and navy officials say they could be 
effective in the shallow gulf 
the navy is escorting 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers raising 
fears in congress that the united states might be drawn into the 
iraniraq war since kuwaiti is an iraqi ally 
there have been several clashes between the navy and iran the 
most recent occurring april 18 when navy ships and planes sank or 
damaged six iranian vessels 
adm paul a yost coast guard commandant told a senate 
subcommittee that he would be delighted to send the ships to 
the gulf and said the move would have only a minimal impact on 
antidrug efforts 
the boats are 110foot island class vessels designed to 
operate in waters off florida and the caribbean on antidrug 
patrols the coast guard is buying 35 of the vessels of which 17 
have een delivered 
the boats have a top speed of more than 26 knots but their 
heaviest weapons are machine guns pentagon officials had 
considered sending the boats to the gulf last fall but declined 
because they are so lightly armed 
yost told the appropriations transportation subcommittee the 
boats would be replaced on antidrug patrols by other coast guard 
vessels and by some navy ships 
but earlier yost had been questioned about antidrug efforts 
and admitted you can always use more money and boats 
sen mark hatfield rore it seems to me were going to hurt 
our drug efforts by sending the boats to the gulf 
sen alfonse damato rny was even more critical i think 
its an incredible policy he told yost we kind of bumbled our 
way into this 
the coast guard is facing severe budget problems yost told the 
subcommittee including a 100 million shortfall in the current 
fiscal year more than 30 stations or facilities have been closed 
and antidrug patrols have been cut by 55 percent 
administratively the coast guard is part of the transportation 
department but it also has national security responsibilities and 
the navy has offered to pay the cost of sending the vessels to the 
persian gulf yost said 
yost defended the plan this is not an idea off the top of 
somebodys head it was well thought out and researched he said 
but lowry saw it differently sending the coast guard to the 
gulf would be just another tragic dangerous and poorly conceived 
move by the administration

cbs said thursday it is postponing its fall 
television season by almost two months and possibly longer 
because of a scriptwriters strike and the possibility of a second 
strike this summer by craft workers 
network officials declined to comment thursday beyond the 
release of a brief statement sent from thomas f leahy president 
of the cbs television network to cbsaffiliated stations 
the network ranked third in the nielsen ratings this season for 
the first time in its history had planned to begin its new fall 
programming sept 5 however it wont begin now until the end of 
october at the earliest 
the other two networks have not yet announced details on when 
their fall seasons would begin the schedule at no 1 nbc will 
include the summer olympics beginning sept 16 and the world 
series in late october 
although the strike had stopped production of 22 lateseason 
episodes of television series at the three networks the cbs 
postponement was the first real blow to the entertainment industry 
by the 8weekold job action 
weve been predicting that cbs stood first in line to feel the 
impact of the strike because of their early start date said 
cheryl rhoden spokeswoman for the writers guild of america this 
is a good example of why the producers should return to the table 
the 9000member guild went on strike march 7 and no new 
negotiations have been set the contract dispute has focused 
largely on residual payments for movies and tv programs shown 
overseas and on residuals for hourlong tv shows sold into 
syndication 
herb steinberg spokesman for the alliance of motion picture and 
television producers the studio bargaining unit said cbs 
decision will result in an economic loss for the writers the 
bottom line is that we would like very much for the town to go back 
to work 
in his message sent to cbs stations wednesday night leahy said 
that cbs broadcast group president gene jankowski stated that 
given the continuing strike by the writers guild of america and 
the uncertainty over the iatseteamsters negotiations in the film 
industry this summer the previously announced sept 5 start date 
for the 198889 season is no longer feasible 
we are looking forward to a new season start date at the end 
of october 1988 the message said further details and an exact 
start date will be forthcoming 
the contract of the international alliance of theatrical and 
stage employees which represents about 25000 hollywood 
behindthecamera production workers expires expires july 31 said 
iatse spokesman mac st johns 
but st johns said we are certainly not going to take the 
blame for them delaying the start of their season i suppose 
theres always uncertainty when you go into negotiations but no 
more so now that in the past 100 years 
our president al ditolla has made it crystal clear that he 
is not going into these negotiations with the idea of going on 
strike 
a writers guild strike also delayed the 198182 season for 
several weeks the year before a strike by movie and television 
actors in 1980 delayed the opening of that years television season 
for all three networks 
brandon stoddard president of abc entertainment said last week 
that he did not know when the abc fall season would begin although 
the lineup was set to be announced on may 23 
at nbc spokesman jay michelis said thursday our schedule is 
ok so far but it will all depend on how long the strike lasts we 
will announce our fall schedule on may 18 
brandon tartikoff president of nbc has said that for all 
intents and purposes nbc would not begin its fall schedule until 
after the world series

the reagan administration will try through 
legislation to cut off millions of dollars in federal aid to cities 
with rent control but a new york congressman said thursday the 
plan is sure to be defeated 
rep charles schumer dny released a letter from samuel r 
pierce jr secretary of housing and urban development which said 
the administration would propose legislation for fiscal 1989 to 
restrict rental rehabilitation grants to areas without rent control 
laws 
the restriction cannot go into effect until legislation has 
been adopted by congress and signed by the president pierce 
wrote 
originally the office of management and budget had suggested 
making the change through federal regulation but hud spokesman 
jack flynn said his department has always maintained that it 
would require legislation to change the grant program 
the letter is a carefully worded admission of defeat 
schumer said thursday of pierces comments administration 
officials first tried to impose their callous plan through 
regulation because they knew legislation to interfere with local 
housing laws would stand no chance in congress once they saw that 
congress would not let their regulation go into effect they backed 
off 
in january budget documents prepared by omb detailed a plan to 
enact a federal regulation that would cut aid to cities with rent 
control laws the government distributes 200 million annually in 
such funds which are used for major repairs to correct violations 
of building codes 
more than 200 cities including new york boston washington 
los angeles and san francisco have some form of rent control 
schumer estimated that new york would lose 20 million under the 
administrations plan

the house clamped another arms control 
restriction on the white house by voting 214186 on thursday to ban 
all but the smallest tests of us nuclear weapons 
the vote was the third time in two days the 
democraticcontrolled chamber approved arms control restrictions 
opposed by president reagan 
earlier in the day the chamber rejected a proposal to ban all 
finalstage tests of an antisatellite weapon but the air force 
says it already has dropped development of the weapon because of 
earlier congressional restrictions 
the decisions came as the house worked on a bill authorizing the 
pentagon budget for the fiscal year which begins oct 1 
all three arms control votes were essentially repeats of 
restrictions added by the house last year to its pentagon budget 
bill 
meanwhile the senate armed services committee finished work 
thursday on its version of a pentagon budget bill even though that 
panel also is controlled by democrats the administrations defense 
program fared better in the committee than it did in the house 
armed services committee 
for example the only arms control restriction the senate panel 
approved was a ban on any tests of reagans star wars system that 
would violate the narrow interpretation of the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
the house and senate bills both authorize 2995 billion in 
pentagon spending for the next fiscal year a figure set by last 
decembers budget summit between reagan and congress designed to 
reduce federal deficits 
differences between the two measures will have to be reconciled 
later by a housesenate conference committee 
in votes thursday the house 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
decided on the 214186 decision that went generally along 
party lines to ban all underground nuclear tests of weapons larger 
than one kiloton the decision came after the house passed 3990 
a republicanbacked amendment praising reagans effort to negotiate 
limits on testing 
the ban was voted last year by the house but was dropped by the 
housesenate conference committee and ended up as only an advisory 
request 
rep william broomfield rmich told the house the ban would 
totally undercut our negotiators a reference to the ongoing 
ussoviet talks aimed at a comprehensive ban on all nuclear tests 
but rep richard gephardt dmo said we owe it to our 
children to vigorously pursue a total ban on all atomic tests 
openair atomic tests are banned by a 1963 treaty but that pact 
allows underground tests 
rejected 205197 the antisatellite ban proposed for a fourth 
year by rep george brown dcalif but the panel also turned down 
212195 a proposal to spend 100 million for development of a 
groundbased antisatellite weapon 
the restriction had been imposed by congress the past three 
years and the pentagon responded by dropping work on the program to 
develop an asat weapon fired from a highflying f15 jet 
instead the air force is working on different types of asats 
particularly those using groundbased lasers 
earlier in the week the house had voted to ban any star wars 
tests that would violate the narrow interpretation of the abm pact 
it also voted to require continued compliance with numerical limits 
in the unratified 1979 salt ii pact 
the only restriction we added was the abm intepretation 
language said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the panel 
the senate panel recommended 46 billion for the strategic 
defense initiative as star wars is formally known the bill on the 
house floor provides 4 billion although next weeks scheduled 
debate over sdi could mean changes in that total 
currently sdi receives 39 billion and reagan had sought 48 
billion for the next fiscal year 
the senate measure also includes a proposal creating a pentagon 
commission which would determine unneeded military bases that could 
be closed no similar proposal is part of the house bill 
the senate bill also approved reagans request for a 43 percent 
pay hike for americas 21 million uniformed military personnel 
the house measure proposes a 4 percent increase

a hong kongchinese committee on thursday 
unveiled a proposed constitution for hong kong that guarantees that 
china will not impose socialism for a 50year period but contains 
measures that could limit freedoms 
the draft of the basic law promises freedom of speech press 
assembly and religion however it says those rights may be 
restricted in the thriving capitalist city when necessary to 
maintain national security public order public health and morals 
another measure gives chinas communist partycontrolled 
legislature the national peoples congress final power to 
interpret and amend the basic law 
under a 1984 pact hong kong will revert to chinese sovereignty 
in 1997 when britains 99year lease on the bulk of the territory 
expires 
hong kong delegate martin lee who believes the draft violates 
the spirit of the 1984 chinesebritish agreement promising hong 
kong substantial autonomy said the matter is in the hands of the 
hong kong people 
if it becomes clear to everybody that the people of hong kong 
want to have the democratic option and not an undemocratic one then 
its a political factor china has to take into account i hope they 
will he said 
if we dont speak with one voice then we are doomed to have an 
undemocratic system he said 
copies of the 59page draft in chinese and in english were to be 
made available to hong kongs 57 million residents beginning 
friday at banks subway stations and other public places 
sir david wilson hong kongs britishappointed governor urged 
residents to study the document very carefully 
the draft outlines procedures for establishing a semiautonomous 
system to govern the enclave as a special administrative region 
under chinas one country two systems policy which permits 
capitalism for 50 years hong kong would have its own tax system 
courts education system and social welfare organizations 
hong kong residents have five months to comment on the proposed 
constitution before the 58member draft committee resumes 
deliberations a 177member basic law consultative committee 
comprised of local civic leaders approved by china will compile 
the opinions 
the consultative committee said it will also consider public 
opinion poll results but does not plan to conduct its own surveys 
said vice chairman lo takshing 
the consultative committee plans to hold seminars and some 
chinese officials are scheduled to visit hong kong in june and 
september to talk to residents about the proposed basic law 
a final version is expected to be approved in 1990 by chinas 
peoples congress 
the draft committee made up of 33 members from china and 25 
from hong kong debated the draft for 2 years 
as a whole it the draft is not really a bad job although if 
we had more time it could be better ssaid liu yiuchu a hong 
kong lawyer and member of the draft committee 
i made reservations about certain things that have not been 
made clear in the draft she said including the relationship 
between hong kongs courts and those on the mainland 
the panel was unable to agree on several clauses 
instead it issued multiple proposals on some issues including 
the selection of hong kongs post1997 government the draft 
contains four alternate forumulas for electing a legislature 
hong kong made up of several islands and a strip of land along 
chinas southeastern coast has been ruled by britain since queen 
victorias navy wrenched it from declining imperial china in 1842 
most hong kong residents are ethnic chinese and many fled china 
after the 1949 communist takeover thousands have emigrated since 
1984 because of fear of communist rule and many more say they may 
do so depending on how the basic law is worded

sinhalese extremists killed at least 
two people and set fire to a railway station as part of their 
campaign to disrupt provincial elections on thursday police said 
voting was held for four of the nine provincial councils 
thirteen political parties boycotted the vote saying general 
elections should precede regional voting 
more than 15000 police were deployed in the four provinces 
where 28 million voters were eligible to select 155 council 
representatives the elections will help form autonomous regional 
councils for the first time in sri lankas history 
when voting ended at 4 pm 630 am edt turnout was 
estimated at only 45 percent an election official said 
the peoples liberation front an underground ultranationalist 
sinhalese organization opposed the elections because they were 
designed to give greater autonomy to the minority tamils 
tamil guerrillas have fought since 1983 for an independent 
homeland in the north and east the front says a peace accord 
signed in july 1987 makes too many concessions to the tamils who 
form 18 percent of the countrys 16 million population and who 
complain of discrimination 
the sinhalese community comprises 75 percent of the population 
the accord was signed by sri lanka and india which has a large 
tamil population in its southern region and is helping disarm the 
rebels 
police officers speaking on condition of anonymity said 
members of the front set a railway station on fire at nagolagama 
50 miles northeast of colombo

and killed by two men on a motorcycle police said a voter was 
killed at wellawaya 110 miles southeast of colombo

peoples liberation front which the government accused of trying 
to kill president junius r jayewardene last august

northcentral province and the uva and sabaragamuwa districts in 
the south

the senate on thursday night virtually killed 
any chance that congress would vote to extend the may 4 deadline 
for illegal aliens to apply for amnesty 
the action came on a procedural vote to shut off debate by those 
who oppose extending the amnesty to nov 30 only 40 senators voted 
to shut off the debate and 60 votes are needed to do so fiftysix 
senators voted against shutting off debate 
the senate will be in recess when the deadline arrives next 
wednesday so there is no chance that proponents of the extension 
can try again 
the house approved the extension on april 21 by a 213201 vote 
the immigration and naturalization service had recommended a 
presidential veto if president reagan followed the advice his 
veto likely would have been sustained 
immediately after the vote sen alan k simpson rwyo urged 
all senators to tell their constituents may 4 at midnight is the 
final time for application for amnesty and they must know that 
this extraordinary act of grace will end may 4 when we are in 
recess this is it simpson said 
the immigration law enacted in 1986 was finely tuned legislation 
that carefully balanced a legalization program for illegal aliens 
with penalties for employers who knowingly hire undocumented 
workers 
the senate vote and the narrow house margin demonstrated that 
amnesty for those who came to this country illegally before jan 1 
1982 remains an emotional issue 
aliens who came to this country illegally before 1982 and have 
lived here continually since then were given one year to apply for 
temporary residency as the first step toward permanent status may 
4 ends the oneyear period 
immigration offices will remain open until midnight on 
wednesday the ins already has begun a program that allows people 
to sign up now and produce the necessary documentation later 
sen phil gramm rtexas speaking for senators opposing the 
extension said that illegal border crossings which dropped after 
the new law was passed have increased greatly in recent months 
after an initial period when the law was taken seriously the 
level of illegal immigration has risen by 60 percent over the last 
year he said when people are asked why they are coming they 
say they dont believe the law is going to be enforced 
gramm added that the border patrol is finding a large increase 
in the use of false documents by illegal aliens 
he said the extension proposal is fueling the fire that is 
already sending millions of people across our borders illegally 
gramm said that reagan would have vetoed the bill and that veto 
would have been sustained he warned before the vote that the 
extension bill would raise false hopes and illegal aliens who 
waited past the may 4 deadline would lose the opportunity to get 
the best gift america has to be in the united states legally 
sen edward m kennedy dmass speaking for the extension 
said its hard to comprehend the intense opposition that some 
senators are bringing to this issue 
he said of all the people in america illegal aliens are 
the least likely to know their rights but they do have rights 
sen alan cranston dcalif also backed the extension 
commenting we have little to lose and much to gain by extending 
the application period 
sen pete wilson rcalif said the extension should be passed 
because this game started late the effort by the ins however 
well intended has not been sufficient there are people who are 
eligible but timid 
but simpson the chief sponsor of the 1986 law carried the day 
commenting that with some 13 million applications so far the 
legalization program is working applications have been approved at 
about a 95 percent rate 
if you want to live your dream heres your chance he said 
it will never come again

the house judiciary committee on thursday 
approved legislation designed to make tennis star ivan lendl an 
american citizen in time to play for the us olympic team in seoul 
this summer 
but a spokesman for the us tennis association said the team 
members already have been selected and it is unlikely a player 
would be bumped to make room for lendl even if the czech native 
receives us citizenship and clears another series of procedural 
hurdles to become eligible 
this would put us in a very difficult situation said ed 
fabricius director of communications for the association i 
dont see it happening weve already selected the team 
the committees voice vote came one week after a house 
immigration subcommittee which traditionally opposes olympictied 
exemptions agreed to the measure 
the bill would waive for lendl the fiveyear period permanent 
residents are required to wait before receiving citizenship 
lendl 28 the worlds no 1ranked tennis player is a native 
of czechoslovakia but has lived in greenwich conn since 1981 
and has adopted the united states as his home 
two other potential olympic athletes also won committee approval 
for fasttrack citizenship jenspeter burntd is an east german 
swimmer who defected in 1985 and is living in alabama gagik 
barseghian is an armenian wrestler who moved to california in 1986 
if the citizenship bill is enacted lendl would have to 
represent the united states in the davis cup in july to be eligible 
for the olympics and since he has previously represented 
czechoslovakia in davis cup competition he would have to secure a 
waiver from the international tennis federation 
after that the czech olympic committee would have to give lendl 
a waiver to play in the olympics

a politburo member went to a huge steel 
plant where half the workers were on strike thursday but there was 
no sign of an end to polands worst labor trouble since the 
solidarity days of 198081 
police detained three senior solidarity leaders and an organizer 
of another strike set for friday in stalowa wola said members of 
the independent union federation which was born in 1980 and 
outlawed after the communist authorities declared martial law in 
december 1981 
bronislaw geremek an adviser to solidarity founder lech walesa 
said police stopped his car in stalowa wola in the southern 
industrial belt and detained him solidarity spokesman janusz 
onyszkiewicz and warsaw solidarity leader zbigniew bujak he said 
onyszkiewicz and bujak remained in custody 
ewa kaberna a solidarity activist who announced plans for the 
strike at the 18000worker heavy machinery plant was apprehended 
by police on the street said solidarity spokesmen zbigniew 
romaszewski in warsaw 
politburo member alfred miodowicz visited the lenin steelworks 
works at nowa huta outside krakow about 65 miles southwest of 
stalowa wola 
his trip coincided with a warning to strikers that their 
3dayold work stoppage was illegal and a breakdown in talks 
between management and an unofficial strike committee 
state television gave the strike prominent attention thursday 
night saying it was against the law and talks had begun with the 
plants official union 
miodowicz told reporters deputy prime minister zbigniew szalajda 
was on his way to nowa huta strikers said later they were told 
szalajda had arrived but the leader of the plants official union 
denied it 
workers expressed anger that management began talks thursday 
with the governmentsanctioned union several hundred students 
rallied in support of the strikers but police dispersed them 
the strike at the 32000worker nowa huta plant is the biggest 
in poland since those that swept the country after food price 
increases in 1980 which brought down a government and led to the 
imposition of martial law 
organizers said at least 16000 people had stopped work at the 
plant in nowa huta whose name means new steel mill the town was 
built in the 1950s as a model socialist community 
about 1200014000 strikers were said to be inside the plant 
they were able to go in and out and some went home to rest 
workers who strike in poland customarily go to their place of 
employment but instead of working they hold meetings pass out 
pamphlets or even sleep 
demands at nowa huta include an immediate 50 percent increase in 
average monthly pay of 105 the unofficial strike committee also 
said 15 paid monthly in compensation nationwide for recent price 
increases should be doubled for industrial workers teachers 
health care workers and retirees 
prices in poland rose 42 percent in the first three months of 
1988 because of government reductions in subsidies on many consumer 
items 
we are still waiting in vain for a proposal to meet the mill 
management again stanislaw handzlik a dismissed solidarity 
activist said thursday evening we feel it is a test of nerves 
at the moment 
he said by telephone from the plant that force might be used 
against the strikers 
miodowicz who met western reporters by chance said when asked 
about the comment i dont think that will be necessary 
handzlik and other strikers said later they were told by 
management that szalajda the chief government official for 
industrial policy was holding a crisis staff meeting with 
management wladyslaw sitkowski head of the official union at the 
plant said szalajda was not there 
a report by the official news agency pap said szalajda was 
meeting with steel company executives in nearby katowice to 
discuss the possibility of changing the production structure in 
the metals industry 
involvement of two such senior officials would indicate deep 
official concern about the strike only days before may day the 
international labor day that is a time of official celebration and 
antigovernment protest in poland 
at stalowa wola factory officials confiscated the work passes 
of some employees in an attempt block the strike called to begin 
at 7 am friday romaszewski said in moscow 
negotiations with the official union at nowa huta appeared to be 
an effort to seize the initiative from an unofficial 16member 
committee formed when the strike began tuesday 
the crew reacts with outrage handzlik said from the plant 
proposals put forth by the official unions are very vague and pay 
issues are almost put off indefinitely 
the last talks with the strike committee took place early 
thursday soon after midnight and lasted only 15 minutes strikers 
said they reported threats that failure to reach agreement could 
lead to police intervention

the united states is banning imports of 
elephant ivory originating from stockpiles in burundi no matter 
where they may be shipped from the fish and wildlife service said 
thursday 
to bolster international efforts to save endangered african 
elephants other countries are being asked to take similar action 
against a burundi stockpile of ivory believed harvested by poachers 
in other countries said spokesman david klinger 
burundi is a marylandsized central african nation without wild 
elephants of its own although ivory shipments from burundi in 
violation of treaties could not be accepted by the united states 
without thursdays action there would be no legal bar to 
importation of carved or otherwise worked items made in third 
countries from ivory shipped from burundi 
swissbased officials of the convention on the international 
trade in endangered species and others sources have confirmed that 
about 16000 tusks or 94 tons of ivory have accumulated under 
private ownership in burundi klinger said 
the ivory was accumulated before burundi last november banned 
imports outside of the convention and officials there say they 
have no legal way to prevent export of the material 
we dont want this ivory in international trade said 
klinger because burundi has no wild elephants and no 
ivoryproducing country has authorized exports to burundi since the 
control system began in december 1986 fish and wildlife service 
law enforcement officials believe this stockpile was obtained 
illegally 
burundi is not one of the 95 nations that have signed the 
convention and has been used as a shipping point by people trying 
to get around quotas on ivory from elephants killed in other 
countries said klinger 
the neighbors of burundi zaire rwanda and tanzania do have 
elephants which have been severely threatened by poaching and loss 
of habitat from an estimated 15 million animals 10 years ago the 
population has fallen to about 760000 
for this reason nations with elephants have agreed on quotas 
for ivory shipments and a registration and tracking system for 
tusks taken according to the quotas burundi cooperates in the 
quota system and banned nontreaty imports of ivory last november 
but says it has no legal way to act against ivory imported before 
that 
when registration began on dec 1 1986 18148 tusks totaling 
986 tons were listed by burundi such previously accumulated 
inventories were exempt and could be sold and the tusks went to 
carvers in hong kong 
the current stockpile is not registered with the convention 
about 770 to 900 tons of ivory are traded every year tusks are 
worth about 50 million and carved items 500 million or more 
klinger said

hundreds of demonstrators set up 
flaming barricades on the streets of the capital thursday in a 
protest calling for the ouster of military strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
hours before the demonstration government security agents 
arrested 30 people in a crackdown on opposition activists others 
were being sought by police 
attorney general carlos a villalaz told a news conference those 
arrested were planning a threeday campaign of violence which he 
said may have included tampering with two locks of the panama canal 
among those arrested was enrique marquez presidentelect of the 
panama canal society of professional engineers 
in a statement the society called it one more proof of the 
constant violation of human rights by the defense forces of the 
republic of panama 
riot police lobbed teargas canisters and fired birdshot into 
the air to break up small pockets of demonstrators on the via 
espana a main thoroughfare in panama city barricades of burning 
tires garbage and boxes blocked some side streets 
several arrests were reported 
the protesters some on balconies high above the burning 
rubbish chanted get out noriega justice and down 
with pineapple face a derogatory reference to noriega 
we are civilistas and we want democracy and justice in 
panama shouted a middleage woman civilistas refers to 
supporters of the national civic crusade which has organized 
protests against noriega since june 
the demonstration however was not the largescale turnout 
hoped for by the opposition 
the protest started on via espana in the heart of an upperclass 
shopping district not far from many of the banks that make up this 
citys international financial center 
merchants shuttered windows as a precaution against violence 
truckloads of police and riot troops patrolled streets and a 
water cannon was used to discourage protesters 
the us southern command on thursday urged us servicemen and 
their dependents in panama to stay out of public places where 
demonstrations might occur 
noriega is chief of panamas 15000member defense forces and 
the power behind the government 
the crackdowns came as a us state department official was 
reported to be meeting with the panamanian general who has been 
indicted on drugtrafficking charges in the united states noriega 
denies the charges 
michael kozak an aide to assistant secretary of state elliott 
abrams returned to panama for the second time in two weeks said a 
source in washington who spoke on condition of anonymity 
reagan administration officials reportedly have been seeking 
more subtle ways to get noriega to step down after failing to 
dislodge the general with sweeping economic sanctions the 
sanctions have created a severe cash shortage in panama 
on thursday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater suggested 
the reagan administration would be satisfied if noriega resigns as 
head of the countrys military forces previously us officials 
insisted that noriega leave panama 
none of the people arrested thursday were leaders of the civic 
crusade 
villalaz said earlier the arrest order applied to 35 directors 
of the civic crusade plus an unspecified number of neighborhood 
leaders of the planned demonstration 
villalaz said arrests were made after intelligence agents 
uncovered an opposition plan that constituted a movement aimed at 
carrying out acts of violence beginning thursday 
weapons documents describing how to make firebombs and papers 
describing the workings of the pedro miguel and miraflores locks of 
the panama canal were found during raids thursday villalaz said 
opposition activists want to find a formula through which the 
functioning of the miraflores and pedro miguel locks will be 
affected he said 
agents raided the offices of the panama industrial association 
the panamanian odontological association and the national medical 
commission all three organizations complained the raids were 
carried out without proper warrants 
efforts to reach opposition leaders for comment were not 
immediately successful many have been in hiding since their 
headquarters in a panama city hotel was raided march 28 after a 
protest and more than 40 people were arrested 
the civic crusade has been unable to attract enough support for 
a major protest since the march rally was smashed by riot police 
a federal judge in miami ruled thursday that noriega could 
challenge his indictment on drugtrafficking charges without 
surrending himself to authorities us district judge william 
hoeveler gave noriegas miami lawyer 10 days to submit challenges 
to the feb 4 indictment

shell oil co acknowledged that an 
illegal practice allowed 175000 gallons of crude oil to seep into 
bird sanctuaries and bays killing almost 200 waterfowl and other 
wildlife and threatening more thursday 
larry kolb principal engineer with the state regional water 
quality control board called the spill an ecological disaster and 
estimated that it could cost shell 3 million in penalties and 1 
million in cleanup costs 
about 100 cleanup workers thursday were rushed into area 
wetlands where winds and rising tides threatened to expand the 
spill which occurred during the nesting season 40 miles northeast 
of san francisco 
the spill occurred friday night or early saturday when a 
drainpipe that carries off rainwater through the middle of an oil 
tank at shells major northern california refinery broke inside the 
tank allowing oil to be siphoned out 
shell said wednesday that it regularly allowed rain collected 
from the roof of the tank to flow uninspected into a nearby marsh 
the practice violated federal environmental protection agency 
regulations shells written policies and standard industry 
practice refinery manager ron banducci said 
he said he had no explanation for the deviation from established 
procedures and epa requirements 
while the investigation is continuing the management of this 
refinery takes full responsibility for the accident shell 
spokesman gene munger said thursday 
the practice of discharging the storm water without inspection 
was not followed at any of the 173 other tanks at the 1000acre 
refinery said banducci 
in our view leaving the valve open when rain is predicted is 
not control of rain discharges in any sense of the word kolb 
said thurssday 
about 126000 gallons of the san joaquin crude a particularly 
thick oil have been recovered from a 15mile stretch along 
carquinez strait and the peyton marsh which adjoins the refinery 
crews raced to remove the oil much of it stuck to rocks and 
marsh reeds before rain or an exceptionally high tide of 55 feet 
due on saturday can spread it 
high tides and gusty winds late wednesday pushed up to 1600 
gallons of oil out of the marsh into the waters of suisun bay to 
the east and carquinez strait northeast of the san francisco bay 
said coast guard spokesman ken freeze 
state fish and game department officials flew over ryer and roe 
islands about six miles from the spill and found lots of birds 
lots of oil 
some of the oil has gotten into areas where it wasnt before 
primarily the nesting areas out there and thats bad for sure 
said brian hunter fish and game regional manager 
by thursday morning 447 oily birds and animals had been picked 
up from polluted areas said hunter of those 189 were either dead 
or died during the rescue the animals included 32 mammals and 
eight reptiles 
kolb said damaged areas may take a year or more to recover 
on wednesday wildlife crews blasted gaspowered cannons to 
frighten birds from nesting marshes and set up zon guns 
propane gaspowered cannons to scare birds away from fouled areas 
about 50 members of the california conservation corps were sent 
to help clean up the martinez marina where some 400 boats were 
trapped in the harbor many belonged to fishermen upset they would 
miss this weekends fishing 
most of their boats had oil stains on the hulls and by federal 
regulations must be cleaned before being allowed out of the marina

a spectacular 2mile cavern kept secret 
for 14 years to prevent vandalism will become the newest natural 
tourist attraction in the state thats home to the grand canyon and 
the petrified forest 
the legislature and gov rose mofford rushed wednesday to enact 
legislation allowing the state to acquire the cavern mrs mofford 
perched a spelunkers helmet atop her beehive hairdo as she signed 
the bill adopted an hour earlier 
until now only a select few have squeezed through the tiny 
opening to see the cavern near benson in southeastern arizona 
about 50 miles from tucson 
state parks board director kenneth travous predicted wednesday 
that when the cave is opened to the public in about three years 
100000 to 150000 people a year will travel by elevator to see it 
its fabulous travous said walt disney couldnt have 
done any better for the state of arizona your imagination goes 
crazy when you get down there 
the cave discovered in 1974 is about 13000 feet long and from 
50 to 100 feet high inside 
thousands of stillgrowing stalagmites and stalactites ranging 
in size from several inches to 60 feet are found throughout the 
tworoom cave which is home to a colony of 700 bats 
parks department spokeswoman cheryl steenerson said the cavern 
is considerably smaller than the famous carlsbad caverns in new 
mexico which are among the worlds largest at 100000 feet in

legislation to bridge the gap between the 
pending mediumrange missile reduction treaty and a future pact to 
make deep cuts in longrange nuclear arms was introduced in the 
senate thursday 
the bill calls for temporary mutual limits on us and soviet 
deployment of longrange strategic arms until the negotiation of a 
new strategic arms reduction or start treaty 
the legislation declares that the two superpowers should not 
exceed the levels of specified nuclear weapons they had in the 
field on jan 25 1988 the date the mediumrange accord was 
submitted to the senate 
both nations would have to agree on such limitations before they 
could take effect 
the bill was introduced by sens dale bumpers dark patrick 
leahy dvt john chafee rri and john heinz rpa 
bumpers said that both supporters and opponents of the pending 
intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf treaty agree that the 
military advantages of the pact to the united states and its allies 
can be overcome by the soviets if moscow deploys additional 
longrange weapons to make up for the mediumrange missiles it will 
be required to destroy 
our legislation provides guidelines for temporary mutual 
restraints to reinforce the inf treaty until we get a strategic 
arms agreement bumpers said 
leahy added unless we stop or slow deployment of new soviet 
strategic missiles the inf treaty will be a dead letter 
without any cap on intercontinental missiles the soviets will 
simply add more strategic warheads to cover the same nato targets 
once covered by the ss20 intermediaterange soviet missiles 
leahy said 
leahy said it is now clear that no agreement will be reached on 
a start treaty at the moscow summit meeting in late may between 
reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
by calling for an interim freeze on multiple warhead missiles 
and bombers the legislation will maintain the viability of the inf 
treaty pending the achievement of a more farreaching start treaty 
he said 
chafee said the treaty will protect the advances made by the inf 
treaty and improve chances of reaching agreement on cuts in 
longrange arms

rite aid corp has canceled its plan to 
construct an international headquarters here after the city council 
approved an ordinance requiring companies to offer unpaid leave to 
new mothers and fathers 
the decision by rite aid one of the nations largest drugstore 
chains comes as state legislators begin to review several bills to 
impose similar requirements statewide parental leave legislation 
is also being considered on the federal level 
suzanne mead a spokeswoman for rite aid said the company did 
not object to specific provisions of the city ordinance the 
concern of company officials she said is that harrisburg was 
entering an area traditionally covered on federal and state 
levels 
the harrisburg ordinance approved by the city council wednesday 
in a 52 override of the mayors veto would allow a mother or 
father to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave after the birth of a 
child 
supporters of the requirement say it would strengthen families 
while protecting the jobs of workers who want to take an extended 
absence but business groups are concerned such restrictions will 
interfere with existing benefits and hamper the business climate 
a spokeswoman for harrisburg mayor stephen reed a democrat 
said the city may take legal action to block its provisions 
obviously its a severe blow to us its 1300 jobs said 
spokeswoman julia marshall the city pennsylvanias capital has a 
population of about 55000 
rite aid with 28000 employees worldwide and a number of 
facilities in suburban harrisburg planned to move 735 jobs into 
the new headquarters and add 100 more jobs a year for the following 
three years in addition the project would have created 
construction jobs 
city officials said they knew of no other city that has imposed 
such a law but at least 10 states guarantee some form of parental 
leave and legislators in pennsylvania are considering such a law 
reed is against the ordinance ms marshall said because it 
singles out harrisburg one municipality and it will be 
detrimental to the business climate which has been improving in the 
last three or four years 
city council president reizdan b moore said the bills 
suporters are not antibusiness were probusiness 
prodevelopment propeople proeverything 
but councilwoman sherri d levin said the bill is 
antiharrisburg 
even the five members of the citys human relations commission 
which must enforce the law wrote the council a letter urging that 
the reeds veto be sustained they said the law would lead to 
increased discrimination for both young men and women who are 
interested in starting a family 
some residents who supported the bill said they were enraged by 
rite aids threatened cancellation 
if you dont pass this you might as well put a sign up 
that says rite aid plantation said claire jones one resident 
ill tell you this i wont pick cotton here 
ms mead said rite aid had a parental leave policy she described 
as attractive but would not discuss its specific provisions 
were responding not to the issue but to the right of a 
municipality to impose such a policy on a local corporation ms 
mead said

an engineered antibody developed to attack a 
type of immune cell in the body has been shown to cure laboratory 
mice of diabetes a california researcher said thursday 
dr c garrison fathman of the stanford university medical 
center said that in an experiment that has lasted for more than a 
year his team demonstrated that a special monoclonal antibody could 
block the destructive action of a tcell lymphocyte that is thought 
to play a role in causing diabetes 
fathman said the antibody was used in a laboratory animal called 
the nonobese diabetic mouse this type of mouse normally develops 
diabetes and is bred to enable researchers to study the disease 
normally he said the mice of this strain develop diabetes 
within 150 days and die within a short time 
but in the stanford experiment reported in the journal science 
mice treated with the monoclonal antibody were cured of diabetes 
and all but three have lived for 450 days two control groups of 
mice that were part of the experiment died of diabetes after 
receiving either none of the antibody or small doses said fathman 
the scientist said that although the research is promising it 
does not offer any immediate hope of curing diabetes in humans 
fathman said the technique must undergo studies in primates before 
it could be applied to humans even on an experimental basis 
furthermore fathman said the treatment would never be 
appropriate for patients who already have diabetes because by then 
the disease has gone too far in the destructive process 
the monoclonal antibody used in the research was developed to 
attack a type of lymphocyte that has on its surface a protein 
called the l3t4 marker when injected the antibody will seek out 
and kill cells with this marker 
lymphocytes with the l3t4 marker are thought to be the pilot 
cells in an attack on the pancreas the organ that secretes 
insulin this lymphocyte is thought to start a cascade effect that 
results in the insulinsecreting beta cells of the pancreas being 
destroyed by the bodys own immune system once the beta cells are 
destroyed the body can not produce insulin a hormone essential 
for the metabolism of sugar 
fathman said his team used three groups of the nonobese diabetic 
mice one group received none of the monoclonal antibody a second 
group received one large dose of the antibody the third group 
received a large dose plus smaller weekly doses 
the experiment began when the mice were 90 to 110 days old at 
that point said fathman the destructive process that leads to 
diabetes was well started with the beta cells of the pancreas 
already under attack 
by 260 days 80 percent of both the untreated mice and the mice 
which received a single dose of the antibody were diabetic or dead 
among the 25 mice that received weekly doses of the antibody only 
two were diabetic fathman said the treatment may have started too 
late in the process for these two mice a third mouse in the 
treated group died later of other causes 
all treatment was withdrawn 150 days after it started and the 
fullytreated mice remain healthy 
fathman said in a telephone interview that the treated mice now 
have passed the age of 450 days and are maintaining normal levels 
of sugar in their blood evidence that they are not diabetic 
we clearly have prevented them from reverting to the diabetic 
state he said they are cured 
fathman and his coworkers reported on the experiment in 
science the journal of american association for the advancement of 
science the magazine was published friday

north korea tried to buy hundreds of japanese 
computers through a company in indonesia last month but cia agents 
foiled the plan a news agency said thursday 
the kyodo news service quoting unidentified us sources in 
singapore also said cia agents were monitoring north korean trade 
representatives in singapore to block possible terrorist actions at 
the summer olympics in seoul south korea 
kyodo quoted the sources as saying cia agents discovered in 
march that 500 computers ordered from a japanese trading company 
for export to a company in jakarta indonesia were destined for 
communist north korea 
the news agency said the cia notified japans ministry of 
international trade and industry through diplomatic channels and 
the ministry subsequently denied the trading company an export 
permit for the computers 
kyodo said the names of the companies involved were not 
available 
japanese trade ministry and foreign ministry officials said they 
could not comment on the reports of cia or north korean involvement 
they said a distributor for japans nec corp a major computer 
maker had received an order from a small company in the western 
city of kobe for 500 to 600 personal computers 
the kobe company had received an order for the computers from a 
small japanese trading company in tokyo which in turn had received 
an order from a firm in singapore the ministry officials told the 
associated press they spoke on condition they not be identified 
they said necs distributor canceled the deal before an 
application was made to the trade ministry for an export permit 
an nec spokesman seiji igarashi confirmed an nec distributor 
had received an order last fall from a japanese trading company for 
about 500 personal computers he said the distributor canceled the 
deal this spring when it could not confirm the ultimate source of 
the order 
japanese companies and government officials have tightened their 
monitoring of hightechnology exports to communist countries since 
a toshiba corp subsidiary was found last year to have violated 
japanese and international trade regulations by selling 
sophisticated metal milling machines to the soviet union

the chairman of the house banking committee on 
thursday called on federal regulators to dissolve within 60 days a 
muchcriticized agency created 2 years ago to sell property from 
insolvent savings institutions 
after meeting with democratic members of the committee rep 
fernand j st germain dri decided to send a letter to federal 
home loan bank board chairman m danny wall calling for the speedy 
abolishment of the federal asset disposition association said a 
committee spokeswoman who spoke on condition of anonymity 
two members of the committee rep thomas mcmillen dmd and 
rep paul kanjorski dpa are drafting legislation to dismantle 
fada should wall refuse to comply the spokeswoman said 
wall spokesman karl hoyle said the bank board which regulates 
3147 federally insured savings institutions is unlikely to do 
away with fada 
wed be the first to admit there were problems but we have 
those problems under control weve got new management at fada and 
we believe it should have an opportunity to prove itself he said 
in another development the new chief executive of fada gerald 
p carmen said the agency made its first quarterly profit during 
the first three months of this year 
we will be posting a net profit of 538000 for the first 
quarter the loss last year was approximately 7 million and the 
year before that 3 million he said i dont want to make more 
of it than it is but i think it is kind of a turning point 
the move to abolish fada by house democrats comes less than a 
week after the release of a highly critical report by the banking 
committee that charged fada with being a bloated bureaucracy 
that wasted millions of dollars 
the bank board created fada in late 1985 by chartering it as a 
private savings institution despite that structure it functions 
as an arm of the government and all of its stock is owned by the 
insurance fund that backs sampl deposits the insurance fund is also 
fadas only customer paying it fees to manage loans and real 
estate from insolvent sampls

defense attorneys at the racketeering trial of 
rep mario biaggi tried to link vice president george bush to the 
scandalplagued wedtech corp on thursday while crossexamining a 
witness 
the witness former wedtech executive lawrence shorten 
testified that he was told the company hired a distant relative of 
bushs as a management consultant partly because of his contact 
with the vice president 
but shorten denied that charles dickey dyer iii related to bush 
by marriage was hired to win bushs support for wedtechs 
obtaining a multimilliondollar navy contract 
shorten also said he was told by a close friend of attorney 
general edwin meeses that meese would have president reagan 
overrule the navy if it did not give the contract to wedtech which 
is now bankrupt 
steve hart a bush spokesman confirmed that dyer is related to 
bush through marriage but said the vice president had nothing to do 
with contracts 
we have no records of any type of involvement or any action 
involving navy contracts that would suggest the vice president took 
any position one way or another hart said 
hart said that dyer did write the vice president five or six 
letters 
but he added the vice president either didnt respond to the 
letters or in the cases where he did respond they were very 
cursory responses thanks for note and so forth and alluded to 
little if anything in the letters 
shorten one of four former top wedtech executives who have 
pleaded guilty to state and federal charges now cooperating with 
the government in exchange for leniency said wedtech was vying 
with companies in puerto rico and texas to win a navy contract to 
build floating docks or pontoons in 1984 
he said that bush supported the other companies but he denied 
an allegation by biaggis lawyer james larossa that dyer was 
hired to countermand the problems that george bush was giving 
wedtech 
shorten said he did not think the vice presidents relative was 
still working for the defense contractor in 1984 when the pontoon 
contract was up for grabs 
but you did get the contract right persisted larossa 
yes said shorten wedtech obtained the first of several 
navy pontoon contracts totaling more than 100 million in april 
1984 
in a telephone interview from his princeton nj home dyer 
said that he stopped working for wedtech in the fall of 1981 but 
that payment for his consulting services was strung out until early 
1984 
dyer said if bush did anything on wedtechs behalf im not 
aware of it he added if they had any influence with george 
bush i didnt get it for them dyer said bushs busy schedule has 
kept them from speaking since 1980 
dyer also denied speaking or writing to bush about wedtechs 
pontoon contract but said he did write the vice president at least 
twice on the companys behalf about an army engine contract in 1981 
biaggi a new york democrat and six others are accused of 
turning wedtech which is now bankrupt into a racketeering 
enterprise that paid out millions of dollars in bribes to obtain 
nobid government contracts 
defense lawyers have tried to show that wedtech officials had 
close links to highranking officials in the reagan white house and 
thus did not need the help of a democratic congressman from the 
bronx 
shorten said wedtech sought the help of such washington insiders 
as san francisco lawyer e robert wallach a close friend and 
former personal lawyer to meese 
you know sir asked larossa that wallach had an open door 
to the white house through his buddy ed meese right 
yes sir said shorten 
he told you that didnt he 
yes he did said shorten 
later larossa asked if wallach had told shorten that if the 
navy didnt give you wedtech the pontoon contract he would make 
sure through meese that the old man ronald reagan would 
overrule the navy and give it to you right 
he did say that yes said shorten 
wallach is under indictment on charges of taking payoffs from 
wedtech executives to influence meese and other public officials 
meese has not been charged with any wrongdoing

firefighters were not saving their homes pelted firetrucks with 
stones the wood and cardboard shantytown had no fire hydrants and 
officials said the roads were too narrow for the trucks 
there was no immediate estimate of damage and the cause of the 
fire was under investigation the citys fire chief chief brig 
gen ernesto madriaga said the blaze was possibly the biggest in 
manila since world war ii 
four people were injured including three civilians and a 
fireman who was struck in the head by a water hose madriaga said

it began in the capitals crowded pandacan district smoke 
blackened the skies over much of the city thursday afternoon 
the fire threatened to spread to a governmentowned petroleum 
compound but did not reach it because of a change in the wind 
hundreds of people huddled around collections of personal 
belongings including refrigerators furniture and televisions 
sets on the sides of a narrow mudcovered street separating the 
smoldering shantytown from the petroleum compound

an assassination team of two masked men 
fired blasts from a sawedoff shotgun thursday to kill agop 
agopian the founder and leader of an armenian terrorist group 
feared throughout the world 
agopian who posed as a lebanese businessman in athens but also 
carried a south yemeni diplomatic passport was shot outside his 
home in a prosperous seaside suburb 
a statement by the ministry of public order said the victims 
wife during questioning by security police said he was the 
leader of asala agop agopian 
police identified the wife as janil titizian and said she told 
them her husband recently arrived from south yemen and was on his 
way to yugoslavia she said he was bound for the airport when 
killed 
asala standing for the armenian secret army for the liberation 
of armenia has claimed numerous terrorist attacks against turkish 
targets including the july 1983 bombing of the turkish airlines 
desk at paris orly airport which killed eight people and wounded 
56 
the group seeks the foundation of an independent armenian state 
in eastern turkey 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the killing 
agopian was killed outside his house in the old phaleron suburb 
at 430 am 930 pm edt wednesday as he waited for a taxi in 
the street outside his home with him was a woman identified as his 
sisterinlaw she was unhurt 
according to a police spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity in accordance with greek practice two armed men emerged 
from a parked car 
one man fired at agopian using solid shotgun slugs the type 
used in greece for boarhunting 
agopian hit with two slugs in the chest and elbow tried to 
flee the man ran after him and fired two more slugs into his head 
and chest 
the attackers got away in a car left parked across the street 
from the secondfloor apartment where agopian and his wife lived 
the victim was first identified as abdul mohammed kashim 39 
from a south yemeni diplomatic passport he was carrying 
but following reports from paris saying the dead man was the 
longsought leader of asala the ministry said his wife revealed 
his real identity 
hed lived in athens for at least a year possibly longer as 
henri titizian but he traveled abroad very frequently on the 
yemeni passport said a police source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the source said agopian planned to open a supermarket in athens 
agopian whose name has also been given as hagop hagopian was 
reported killed in an israeli air raid on a palestinian camp near 
beirut during israels 1982 summer invasion of lebanon 
but there were also reports that agopian was still alive and 
active in the terrorist organization he had founded and had merely 
changed identities 
armenian sources in athens speaking on condition of anoymity 
said agopian was born in iraq in 1945 and that his name was most 
likely a pseudonym 
asala founded by agopian in 1975 claimed responsibility for 
more than 60 attacks on turkish targets including killings of 
around 30 turkish diplomats and dependents in western europe and 
the united states 
agopian ran asala from beirut with funding from the palestine 
liberation organization and leftist groups 
besides seeking the creation of an independent armenian state in 
turkey the marxistoriented organization vows to avenge a massacre 
by ottoman turks in 191516 that it says left 15 armenians dead 
both security police and ministry officials declined to say 
whether a rival armenian group could have been responsible for 
killing agopian 
the french news agency agence francepresse reported in paris 
that thursdays killing may have been the work of the 
asalarevolutionary movement an armenian commando group which 
separated from the main organization 
the head of that group american archaeologist monte melkonian 
is serving a sixyear term in french prison for criminal 
association weapons possession and forging identity papers 
the ministry said security police were still questioning mrs 
titizian 
a police source said agopian apparently was selling off some 
businesses in lebanon and was transferring his activities to 
greece 
the police spokesman said agopian was booked on an early morning 
yugoslav airlines flight to belgrade

a fire broke out in the crew quarters of 
the uss bonefish before the submarine was wracked by explosions and 
fire that killed three crewmen a survivor of the accident said 
thursday 
the navy has refused to speculate on the cause of sundays 
accident off the florida coast but civilian submarine experts have 
said the explosion could have been connected with a buildup of 
hydrogen gas in the battery compartments 
ronald larsen the chief electricians mate said there was a 
small fire in berthing and a couple of people manned fire 
extinguishers and attempted to put it out 
he said there were initial reports that the fire was under 
control then reports the fire was spreading 
from everybody i talked to there was an explosion later maybe 
five minutes down the road he said i never heard the 
explosion being so far aft 
crew members had donned gas masks and made an orderly evacuation 
despite thick poisonous smoke he said the subs emergency lights 
hardly did any good because of the density of the smoke larsen 
said 
no one was available for comment on larsens account an officer 
at fleet headquarters said thursday night telephone calls to four 
spokesmen at home went unanswered or were not returend 
the 219foot bonefish one of the navys four remaining 
dieselelectric subs was cruising at periscope depth sunday when 
the first explosion hit its forward battery compartment the navy 
said earlier the batteries are used to power the sub when it is 
below the surface 
recharging those batteries generates hydrogen gas which can 
explode if allowed to accumulate 
after the explosions began the bonefish was able to surface 160 
miles east of cape canaveral fla and cmdr mike wilson 42 
ordered the 92member crew evacuated because of smoke and toxic 
fumes the navy said 
two of the 89 survivors remained hospitalized thursday 
larsen disputed speculation that high levels of hydrogen in the 
battery compartments may have been responsible for the explosion 
i know for a fact we had zero percent hydrogen in the battery 
well he said 
lt cmdr aaron long a spokesman for the atlantic fleet 
headquarters in norfolk va said earlier that preliminary 
indications pointed toward a series of explosions aboard the sub 
including one in the battery compartment 
the navy said thursday that bodies of two of the three sailors 
had been removed from the submarine which was being towed by the 
salvage ship uss hoist to charleston its home port 
larsen from bellows falls vt said he was in the engineering 
section when the fire filled the craft with thick smoke before i 
left i held the flashlight up to my mask and you couldnt tell if 
it was on or off he said 
the evacuation was orderly however he said there were no 
reports of anybody grabbing somebody by the waist so they could go 
first he said 
because crewmen were at their stations about 20 minutes before 
they evacuated they probably had time to become familiar with 
their location even in the dark he said 
the three victims were were relatively new to the crew on board 
four or five weeks and may have been doomed by a lack of 
familiarity with the crafts layout larsen said 
the bonefish although running great at the time of the 
accident had a reputation for breaking down and not getting under 
way on time because of its age he said 
rep arthur ravenel rsc a house armed services committee 
member whose district includes the naval base said he had 
dismissed what he called rumors that the bonefish was not seaworthy 
ravenel said the charleston naval shipyard had told him the 
bonefish was overhauled four years ago and its batteries were 
replaced two years ago 
a crewman told charleston tv station wciv on wednesday that the 
ship had been running fine before the accident 
it was totally safe said seaman chris dolby it was in 
the best shape id see it in the two years ive been on the ship 
another member of the crew petty officer 2nd class william 
baker of okolona ky said bonefish personnel were schooled in 
handling emergencies 
the crew acted in the best way possible we train every day 
and this is where it paid off baker said 
chief petty officer joseph c mowery an atlantic fleet command 
spokesman in norfolk the remains of lt ray everts 30 of naoma 
wva and petty officer 1st class robert w bordelon jr 39 of 
willis texas were transferred to naval hospital in charleston 
late wednesday 
the body of petty officer 3rd class marshall t lindgren 21 of 
pisgah forest nc will be removed with the assistance of a 
medical team from the aircraft carrier john f kennedy before the 
ship reaches charleston the navy said 
the navy said a memorial service for the three crewmen will be 
held saturday in a charleston lutheran church

china and southeast asia where he faces a storm of criticism over 
a cabinet members remark that japan was not the aggressor in world 
war ii 
seisuke okuno director of japans national land agency angered 
the chinese and other asians last week when he visited a japanese 
war memorial and said that japan was simply defending itself in 
world war ii 
he said his country fought to protect itself at a time when 
the white race had turned asia into a colony 
a chinese foreign ministry spokesman li zhaoxing said 
wednesday its astonishing and very regrettable to us that a 
minister of japan made such discourteous remarks in this regard of 
historical facts 
a spokesman for japans foreign ministry said thursday that uno 
will not apologize for okunos remarks during his trip 
this is not a matter of policy from the official stand of the 
government rather the personal comment of one cabinet member 
said spokesman yoshifumi matsuda i dont think mr uno is going 
to make any sort of formal apology 
however he also acknowledged japan had a responsibility in the 
war 
we are responsible for a lot of aggressiveness on our part 
not only in china but elsewhere he said no one in japanese 
society doubts this except a very small amount of extremists 
which you have in any society 
although he did not apologize okuno later said he was sorry 
that his remarks were criticized by the chinese media and he 
acknowledged japan caused major damage to its neighbors during 
world war ii according to the daily yomiuri newspaper 
matsuda said there were no plans to dismiss okuno 
education minister masayuki fujio a member of former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasones cabinet was fired after he said korea 
was partly responsible for its annexation by japan in 1910 and 
said japans actions against china during world war ii were 
justified 
during his trip uno will visit hong kong china indonesia and 
singapore 
in beijing a meeting of chinese and japanese officials opened 
thursday with china criticizing okunos remarks 
huan xiang director of the chinese state councils 
international studies center said okuno was trying to cover up 
japans history 
there were also strong reactions to okunos comments in 
singapore and korea 
the progovernment straits times newspaper in singapore said in 
an editorial if there were a prize for political hogwash mr 
seiuke okuno would win it hands down 
the official north korean central news agency called the remarks 
an insult to human conscience 
in south korea the independent seoul newspaper hankook ilbo 
said in an editorial that the remark showed the japanese have a 
sense of superiority based on their economic success

a car key 
darci pierce 20 was found guilty but mentally ill last month 
of murder kidnapping and child abuse in the slaying of cindy ray 
23 who was 8 months pregnant 
the verdict meant the jury believed mrs pierce was mentally ill 
when she committed the crimes but did not meet the legal test for 
insanity 
prosecutors contended that mrs pierce was desperate for a child 
and told her husband an airman at kirtland air force base that 
she was pregnant and that she was going to have labor induced july 
23 
she waited outside a prenatal care clinic at the base that day 
and abducted mrs ray the first nearly fullterm pregnant woman to 
walk out prosecutors said 
mrs pierce drove to the mountains east of albuquerque where 
she strangled mrs ray and cut the baby from her body with a key

mrs pierce was arrested after she went to an albuquerque 
hospital with a newborn girl and doctors determined she had not 
given birth

in prison for murder 18 years for kidnapping and 18 months for

opec oil ministers failed in an initial 
round of talks thursday to reach agreement on a proposal to cut oil 
exports in conjunction with nonopec producers cartel leaders said 
after a nearly fourhour session that ended early friday the 13 
ministers said they would resume their closeddoor deliberations 
friday evening 
rilwanu lukman the nigerian president of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries said the ministers had discussed the 
exportcutting plan in general terms but nothing specific was 
decided 
the proposed reductions in combination with cuts by six 
nonopec oil exporting countries are designed to push up oil 
prices and codify a new spirit of cooperation among oil producers 
the six independent producers on wednesday said they would cut 
oil exports by 5 percent for two months if the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries did likewise 
opec however is divided over how to respond to the offer 
which is the first such proposal from rival producers since the oil 
cartel was formed in 1960 
oil prices on the open market fell thursday brent crude from 
the north sea dropped as low as 1690 a barrel before closing at 
1720 in london down 30 cents from wednesday 
on the new york mercantile exchange the june contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark us crude fell 29 cents to 
close at 1798 a barrel the contract lost 33 cents on wednesday 
iran strongly supports the nonopec proposal both as a way of 
strengthening the oil market and as a step toward closer ties with 
nonopec producers 
any measures and means that can lead to this would be 
supported by us the iranian oil minister gholamreza aghazadeh 
told reporters on his arrival from tehran 
other opec members including saudi arabia take a more cautious 
view they want to encourage outside producers to restrain their 
oil output but they see little merit in the terms of the proposal 
under consideration in vienna 
saudi king fahd meanwhile reiterated his view that opec can 
get prices up simply by sticking to its existing agreement on 
production restraints he did not comment directly on the nonopec 
offer 
i believe prices will go up if we adhere to the output ceiling 
and convince nonopec producers of the feasibility of limiting 
their production he was quoted as saying in an interview 
published thursday by a kuwaiti newspaper 
officials from the nonopec countries were not attending 
thursdays cartel meeting so there was to be no direct negotiating 
between the two groups 
the offer from the nonopec producers mexico egypt china 
oman malaysia and angola states that they will cut their exports 
by 5 percent from the average level over the past six months they 
said this amounted to about 200000 barrels a day 
the cuts would be for may and june only 
a 5 percent cut by opec from its current level of exports would 
amount to about 700000 barrels a day together with the 200000 
barrels to be cut by the outsider producers this could have a 
significant impact on the market analysts said 
but it appeared increasingly clear that opec would not cut by as 
much as proposed sources in several delegations said speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the cartel easily could argue that a much smaller reduction 
would fulfill the terms of the outsiders proposal which says only 
that a 5 percent cut by nonopec is conditioned on a similar 
proportional response by opec 
if opec based its 5 percent cut on an average level of exports 
over the past six months as the nonopec countries had done 
then opec would have to cut only about 200000 barrels a day from 
its actual present rate of exports this is because opecs exports 
were substantially higher in the latter part of 1987 
a cut of 200000 barrels a day by both groups would have little 
or no impact on the balance between oil supply and demand said 
bahman karbassioun a viennabased oil consultant and a former opec 
staffer 
it would have only a symbolic impact he said

the sandinista government proposed on 
thursday that the twomonth ceasefire be extended by 30 days to 
allow negotiators to work out an enduring peace with rebels but 
the rebels immediately said no 
azucena ferrey spokeswoman for the rebels known as the 
contras said the sandinista proposal shows they lack good will 
she noted in a telephone interview that the current ceasefire 
expires at the end of may and said that if they want to extend 
it the ceasefire they can propose it then 
gen humberto ortega the defense minister and the leader of the 
leftist governments delegation to the peace talks told reporters 
such an extension will help improve the conditions under which 
the negotiations are taking place so that an overall agreement can 
be discussed to reach a final accord 
the 60day provisional truce which started april 1 is part of 
an agreement reached by the usbacked rebels and the sandinistas 
at the southern border post of sapoa on march 23 
during the truce the two sides are to attempt to negotiate an 
end to the 6yearold conflict that has cost more than 26000 
lives by government estimates 
ortega the brother of president daniel ortega announced the 
offer shortly before the delegations resumed highlevel political 
talks 
the government also offered thursday to let the international 
red cross administer humanitarian aid immediately to the contras 
even before rebel combatants gather inside safe zones established 
during previous talks 
the sandinista proposal was read by deputy foreign minister 
victor hugo tinoco who said the offer was an attempt to 
facilitate the pacification process 
sandinista and contra negotiators previously agreed upon seven 
safe zones in which the contra fighters are to collect the two 
sides differed over operational conditions inside the zones 
however and the rebels have yet to gather inside them 
the threeday negotiating session marks only the second time the 
two sides have met in managua since the war began in 1981 recent 
reports have said that the contra leadership is divided with the 
rebel military commanders opposing any immediate agreement with the 
sandinistas 
president ortega on wednesday predicted an agreement can be 
reached if both sides bargain in good faith 
however the sandinistas and the contras remain far apart on 
essential issues 
humberto ortega accused the rebel commanders of taking part in 
the talks not with the purpose of reaching agreement but to buy 
time 
american and other sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said rebel leader adolfo calero tried unsuccessfully to oust the 
top rebel military commander enrique bermudez a week ago 
a us official said the contra directors split 22 with one 
abstention on whether to remove bermudez he ostensibly takes 
orders from the fivemember civilian directorate but believes he 
should have more influence over rebel decisions the sources said 
calero argues that civilian control over the movement is 
essential and sees bermudez as a threat to that objective 
in an effort to dispel rumors of disunity bermudez and other 
contra leaders issued a statement in miami on wednesday declaring 
support for the talks calero in a telephone interview thursday 
denied there was any split in rebel ranks 
there are obviously sectors who would be interested in there 
being such a split he said

just in time for the parched tourist season 
parliament approved legislation thursday to let pubs stay open all 
afternoon 
the changes in english licensing laws the first in 71 years 
promise a minor revolution in national drinking habits 
since world war i pubs have had to send patrons packing and 
shut their doors at midafternoon about the time the weary 
thirsty tourist thinks of settling into a pint of english beer and 
giving his feet a rest 
when the changes go into effect by summer pubs will be allowed 
to stay open from 11 am to 11 pm every day but sunday under 
current law the hours are 11 am to 3 pm and 530 pm or 6 
pm to 11 pm 
one controversial amendment which slipped by the house of lords 
extends sunday drinking by one hour pubs will still have to close 
sunday afternoons but will now be open from noon to 3 pm insted 
of 2 pm 
as now they will then shut down until 7 pm and close for the 
day at 1030 pm 
the 1916 licensing law that shut pubs down after lunch was aimed 
at curbing drinking by world war i munitions workers 
the new hours to become law after the formality of the queens 
approval will be in effect in england and wales scotland has 
separate licensing laws no date has been stated for implementing 
the new hours 
organizations of consumers tourists and brewers applaud the 
changes but some people say it will cause excessive drinking and 
will be tiring for pub staff the british medical association has 
said it feared an upsurge in alcoholrelated illness and road 
accidents 
the sunday clause opposed by prime minister margaret thatchers 
conservative government was an amendment introduced last week into 
the unelected house of lords 
it was brought to the floor and when the presiding officer 
asked if there were objections home office minister lord robert 
ferrers in accordance with procedure for opposing measures in the 
lords shouted not content 
he expected to be joined by other conservative lords but they 
missed their cues and because no one spoke up a second time the 
amendment by procedure was deemed to have been approved

the soviet union accused us officials on 
thursday of slowing work on a treaty to halve superpower arsenals 
of strategic nuclear arms 
rather than cooling down the delegations at geneva we must do 
our utmost in the spriit of the washington accord to intensify 
efforts to work out the treaty foreign ministry spokesman vadim 
p perfiliev said at a regular news briefing 
us and soviet delegations are working in geneva on a treaty 
that would cut nuclear arsenals of longrange nuclear missiles but 
officials have said numerous differences remain both us and 
soviet officials have expressed doubt the treaty will be completed 
in time for president reagans may 29june 2 summit in moscow with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
during gorbachevs visit last december to washington the two 
signed an accord eliminating medium and shorterrange nuclear 
weapons 
perfiliev said us officials were dragging their feet on the 
strategic arms accord by putting brakes on the tempo of work on 
the geneva documents and the postponement of difficult questions 
until better times 
such an approach cannot but give rise to serious concern he 
said 
secretary of state george p shultz and soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze tried in a moscow meeting last week to 
resolve differences over the treaty but little progress was 
reported the two are due to meet again in geneva may 1112 to make 
a last attempt at reaching agreement before the moscow summit

the senate on thursday passed a billiondollar 
aids information and research bill that calls for mandatory aids 
testing of people convicted of sex and drug crimes 
finally we have declared war on the virus and not on the 
victims in our battle against aids sen edward m kennedy 
dmass said after the 874 vote 
the vote came after hours of bitter argument over the content of 
educational materials paid for with federal dollars 
tempers were lost curses hurled and senators denied the 
opportunity to speak as lawmakers debated whether to renew a 1987 
ban on federally funded materials that directly promote or 
encourage homosexuality 
the ban which expires sept 30 was passed last year 942 but 
sentiment shifted this year after several senators said it was 
having a chilling effect on public health efforts in the homosexual 
community which has the highest percentage of aids victims 
the senate agreed to the ban sponsored by sen jesse helms 
rnc but also agreed to another provision that says education 
materials should stress the public health benefits of abstinence a 
single monogamous relationship and avoidance of intravenous drug 
use the provision also says no other part of the bill should 
restrict the dissemination of accurate information to anyone at 
risk apparently superseding the helms ban 
in addition to voting unanimously to approve mandatory aids 
testing of people convicted of sex and drug crimes the senate also 
accepted neutralized versions of several conservative amendments 
that supporters said would have hampered the bill 
sens kennedy and orrin hatch rutah sponsors of the fiscal 
1988 research and education bill called it the nations first 
comprehensive statement of an aids policy the two are chairman and 
ranking minority member respectively of the senate labor and 
human resources committee 
the bill authorizes 665 million for state and federal aids 
education programs increased hiring at the national institutes of 
health a new home health care program for aids victims and special 
efforts to help highrisk minorities and intravenous drug abusers 
a committee aide said openended research money would bring to 
total to about 11 billion in annual spending 
the bills passage also was lauded by victor basile executive 
director of the human rights campaign fund the national political 
action committee for the gay and lesbian community 
we wanted to say how delighted we were with the final passage 
which for the first time establishes a national policy on 
aids basile said with respect to jesse helms and his attempts 
to make war on people who are sick were happy that the senate has 
decided overwhelmingly to make war on a disease instead 
in the house a bill covering research on aids is pending in the 
house energy and commerce committees health subcommittee bills 
covering the other areas included in the senate bill have not be 
introduced 
the 970 vote on a testing amendment by sen don nickles 
rokla marked the first time congress has ventured into uncharted 
areas of aids testing and confidentiality 
the reagan administration announced last year it would test new 
immigrants and the senate later put its stamp of approval on the 
policy the defense department tests all 21 million men and women 
on active military duty as well as all recruit applicants and the 
justice department said last october that it would test some 
federal prisoners 
under the senate measure anyone convicted of a state or federal 
crime related to sex or intravenous drugs carrying a penalty of 
death or at least a year in prison would be tested results would 
be confidential but could be disclosed to prison wardens or victims 
of sex crimes 
homosexuals and intravenous drug users have been the chief 
victims of aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome which 
attacks the bodys immune system and is spread through blood blood 
products or semen as of april 21 aids had been diagnosed in about 
59500 americans of whom more than half or about 33000 have died 
since june 1981 according to the federal centers for disease 
control no one is known to have recovered from aids 
helms said several senators on wednesday had viewed a federally 
funded videotape used in the homosexual community and became sick 
to their stomachs it had explicit instructions about how to engage 
in homosexual activity it had two men doing it 
helms contended 95 percent of americans would agree with the ban 
on federally funded materials that promote or encourage 
homosexuality but his amendment was challenged by a fellow 
conservative hatch who said public health efforts ought not 
exclude the group affected most by aids 
we have to tell homosexuals more than simply to become 
heterosexuals hatch told helms at least if they wont or 
cant become heterosexuals we can encourage them to abstain from 
promiscuous sexual activities it just makes sense this will 
decrease their risk and maybe even more importantly the risk to all 
the rest of the people in our country and throughout the world 
responded helms were in the business of creating fig leaves 
in this place 
kennedy succeeded in weakening an earlier helms amendment that 
would have banned federal funds for cleanneedle programs under 
such programs drug addicts receive the clean needles in exchange 
for shared dirty needles that may be contaminated with the aids 
virus 
the senate twice rejected the helms version of the plan but 
approved by voice vote a compromise that bans such use of federal 
money unless the surgeon general deems the programs effective in 
stopping drug abuse or the spread of aids among addicts 
kennedy called the helms cleanneedle amendments poorly 
crafted political mischief being thrown out as no more than a 
harassing technique against a popular bill he said it is much 
too early to decide that needleexchange programs dont work and 
shouldnt be used 
but helms condemned the compromise saying surgeon general c 
everett koop has already said the programs may be a good idea 
its just a matter of time before federal money is spent on 
them helms said 
kennedy also derailed another amendment that would have required 
state certification that no aids patient would be denied routine 
nutrition or hydration if that would lead to death 
this amendment vigorously protects the rights of aids 
victims said armstrong sponsor of the measure but the senate 
after nearly three hours of discussion instead approved 6036 a 
kennedy substitute asking the congressional biomedical ethics board 
to study the problem as it relates to patients with any disease 
those senators voting against the aids bill were helms william 
armstrong rcolo james mcclure ridaho and malcolm wallop 
rwyo not voting on the bill were sens joseph biden ddel

a woman accused of killing her husband and 
another woman with cyanidelaced excedrin wrote a bank five days 
before his death to say the couples money problems would soon be 
over a prosecutor said thursday 
but under crossexamination by assistant us attorney joanne 
maida stella nickell denied telling fbi investigators that she 
expected to benefit from the 1986 death of bruce nickell 52 
i told them i didnt expect to benefit at all because money 
was not important to me my husband was i would have sooner had 
him than any amount of money mrs nickell said 
the 44yearold auburn woman is accused of five instances of 
tampering with overthecounter medicine including two cases 
involving deaths in the first such deathbytampering ever to go 
to trial in this country 
both the defense and the prosecution rested their cases later 
thursday and closing arguments were scheduled for monday 
prosecutors charge mrs nickell plotted the death of her husband 
to collect 176000 in insurance benefits and put other tainted 
painrelievers on the shelves of area drugstores to make the 
tampering appear random 
sue katherine snow 40 of auburn also died in june 1986 after 
swallowing cyanidelaced excedrin if convicted mrs nickell could 
face life in prison 
ms maida called a rebuttal witness who said mrs nickells 
daughter cindy hamilton told her of mrs nickells plans in 
november 1985 more than seven months before nickell died 
the witness katherine parker of tacoma said ms hamilton her 
former roommate told her katy do you know what my mother just 
said to me she asked me how much cocaine it would take to kill a 
person 
ms hamilton said that her mother had been talking about 
getting rid of her father she was getting tired of him ms 
parker said 
ms hamilton had testified tuesday that her mother had discussed 
putting cocaine in nickells iced tea to make his death look like 
an overdose 
mrs nickell asked wednesday if she had ever told her daughter 
that she intended to poison her husband with cyanide or that she 
had attempted to kill her husband replied no 
earlier thursday under questioning by ms maida mrs nickell 
confirmed that she and her husband owed three banks and an 
investment company 8553 in april and may of 1986 but she denied 
that their financial situation was getting worse 
on april 25 mrs nickell wrote one bank that she was having 
marriage problems that would soon be solved five days before 
nickells death she wrote the same bank that my payments will 
now stay current maida said 
mrs nickells attorney public defender tom hillier ended his 
examination of her by asking if she killed her husband 
no i did not she answered in an steady voice 
the thought never entered my mind and never would because i 
loved bruce too much she said theres no way id ever think 
of getting rid of him 
hillier also asked her if she tried to copy the unsolved tylenol 
tampering case in which seven people died in the chicago area in 
1982 mrs nickell denied that accusation raised by her daughter 
in earlier testimony as well as claims she planned to leave her 
husband 
ms maida had mrs nickell read passages about cyanide from 
deadly harvest a library book mrs nickell borrowed in 1983 
and 1984 the book dealt with poisons and poisonous plants 
cyanide is often employed as the lethal substance in murder 
mysteries nickell read slowly as a packed courtroom and a us 
district court jury listened 
mrs nickell denied taking notes from deadly harvest when 
ms maida said some of mrs nickells 87 fingerprints found in the 
book were cut off by a straight line as if by a piece of notebook 
paper 
during her testimony wednesday mrs nickell tearfully told of 
watching nickell collapse saying she never knew he was dying 
babe i feel like im going to pass out she quoted her 
husband as saying before he collapsed at their home june 5 1986 
mrs nickell described her husband as a loving goodnatured man 
with a sense of humor she denied telling family members her 
marriage was unhappy or that their periodic financial stresseshad 
threatened their marriage 
prosecutors allege she forged her husbands signature on 
insurance paperwork but she said signed the forms with his 
permission because he despised paperwork

federal prosecutors are increasingly concerned 
about vacancies at the top of the justice department which attorney 
general edwin meese iii has been unable to fill for nearly a month 
us attorneys held a lengthy discussion about the vacancy in 
the departments no 2 post concluding in an informal vote that 
they want one of their colleagues rather than someone from outside 
the department to fill the position said three department 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
the consensus at tuesdays meeting at the justice department was 
that robert ulrich the us attorney in kansas city should be 
chosen by meese to become deputy attorney general said the sources

strikes in poland pose a new challenge to 
kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev just as he seeks to ease 
eastwest tension by declaring that he will withdraw from 
afghanistan and loosen controls in eastern europe 
gorbachev is counting on better relations with the west to give 
him breathing space for badly needed economic reforms in the soviet 
union 
a new polish crisis would pose a dilemma for him 
if gorbachev is perceived in the west as backing violent 
suppression of strikes in poland it could spoil the mood at the

for more than 60 years salem school 
has quietly educated europes elite including britains prince 
philip queen sophia of spain and golo mann the historian and son 
of nobel prize novelist thomas mann 
but the count who lives in a castle next door here in tranquil 
foothills near lake constance has accused salems officials of 
permitting widespread sexual misconduct and alcohol abuse among its 
teenage students 
the officials call the charges baseless and say the school is a 
victim of a vicious assault by count max von baden whose family 
owns the school property 
these charges are only a pretext for what is in reality his 
bitter fight to gain control of the school bernhard bueb the 
schools director said in an interview 
he added that relations between school authorities and the count 
soured in 1980 when a pregnant unmarried teacher was allowed to 
stay on a similar case in 1984 further fueled the counts 
displeasure with the school he said 
in a so far unsuccessful legal bid to evict the school from the 
property the count has cited alleged examples of sexual encounters 
between students on school grounds and alcohol and drug abuse as 
proof that salem is no longer fulfilling its mission 
he claimed former students recounted allegations that boys had 
used pass keys to enter girls dormitories and that hashish had 
been found on school grounds in 1985 
the count also maintained that the school has become too 
progressive and has strayed from the educational precepts of its 
founder kurt hahn a jew who presided over the school until he was 
forced to flee nazi persecution in 1933 
salem school was founded in 1920 by hahn and prince max von 
baden count maxs grandfather 
the prince allowed the school to use the grounds and buildings 
of a medieval monastery and was its benefactor until his death in 
1929 
the von baden family remained directly involved in the school 
until 1959 when the counts father declared it independent of 
family control 
since then the familys involvement has been largely 
ceremonial with only a rental agreement binding it to the school 
the agreement expires in 1999 
golo mann who attended salem in 192327 said recently he has 
no regrets and looks back fondly on his four years there 
it was a little spartan but it strengthened my character 
prince philip entered the school in 1933 in the last days of 
its leadership under hahn after hahn fled and founded a new school 
in gordonstoun scotland in 1934 philip remained his pupil there 
the prince later sent his sons charles andrew and edward to 
the gordonstoun school which is run on the same stringent 
principles as the salem school 
when queen sophia of spain attended the salem school as a 
princess of greece in 195155 it was run by an uncle on her 
mothers side 
she enjoyed attending the school and has been back on several 
occasions to visit said a retired administrator of the school 
today salem school has 242 pupils 14 to 17 years old tuition 
averages about 16500 a year 
students stroll across manicured castle grounds to classes in 
restored 13thcentury buildings all under the watchful and 
critical eye of the count who lives in an 18thcentury baroque 
castle next door 
hahns founding and guiding principle for the school was the 
conviction that the body and character must be developed as well as 
the mind 
smoking alcohol and sexual contact were forbidden 
each day began with a morning jog every student was required to 
wear a uniform exercise and take two cold showers a day 
the uniforms are gone now and so are the cold showers 
the morning jog remains but the oldest students are allowed to 
smoke off campus and congregate on weekends in local pubs approved 
by school officials 
society and education have changed since our school was 
founded bueb said 
he denied the counts charges that a permissive atmosphere had 
led students to run amok in sexual and alcoholic excess 
of course there have been instances when students have had too 
much to drink or have been caught having relations at the school 
bueb said but the count makes it look like this sort of thing 
happens every day when in fact his examples stem from incidents 
that occurred over 12 years 
bueb said pupils found to be drunk must perform 20 hours of work 
and that those caught with illegal drugs are immediately expelled 
a 1986 decision by an abitration court found insufficient 
evidence to warrant granting the counts request to immediately 
terminate the schools lease a court in constance recently upheld 
the ruling 
but the count has said he would seek a new arbitration hearing 
this time to impose hefty rent increases and renewed demands that 
the school vacate the property 
he said he wants to use the property for his own school that 
will again conform to hahns priniciples

some foreign embassies are cashing in on the high 
value of real estate in central tokyo 
australia is selling its tokyo property to help balance the 
budget back home 
mainland china is doing it to finance a new ambassadors 
residence in tokyo 
the argentine embassy has refused to comment on japanese press 
reports that it is looking to sell its ambassadors residence to 
help pay for the building of argentinas new capital city 
but the diplomatic missions of poorer countries complain of 
being priced out of tokyo 
the african nation of uganda for example closed its embassy in 
tokyo last year and its mission in china now doubles as the embassy 
for japan 
embassy land sales have generated waves in diplomatic channels 
because local authorities are trying to lower prices in hopes of 
stemming further increases in property prices in the worlds most 
expensive city 
the australian government decided it would reduce its current 
account deficit by selling some of its assets including 
onethird of its land in tokyo said an embassy spokesman the 
high value of the yen and booming real estate were factors in the 
government decision to sell 
australias 15 acres of prime land with a pond and many trees 
is in the posh minato ward and according to the spokesman was 
recently sold to a consortium of four japanese and two australian 
firms 
the bid price was 475 million or according to news reports 
25 times the asking price for adjacent land 
it wasnt exactly double the standard price but it was 
slightly too high said a metropolitan government official 
speaking only on condition of anonymity 
we told them to lower the price otherwise it would jack up 
the price of the surrounding area he added 
according to japanese land law foreign missions are free to 
sell their property at any cost the metropolitan government 
official said but in light of the recent acceleration in prices 
sellers are required to report terms of sales to the government 
before signing contracts 
we then advise them if the price is too high the official 
said but the city has no power to stop a sale 
according to the governmentrun national land agency the cost 
of residential real estate skyrocketed a record 689 percent in 
fiscal 1987 almost double the previous high of 359 percent in 
1973 and nearly three times the 1986 increase of 238 percent 
the agency attributed the phenomenal rise to speculative buying 
prompted by money surpluses and lowered interest rates 
while big powers like the united states and the soviet union 
seem settled on their prime embassy grounds the chinese embassy is 
looking to unload part of its property for a reported 111 million 
we want to sell the land to purchase another property for 
building our ambassadors residence said an embassy official 
the embassy of zambia which rents the property it occupies is 
threatened by a redevelopment plan that would raze the mission 
buildings to make way for a highrise business complex 
if our landlord is bought out we will be too said 
ambassador boniface zulu we will not stand in the way of 
progress though we like it here and want to stay 
but shozo yamaguchi the landlord is anxious to sell 
instead of all these little houses it would be better to have 
a highrise he said 
for us landlords renting to diplomats is like volunteer 
work if there is some problem with rent payment the foreign 
ministry wont touch it but they also urge us not to evict 
diplomats for fear of repercussions 
all we can do is cry ourselves to sleep 
the zambian predicament reflects a growing problem among foreign 
missions in tokyo 
some operate with skeleton staffs because of the high cost of 
living in tokyo 
late last year a group of six ambassadors met with foreign 
minister sosuke uno and asked the government to provide 
inexpensive land for construction of embassyrelated buildings in 
tokyo a foreign ministry official said 
the ministry set up a study group to discuss the proposal the 
official said but it has not come up with any concrete ideas

it was january 1983 and the new michael stanley 
dukakis was at house speaker tom mcgees door 
dukakis back for a second term as governor four years after he 
was bounced from office was chastened wary and ready to play ball 
from the first day he came back he was an entirely different 
person said mcgee who had fumed about having to wait outside 
dukakis office during his first term as governor during the 
four years he was out he certainly learned how to deal with 
people he leaned on us for advice which was unheard of in the 
first term 
dukakis leaned on nobody for advice in his first term he 
appeared arrogant and aloof as he defiantly refused pleas from 
mcgee and other legislative leaders to raise taxes as the state 
teetered on the edge of bankruptcy 
barney frank now a liberal democratic congressman from 
massachusetts but at the time a state legislator is quoted in a 
recent biography of dukakis as saying everyone in america except 
him knew he had to raise taxes 
instead dukakis cut state spending refused to give state 
workers a costofliving increase at a time of doubledigit 
inflation and slashed thousands from the welfare rolls liberal 
activists who had helped elect dukakis labeled him a turncoat 
eleven months after taking office he finally gave in and signed 
the largest tax hike in massachusetts history an income tax 
surcharge coupled with an increase in the sales tax although he 
would enjoy some legislative successes in the next three years he 
never recovered from the furor caused by the tax hike and program 
cuts 
he had alienated probably every group that had been with 
him said mcgee and on top of that he didnt really campaign 
hard enough 
so in the democratic primary in 1978 democrats rejected dukakis 
for renomination choosing instead a conservative edward j king 
dukakis spent his years out of office lecturing at harvards 
john f kennedy school of government 
returned to office in 1982 and reelected in 1986 he has 
changed his ways he listens to others now and he champions causes 
that while complex are for the most part popular 
this is not a fellow who has taken a lot of risks in his 
career said martin linsky a former republican legislator who 
now teaches at the kennedy school he represents integrity and 
competence hes not a person who tackles highly provocative issues 
in a challenging way 
he even has run the risk of being labeled a flipflopper by 
changing course on a couple of key issues 
dukakis the compromiser was most in evidence recently when he 
announced he would not fight efforts to keep firstdegree murderers 
from getting furloughs from prison he supports furloughs but the 
concept fell into disfavor with legislators after a convicted 
murderer on furlough fled to maryland and raped a woman 
dukakis said he changed his mind as any good manager would when 
confronted with such strong sentiment 
the new michael dukakis started his second term on a roll the 
state republican party was in disarray and massachusetts was in the 
midst of a stunning economic turnaround anchored by the booming 
hightech industry that had settled in the area to draw from the 
brain banks of nearby universities unemployment which had 
approached 13 percent in 1975 had plummeted below 4 percent 
people started referring to the massachusetts miracle 
as a presidential candidate dukakis has been criticized on the 
grounds he was taking undeserved credit for the state economy 
studies have attributed most of the boom to high tech but also 
have credited dukakis for not impeding progress and for innovative 
programs to steer businesses away from the boston area and into 
depressed shoe and textile mill cities 
dukakis makes frequent references these days to perhaps his 
three greatest achievements as governor legislation guaranteeing 
health care to all workers a jobs training program for welfare 
recipients that state officials say has resulted in 45000 job 
placements and reduced the state welfare caseload and a vigorous 
tax enforcement program credited with turning the 300 million 
deficit that dukakis inherited from king into a 500 million 
surplus 
the welfare program employment training and the tax 
enforcement package were enacted during dukakis second term he 
also won passage of a condominium conversion bill protecting 
tenants a law requiring employers to notify workers about the use 
of toxic materials and a plantclosing law he now trumpets on the 
campaign trail it encourages tottering businesses to notify the 
state before shutting down and provides jobtraining programs for 
workers in danger of losing their jobs 
instructive of dukakis new style was the way he handled the tax 
collection package known as reap revenue enhancement and 
protection 
publishing the names of tax scofflaws in newspapers and shutting 
down businesses that owed taxes were not overwhelmingly popular 
ideas in his first term dukakis likely would have dropped the 
package on the legislature with a takeitorleaveit attitude 
instead he called together an array of lawmakers and interest 
groups 
he told them they would have to fight for smaller slices or 
give him the resources he needed recalls ira jackson a former 
state tax commissioner he listened they listened and we got it 
all 
the legislature during his second term did reject some dukakis 
ideas a new business tax to fund infrastructure programs a gay 
rights bill and a proposal to finance the state pension fund 
liability which has kept massachusetts from getting a top bond 
rating 
as massachusetts prospered and dukakis and his state began to 
get national attention there were growing signs the governor had 
an eye on the national political landscape

in 1984 he was considered a possible running mate for walter 
mondale and was given several roles within the national democratic 
party and the national governors association traveling to 
washington and elsewhere promoting his jobsforwelfare recipients 
program and his tax collection ideas his peers designated him the 
nations most effective governor 
his willingness to make deals and a good sense of timing were 
serving him well 
dukakis who had vetoed a 1984 tax cut signed several tax 
reductions in the next three years even a repeal of the tax 
surcharge that remained in place from his first term 
he won a third term in 1986 with nearly 70 percent of the vote 
now he boasts that he has experience mopping up republican red 
ink while cutting taxes 
the assertion draws mixed reviews back home 
i saw his ads in pennsylvania when i was home visiting said 
barbara anderson executive director of an antitax lobby called 
citizens for limited taxation those people out there dont know 
that he was dragged kicking and screaming into those tax cuts the 
reputation is a fabricated myth 
linsky and boston democratic political consultant michael 
goldman disagree 
he did sign those tax cuts and he can say that said linsky 
he doesnt say he proposed them 
anything is fair play in the political arena said goldman 
politicians get more blame than they deserve for some things and 
they also tend to get more credit than they deserve for others 
still some projections say spending will have to be rolled back 
or the state could face a 200 million deficit by the end of the 
current fiscal year 
i think many people who are familiar with financial management 
are laughing when people say our state is in great fiscal shape 
said alexander tennant executive director of the state republican 
party 
the gop and anderson blame dukakis for the new budget crunch 
saying he should have put money aside instead of increasing state 
spending by nearly 1 billion a year since returning to office yet 
they also mounted much of the pressure that led to the tax cuts 
anyone can manage on a billiondollarayear increase said 
anderson wait until the miracle worker is facing the national 
deficit hell do what hes done before cut services and raise 
taxes 
but that first term was a long time ago massachusetts is a 
different state and dukakis a different politician 
despite facing token republican opposition in 1986 he 
campaigned hard mindful of 1978 and perhaps with an eye on 
national exposure beginning with his neighbors to the north hosts 
of the allimportant new hampshire presidential primary 
he had said little during his first term while construction was 
under way at new hampshires seabrook nuclear power plant just over 
the massachusetts border but he became a loud critic in recent 
years 
dukakis now refuses to submit federally required evacuation 
plans for massachusetts towns near seabrook blocking the plant 
from opening polls show a majority of new hampshire residents 
oppose seabrook 
dukakis later began to criticize the troubled pilgrim nuclear 
power plant in his own state the nuclear regulatory commission 
considers it one of the nations worst 
the plant has been closed on the nrcs orders for two years and 
dukakis has demanded that state officials be permitted to question 
managers about safety issues before the plant can be reopened 
shortly after being elected to his current term dukakis 
introduced the health care measure a firstinthe nation proposal 
that guarantees health insurance to virtually all workers by 1992 
he was so eager to get the idea enacted into law that his original 
bill was derided by both parties as poorly conceived and had to be 
completely reworked 
dukakis touts the plan as a national model but critics say it 
will not work in states without a strong economy 
the governor generally is considered a good manager but several 
incidents involving subordinates have stirred doubts 
he was shaken early in his presidential campaign when it came 
out that his top aide john sasso had leaked to reporters a 
videotape showing that one of dukakis rival in the presidential 
campaign sen joseph biden of delaware had used the words and 
sentiments of a british politician as though they were his own the 
disclosure forced biden out of the presidential race 
dukakis who had said he disliked negative campaigning said his 
campaign had not been responsible for the leak 
later sasso owned up to his role showing that dukakis had been 
kept in the dark by his closest adviser on an explosive issue at 
first dukakis said he would not fire sasso then he reluctantly 
accepted his resignation 
in another incident a longtime dukakis campaign organizer 
appointed president at bridgewater state college pleaded guilty 
this month to diverting 80000 in federal money for personal use 
while he was in charge of the states adult education program 
and in 1986 it was disclosed that high state officials 
authorized a 10000 payment to a student who had accused the 
president of westfield state college of sexually assaulting him 
linsky believes voters consider dukakis personally above 
reproach in these incidents because of his role as a reformist 
legislator in the 1960s and the mr clean public image he has 
created by his family man approach to his work 
in that sense hes like president reagan not in the 
teflon sense but in the sense that he himself has a great deal of 
integrity and that he is very comfortable with himself not a 
person who goes around conveying a lot of selfdoubt said linksy

after years of problems with old facilities and 
foreign competition and threatened and actual bankruptcies the 
steel industry is reclaiming its status in the american industrial 
scene 
its return couldnt have been more effectively stated than on 
april 26 when usx the no 1 steelmaker bethlehem 
wheelingpittsburgh and national reported solid earnings 
improvements 
just a year ago it was another story usx was in the red 
bethelehem was the subject of bankruptcy rumors wheeling had filed 
for protection under the bankruptcy laws and national was losing 
money 
still 1987 wasnt so bad for the industry as a whole it was 
the first profitable year since 1981 yes six straight years in 
the red for what used to be considered the symbol of american 
industrial might 
now 1988 is shaping up as an even better year than 1987 
reflecting this steel stocks are in favor again and rising 
moreover steel analysts are saying that the new steel industry 
probably will be profitable for a long time to come a consequence 
not just of the lower dollar but of a long and costly rejuvenation 
over the past decade or so 
says harvey katz analyst for value line the investment case 
for steel is the strongest its been in years both for the 
performanceminded and for those with a three to fiveyear 
perspective 
among other things the industry has rid itself of dated 
facilities shrunk itself by onethird installed continuous 
casting systems that reduce labor materials and energy costs and 
retreated from illconceived diversifications 
its seemingly agesold complaint about high labor costs 
workers in the steel industry commonly received much higher wages 
than in comparable industries seems to have been resolved unions 
have made wage concessions 
the turnabout was a painful one marked by years of outraged 
charges of unfair foreign competition demands for government 
protection confrontations with environmentalists troubles with 
labor and some say poor management 
oldtime steel management was composed of dedicated individuals 
who didnt like outsiders including the us government telling 
them what they must do while committed to their industry they 
might also have been committed to oldfashioned techniques 
whatever they were no match for the newcomers 
foreign steel made in new plants by new techniques some 
developed in the united states but not widely employed here 
flooded the country lower foreign wages helped so did the 
dollars relatively high value in foreign trade 
at times it looked hopeless a theory developed that the steel 
industry for years to come would wander the world with newly 
industrialized nations snatching business from older producers with 
old equipment and rising wages 
it was a terrible thought for americans to contemplate a steel 
industry they had considered invulnerable when the same problems 
began arising in automotive and other industries the brooding 
intensified 
it was a long road back for us manufacturers who seemed 
reluctant to believe they shouldnt remain no 1 even if their 
products werent it was hard to swallow pride but necessary to do 
so before the recovery could begin 
now that steel producers seem competitive again the marketplace 
might give them a further thrust says katz underlying his 
optimism he says is not just the lower dollar but the need for 
refurbishing the us infrastructure 
reminders of this need come every day in reports of bridges 
requiring repairs or replacement few bridges are built anywhere 
these days without a lot of steel in them

convincing parents that top prep schools are 
worth tuitions exceeding 10000 isnt always easy but even 
harder are the challenges of ensuring classrooms are filled in 
future years with ethnically diverse students and faculty 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
perhaps the least of the 
challenges facing the private school that proclaims itself the 
pearl of the midwest is explaining to parents why its worth 
12000 annual tuition 
the 300acre campus of cranbrook kingswood school outside 
detroit has the requisite prepschool luxuries a hockey arena 
bowling alleys indoor and outdoor tennis courts where players 
strokes are videotaped and an oldtime swimming hole called lake 
jonah so named because its shaped like a whale 
for its 800 students each day is an aesthetic feast from the 
tapestries and art deco light fixtures down to the very doorknobs 
and lunchroom chairs these and practically everything else were 
designed or influenced by famed finnish architect eliel saarinen 
who lived and taught here from 1925 to his death in 1950 
but just as the virtues of top private schools like this arent 
just skindeep neither are the problems 
with the schoolage population declining and prep school 
tuitions sometimes rivaling ivy league colleges officials worry 
about future enrollments and are casting their recruiting nets from 
coast to coast 
the nations approximately 1700 independent private schools 
those not receiving tax or church funds enroll some 600000 
students up 97 percent over the last decade 
but the number of students taking private school admissions 
tests dropped by 14 percent in the last two years according to the 
national association of independent schools 
a few years ago cranbrook kingswood could almost fill its 
classes with students just from michigan and surrounding midwestern 
states now the school recruits from as far away as southern 
florida and california 
if we didnt do that kind of thing we wouldnt be in good 
shape in five years because of the demographics the best schools 
are out there all the time said admissions director bruce 
kridler whose travel budget has risen from 500 to 15000 in 
recent years and who now makes routine visits to 35 cities in 17 
states 
like other prep schools cranbrook kingswood has constantly 
fought a perception of elitism the formerly allwhite 
predominantly episcopalian school is now 25 percent jewish and 25 
percent persons of color including indians asianamericans and 
blacks a change due largely to aggressive minority student 
recruiting and a 158 million endowment that helps make sizable 
scholarships possible 
cranbrook kingswood is the most expensive boarding school in 
michigan and among the most expensive in the midwest but it is a 
bargain compared with the priciest eastern schools 
leland academy in franklin mass is the nations most 
expensive private college preparatory school charging 18500 for 
a years tuition fees room and board cranbrook kingswood at 
12000 ranks 44th in the nation 
another stubborn problem is finding minority teachers of 90 
upperschool faculty members four are black one is hispanic one 
is asianamerican 
but such challenges seem remote at 8 am as english teacher 
peter fayroian poured the coffee in his carpeted classroom for a 
dozen students about half the size of most public school classes 
he kicked off a discussion on the religious and moral 
implications of herman hesses classic siddhartha should we 
prepare to come to the presence of the holy on a motorcycle he 
asked what should be the relationship between technology and the 
holy 
in russ conners biology lab nine juniors toil on a typically 
complex question at what wavelengths does chlorophyll in plants 
absorb the most light 
they use a college text conner said and i dont give 
them a whole lot of answers 
academically ive never seen anything like it said jerry 
rubino from nearby sterling heights mich whose daughter lisa is 
an 11thgrade day student public school kids might come home at 
230 or 3 in the afternoon but my daughter typically isnt home 
until 6 or 7 at night and then she buries herself in the books 
its a school rule that the 270 boarding students must be in 
their rooms studying every evening sunday through thursday 
upon graduation each students name is handcarved into the oak 
walls of alumni court those names include such luminaries as 
wyoming senator alan k simpson daniel ellsberg who leaked the 
pentagon papers poet brad leithauser and new republic editor 
michael kinsley 
nonetheless schools that tout themselves as training grounds 
for future leaders in an increasingly diverse world simply cant 
ignore the issues of race and ethnicity any longer said school 
president and acting director lillian bauder 
yet private schools remain overwhelmingly white according to 
the naiss own statistics in 198687 independent school 
enrollments were 47 percent black 18 percent hispanic 47 
percent asianamerican and 01 percent native american 
i recruit in cabrini green said kridler referring to an 
allblack chicago housing project and i go to mexicanamerican 
neighborhoods 
inner city kids think were not affordable i talk a lot about 
financial aid opportunities kridler said 
about 24 percent of students in the upper school grades 912 
get financial aid covering twothirds of need on average still 
22 students accepted last year did not enroll for money reasons 
low teacher salaries remain a source of frustration especially 
for younger faculty even though median salaries have risen 7000 
in five years nationally beginning private school teachers make 
1200019000 and average salaries for all such teachers was 
23000 about 5000 less than public school teachers 
fayroian a 25yearold firstyear teacher earns 16300 he 
says he is up at 4 am and in bed at midnight spending his day 
and evening grading papers teaching classes and meeting with 
students the salary can be disheartening for the amount of work 
we do he said 
top scale at cranbrook kingswood is 34000 and the median is 
25600 theres no teacher union and no tenure 
on the other hand private school teachers generally have more 
freedom to choose textbooks and shape their lessons free of 
bureaucratic interference 
at cranbrook kingswood the resulting curriculum is so rigorous 
many students find college easy by comparison the school recently 
studied its recent graduates and found their freshman grades often 
improved compared with their grades at cranbrook kingswood 
students who averaged 20 to 25 at the prep school averaged 286 
as college freshmen for example 
what makes the grind worth it is the extraordinarily high 
probability of admission to one of the better us colleges 
of 190 graduates in 1987 187 went to college 14 as national 
merit finalists their scholastic aptitude test scores averaged 
1100 of a possible 1600 compared with a national average of 906 
mark botvinick a 17yearold senior from bloomfield hills 
whose public schools lead the state nonetheless chose to come here 
and was recently granted early acceptance at his dream school duke 
university 
denise brainard a 12th grader from crosslands wva says 
theres no comparison between what she gets here and what she would 
have gotten at her hometown school 
private schools are very stereotyped she said people 
think theyre very snobby but were not we come here for the 
education i dont know what my chances would have been at nitro 
high school in crosslands wva

tony awardwinner ron richardson has done something 
very few american actors would even think of trying hes relearned 
his lines in japanese to bring a broadway hit to tokyo 
his performance as jim the slave friend of huckleberry finn 
delights japanese audiences and has made him and the musical big 
river a big success 
when i walk out onto the stage and deliver my first line i 
hear a loud swift intake of breath richardson said the 
audience is surprised to see a black man walk out onto the stage 
and speak in japanese 
richardson who originated the role in the play which won the 
tony for best musical in 1985 said audiences are also surprised by 
his booming voice and though generally more quiet and reserved 
than americans react with a lot of noise themselves when the show 
is over 
they like me richardson laughed weve been getting an 
incredible reaction i think the japanese forget that they are in 
japan 
before coming to tokyo richardson a 36yearold native of 
philadelphia said he really didnt know what to expect 
i came here with an open mind wide open for experiences he 
said in an interview i was prepared to make adjustments 
richardson began studying japanese last august six hours a week 
at the japan society in new york in november he came to japan on 
a promotion tour and got a chance to try out his newfound skills 
before coming back in february he secluded himself on the long 
island shore for 2 months 
it took me a very very long time to learn my lines he 
said im amazed i was able to do this up until the very end i 
really wasnt sure 
the only part of the show he didnt need to relearn was the 
songs i had to sing in english or else i wouldnt be able to 
make it the songs in english give me time to regroup he said 
three other americans are in the 29member cast but richardson 
is the only one required to make long speeches in japanese 
success hasnt left much time to get out and see the country 
but has given him a feel for tokyos workaholic pace with eight 
or nine shows a week i only see japan from my window 
being way off broadway is a pleasure though american 
musicals are a new form for the japanese cast and theyre 
dedicated he said theater people in the united states can be 
complacent but every night here is exciting 
after his first performance richardson was visited backstage by 
crown prince akihito and princess michiko who he said were warm 
and generous with praise 
richardsons parents were also in tokyo for opening night 
i come from a talented family and not much shakes them but 
this did he said they saw me in a whole new light that was 
nice

from broken hearts to broken bones more than 2 million children 
were abused and neglected across the united states last year three 
died every day 
even more alarming reports of child abuse have increased by 223 
percent over 10 years according to the national committee for the 
prevention of child abuse a nonprofit chicagobased organization 
with 67 chapters 
the case numbers rose from 669000 in 1976 to 2160000 in 1986 
although some experts say some part of the increase is due to 
heightened public awareness and state laws that make reporting 
mandatory 
tragically too many abuse cases slip past the social agencies 
meant to protect such children 
two recent cases in massachusetts underscore the agencies 
limitations in one a toddler who had already survived two 
fractured skulls was returned to her parents because an agency had 
not told the hearing judge that assault charges were pending 
against them in the other despite the best efforts of social 
workers an alcoholic mother allowed her twin daughters to starve 
to death 
child abuse ranges from a lack of affection to death 
based on incomplete surveys and projections the national 
committee for the prevention of child abuse estimated that 1132 
children died of abuse last year but cindy moelis a research 
analyst for the committee said the number could be as high as 
5000 
many deaths are often attributed to other causes such as 
sudden infant death syndrome but are suspected to have been caused 
by child abuse said ms moelis 
according to recent committee findings at least 25 percent of 
the fatal cases had previously been referred to authorities but 
fell through the cracks because there wasnt enough coordination 
among between agencies 
ms moelis said authorities are so overwhelmed by their workload 
that its very difficult to assess which families are most at 
risk of seriously harming their child 
in about half the cases abuse takes the form of physical 
neglect according to a 1984 report from the american association 
for protecting children based in denver children are not properly 
fed clothed or given medical care an additional 25 percent are 
physically abused 14 percent are sexually assaulted and 10 percent 
suffer emotional abuse such as unreasonable parental demands or 
lack of caring in 85 percent of the cases the abusers are the 
parents 
many states are trying to deal more effectively with child abuse 
thirtytwo states have review committees to examine child abuse 
deaths fifteen states are trying to find better ways to flag the 
greatest risk cases six states have passed or proposed legislation 
to toughen sentences for abusers who kill children 
according to parents anonymous a selfhelp group aimed at 
heading off abuse before it occurs most abusive parents are under 
stress unable to meet their own needs or bothered by something 
from their own childhoods 
judi czimbal director of program development for massachusetts 
parents anonymous said the main problems are isolation feelings 
of being overwhelmed financial problems and fatigue 
they want to be good parents but they often dont know how 
said mrs czimbal they wind up getting very angry and theyll 
take their frustrations out on a child without wanting to

the 18monthold twins had been dead 
at least 14 hours when they were found in their sheetless crib dec 
20 1983 one weighed 14 pounds the other 11 less than half the 
normal weight of babies their age 
they had starved to death in the middle of the largest city in 
western massachusetts in the middle of a housing project before 
the eyes of their mother 
valarie miller 33 was sentenced oct 8 1987 to six to nine 
years in state prison after pleading guilty to two counts of 
manslaughter by negligence but the judge cut the sentence to one 
year in prison and five years probation 
detective capt ernest stelzer said the case was the most 
extreme case of negligence he had seen in 24 years on the force 
medical examiner loren mednick testified at the inquest that the 
children had no fat around their organs and were so dehydrated they 
lacked even eye fluid 
the case took hampden county district attorney matthew j ryan 
more than three years to resolve because of constant procedural 
delays and the inquest results from 1984 were made public only 
recently 
miller refused to be interviewed but now that she is in prison 
neighbors are talking and court records and interviews help paint 
the painful picture of how it happened 
latashia and latoya miller were born june 6 1982 a month 
early although underdeveloped they appeared healthy to state 
social workers and checked out fine with doctors up through their 
last visit in august 1983 
their mother however seemed depressed i had the feeling 
that she was perhaps overwhelmed by the care of two children 
barbara buell a nurse with the early childhood service team who 
visited the family until the twins were 6 months old testified at 
the inquest 
a small solitary woman miller lived with the twins in a 
twobedroom apartment in a project tucked into a residential 
neighborhood of springfield buell said the apartment was always 
neat when she visited but was devoid of toys or other signs of 
children 
youd never think the children were living with her she 
said in a recent interview 
she also said the mother resisted help 
i know everybody made efforts to keep her in counseling and 
they werent too successful buell said oh sure shed show 
up but shed just sit there and look away from you 
neighbors said miller socialized in the summertime often 
bringing the babies to barbeques held nightly in the yards of the 
dozen red white and blue fourfamily apartment houses 
she drank the neighbors said 
she also visited other apartments for what appeared to be an 
afternoon drinking ritual they said 
the twins were left behind on those occasions 
some of the time she came back she was high or just 
staggering a downstairs neighbor earl harris testified at the 
inquest 
the twins father harrison wright visitedeach thursday a 
married man whod met miller at a bar where they worked wright 
lived with his family on the other side of town but testified that 
he sneaked away regularly to see his outofwedlock daughters 
bringing them diapers and cookies when i have an extra couple of 
dollars 
wright testified that they were fed adult food like mashed 
potatoes and that when he mentioned their thinness to their 
mother she told him they had a cold and werent eating properly 
a week before the twins died gloria green who lived across the 
street sais she saw them lying in their crib a bottle in each 
hand and nothing in the bottle 
despite the clues however it didnt dawn on me she wasnt 
taking care of them she said in an interview she added that she 
was afraid to report miller a fear experts say is common to 
friends and relatives of alcoholics 
if you see somebody coughing to death you say how about 
getting to a doctor but alcoholism is another thing said 
collette ross a counselor at alcoholism services of greater 
springfield people feel they are infringing on the alcoholics 
right to privacy 
millers boyfriend bobbie l stovall testified that he and 
miller spent the evening of dec 19 and the early hours of dec 20 
1983 at her apartment drinking vodka and beer she later told 
police the children fussed all night they cried but that is not 
unusual they do that sometime i checked on them and they were 
ok 
the police say she added i dont remember if i fed the kids 
today or not it might have been yesterday i think i gave them 
some water today 
late that day after she had slept some hours she visited 
green drank two beers and a halfpint of vodka left and 20 
minutes later called green from a pay phone according to police 
reports and interviews 
sobbing and with loud music playing in the background she 
said i need a drink bad she said she was having a lot of 
problems but she wouldnt say what green said 
not long afterwards in the early evening a few neighbors were 
in a downstairs apartment when miller ran to them crying no no 
my babies is dead both of them 
harris the neighbor ran upstairs and found the children on 
their sides staring at one another he later testified they 
were pronounced dead at the local hospital 
on jan 25 1985 more than two years after her babies withered 
away in their crib miller pleaded guilty to two counts of 
manslaughter by negligence and two counts of failing to supply 
adequate care and guidance 
when it came time for sentencing assistant district attorney 
elizabeth scheibel urged hampden county superior court judge george 
c keady jr to imprison miller for an unspecified period saying 
motherhood carries great responsibility and miss miller did 
not live up to that responsibility here alcoholism should not 
excuse what she did or didnt do 
i cannot disagree keady replied i dont think we can 
forget about these two children even back to pregnancy these 
children were at her mercy 
after the inquest free on personal recognizance miller lived 
for a time with her mother she had another child despite birth 
control counseling 
the boy who recently turned 2 also failed to thrive under her 
care he was placed temporarily in a foster home and then put in 
the custody of his grandmother audrey young joining millers 
11yearold daughter who has lived with young since infancy 
she was an alcoholic that was her problem young said about 
her daughter she was never a bad girl i never had any problem 
with her 
the nurse who tried to help miller said alcohol counseling 
simply failed 
this was a case that more or less seemed to defeat the 
system buell said she couldnt be helped

earl l butz is noted for saying many things 
such as telling farmers decades ago to get bigger or get out or 
advising them during the boom export years to plant fencerow to 
fencerow 
another god put the worm in the apple man took it out 
that was one of butzs prime quips when he was secretary of 
agriculture in the early 1970s during the nixon and ford 
administrations he used it often when environmentalists complained 
about using too many chemicals on farm crops 
butz who will be 79 on july 3 is still a favorite on the 
agricultural speaking circuit and he occasionally touches raw 
nerves with his candor 
last fall butz was a guest commentator in the respected 
quarterly magazine choices which is published by the american 
agricultural economics association as an economist and dean 
emeritus of agriculture at purdue university butz is right at home 
among his professional colleagues 
butz wrote about one of his favorite topics risk and how 
americans live in a riskfilled world always have he said from 
westwardbound prairie schooners to the heavenbound rocket 
challenger of our day 
in those adventures he said some americans lost their lives 
yet all were driven to risk by the dream of something better than 
what they already had or by the dream of greater reward if the 
risk paid off 
butz said that a growing world population means that agriculture 
must push even harder to produce more on a shrinking resource base 
in doing so he said caution must be exercised that we dont go 
overboard in our hysteria to clean up the environment and make 
everything absolutely safe 
it means using more chemicals not less butz said it means a 
vertical expansion into the realm of science in order to feed 
the world there should be more biotechnology more antibiotics 
more pesticides more risktaking not less he said 
modern agricuture cannot continue to produce adequate amounts 
of safe and wholesome food without substantial use of chemicals and 
antibiotics he said 
as butz sees it one of the problems is that twothirds of 
living americans never had the experience of biting into a wormy 
apple and after seeing the worm hole wonder whether they had 
eaten the worm or whether it was still in the apple 
lets be honest about it butz said god put the worm in 
the apple man took it out man used poison to get it out 
deadly poison but the good part is that you cant buy a bad apple 
in your town today 
butz said it is completely unacceptable to believe that there 
is no way out of the problems we have created through chemicals 
and other scientific means 
unquestionably there are risks involved but none so great as 
the risk that we may quit risking try vainly to set the clock 
back and abjectly surrender the goal of a better world is the 
mistaken belief that this one is as good as can be he said 
well 
in the spring issue of the magazine butz was mauled by a couple 
of letterwriting colleagues for some of his assertions 
peter d bloome of the university of illinois said butz is 
correct about the futility of seeking a riskfree existence but 
adds that we should not become cavalier about the risks 
inherent in progress 
i can deal with the worm in my apple bloome wrote what i 
cannot deal with in my apple or my drinking water is the poison 
that killed the worm i expect science to remove the worm from my 
apple that involves an acceptable risk at an acceptable cost 
brian baker of the university of california said earl butz 
made me feel unamerican perhaps i should start smoking and riding 
a motorcycle without a helmet 
the goal of agricultural ecologists he said is not to turn 
the clock back but to design agricultural systems which are 
sustainable stable and resilient as well as productive 
biological or natural controls are preferable to contamination by 
chemicals 
butz had the last word in a postscript contending that the 
comments largely reinforce the main thesis of what he had 
written 
of course we should pursue biological natural controls 
he said but let us not become so zealous in pursuit of that goal 
that we discourage research in chemical controls we need both

healthy gains in americans personal incomes and consumer 
spending last month indicate consumers have rebounded from last 
octobers stock market crash economists say 
the commerce department said wednesday that personal incomes 
climbed 08 percent in march after a 06 percent gain in february 
it was the biggest increase since an identical 08 percent advance 
in december 
consumer spending jumped 07 percent in march the government 
reported 
analysts said spending and income figures indicated the 
consumer who cut back on purchases immediately following the 
october stock market crash had rebounded and was continuing to 
propel overall economic growth 
there is no serious consumer retrenchment going on people are 
still willing to buy said sandra shaber an economist with the 
futures group an economic forecasting firm in washington we 
shouldnt face any serious problem of a spending slump for the rest 
of the year 
but the latest economic report had little impact in the 
financial markets where stock prices edged up bond prices slipped

oil prices seesawed and then slumped in a wild 
trading session driven by speculation about the outcome of a 
meeting between opec and independent oil exporters 
on the new york mercantile exchange the june contract for west 
texas intermediate crude jumped 12 cents per barrel to 1872 by 
noon wednesday but tumbled late in the day and closed at 1827

similar swings affected refined products traded on the exchange 
the nearmonth contracts for wholesale unleaded gasoline fell 06 
cent a gallon to 5236 cents and wholesale heating oil fell 27 
cent a gallon to 5177 cents 
traders said the market strengthened in early activity because 
of indications that the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries and a group of noncartel oil exporters meeting in 
vienna might agree on 5 percent production cuts aimed at 
eliminating excess supplies and raising prices 
but later rumors hit the market that key opec member saudi 
arabia had walked out of the meeting by another unconfirmed 
account the nonopec participants at the meeting had inflated 
their production figures so the 5 percent output reduction proposal 
would be largely meaningless 
some traders who had bought oil on the hunch that prices would 
rise because of the meeting became nervous and sold accelerating 
the lateafternoon slide 
others said the market closed in a position to rally sharply if 
the opec and nonopec bargainers can devise a productioncutting

the japanese government warned thursday that the 
wideranging trade bill passed by the us congress could hurt 
international economic growth 
japan strongly fears that if the bill is enacted in its 
present form it will have a serious impact on bilateral and 
multilateral economic cooperation and may hinder the development of 
the world economy said chief government spokesman keizo obuchi 
the bill which president reagan repeatedly has threatened to 
veto toughens us retaliatory measures against countries engaged 
in unfair trade practices 
it also would impose trade sanctions against japans toshiba 
corp for its subsidiarys sale of sensitive equipment to the 
soviet union the sales violated rules of the coordinating 
committee for export control a parisbased group that regulates 
western hightechnology exports to communist nations 
hajime tamura minister of international trade and industry 
said the toshiba sanctions were regrettable because cocom 
regulations provide that each member country has responsibility for 
ensuring compliance by companies within its borders 
the senate approved the bill and sent it to reagan by a vote of 
6336 less than the twothirds majority needed to override a veto 
the presidents key objection is to a provision requiring employers 
to give advance notice of plant closings and major layoffs 
it is extremely regrettable thatthe us senate following 
the house of representatives passed the omnibus trade bill which 
contains provisions problematical for japan obuchi stated the 
government of japan strongly hopes that such a bill will not 
finally be enacted 
on wednesday japanese prime minister noboru takeshita also 
warned that the bill could damage the global economy and said 
japan would try to restrain growing protectionism in the united 
states by improving its ties with europe

by backtracking from earlier 
proposals to close an assembly plant and move some auto production 
to mexico chrysler corp has revived hopes of a quick end to early 
contract talks union negotiators say 
the automaker announced wednesday it would delay for several 
months the planned closing of its kenosha wis assembly plant and 
the transfer of kcar assembly work to mexico 
union displeasure over the kcar plan chryslers initial 
contract proposals and other developments had helped sour and bog 
down the talks which were begun earlier than usual to help ease 
growing friction between the company and the united auto workers 
following wednesdays announcements uaw vice president marc 
stepp said union bargainers were ready to negotiate into the night 
and through the weekend to make up for lost time 
i hope lee iacocca would stick around and watch this 
management in terms of how they perform so at least we can sit down 
and negotiate a contract within the next seven to 10 days 
peacefully without some other stupid announcement that this company 
is now becoming very famous for stepp said 
many union members were angered last week when chrysler 
confirmed reports that it planned to shift kcar production from 
detroit to mexico in july 
the kenosha closing has been a sore point since chrysler 
announced in january that it would close the 5500worker plant in 
september despite earlier indications to workers and wisconsin 
officials that it would be kept open another five years 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca attributed the decisions to delay 
the moves to betterthanexpected sales of kcars and of cars built 
at kenosha 
the union also had been miffed by chryslers contract proposals 
which veered sharply from a jobprotecting industrypattern 
contract established last fall at ford motor co and general motors 
corp 
on monday as the union was considering breaking off 
negotiations iacocca met with uaw president owen bieber and later 
with chrysler managers and negotiators in an effort to get the 
talks back on track 
i think weve got to cut out the rhetoric and get down to 
work on contract negotiations iacocca said wednesday 
talks on the contract which expires sept 14 and covers 66000 
active workers in 15 states opened april 18 four months early 
both sides hoped an early settlement could mend hostility over the 
kenosha closing and over chryslers aborted attempt to sell its 
acustar inc parts subsidiary earlier this year 
chrysler had planned to close the former american motors corp 
plant in kenosha in september phaseout was scheduled to begin in 
july when production of the omnihorizon was to be moved from 
kenosha to detroits jefferson avenue assembly plant 
chrysler also planned to end us kcar production when the 
omnihorizon was moved to detroit and a newark del assembly 
plant was converted from kcar production to building the kcars 
replacement a plant in toluca mexico was to fill orders for 
1989model dodge aries and plymouth reliant kcars 
instead kenosha will build the omnihorizon and other cars in 
kenosha until december giving workers up to a sixmonth respite 
the kcar will stay in detroit until the omnihorizon is moved 
there in january 
iacocca left open the possibility of boosting kcar imports from 
mexico in beginning in january but stepp said adoption of the 
industry pattern contract at chrysler before then would make it 
easier for the union to combat such a move

agricultural experts have said the governments 
goal of producing 450 million tons of grain annually by 1990 will 
be impossible to attain the official china daily reported thursday 
speakers at a meeting this week organized by the china crops 
association said it would be at least 1992 before the nations 
farmers reach the 450million ton target 
increasing grain output has been made a top priority of the 
beijing government following three straight years of disappointing 
harvests 
in 1987 the nation produced 402 million tons up from 391 
million in 1986 but still below the record 407 million tons in 1984 
premier li peng has said china must increase output to 500 
million tons by the year 2000 merely to keep up with population 
growth 
grain production has stagnated in recent years as farmers 
unhappy with low governmentset prices for grains turned to more 
lucrative cash crops such as vegetables while some landholders 
gave up farming and used their land to erect small factories 
the government has tried to encourage farmers to grow grain by 
boosting prices and giving priority to grain farmers in allotments 
of fertilizer and fuel 
experts at the conference also recommended that efforts be made 
to increase yields and open up about 3 million hectares roughly 
75 million acres of virgin land by the year 2000 they said china 
will try to sow about 13 million hectares of highyield hybrid rice 
by the turn of the century

british sugar producer tate amp lyle plc may have

even further if it hopes to win the illinoisbased corn syrup 
maker according to one industry analyst 
tate amp lyle increased its offer for staley to 35 a share from 
32 a share or a total of 133 billion on wednesday 
staley rose 50 cents to 37 a share wednesday on the new york 
stock exchange 
industry analysts had said tate amp lyles initial bid for 
staleys 304 million common shares outstanding plus its preferred 
stock was well below the companys fair market price which some 
estimated could be up to 40 a share 
the new offer indicates the seriousness by tate amp lyle to make 
a deal with staley said clinton mayer iii an analyst in new 
york with bear stearns inc the 32 bid was unrealistic this 
new offer is moving toward realism

something on it we cant make any comment staley spokesman g

now that rival oil producers have offered 
opec the help it sought for years the cartel seems unsure how to 
use it 
mexico china and four smaller independent oil producers offered 
to cut their exports by 5 percent if the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries makes a proportionally similar sacrifice 
all the opec members say theyre pleased the offer was made but 
few said whether they like the idea 
oil ministers from all 13 opec member countries arranged a 
meeting tonight to decide what to do about the proposal 
some analysts say the plan if accepted by opec and implemented 
by all 19 countries involved probably would push oil prices up to 
opecs target of 18 a barrel most opec crudes are selling in the 
open market for 16 a barrel or less 
the oil market in europe was unsettled and slightly weaker today 
in early trading londonbased traders said 
the price of brent crude from the north sea was down 25 cents 
at 1725 a barrel roughly matching declines in late new york 
trading on wednesday 
analysts said the market appeared to be viewing the opec talks 
as only a prelude to more crucial negotiations in june when the 
cartel may face tough decisions about cutting production by larger 
amounts to avert a price slide 
for now theyre just firefighting said paul mcdonald a 
londonbased oil consultant 
prices fell wednesday on the new york mercantile exchange the 
june contract west texas intermediate the most widely traded us 
crude fell 33 cents to 1827 a barrel 
paul mlotok who monitored the opec talks for the new yorkbased 
investment firm salomon brothers inc said the nations were on 
target for a possible agreement to boost prices 
but mlotok acknowledged that opec rarely makes decisions about 
reducing its oil production or its exports without long often 
unproductive negotiations 
iran a leading advocate of production cuts to help boost 
prices said on wednesday that it supported the independent 
producers proposal 
when a reporter asked libyan oil minister fawzi shakshuki if his 
government could accept the plan he replied it depends he 
didnt elaborate 
rilwanu lukman opec president and oil minister of nigeria 
sought to evade reporters questions about his countrys position 
on the exportcutting plan 
he stressed that this was the first time a group of nonopec oil 
producers offered to restrain production as a gesture of 
cooperation with the cartel 
its a good proposal in that its a proposal that weve never 
had before he said 
the position of saudi arabia the cartels largest producer and 
the worlds biggest oil exporter was equally unclear 
at one point saudi oil minister hisham nazer told reporters 
wed like greater participation in oil export cuts by 
independent producers he declined to say if his government favored 
the proposal before opec 
at another point when asked if he thought opec would accept the 
offer he replied we havent done anything yet 
six opec oil ministers met with representatives of the nonopec 
countries on wednesday to review the exportcutting plan the 
independent producers envison reductions of 200000 barrels daily 
in their exports and about 700000 barrels a day in opecs exports 
after their meeting the two groups said they shared a desire to 
see stability in oil prices and found much common ground in their 
analysis of the world oil market situation 
they stopped short of saying they agreed on how price stability 
could be achieved but sought to stress the importance of the 
meeting between opec and rival producers 
it constitutes the beginning of a new stage of cooperation 
between a large number of oilproducing countries the groups 
stated 
the six nonopec countries involved are mexico china malaysia 
egypt angola and oman colombia took part in the talks but said it 
would not join in the proposed export cuts

authorities today said nearly 3000 people 
had died in the 1984 bhopal disaster and estimated that more than 
1700 more will die over the next seven years as a result of the 
gas leak 
the figures were contained in a new relief plan that will 
provide 285 million in economic and medical aid to victims of 
toxic methylisocyanate gas released by a plant owned by a union 
carbide corp subsidiary 
the plan released by the government of central madhya pradesh 
state said 2998 people had died in the worlds worst industrial 
accident previous estimates had put the death toll at 2800 
the plan also suggests that 250 deaths will occur annually over 
the next seven years as a result of the gas leak the projection 
was the first official attempt at estimate the number of future 
deaths from the disaster 
the government already has spent 46 million on relief for 
victims of the toxic cloud which was released at 1 am on dec 3 
1984 by the pesticide plant and spread over nearby shantytowns and 
into the city of bhopal 
many gas victims have breathing problems that become 
progressively worse and ultimately cause death others will become 
ill with diseases whose symptoms include fever vomiting and 
diarrhea 
union carbide headquartered in danbury conn faces two legal 
actions in india india is suing it for 3 billion in damages in a 
civil action being heard in bhopal and has launched a criminal case 
against the company several of its subsidiaries and current and 
former officers 
on april 4 the madhya pradesh high court ordered union carbide 
to pay 192 million in interim relief to gas victims 
federal and state coffers will provide the money for the new 
economic and medical assistance for the gas victims state 
officials said the interim relief when paid will be used for 
other purposes they said 
robert d kennedy chairman of union carbide told the companys 
annual meeting in danbury on wednesday the company has not decided 
whether to appeal the ruling 
the indian government currently is sorting through 500000 
injury and loss claims to determine which are valid more than 
20000 people are known to have sustained serious injuries in the 
leak 
among those scheduled to get financial aid under the new plan 
are 509 women widowed by the gas leak and 27 children who were 
orphaned 
the plan sets aside 192000 per year for financial relief to 
the families of those who die as a result of the disaster 
since the government pays 770 in lumpsum relief for each 
death the government is anticipating 250 additional deaths each 
year for the next seven years said state officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the plan does not explain the basis for the estimate and said 
spending could be higher because it is not possible to assess the 
longterm damage 
it also says a special unit will be set up to conduct scientific 
investigations into the longrange effects of the gas 
india contends the gas leak was caused by negligence union 
carbide has said it resulted from sabotage by a distruntled 
employee 
efforts to reach an outofcourt settlement in the civil case 
failed last november although both sides agreed to continue 
talking informally 
according to sources close to the talks last fall union carbide 
had offered slightly more than 500 million to try to settle the 
case 
kennedy said on wednesday the company is spending between 7 
million and 8 million annually on expenses from the bhopal 
litigation

the government has decided to reduce 
import tariffs on wine from the present 100 percent to levels 
between 30 percent to 40 percent officials said thursday 
but south korea will reject us demands for abolition of wine 
import quota restrictions saying domestic wineries were not yet 
competitive and needed protection officials at the finance 
ministry said 
the issue is just one of several that officials of both 
countries discuss in talks set to begin here monday the united 
states hopes to bring trade between the two countries more into 
balance last year the total amounted to 10 in south koreas favor 
us officials are also expected to press this country to lift 
its import ban on beef and further open its market for cigarettes 
and other american products and services 
south korean officials said the government planned to ease 
import inspections and facilitate customs clearance of wine imports 
under foreign pressure particularly from the united states 
south korea began allowing imports of foreign wine last october 
but it imposed quotas limiting imports to 20 percent of total 
domestic consumption this year to 30 percent in 1989 and 40 
percent in 1990 before fully opening the market in 1991 
korean imports of wine in the first quarter amounted to 116 
kiloliters worth 334000 according to official statistics 
on the beef issue kim daejung leader of the main opposition 
party said at a news conference thursday that his party opposed 
us demands for abolition of the import ban 
kim said south korean farmers should not be made scapegoats 
for the us trade deficit 
he said american beef sales here would do little to cut that 
deficit and the united states instead should apply trade pressure 
on companies that export to the united states 
kim said in principle his party for peace and democracy 
supported the idea of free trade 
but there is an exception for agricultural products even in 
the united states there is a certain amount of protection 
concerning their farm products this is the case everywhere he 
said

the new york stock exchange is working on rules 
that would require member brokerages to disclose the identity of 
every customer they conduct trades for a senior big board official 
has disclosed 
such rules designed to strengthen the exchanges 
selfregulatory powers over trading abuses could enmesh the 
securities industry in controversy because of the historic 
relationship of privacy between brokers and customers 
under present rules the nyses market surveillance unit must 
ask member firms for the identities of customers believed to be 
involved in questionable trading such requests are often 
excessively timeconsuming 
richard grasso the nyses executive vice president disclosed 
the plans for tighter rules wednesday in testimony before the 
senate agriculture committee which has been holding hearings into 
progress on remedies to prevent another stock market crash the 
committee oversees the commodity futures trading commission which 
regulates stockfutures trading 
in the longer term we will be proposing rules that will 
require for regulatory purposes that firms maintain a backend 
process to identify beneficial owners this will assist the 
exchange in performing its oversight and selfregulatory 
responsibilities grasso said 
i want to emphasize the longterm nature of implementing such 
rules for identifying beneficial owners thats because of the 
enormous amount of computer program changes that will have to be 
made by the firms themselves and the need to coordinate any new 
rules of this kind with other selfregulatory organizations 
clearing and depository institutions and other relevant security 
industry participants he said 
elaborating on the proposal in an interview with the wall street 
journal grasso said member firms would electronically report the 
identities of customers to the big board probably the day after 
the transaction when buy and sell orders are matched during the 
period for settling trades 
the market wouldnt know who the customer is he was quoted 
as syaing we would have it the customers identity only for 
regulatory purposes 
the journal said grasso indicated the big board is concerned 
about customer resistance and acknowledged that the proposal would 
require customer education 
the nyses marketsurveillance unit scrutinizes daily trading 
via computers that are designed to alert exchange investigators 
about transactions that suggest possible insider trading or market 
manipulation 
if a suspicious trade is detected the surveillance unit will 
call the brokers involved for more information and sometimes refers 
the material to the securities and exchange commission for further 
investigation

texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo 
irresistible costcutting force of the airline industry has 
smacked into a seemingly immovable object at eastern airlines 
veteran machinists leader charles e bryan 
bryan a philosophermechanic who admits to being kind of a 
cornball sometimes bases his strategies on his selfteachings in 
yoga zen the bible and history 
its kind of a gandhi approach or martin luther king if you 
continue to be right its pretty hard for your adversary to 
overcome bryan said in a recent interview 
while the 55yearold west virginia native quotes khalil gibran 
and gets mistyeyed over the selfless nobility of king arthur and 
sir lancelot in camelot his favorite movie his union members 
relish the morefamiliar image of those same dark blue eyes 
flashing fire and bryans voice rising in anger as he argues his 
points 
prominent in his small cluttered office in an 
industrialwarehouse area west of the miami international airport 
is a plaque given him by his members showing bryan in a news 
photo angrily pointing his finger during the eastern shareholders 
meeting that approved lorenzos takeover 
the president since 1979 of machinists district 100 
representing 12000 or more than onethird of easterns 
employees bryan was blamed by former eastern chairman frank borman 
for forcing the 1986 sale of the troubled carrier to houstonbased 
texas air borman once questioned bryans sanity 
on april 13 borman vice chairman of texas air appeared with 
lorenzo and eastern president phil bakes at a washington news 
conference aimed at countering a growing image that texas air 
management is harassing employees and running unsafe airlines 
the intransigence and unresponsiveness of the iam are the most 
serious obstacles to a successful conclusion of easterns internal 
restructuring borman told reporters citing his own experience 
at trying to work with the machinists leadership 
bryan responded i would be delighted to sit down with frank 
lorenzo and have an open discussion with the whole world watching 
he can bring borman along i dont think hell ever have the 
courage to do that he couldnt deal with reality and the facts 
lorenzos takeover of eastern which teetered near bankruptcy 
chilled many employees in 16 years from his houston base lorenzo 
has become a bogeyman for airline unions a reputation solidified 
in 1983 when he took his continental airlines into bankruptcy 
reorganization he voided contracts slashed salaries laid off a 
third of the work force and got the carrier flying again despite a 
pilots strike 
bryan though sent lorenzo a congratulatory telegram after the 
eastern sale and asked for a meeting to discuss cooperation he 
never got a response he said 
instead bryan and flight attendants union head robert v 
callahan lost their seats on the board of directors bryan had to 
turn in his directors gold badge which he wanted as a souvenir 
and he lost flying privileges he later received a letter 
threatening his firing for meeting with union members on company 
property 
bryan had frequent meetings with borman during the 15 years at 
eastern of the former astronaut who once awed bryan but he says 
hes never heard a word from lorenzo and has gotten no more than 
a coldfish handshake from bakes 
his letters to top executives he says are invariably answered 
by staffers 
theyve tried to diminish me to the lowest common 
denominator bryan said but if theres anything thats driven 
our union together its the way theyve tried to discredit me 
personally 
bryan believes that management after failing to extract cuts of 
up to 50 percent in salaries for baggage handlers and other 
nonmechanics in his union wanted to force a strike keep the 
carrier flying with replacement workers and crush the union 
bryan claims that rising numbers of firings and grievances have 
been designed to provoke a wildcat strike so they can fire 
everybody 
but everyone has been beautiful in following our philosophy 
our direction to keep doing a good job and not react to the harsh 
treatment said bryan reelected last year with 82 percent of 
the vote 
theres been more to the machinists effort than passive 
resistance bryan who also has a 16person union staff has a 
consultant who keeps a database compiling any corporate activity by 
texas air such as filings with federal agencies or court 
depositions anything that provides information on the 
closetothevest management 
the union has attorneys in miami palm beach new york and 
washington keeping up with myriad lawsuits including a recent 
machinists suit charging management with trying to dismantle 
eastern and violating security and federal labor laws and asked 
for the courts to reverse the lorenzo takeover 
last year the machinists won a federal ruling preventing 
eastern from having an independent company take over some ground 
service work and in march another ruling blocked the announced 
spinoff of easterns profitable northeast shuttle into a texas air 
subsidiary 
and persistent charges by easterns pilots and machinists were 
blamed by management for the current federal aviation 
administration safety inspections of eastern and continental and 
for the transportation departments unusual study of texas airs 
ability to run airlines 
frank lorenzo has run into a smart cookie said callahan 
who left eastern after losing a reelection bid in the flight 
attendants union charlie bryan is not a wild man hes a very 
deliberate intelligent motivated man who has been carefully 
portrayed otherwise by corporations fearful of his populist 
appeal 
callahan a onetime george washington university social 
historian and now director of promotions at the university of miami 
rosenstiel school of marine sciences says the conflict at eastern 
isnt a clash of egos its a clash of ideologies 
bryan a divorced father of three who says he last vacationed 10 
years ago is dedicating his 70hour weeks at 63879 a year 
these days to heading off lorenzo every place he can 
management insists that bryan is being stubbornly shortsighted 
and that the moneylosing carrier cant go on with baggage handlers 
earning an average 47000 
bryan says such averages are caused by mismanagement because 
workers are working too much overtime he charges management has 
intentionally created such averages to try to divide his union 
between the 6000 mechanics and the other lesserskilled workers 
when mechanics ask me why we dont have separate unions i 
tell them there are a lot of reasons but the best one is thats 
what frank lorenzo wants bryan said its the first step in a 
divideandconquer strategy i will never sacrifice those workers 
quality of life 
bryan says he wants only whats best for his members and the 
airline he went to work for in 1956 he believes employees should 
have important influence even controlling influence in their 
companies 
a lot of people identify me with don quixote bryan said 
but i never believe any of these dreams is impossible

president reagan today renewed his opposition 
to a plantclosing provision of the trade bill saying congress 
should not legislate a requirement that companies warn workers of 
planned shutdowns 
shortly after his top trade negotiator repeated reagans plan to 
veto the justpassed trade legislation the president was asked 
what quarrel he had with the workernotification provision 
as an old labor union president i suggest thats a matter 
that belongs in the managementlabor contracts between the unions 
and the people the president said reagan was questioned as he 
greeted canadian prime minister brian mulroney for a private lunch 
reagan is a former president of the screen actors guild 
us trade representative clayton yeutter said earlier that 
reagan would veto the massive trade bill but congressional 
democrats called on the president to rethink his position and 
sign the measure 
this bill isnt dead yet senate majority leader robert c 
byrd dwva told reporters today the ball is in the white 
house court if there is a demise of this bill it will occur at the 
white house not here 
house officials said it would be next week before the 1000page 
bill could be put into proper form and delivered to the white 
house reagan would then have 10 days to either sign it or veto it 
the bill would increase the power of the us trade 
representative to act against other countries that use unfair trade 
practices make it easier to curb imports repeal the windfall 
profits tax on oil companies and increase agricultural subsidies 
yeutter said reagan will veto the bill because of the 
controversial plantclosing provision he urged that the senate 
eliminate that provision very quickly 
we need a trade bill this year yeutter said on nbctvs 
today program 
there are a lot of good things in that legislation so if a 
couple of necessary corrections are made and the bill comes back 
im really quite confident the president would sign it yeutter 
said in another interview on cbs this morning 
byrd however said the senate had only about 90 legislative 
days left this year and had a heavy schedule asked if it would 
accept proposed changes from the white house byrd said were 
not spoonfed from the white house 
i hope the president will rethink his position and come down 
on the side of the american people byrd said 
house speaker jim wright dtexas pleaded for reagan to sign 
the bill which he said has overwhelming popularity across the 
country 
there has to be a warm side to the president he said i 
cant believe it falls on deaf ears or a flinty heart 
wright said reagans promise to veto the bill was made to 
captains of industry who would understand if he changed his 
mind 
but byrd said the white house doesnt want this bill the 
white house doesnt want any trade bill 
the governments of japan and korea today urged reagan to veto 
the measure there was also a warning from the european economic 
community of retaliatory action if reagan doesnt kill it 
japans chief government spokesman keizo obuchi said the bill 
which imposes sanctions against toshiba corp may hinder world 
economic development the government of japan strongly hopes that 
such a bill will not finally be enacted said obuchi 
south korea foreign ministry spokesman kim hwangkyung said the 
bill would hinder international trade and the government hopes the 
reagan administration will take appropriate actions in line with 
its much publicized stand on the bill 
willy de clercq eec commissioner for external trade said the 
eec will react to measures in the bill it considers 
protectionist and harmful to european interests if reagan does not 
veto it 
the senate approved the bill 6336 wednesday that left 
democrats at least three votes short of the twothirds majority 
needed to enact their version over reagans objections 
the bill would get reagans signature said yeutter if it were 
not for the provision strongly backed by democrats and labor 
requiring companies to give workers 60 days notice of intended 
plant closings 
only 11 republicans voted in favor of the measure produced after 
three years of congressional debate over soaring us trade 
deficits one democrat voted against the measure sen william 
proxmire dwis who criticized a provision easing the foreign 
corrupt practices act 
i believe that this bill is dead said sen john c 
danforth rmo a gop sponsor he and other supporters held out 
hope however that a revised version might pass later this year 
the centerpiece of the bill would overhaul the system under 
which the united states retaliates against trade law violations it 
would transfer authority to act from the president to the us 
trade representative 
it also would streamline the system under which the united 
states imposes import curbs to protect us industries threatened 
by foreignmade goods 
other provisions range from billions of dollars in agricultural 
subsidies to repeal of the oil profits tax also included are 
sanctions against toshiba of japan and kongsberg vapenfabrikk of 
norway for selling submarinesilencing equipment to the soviet 
union 
federal aid for those left jobless by imports would be expanded 
under the bill which calls for a 015 percent import fee to pay 
for the program 
curbs on overseas shipment of hightech equipment would be 
eased the government would be barred from buying goods from 
countries that freeze out us exports and the president empowered 
to halt any corporate merger or takeover on national security 
grounds

oil prices are down and opec is turning 
to outsiders for help for western nations this raises a question 
is the cartel still a menace or only a harmless bogeyman 
less than a decade ago oilimporting countries saw opec as the 
devil a dastardly outfit bent on carrying out economic terrorism 
against the west 
some still do but gradually the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries appears to be shedding its bad guy image 
evidence was the meeting this week between opec and seven 
independent oilproducing nations to discuss joint cuts in oil 
exports as a way of boosting prices 
the outsiders are not part of the western club of rich nations 
they include partly industrialized mexico communist china marxist 
angola two arab countries and some relative newcomers to 
oilexporting status 
yet opec seems to have become more palatable even to some richer 
countries 
norway over the past year has established close ties to the 
cartel and in 1987 the european economic community comprised of 
britain france west germany and nine other european nations held 
an initial seminar with opec representatives to exchange views 
the seven nonopec countries did not come to vienna because of a 
newfound fondness for opec or a desire to become members they 
simply are so troubled by volatile oil prices that they will try 
nearly anything to stabilize the market 
before the startling oilprice spirals of the 1970s began 
unwinding six years ago any formal deals between opec and other 
oil producers would have seemed preposterous 
for one thing opec wasnt interested as recently as 1978 it 
controlled twothirds of the noncommunist worlds oil supplies 
prices were high and most people thought theyd go much higher oil 
at 100 a barrel seemed a good bet for the late 1980s 
then came the oil glut of the early 1980s opecs fortunes took 
a sharp turn as new oilexporting powers such as britain and mexico 
began undercutting opec prices and boosting their sales 
now the nonopec oil producers pump about 28 million barrels a 
day while opecs output has dropped to 175 million barrels a day 
from its 1978 peak of about 31 million barrels daily 
opec has come to the conclusion that this trend must not 
continue so it has moderated its goals saying it only wants to 
keep oil prices at a reasonable level and that all 
oilproducing countries must help achieve this 
opec is not against anybody says arturo hernandez grisanti 
the oil minister of venezuela which was one of five founding 
members of the organization in 1960 
opec is trying to stabilize the oil market and this stability 
is in the interests of everybody including consumers he told 
reporters this week in vienna 
the message seems to be working opec contacts with nonopec 
countries particularly in the third world are now commonplace 
although they had no direct role in this weeks opec meetings 
the state of texas and the canadian province of alberta sent 
officials to vienna to consult privately with key opec 
representatives 
kent hance a member of the texas railroad commission that 
regulates the states oil industry says the united states has 
nothing to fear from opec and should establish close ties to the 
cartel 
right now opec is not in the position to do something that 
would be harmful to us he said in an interview 
the reagan administration refuses to deal openly with opec it 
maintains that governments should not interfere in the setting of 
oil prices or production rates 
this also is the official policy of the international energy 
agency a parisbased body representing the united states and 20 
other western industrialized nations the agency was set up after 
the 1973 arab oil embargo against the united states an event that 
propelled opec to instant status as an oil power 
part of opecs image problem is linked to the makeup of the 
group some countries with close bilateral ties to the united 
states such as saudi arabia and venezuela say they honestly want 
to avoid a repeat of the 1970s oil price shocks because it would 
only mean another cycle of boom and bust in their countries 
but other members mainly iran and libya have not abandoned the 
aim of driving prices high quickly and getting the most out of a 
resource the west cant do without 
in recent years the saudi view has prevailed but in much of the 
west doubts persist about whether opec would stick to its moderate 
pricing stance if the world supply glut ended and opec regained the 
leverage to send prices skyrocketing

asian and european common market officials are urging president 
reagan to veto the wideranging trade bill passed by congress 
warning that the measure likely would invite retaliation harmful to 
the world economy 
the bill which was passed wednesday and is headed to reagan for 
his signature toughens us retaliatory measures against countries 
engaged in unfair trade practices 
it provoked street demonstrations by students in south korea 
but drew a mild reaction in hong kong where officials said the 
british colony could adust to the measure 
some us trading partners were encouraged because the bill 
wasnt passed by sufficient votes to override a veto but that did 
not stop them from pressing their cases 
japan strongly fears that if the bill is enacted in its 
present form it will have a serious impact on bilateral and 
multilateral economic cooperation and may hinder the development of 
the world economy japans chief government spokesman keizo 
obuchi said 
japans trade surplus with the united states totaled 509 
billion last year 
in brussels the european economic communitys commissioner for 
external trade willy de clercq said in a statement that the 
trading bloc will use its rights under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade each time its interests are harmed by the 
unilateral measures taken by the american authorities 
he made that threat contingent on whether reagan successfully 
vetoes the bill 
south korean trade and industry minister ahn byongwha said in 
seoul that the measure would invite retaliation if it became law 
adding we firmly believe the us president will veto it as he 
repeatedly confirmed 
foreign ministry spokesman kim hwangkyung said the bill 
contained protectionist provisions that might undermine an 
orderly growth of international trade 
the bill will hamper not only the liberalization efforts of 
the south korean government but also the smooth growing of the 
koreaus economic and trade relationship he added 
the us house of representatives passed the trade legislation 
april 21 and the senate approved by a 6336 vote just under the 
twothirds majority needed to override a veto 
the legislation also imposes trade sanctions against japans 
toshiba corp for the sale by its subsidiary of sensitive equipment 
to the soviet union 
the sales violated rules of the coordinating committee for 
export control a parisbased group that regulates western 
hightechnology exports to communist nations 
hajime tamura who heads the ministry of international trade and 
industry said he regretted the toshiba sanctions but that miti 
appreciates the fact that more than one third of the total senate 
voted against the bill 
joichi aoi president and chief executive officer of toshiba 
which stands to lose more than 50 million this year if the bill 
becomes law also expressed strong disappointment 
toshiba corporation was neither involved in nor had any 
knowledge of the misconduct by toshiba machine co ltd aoi 
said in a statement thus we have been insisting that it would 
be grossly unfair to punish toshiba corporation 
in brussels a spokeswoman for de clercq told reporters that the 
eec was waiting to see what happens next before making any 
specific moves 
the spokeswoman said that the ec objects to a number of 
provisions in the trade bill which it considers to be protectionist 
and to harm eec interests 
one would widen the power of the us trade representative to 
investigate and order retaliatory action against alleged unfair 
trade practices another would threaten foreign companies access 
to the us telecommunications market if their governments do not 
reduce barriers to entry by us companies to their markets 
meanwhile in south korea about 1500 students from five 
schools gathered at seoul national university and hurled firebombs 
at riot police in a protest denouncing the government and what they 
called us economic aggression 
this country posted a trade surplus of nearly 10 billion with 
the united states last year 
in hong kong director of trade michael sze said the measure 
is a much better bill than the original one 
many of the provisions which we were concerned about have 
either been improved or dropped completely he said so from 
hong kongs perspective i think its a bill that we can live 
with sze said in an interview with governmentrun radio 
television hong kong 
the united states accrued a 65 billion deficit in trade with 
hong kong last year

pennzoil co plans to move slowly and cautiously 
in finding ways to invest 3 billion it received from texaco inc 
chairman j hugh liedtke told shareholders thursday at the 
companys annual meeting 
the short of it is we havent fully decided on the right 
course liedtke said it would avail our shareholders and our 
employees little to have won this settlement only to lose a portion 
of its value through hasty or illconsidered actions 
liedtke who is giving up his position as pennzoils chief 
executive officer but remaining as chairman said the board would 
be considering a number of investments in coming months 
during a news conference following the shareholders meeting 
neither liedtke nor pennzoil president randal b mcdonald would 
offer many specifics other than to say the company would strive 
toward a balance between acquisitions of oil and gas reserves and 
a balance between exploration and production activities and 
refining and marketing activities 
liedtke said top company officials had a list of 2530 companies 
under consideration for investment of which about six have been 
examined in detail 
publicity about the huge payment to pennzoil had brought with it 
a deluge of suggestions of how the money should be spent liedtke 
said 
they range all over the place he said one man in 
liverpool wants to take his wife to paris 
after the meeting the company announced that its firstquarter 
earnings jumped 71 percent bolstered by higher refinery margins 
and a onetime gain from the early redemption of a bond issue 
pennzoil said it earned 207 million or 41 cents per share 
compared with 121 million or 20 cents per share in the same 
period a year ago 
during the first quarter the company experienced an aftertax 
gain of 69 million or 17 cents per share through an early 
debenture redemption 
revenues totaled 485 million compared with 445 million for 
the same period in 1987 the company said 
higher prices for natural gas and larger sales volumes bolstered 
a gain in pennzoils oil and gas segment to 27 million from 175 
million in the 1987 first quarter it said 
operating income from the companys products division fell to 
284 million from 33 million during the same period in 1987 
mostly due to lower sales volumes and margins on its motor oil 
pennzoil said 
first quarter operating income from the companys sulphur 
division was 119 million down from 165 million during the 
first three months of 1987 the company said 
liedtke who has been pennzoils chief executive officer for 35 
years received a standing ovation following his address to 
shareholders afterward he told reporters he planned to spend more 
time with his family as well as reading and travelling in the 
years ahead

ford motor cos firstquarter earnings set a 
world auto industry record for a single quarter and industry 
analysts predicted thursday that ford will top competitors in 
profitability throughout 1988 
the nations secondlargest automaker said thursday it earned 
1623 billion or 331 a share on sales of 2074 billion in the 
first three months of 1988 
fords firstquarter earnings were up 88 percent from 149 
billion or 287 a share earned in the first quarter of 1987 on 
sales of 1814 billion 
the previous quarterly earnings record was set by general motors 
corp the worlds largest automaker with 1614 billion in 
profits in firstquarter 1984 
in the first quarter of this year gm earned 109 billion or 
311 a share on sales of 2644 billion chrysler corp the no 
3 us automaker earned 1837 million or 83 cents a share on 
sales of 78 billion 
ford said a 102 percent drop in us earnings from a year ago 
caused by costs of buyer incentive campaigns and newproduct 
launches was offset by a nearly 76 percent jump in overseas 
earnings 
ford earned 104 billion in the united states in the first 
quarter down from 116 billion a year ago outside the united 
states ford earned 580 million up from 330 million in 
firstquarter 1987 ford said 
our firstquarter earnings reflect the good balance of the 
overall ford team effort the company said in a statement 
attributed to chairman donald e petersen and vice chairman harold 
a poling 
with increasingly competitive worldwide automotive markets 
ford must continue to improve quality and operating efficiency as 
well as offer customers good value in products they said 
in 1987 ford set a world industry earnings record for a single 
year with a profit of 463 billion ford also was the topearning 
us automaker in 1986 earning 329 billion and outperforming gm 
for the first time since the 1920s 
ford also continues to sit on a 10 billion cash reserve the 
company is seeking a major acquisition that while outside the auto 
industry itself might complement fords main business 
david mccammon ford treasurer and vice president for finance 
said the company is searching patiently and carefully for either 
one main acquisition or a coordinated series of smaller purchases 
but gave no further details 
mccammon declined to project ford earnings for the rest of 1988 
but said he believes industrywide us sales of imported and 
domestic vehicles may top current predictions of about 15 million 
ford said the incentives and newproduct launches while costly 
helped boost sales and increase fords share of the us car market 
18 percentage points to 218 percent in the first quarter 
fords share of the us truck market grew slightly from 
firstquarter 1987 to 297 percent strong sales left ford with 
lowerthanaverage inventories of unsold vehicles the company said 
industry analysts predicted ford would continue to lead the 
industry in earnings throughout 1988 partly because it has boosted 
production schedules for the second half of the year 
fords gross profit per unit and manufacturing profit per unit 
are far and away better than general motors said joe phillippi 
analyst with shearson lehman hutton in new york 
phillippi said fords sales include a healthy percentage of 
highprofit vehicles while it has the best control over costs in 
the industry 
ford said its financial services group earnings were below those 
of a year ago because of lower profits at first nationwide 
however ford credit earned a record 200 million in the quarter 
up 2 percent from a year ago 
its foreign performance was boosted in europe by strong sales 
throughout the industry improved profit margins and favorable 
exchange rates contributed 60 million toward offsetting the 100 
million cost of a twoweek strike at a british plant mccammon said 
in latin america the autolatina joint venture ford and 
volkswagen formed in july 1987 helped earnings by reducing 
operating costs and cutting interest expenses and benefited from 
improvements in the brazilian economy

the stock market declined slightly today faced 
with rising interest rates 
prices of longterm government bonds showed losses of about 5 
for each 1000 in face value today putting their yields in the 
neighborhood of 905 to 910 percent 
analysts said the latest data on unemployment claims prompted 
expectations that employment statistics for april will show 
continued strength in the economy 
that in turn would be viewed by some wall streeters as an 
added bit of impetus for the federal reserve to consider tightening 
credit against the possibility of increasing inflationary pressures 
brokers noted that the volume of stock trading remained light 
suggesting that the market was still suffering more from caution 
than from any widespread selling

eastern airlines announced 60thbirthday fare cuts 
thursday that executives hope will restore a ridership that has 
lagged since federal inspectors launched a safety check of the 
troubled carriers planes 
we have been dented in terms of bookings since the federal 
aviation administration earlier this month started inspecting 
easterns 267 planes said john nelson vice president of marketing 
for the miamibased carrier 
you know were not going to talk about specifics we took some 
bumps said nelson and this fare cuts in part is due to this 
there will be some who wont come back he said estimating 
that eastern flies 100000 passengers daily and hopes to increase 
that 
the carrier has been deeply hurt by large losses and persistent 
labor hostility compounded by recurring questions about its safety 
practices 
before uncorking champagne and cutting a cake topped with a huge 
60 candle in honor of the carriers may 1 birthday nelson said 
easterns maxsaver fares between may 1 and june 15 will be rolled 
back to prices set when the fare was created in february 1987 
under the reductions a miaminew york flight with a current 
lowest price of 104 would cost 79 one way a 119 oneway 
miamiboston fare will cost 89 
other pricing gimmicks are firstclass seats for 60 roundtrip 
over the cost of domestic maxsaver fares letting people born on 
may 1 fly free if accompanied by a passenger paying a maxsaver 
fare allowing maxsaver fare flyers to bring a companion for 60 
more each way on most flights and offering a very frequent 
flyer program 
under that program people who take 60 eastern flights 
excluding its shuttle between may 1 and june 30 will receive 
unlimited travel for a year or can treat 30 friends to a free 
domestic eastern flight 
its a relatively slow travel period were awaiting the 
summer rush were trying to get people out of their cars out of 
their homes nelson said 
the direction were taking is contrary to the airline 
industry he added how other carriers are going to react i dont 
know 
continental airlines which like eastern is owned by texas air 
corp will generally not match the fares said spokesman ned 
walker 
we are only going to match in certain selective markets where 
we are competitive with eastern for the most part we will not be 
matching their fare action walker said we currently have a 
good pricing structure and dont see a need to change it 
eastern was born in 1928 as pitcairn aviation ferrying mail at 
night under a contract with the federal government on hand at the

harcourt brace jovanovich inc the publishing 
insurance and theme park concern said thursday its loss widened in 
the first quarter when its interest costs soared sixfold 
but the companys operating loss narrowed from a year ago and 
officials noted that the first quarter often is weak because of the 
seasonality of the educational publishing and amusement park 
businesses 
the higher interest expenses resulted from heavy borrowing last 
year as the company financed a recapitalization to thwart a hostile 
takeover effort 
harcourt based in orlando fla said it lost 355 million in 
the three months ended march 31 in contrast to a loss of 94 
million in the same quarter last year 
its revenue for the quarter rose 74 percent to 3067 million 
from 2857 million a year earlier 
the company said its operating loss before the recapitalization 
charges narrowed to 135 million from 473 million a year earlier 
we are pleased with the results because have been able to 
reduce our first quarter operating loss by about 70 percent from 
last year said john f berardi harcourts vice president and 
treasurer 
harcourts interest expense climbed sixfold to 672 million 
from 112 million a year earlier 
it said revenue from its publishing operations rose 2 percent to 
1285 million for the quarter but its loss from publishing 
operations narrowed to 266 million from 392 million 
the company is a leading publisher of school textbooks and the 
first quarter is normally weak because of ordering patterns in that 
business 
revenue from theme parks including the sea world parks in 
florida california and ohio rose 268 percent to 610 million 
while income from park operations fell 72 percent to 40 million 
insurance revenue rose 45 percent to 1171 million and the 
company reported income of 109 million from insurance operations 
in contrast to a loss of 66 million a year earlier that included 
a pretax charge of 152 million for the relocation of the 
companys insurance operations to florida from michigan

after declining sharply in 1986 mostly due to 
falling world oil prices mexicos troubled economy grew modestly 
last year but its chronic inflation also rose the nations central 
bank reported thursday 
in its annual report the bank of mexico said the gross national 
product grew by 14 percent in 1987 after contracting by 4 percent 
the previous year industrial production during 1987 rose by 29 
percent among the best performing components mining rose 69 
percent electrical production 61 percent manufacture 21 percent 
and contruction 22 percent 
services during the year rose 12 percent but agriculture 
dropped by 03 percent 
according to the report mexicos balance of payments similarly 
improved from a deficit of 17 billion in 1986 to a surplus of 
39 billion last year as a result of a substantial improvement in 
the terms of the countrys trade structure 
income from nonpetroleum exports during that period rose by an 
unprecedented 24 percent as a result of a new overall drive to sell 
more abroad and income from petroleum exports rose 37 percent 
while imports dropped by 7 percent and foreign debt service 
payments by 2 percent 
at 105 billion mexicos is the biggest foreign debt among 
developing nations after brazil 
direct foreign investments in 1987 totaled 32 billion and the 
country showed a net foreign currency income of 1199 billion 
while foreign currency reserves rose by 69 billion to 137 
billion by the end of 1987 
treasury secretary gustavo petricioli said last week mexicos 
foreign currency reserves currently stand at an alltime high of 
more than 16 billion 
but the annual rate of inflation as measured by the consumer 
price index soared from 1057 percent in 1986 to 1592 percent 
last year the report said sharply reducing the purchasing power 
of salaries which have not kept pace 
the government put into effect an economic solidarity pact in 
december intended to reduce monthly inflation to 1 to 2 percent by 
the end of 1988 de la madrid said recently that the target of 2 
percent monthly inflation should be reached by midyear

all three of the federal reserve boards 
measures of the nations money supply rose in midapril the 
central bank said thursday 
the fed said its narrowest measure of the money supply m1 rose 
300 million in the week ended april 18 to a seasonally adjusted 
7666 billion from 7663 billion the previous week 
it said the measure known as m2 rose 600 million to a 
seasonally adjusted 29915 billion from 29909 billion the 
previous week 
an even broader measure m3 increased 13 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 37601 billion from 37588 billion 
m1 includes cash in circulation deposits in checking accounts 
and nonbank travelers checks m2 is m1 plus accounts like savings 
deposits and moneymarket mutual funds m3 is m2 plus lessliquid 
accounts such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations 
of 100000 
some economists say changes in the money supply provide clues 
about trends in inflation but the federal reserve has appeared to 
place less emphasis on money supply growth in recent years than it 
did earlier this decade 
in setting its monetary policy the fed says it monitors the 
value of the dollar commodity prices and the difference between 
short and longterm interest rates as well as changes in m2 and m3 
in other reports 
the federal reserve bank of new york reported commercial and 
industrial loans at major new york city banks rose 234 million in 
the week ended april 20 compared with a decline of 136 billion a

monetary base the seasonally adjusted total of member bank 
reserves held at federal reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and

lucky stores inc spurning a takeover by 
rival american stores inc that would have created the nations 
largest supermarket chain agreed thursday to a 22 billion merger 
with a new york investment firm 
the announcement sent luckys stock climbing 5375 to close at 
6150 on the new york stock exchange nearly twice its value a 
month ago when american stores made its offer more than 33 
million lucky shares were bought and sold making it one of the 
most actively traded issues 
the 61pershare deal is worth about 600 million more than the 
initial 45pershare offer by american stores the salt lake 
citybased suitor sweetened the offer to 60 earlier thursday but 
was again rebuffed 
an analyst said luckys consent to be acquired by the investment 
firm of gibbons green van amerongen is unlikely to end the 
bidding war for californias secondlargest grocery chain 
under the agreement a company formed by gibbons green van 
amerongen will launch a cash tender offer next wednesday to acquire 
357 million shares of lucky shares 92 percent of the shares 
outstanding for 61 per share 
following completion of the tender offer the two companies will 
merge and the remaining stockholders will receive preferred stock 
with a stated value of up to 7 for each of their shares according 
to a joint announcement by both companies 
lucky stock climbed 5 a share to 61125 in heavy trading on 
the new york stock exchange midway through the session 
gibbons green van amerongen said it would retain current lucky 
management and employees and maintain its corporate headquarters in 
dublin 25 miles east of san francisco 
we believe it lucky is the preeminent supermarket company 
in the areas of its operations said leonard green a partner in 
gibbons green van amerongen 
the investment firm said it had received a highly confident 
letter from drexel burnham lambert inc on the probability of 
financing based upon proposals from commercial banks gibbons 
green said it expects bank financing to be committed shortly 
luckys board of directors said it decided to accept the offer 
over american stores bid based on the opinion of goldman sachs amp 
co financial advisers to the company 
john m lillie chairman and chief executive officer said we 
believe that the the transaction is very beneficial to our 
stockholders and allows lucky to continue with its plans for 
growth 
the offer is subject to financing a majority of lucky shares 
being tendered and other conditions 
analyst jeff siegel of pershing amp co in new york said the deal 
would allow gibbons green van amerongen to gain a valuable 
foothold in southern california but he said american stores could 
remain in the bidding 
he said luckys retail base and strong management make it a 
worthwhile target 
another san francisco bay area grocery giant oaklandbased 
safeway stores inc took a similar action and went private in an 
acquisition by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co in 1986 
the offer from american stores in late march came just 17 months 
after lucky derailed a hostile takeover attempt by new york 
investor asher edelman 
a merger of american stores and lucky would create the nations 
largest supermarket chain surpassing kroger co 
american stores a grocery and drugstore chain has 1700 
outlets in 40 states 
lucky employs 39000 people and has 480 outlets with 340 stores 
in california it is smaller only than safeway in the state

mcdonnell douglas corps firstquarter 
earnings rose 19 percent compared with the yearago period partly 
because of increased revenues in the transport aircraft operation 
the company said thursday 
mcdonnell douglas earned 512 million or 133 per share on 
revenues of 324 billion in the first quarter earnings in the 
same quarter last year were 43 million or 106 per share on 
revenues of 303 billion the company said 
transport aircraft revenues increased sharply because the 
company delivered 24 md80 aircraft in the first quarter of this 
year compared with earlier rates of 12 planes a year combat 
aircraft earnings also increased but the increase was more than 
offset by the impact of an early retirement program instituted in 
1987 the company said 
the voluntary early retirement program resulted in a onetime 
pretax charge of 66 million or 93 cents a share 
the company said it has invested heavily to deveop the md11 
trijet and to compete for the air forces advanced tactical 
fighter program 
chairman john f mcdonnell who reported the earnings at the 
companys annual shareholders meeting said mcdonnell douglas is 
considering a cooperative agreement with the european aircraft 
manufacturer airbus industries to develop a family of aircraft that 
could compete successfully with boeing co the current leader in 
the commercial aircraft industry 
he described negotiations with airbus as very preliminary 
complicated and delicate adding that there was absolutely no 
assurance that we will come to an agreement any time soon

the quaker oats co is misleading the public 
by exaggerating the health benefits of eating oat cereal a 
consumer group said thursday in a complaint to the federal trade 
commission 
a spokesman for the chicagobased company said the complaint is 
without merit and that the claims have scientific backing 
the center for science in the public interest a nonprofit 
advocacy group accused quaker of running magazine advertisements 
that overstate the contribution of quaker oats and oat bran in 
reducing the risk of heart disease 
the ads featuring actor wilford brimley recommend lowering fat 
intake and adding complex carbohydrates and fiber to the diet 
but the center objected to part of the ads saying clinical 
studies showed serumcholesterol levels dropped an average of 
nearly 10 percent among people who ate quaker oats daily as part of 
a lowfat lowcholesterol diet 
the brimley ads make the reader believe that quaker oats are 
some type of magic wand said bruce silverglade the centers 
legal director in fact most of the improvement in the health of 
individuals who eat quaker oats was due to also eating a lowfat 
lowcholesterol diet 
he said oat cereal by itself accounted for only a 3 percent 
chloresterol reduction and a corresponding decline of 6 percent in 
the risk of heart disease a modest to minimal improvement of 
borderline significance 
any healthrelated claim made in food advertising needs to be 
supported by reliable scientific evidence said ron bottrell 
quakers manager of corporate communications in this case we 
feel that we have it 
a heartdisease specialist at the national heart lung and blood 
institute in bethesda md said he had not seen the ads and did 
not want to take sides 
nobody would get too excited if you reduced the risk by that 
amount dr basil rifkind said on the other hand if you look 
at it in population terms we usually say that even small 
reductions in chloresterol could be meaningful 
the center asked the ftc to order quaker to discontinue the ads 
and replace them with ones that would correct any misimpressions 
that consumers have derived from the original advertising 
campaign 
we dont think we misled the reader in any way bottrell 
said adding the study quaker cited was the most conservative among 
several supporting its claims 
the claim were making in the ad clearly talks about eating 
oats as part of a reducedfat reducedchloresterol diet he 
said were not ascribing the overall benefit to oats alone 
ftc spokeswoman dee ellison said the commission had no immediate 
comment on the complaint and would not speculate on if or when it 
would take action 
we take letters of this type quite seriously she said so 
there is no particular time limit for reaching a resolution

enron corp the nations largest natural gas 
transmission company said thursday it was considering the sale of 
its oil and gas subsidiary one of the biggest us independent oil 
and gas concerns 
based upon prices paid in recent transactions for oil and gas 
reserves the sale of all or part of eog enron oil amp gas co 
would strengthen substantially enrons financial position and 
provide the flexibility to pursue very attractive opportunities we 
see in the energy business said kenneth l lay enron chairman 
enron oil amp gas had reserves of 142 trillion cubic feet of 
natural gas and 423 million barrels of oil as of the end of 1987 
for the entire year it sold an average of 343 million cubic 
feet of natural gas and 12000 barrels of oil per day 
for the first three months of 1988 that rate has risen to 399 
million cubic feet of gas and 13000 barrels of oil the company 
said 
assuming completion of a sale we will be realizing for our 
shareholders the tremendous value inherent in these assets under 
current favorable market conditions lay said 
he said proceeds from a sale would be used to reduce enrons 
indebtedness and interest expense and enhance nearterm earnings 
and future cash flow 
lay speaking at enrons annual meeting thursday said debt 
reduction was a major goal for 1988 debt as a percentage of 
capitalization stood at 756 at the end of 1987 and was reduced to 
67 percent by the end of the first quarter 
enron earlier thursday reported firstquarter earnings of 694 
million or 120 per share compared with 627 million or 106 
per share for the yearearlier period 
among the primary causes was a return to more normal winter 
temperature patterns than the relatively warm heating seasons of 
the last three years lay said the colder weather resulting 
in increased natural gas use was coupled with higher average 
prices for gas which also proved beneficial to earnings 
in releasing the financial figures the company restated 
earnings for 1987 to reflect adoption of changed accounting rules 
reducing 1987s reported first quarter earnings by 39 million 
reflecting a lower federal income tax benefit due to a tax rate 
change relative to depreciation and amortization expenses

public service company of new hampshire 
asked a federal bankruptcy judge thursday for an eightmonth 
extension to file its reorganization plan although the judge has 
indicated he wasnt inclined to grant one 
public service also outlined four reorganization options it was 
considering including formation of a federallyregulated holding 
company so it could start charging ratepayers for its 36 percent 
share of the stalled 53 billion seabrook nuclear power plant 
bankruptcy law gives a debtor the exclusive right to propose a 
reorganization plan for 120 days after it files for protection from 
creditors after that period creditors may file alternative 
proposals 
public services exclusivity period ends may 27 public service 
asked us bankruptcy judge james yacos for an extension to next 
jan 27 and for a hearing on its request on may 20 
during a procedural hearing in february yacos had indicated he 
was not inclined to grant an extension 
public service new hampshires largest power company on jan 
28 became the first big investorowned electric utility to seek 
bankruptcy protection since the depression 
the utility sought protection on the grounds it was financially 
unable to continue operating without being able to recoup its 
seabrook investment state law prohibited public service from 
charging customers for its share of seabrook until the plant was 
operating commercially 
operation of seabrook has been delayed by evacuation planning 
snags 
public service said the its unusual case mandated the extension 
of the usual exclusivity period 
the size complexity and novelty of this case have prevented 
the development of meaningful information let alone meaningful 
negotiations within the 120day plan exclusivity periodwhich 
congress designed for a case of average size and complexity the 
company said 
admittedly an eightmonth extension is more than is normally 
requested or granted but this is not a normal case 
public service also said there likely would be at least 10 major 
parties in the negotiations but not all appeared ready to start 
the talks 
public service also outlined reorganization options it is 
considering selling the company as a whole internal 
reorganization into a federallyregulated holding company 
reorganizing to remain under state regulation and liquidation 
public service noted that two new england utilities had 
expressed interest in buying its nonseabrook assets the company 
estimated it would take four to six months to complete preparations 
for such a sale and reach a point where it could compare an 
acquisition offer to other reorganization options 
regarding the holding company option public service noted that 
a principal cause of its financial problems was the state law 
barring it from charging ratepayers for its seabrook investment 
until the plant operates commercially 
but the company noted the federal energy regulatory commission 
which regulates wholesale electricity allows charges for 
construction work in progress or cwip for abandoned or cancelled 
power plants 
a restructuring of public services operations to provide for 
the sale of electricity at wholesale under ferc regulation could 
thus significantly increase public services revenues and value 
the company said 
public service sought bankruptcy protection two days after the 
state supreme court denied an emergency rate increase by upholding 
the anticwip law the company last month appealed the ruling 
to the us supreme court
