the idaho governors decision to close his 
state to shipments of radioactive waste will mean that the rocky 
flats nuclear weapons plant northwest of denver must find somewhere 
else to ship its wastes 
colorado officials and citizens groups that monitor rocky flats 
which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons 
expressed concern over the implications of idaho gov cecil andrus 
decision wednesday 
the us department of energy on thursday said it would honor 
andrus decision and curtail shipments to idaho from rocky flats 
which has sent virtually all its waste to idaho for the last 20 
years 
this is a nightmare come true said jan pilcher spokeswoman 
for citizens against rocky flats contamination its absolutely 
unacceptable to store transuranic waste near a major metropolitan 
area 
rocky flats does not have a state permit that would allow 
longterm storage of wastes on site officials said 
rockwell international inc which operates rocky flats for the 
department of energy had planned to begin shipping plant wastes to 
a permanent disposal site in new mexico this month 
problems in obtaining permits have forced the waste isolation 
pilot plant or wipp near carlsbad nm to postpone its opening 
until next year 
rockwell spokesman pat etchart said the doe is assessing the 
impact of andrus decision and examining all possible storage 
options 
tim holeman an environmental advisor to gov roy romer said 
state officials will meet next week with doe and rocky flats 
officials to discuss how wastes will be handled at the facility 
we dont want any longer storage at rocky flats holeman 
said we want wipp to open as soon as possible 
he said health and radiation experts will be asked to assess the 
possible added risk of longterm storage of wastes at rocky flats 
andrus in a sharply worded letter to energy secretary john 
herrington said long delays in opening wipp have left 24 million 
cubic feet of contaminated material at the idaho national 
engineering laboratory near idaho falls 
idaho was supposed to begin shipping 20 years of accumulated 
waste from rocky flats and other plants to the new mexico site this 
month but congress failed to transfer the 10240acre site from 
the public domain to doe 
several unresolved safety concerns have delayed the opening as 
well and when andrus visited the new mexico site this week doe 
officials told him they did not know when the facility would open 
this answer is simply unacceptable andrus said in his 
letter to herrington

members of a labor union burned an 
american flag and shouted slogans on wednesday to protest a new 
agreement on us military bases 
president corazon aquino dismissed criticism of the accord 
signed monday in washington by foreign secretary raul manglapus and 
us secretary of state george shultz and the largest political 
party in the philippines congress pledged to support it 
about 150 members of the leftist may first movement labor 
alliance burned an american flag near the us embassy shouting 
slogans assailing us foreign policy as they carried banners 
against the bases riot police prevented them from marching to the 
embassy grounds and they dispersed peacefully 
the agreement allows the united states to maintain six bases 
here until 1991 in return for 962 million in aid over the final 
two years of the pact 
but critics charged that the government settled for too little 
compensation filipino negotiators had demanded 12 billion 
annually 
i knew that it would not get total acceptance mrs aquino 
said of the agreement but i still believe secretary manglapus 
did a very commendable job and that certainly it is a big 
improvement from the previous bases agreement 
opposition sen juan ponce enrile said the agreement showed that 
mrs aquino had secretly decided to work for extending the bases 
even after their lease expires in september 1991 
the terms contained in the justconcluded agreement strongly 
indicate to us that the aquino regime will continue to foist upon 
our people this onerous burden of a military presence on philippine 
soil he said 
the united states had been paying 180 million a year for use of 
clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller installations 
the proaquino struggle of the democratic filipino which claims 
151 out of 225 legislators as members said wednesday that the 
agreement provided nearly three times as much aid as the united 
states granted to deposed president ferdinand marcos 
our party is satisfied with the agreement and will support it 
although we realize that more hard work is needed to resolve other 
issues related to the american base facilities in our country 
the legislators said 
the senate created a special committee wednesday to determine if 
the new bases pact violates the philippine constitution and if the 
accord actually an amendment to a 47yearold agreement is 
subject to senate approval as some senators claim mrs aquino said 
it is not 
any extension beyond 1991 must be approved by twothirds of the 
senate where sentiment against the bases is strong 
the senates main objection to the accord is a provision that 
allows the united states to maintain its policy of neither 
confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear weapons on aircraft 
and ships visiting the bases 
the constitution mandates that the philippines adopt a policy of 
freedom from nuclear weapons consistent with the national 
interest but legal experts say the phrase falls short of an 
outright ban 
communist guerrillas whose demand for the removal of the bases 
has fanned a 20yearold rebellion accused the goverment of 
shamelessly selling out philippine sovereignty

a federal court jury wednesday convicted 
four people of conspiracy to import cocaine in a scheme involving 
the use of military mail to ship the drug from panama to the united 
states 
the jury which deliberated about five hours wednesday convicted 
oscar and regina smith and julia thom all of new york city and 
gary king of doerun ga were convicted after about five hours of 
jury deliberations all four face up to life in prison and 4 
million in fines 
us district judge j robert elliott set no sentencing date 
prosecutors said the four were involved in a drug ring that 
shipped 352 pounds of cocaine to the united states between early 
1987 and may of this year 
obviously were pleased said assistant us attorney 
deborah fowler after the verdict was read we believe the jury 
spoke 
the alleged conspiracy was discovered when jackie lee bigelow of 
moultrie was arrested in colquitt county for a traffic violation 
and police discovered 17 pounds of cocaine in the trunk of his 
girlfriends car 
bigelow a former soldier pleaded guilty and testified for the 
prosecution authorities claim 42 pounds of cocaine were mailed to 
some of bigelows friends from military post offices in panama 
frank martin who represented oscar smith said the sheer volume 
of the drug which was shown to jurors probably helped sway their 
decision 
it was just too much cocaine to overcome martin said i 
think it was such a shocking amount that the jury couldnt focus on 
other issues 
prosecutors told the jury that duffel bags stuffed with cocaine 
also were flown to air bases in georgia texas and maryland from 
howard air force base in panama 
the couriers were either current or former soldiers who used 
false military id cards wore their old uniforms and carried forged 
leave papers to board military flights prosecutors said 
the defendants were charged with a variety of criminal counts 
including conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute 
smith the alleged mastermind was convicted on 19 of 20 counts 
including conspiracy to import cocaine use of the mail to 
facilitate a drug felony and possession with intent to distribute 
mrs smith his wife was convicted of four counts including 
use of a telephone to facilitate a drug felony 
king was convicted of three counts including possession with 
intent to distribute and interstate transportation in aid of 
racketeering 
mrs thom who was arrested with mrs smith at a moultrie motel 
last may was convicted on one count of conspiracy to possess 
cocaine with intent to distribute 
mrs smith told officers who arrested her that she made the trip 
to moultrie because she was having an affair with bigelow mrs 
thom said she thought she was traveling to georgia to pick up mrs 
smiths niece for a return trip to new york 
bigelow and john turner a military reservist from nashville 
tenn have pleaded guilty to one count each but three major 
figures in the case remain free because the government has not been 
able to bring them out of panama 
ms fowler identified them last week as faustino lee an alleged 
paymaster at the new york end of the cocaine connection and alex 
smith and ricardo brown described as key figures in the ring

life comes to a near standstill monday 
nights as millions of egyptians sit riveted before their television 
sets to watch angela channings melodramatic malevolence on 
falcon crest 
however jane wymans character and the others in the series 
have few counterparts in egyptian society even the setting a 
winery in a napa valleylike area of california might have 
alienated many egyptian moslems taught by islams holy book the 
koran to abstain from alcohol 
yet the show is a fabulous hit 
egypt has nothing similar to the nielson ratings to gauge 
exactly how popular it is but sohair eletriby head of egyptian 
televisions second channel which airs the series has no doubts 
egyptians have become addicted to falcon crest she said 
theyve become very attached to it 
whether rich and educated or poor peasants reading arabic 
subtitles on the screen falcon crest fanatics consider the 
characters a part of their extended families their fortunes and 
disasters are eagerly followed and discussed everywhere 
the american series also has proved lucrative for stateowned 
egyptian television channel two buys an episode for around 1000 
and on a recent monday sales of commercials brought in almost 20 
times that 
angela channing the scheming matriarch of the falcon crest 
brood ruthless but charming richard channing and dedicated and 
romantic if somewhat naive maggie are among the main characters 
in the colorful series that depicts love hate and events both foul 
and fair 
early episodes of falcon crest began appearing on egyptian 
screens several years ago because of finances egyptian television 
bought only a few 26episode seasons at a time showing them daily 
and then stopping for months until money was found for succeeding 
episodes 
despite the gaps in transmission falcon crest fans remained 
true and for two consecutive months last summer the fifth and 
sixth seasons were aired every night from 915 pm to 10 pm 
the show was so popular that all over cairo appointments were 
made before or after falcon crest tv parties with friends were 
common and cairos congested streets emptied as each episode was 
shown 
at the end of august eletreby changed the schedule showing 
two episodes every monday night she said her office immediately 
was swamped with hundreds of calls and letters demanding that the 
series be shown daily again 
i had only a few episodes from the seventh part and the 
eighth is now running in the united states she said in an 
interview either i could have stopped it for several months and 
then shown the seventh part in its entirety or i could have shown 
it once a week like television in america and europe do all the 
time 
falcon crest isnt the first american tv series to make a 
big splash with egyptian viewers in the 1960s and 70s peyton 
place and rich man poor man were favorites 
in 1982 egyptian television began showing dallas which 
quickly became almost as popular as falcon crest would become 
later dallas was stopped however after a member of 
parliament complained that it was corrupting the morals of egyptian 
youth 
the morality of falcon crest would not seem to be much 
different with angelas scheming against her own son and the 
characters frequent exchanges of bed partners 
but the serial has escaped unscathed so far except for egyptian 
televisions routine censorship which unskillfully scissors about 
five minutes of what the censors consider passionate lovemaking 
from each 50minute episode 
so falcon crest giving egyptians a glimpse of a completely 
different and glittering world easily captures its audience 
viewers have different reasons for appreciating the series 
i like watching it because the men and women are so beautiful 
wearing lovely clothes and living in beautiful houses said 
fawziya ahmed a peasant from a small village north of cairo in the 
nile delta 
christiane latif who helps run a familyowned marble factory 
said the characters are interesting and become like your family 
and the plot makes you want to know what will happen next i try 
not to miss any of the shows 
such sentiments arent universal however 
one government official who declined to be identified said he 
finds nothing special about falcon crest he complained that his 
wife and 5yearold daughter cannot be distracted from the screen 
when the show was on 
and some americans worry that egyptians might think all 
americans are the glittery hollywood types of falcon crest

sidney rittenberg came to china as a young 
idealist and his reward was 16 years in prison now he helps other 
foreigners find keys to the doors of commerce in his adopted land 
rittenberg 67 is president of kamsky and rittenberg a 
consulting firm that helps freign clients most of their american 
get information and access to chinese officials 
since establishing the firm a year ago rittenberg has found 
markets and chinese partners for us makers of gas turbines 
pencils jeans and electrical appliances and guided them through 
the enigmatic world of chinese contract negotiations 
he has organized tours for such as evangelist billy graham and 
gov ray mabus of mississippi sometimes acting as interpreter in 
impeccable mandarin at meetings with senior chinese leaders 
i like the feeling that were building little bridges he 
said in an interview 
rittenberg began building his bridges decades ago with some 
disastrous consequences he is a native of charleston sc and 
first came to china in 1945 as a us army interpreter after 
studying chinese at stanford 
like other young american liberals caught up in the turbulence 
rittenberg was attracted by the zeal and idealism of mao tsetungs 
revolutionaries 
i was taken with the idea they were going to build a new kind 
of just democratic socialist society he said after leaving the 
army he decided to stay in china at the urging of chou enlai and 
other leaders to help establish an englishlanguage radio service 
when chinese authorities put him in the back of a truck going to 
beijing in 1949 he thought he was being enlisted to help negotiate 
relations between the united states and maos new communist 
government i was euphoric he said 
instead rittenberg was imprisoned on charges of being an 
american spy 
he learned later that soviet dictator josef stalin demanded his 
arrest claiming rittenberg was an accomplice of american 
journalist anna louise strong who had been arrested in moscow for 
spying she and rittenberg were collaborating on a biography of mao 
six years in prison followed the first of them in an unlighted 
room with black cloth over the windows 
when he was released and cleared of wrongdoing in 1955 mao 
apologized to me he said they really felt bad about it and 
took me into the family 
back at radio beijing he was made privy to material seldom 
revealed to outsiders that was power access to inside 
information he said in the interview 
his world collapsed once more during the cultural revolution of 
196676 
again he was deceived he said he thought the cultural 
revolution with which mao dislodged the entrenched bureaucracy 
was a great day a kind of town hall democracy 
but the radical leftists who gained power revived the old spying 
charges and jailed him in 1968 he spent 10 years in solitary and 
his chinese wife yulin was sentenced to three years in a labor 
camp 
there was only one real issue keeping your sanity from day to 
day he said of the lost decade i tried not to be bitter in 
solitary bitterness is the enemy but who are you going to be sore 
at it was the whole system 
he said he felt freedom was near when he heard maos widow 
jiang qing yelling from a nearby cell jiang who rittenberg says 
personally prolonged his prison term was arrested in late 1976 as 
ringleader of the notorious gang of four 
again released and again exonerated he was given a sinecure 
with the academy of social sciences helping arrange academic 
exchanges in 1979 he returned to the united states for the first 
time in 34 years 
rittenberg now spends about half the year in the united states 
his consulting firm has an office in new york and he has a home in 
seattle where one of his four children also lives 
his hope that chinese communism would be different from the 
russians more civilized and democratic dissolved long ago 
mao went back on his promises he said and if the 
democratic socialism he once envisioned for china ever comes it 
will be nothing resembling marxistleninist societies so far 
after so many years away rittenberg said he finds the united 
states to be a more humane country 
the leaders of the chinese revolution didnt understand that 
if not everyone is protected by law then no one is he said 
our forefathers were smart enough to build that into the system 
rittenberg worries about corruption in china where young people 
have no 10 commandments and no communist ideology and party 
officials are among the greediest he said there are thieves 
galore built into the system but believes a kind of 
selfcorrecting mechanism will see china through 
china and the united states have a special chemistry and 
theres no reason it shouldnt cement and grow rittenberg said 
i feel kind of good it is happening now

a compromise antidrug bill began to take 
shape wednesday night as more than 20 housesenate negotiators 
agreed to major law enforcement provisions 
the lawmakers however were unable to agree on how to carry out 
provisions to deny many federal benefits to those convicted of drug 
offenses 
while there was no doubt that denial of benefits would remain in 
the bill disagreement remained over whether judges should have 
discretion in removing the benefits or should be required to 
withdraw the assistance upon conviction 
the drug bill expected to authorize about 25 billion in new 
spending is the major legislation keeping congress in session the 
top house and senate leadership was expected to resolve the 
remaining issues thursday and hopefully schedule final passage on 
friday 
each house has overwhelmingly approved different versions of the 
popular electionyear legislation which also will include the 
death penalty for those who kill during drug crimes 
one of the most controversial houseapproved measures was 
dropped it would have permitted introduction in federal court of 
evidence seized illegally but in good faith even when a 
search was made without a warrant current law permits the good 
faith exception only when searches are conducted with warrants 
the negotiators accepted senate language on child pornography 
the provisions would set prison terms of 20 yearstolife for 
anyone convicted of facilitating use of a child for producing 
sexually explicit materials 
the buying and selling of children for the purpose of producing 
child pornography would be made a federal crime 
the negotiators failed to agree on senate provisions to 
strengthen adult antiobscenity laws and threw that issue to house 
and senate leaders 
the bill would require the justice department to devise a system 
that would allow gun dealers to check whether gun purchasers are 
convicted felons a provision originally inserted by the house to 
replace an optional sevenday waiting period on handgun sales 
lawmakers agreed that states would initially have to contribute 
25 percent of the cost to receive federal grants for antidrug 
crime programs after the first year of the fouryear program the 
state match would go to 50 percent 
senate language that 10 percent of federal anticrime grants go 
for streetlevel enforcement was dropped and the decision would be 
left to the states 
the final bill also will include civil fines for those found in 
possession of illegal drugs including marijuana and cocaine

paul gann who a decade ago helped 
lead this states revolt against high taxes is crusading against a 
far deadlier foe this november aids the disease from which he 
himself is suffering 
california law currently prohibits most mandatory aids virus 
testing and requires that voluntary test results be kept 
confidential 
but gann who contracted aids in 1982 from a blood transfusion 
is a chief sponsor of proposition 102 which would eliminate the 
statewide anonymous aids testing program allow insurers and 
employers to screen prospective clients and workers and require 
health officials to do everything reasonably necessary to halt 
the epidemic including tracing the contacts of anyone exposed to 
the aids virus 
the measure would also make it a felony for anyone who knows 
they have acquired immune deficiency syndrome to donate blood or 
engage in prostitution 
state health authorities and other critics insist current 
policies are effective and they warn that aids victims and people 
who test positive for the aids virus could be subjected to housing 
and employment discrimination job loss and other abuses if voters 
approve proposition 102 
but gann dismissed those objections at a recent legislative 
hearing they opponents want to make aids a civil rights issue 
but who in gods name has the right to go out and give you a virus 
thats going to kill you not maybe kill you but kill you 
as part of his campaign gann this week called for a boycott of 
wells fargo bank because the bank contributed 5000 to opponents 
of the initiative 
theyre the bank afraid theyll be boycotted by the gay 
community gann told reporters tuesday though he could not 
provide proof that any boycott had been threatened 
wells fargo spokeswoman kim kellogg said the boycott would 
probably not be effective she added that the bank and other 
corporations are opposing the initiative because they dont like 
it not out of fear of a boycott 
a second more moderate aids initiative on nov 8 ballots would 
allow some mandatory aids testing and limited release of test 
results 
proposition 102s other chief sponsor is us rep william 
dannemeyer a conservative republican 
critics including the california medical association the 
california nurses association health officers and numerous aids 
researchers argue that proposition 102 would drain support for 
programs that have already proven effective in combating the 
epidemic including research education and voluntary testing 
public opinion polls reveal that voter support for proposition 
102 dropped from more than 70 percent early in the campaign to 36 
percent by early october as critics have gotten their message out 
opponents compare proposition 102 to two previous ballot 
measures sponsored by political extremist lyndon larouche those 
initiatives which also enjoyed strong initial support were 
overwhelmingly defeated by voters in 1986 and earlier this year 
but opponents concede their battle is more difficult this time 
without larouches name attached to the proposal 
health officials argue they can with consent trace partners 
and other contacts of aids victims and people who test positive for 
the virus 
the second aidsrelated measure proposition 96 was designed by 
los angeles county sheriff sherman block to help protect rape 
victims and law enforcement officials who fear they may have been 
exposed to aids or other communicable diseases 
if approved rape victims and public safety officers could 
request mandatory aids testing of individuals charged with certain 
crimes or involved in an assault on police firefighters or 
emergency medical personnel 
supporters call the measure a victims rights initiative 
but critics including the president of the health officers 
association of california fear inmates who have been exposed to 
aids may be mistreated if test results are reported 
they also point out that aids tests are not a foolproof means of 
detecting exposure to the virus

after 30 years of committees proposals and no 
small amount of bickering a downtown center opens this week giving 
seattle a combination town square office tower shopping arcade 
bus station and monorail terminal 
thats a minor miracle says stephen koehler president of 
koehler mcfayden amp co of seattle one of the projects 
codevelopers 
theres so many people and so many ideas of what was going to 
go into the small space called westlake that its really 
impossible to make all the people happy about this but i think the 
overwhelming majority will like whats here 
whats here is a 24story office building a fivestory shopping 
and restaurant pavilion and a oneacre city plaza on a roughly 
triangular wedge in the middle of the citys retail district its 
a compromise of three decades of discussions lawsuits civic 
commissions and studies over what to do with one of the few open 
spaces left in seattles core 
its been such a controversial project for so long im just 
kind of glad its done says mayor charles royer 
westlake center was formally opening today amid speeches bands 
doves and 50000 balloons 
koehler mcfayden and the rouse co the columbia md developer 
of such projects as new yorks south street seaport and baltimores 
harborplace built the 110 million office and shopping complex it 
adjoins the 189 million westlake park paved in multicolored 
granite to resemble a salish indian basketweave pattern 
the centers lower level opens to a station of a bus tunnel to 
be completed next year the third floor is the terminus for the 
onemile monorail ride to seattle center site of the 1962 worlds 
fair 
westlake at the junction of westlake avenue pine street and 
fifth avenue has long been a place to find flower vendors hear 
street musicians and political speeches and to duck out of the 
rain beneath the old monorail terminal 
its also a place to shop bordering are large department 
stores a few blocks away is the pike place market a collection of 
fresh fish and vegetable stalls bakeries espresso cafes and 
openair entrepreneurs 
since the 1950s when the city closed a twoblock stretch of 
westlake avenue the site has been the focus for big plans 
proposals have included a pedestrian mall a hotelshopping 
complex a home for the seattle art museum and a central city park 
downtown merchants wanted to attract shoppers openspace 
advocates including the late victor steinbrueck an architect who 
battled to save the pike market wanted a central plaza a living 
room for the city 
steinbrueck head of the committee for alternatives at westlake 
led a successful legal fight to block a plan by royer to locate the 
art museum at westlake that led to the city agreeing to the joint 
venture by rouse and koehler mcfayden in 1983 
construction began in january 1987 the result pleases the 
developers satisfies the city and is accepted with mixed feelings 
by steinbruecks son peter 
seattle lost a great opportunity for a grand square says 
steinbrueck himself an architect but i think the park and 
shopping pavilion will be a major enhancement to the retail core 
steinbrueck thinks the park is good architecturally hes less 
kind about the center which he says blocks westlake avenue from 
the plaza and doesnt fit with nearby buildings and the awful 
tacky blue glass of the towers windows creates an eyesore he 
said 
royer says the city has a clear winner in the retail center 
but thinks it might be a while before the park becomes popular 
its sort of like a new shoe it will take a little time for 
it to become comfortable as a gathering place said royer

full pants and long skirts are coming back in a big 
way as readytowear shows for next summer started wednesday they 
revealed leggy looks in shorts and short skirts but paid more 
attention to longer hemlines 
for the first time american designer patrick kelly gave a tent 
show in a courtyard of the louvre joining the other big names of 
readytowear 
his clothes were just as jazzy and fun as in past less orthodox 
settings with plenty of clinging jersey dresses decorated in dice 
this time along with the usual kelly signature buttons 
the dice also gave pizazz to little fitted pinstriped suits in 
cotton that looked like denim flowerandpolkadot prints on linen 
also added fun topped by fitted jackets with decollete shawl 
collars 
there were a lot of wide wearable trousers but kelly also 
stuck to shortie bloomers and full shorts 
among the lovely more wearable clothes were simple white linen 
shift tops decorated with seashells worn with wide shorts or full 
long skirts 
he based most of his collection on jokes about the mona lisa 
showing jungle lisa in safari outfits skirts pants and bras 
or bustier tops in panther spots he put mona lisa cartoons on 
tshirts including one of himself framed like the famous portrait 
kellys little clinging dresses topped with flowers and 
flowerbasket hats were as winning as his white jerseys with 
multicolored handkerchief trim or bright multicolored trains 
and kelly laid on a milky way galaxy of stars and crescent moons 
in his stretch jersy numbers for evening 
in contrast marc bohans show for dior was full of clothes that

a former elected official was 
sentenced to four life terms wednesday at the courthouse where he 
shot to death a judge a lawyer his former sisterinlaw and 
wounded his exwife 
clyde melvin 63 a former franklin county commissioner from 
nearby apalachicola pulled a 357caliber magnum revolver from his 
boot during a july 28 1987 alimony hearing at the gulf county 
courthouse and shot the victims before he was wounded in the neck 
by sheriff al harrison 
circuit judge carl harper of pensacola followed a jurys 93 
recommendation against sending melvin to floridas electric chair 
for the firstdegree murder of circuit judge wilson lamar bailey 
melvin was ordered to serve life in prison without parole for at 
least 25 years the only other sentence possible for that crime 
melvin was convicted sept 21 in pensacola of firstdegree 
murder for shooting bailey 64 of blountstown through the door of 
a bathroom where the judge had dashed for cover 
he also was convicted of attempted murder for shooting his 
exwife eleanor inez huckeba 60 in the head and seconddegree 
murder for the slayings of her lawyer tom ingles 43 of panama 
city and her sister peggy white paulk 55 of panama city beach 
melvins lawyer henry barksdale said he believed his client 
would be eligible for release when he is 88 upon serving the 
25year minimum for baileys slaying 
melvins trial was moved to pensacola because residents of this 
florida panhandle town where melvin had a career as a security 
guard at a paper mill knew too much about the case 
melvin and others were privately informed of the sentences 
before they were read in open court melvin remained seated and 
expressed no emotion except for a slight trembling of his cheeks 
and chin as the sentences were pronounced 
he declined an opportunity to make a statement 
several relatives of the victims were present all declined 
comment 
several psychologists and psychiatrists testified during his 
trial that melvin was paranoid and under great emotional distress 
at the time of the slayings they disagreed however on whether he 
was legally insane

the presidential election is more than two 
weeks away but insiders already are predicting that a george bush 
administration would be run by a cast of familiar figures from 
ronald reagans presidency 
with michael dukakis far down in the polls and struggling to 
recover his staff says transition planning is on hold even so 
democrats who have been out of power for eight years dream about 
the makeup of a dukakis administration 
among republicans there is a general expectation that former 
treasury secretary james a baker iii who is bushs campaign 
chairman would become secretary of state former sen john tower 
of texas an arms negotiator for reagan and an adviser to bush on 
national security matters has been lobbying for secretary of 
defense and probably has a claim on it republicans say 
gop sources say dick thornburgh who replaced edwin meese iii as 
attorney general this year probably would remain as head of the 
justice department while nicholas brady a onetime bush campaign 
adviser who replaced baker at treasury would hold onto his job 
other likely holdovers in a bush administration according to 
various sources are labor secretary ann dore mclaughlin and 
education secretary lauro cavazos bush has promised to put a 
hispanic in his cabinet and cavazos fits the bill 
reagans national security adviser colin powell is rumored 
both as a candidate to stay in his current job or to head the cia 
otherwise william webster currently the cia chief may be asked 
to remain according to sources 
craig fuller who has been bushs chief of staff for the past 
four years would have to be considered for the same job in the 
white house new hampshire gov john sununu also is mentioned for 
that post or for a spot in the cabinet 
however political consultant vic kamber who owns a public 
relations firm whose major clients are labor unions notes that 
bushs selection of dan quayle as his running mate was a total 
shocker with that in mind kamber says we may be in for some 
surprises when he bush picks his cabinet 
on the democratic side paul brountas a lawyer who is dukakis 
campaign chairman and a close friend and trusted adviser 
presumably could have any job he wants including attorney general 
another longtime adviser john sasso likely would end up as white 
house chief of staff 
rep lee hamilton of indiana the secondranking democrat on the 
house foreign affairs committee and the chairman of the house 
irancontra committee has been mentioned as a possible secretary 
of state under dukakis 
for treasury the names of rep william gray dpenn chairman 
of the house budget committee and investment banker roger altman 
are frequently mentioned for dukakis 
on defense matters dukakis turns to the chairmen of the house 
and senate armed service committees sen sam nunn of georgia and 
rep les aspin of wisconsin and they would be regarded as the 
leading candidates to head the pentagon 
for the record bush and dukakis as well as their aides do 
not talk about whom they would put in their cabinet by revealing 
their choices before the election they would alienate people who 
werent picked and the name of the game now is to offend as few 
people as possible 
when they tell me im the president of the united states or 
presidentelect of the united states ill begin picking a 
cabinet dukakis said this week 
bush said he would be ready to name a cabinet quickly but 
dismissed suggestions he already has decided whom he would pick 
i cant let myself think about that im not going to do 
something that dumb and shift gears bush told a news conference 
sunday 
despite the disclaimers there has been no shortage of talk 
about postelection plums particularly in the bush campaign and in 
republican circles 
its believed that clayton yeutter the us trade 
representative under reagan would be happy to be picked by bush as 
secretary of agriculture another name in circulation for that post 
is former iowa rep cooper evans 
jim burnett former chairman of the national transportation 
safety board and currently a member of the panel has let it be 
known hed like to be secretary of transportation 
for the energy department a name frequently mentioned for a 
bush administration is william martin a former deputy secretary of 
the department who serves as an adviser to bush c boyden gray 
counselor to bush is believed to be more interested in a white 
house post but would go to energy if asked sources say 
bush also may ask lee thomas to remain as chief of the 
environmental protection agency according to sources both at the 
agency and within the environmental community a darkhorse 
candidate for the same job is michael deland epas regional 
administrator in boston who was the point man in federal efforts to 
clean up boston harbor 
for dukakis the epa chief might be thomas jorling head of the 
environmental conservation department in new york 
its expected that the chairman of the council of economic 
advisers under bush would be stanford university economist michael 
j boskin under dukakis it probably would be harvard economist 
lawrence h summers 
richard darman a top white house adviser under reagan who moved 
to treasury as deputy secretary with baker likely would be 
director of the office of management and budget under bush 
david keene a gop political consultant with connections to 
bush says zbigniew brezinski a democrat who was president 
carters national security adviser and now is a supporter of bush 
would be a good candidate to be un ambassador 
for the interior department two names mentioned for a bush 
administration are henry diamond a lawyer in environmental 
practice and nathaniel reed former assistant secretary of 
interior for fish and wildlife and parks 
under dukakis interior probably would be filled by former 
arizona gov bruce babbitt

scratch a democrat these days and youll more 
than likely find a budding media consultant with an idea for 
television ads to buoy michael dukakis flagging presidential 
campaign 
some of these proposals lack a practical touch such as the man 
who called to say he had a great idea republican george bush 
driving a truck for busch light beer he wasnt sure how the 
dukakis campaign could get the vice president into the truck with 
his rivals cameras rolling 
but while their advice may be questionable voters have sensed a 
vacuum one that stems to a large degree from dukakis failure to 
hone in on a single strong theme for his overall campaign 
since the convention in july the democrats have released a 
string of seemingly random ads some negative and some positive 
touching on a wide variety of themes with little apparent tiein 
to dukakis daily campaign speeches and activities 
by contrast the bush campaign and its media shaped by 
political veteran roger ailes have from the start held to a 
consistent and unified goal to paint bush as a family man with 
mainstream values and leadership goals and dukakis as an 
inexperienced leftwing robot who is soft on crime weak on 
defense and holds values alien to most americans 
accurate or not the tactic has worked 
dave dalessandro dukakis recently hired ad chief says the 
massachusetts governors advertising strategy is on target as of 
last friday that was the day two new spots featuring dukakis 
speaking straight into the camera began running on national 
television the campaign also is running a national ad ridiculing 
bushs plan to put his running mate dan quayle in charge of the 
war on drugs 
but the question pondered by many observers from academics and 
political pros to columnists and average citizens is why did the 
dukakis campaign take so long to develop its own strategy where 
was dukakis in midsummer when bush began hammering at his records 
on crime and the environment blasting him as a liberal and raising 
issues that put him on the wrong side of patriotism 
dalessandro says he wont answer those questions since he 
didnt come on board until last month but there is now he 
maintains a strategy we will show michael dukakis as a human 
being and who he is he said theres one overarching theme 
michael dukakis is on the side of the majority of the people 
his theme is that we must regain our stature and our ability to 
perform as a country 
how the new strategy will be played out on television in the 
final weeks of the presidential campaign both in news coverage and 
advertising is a mystery but some experts arent shy about 
suggesting what should be done 
kathleen hall jamieson a university of texas political 
scientist and author of three books on campaign media said the 
dukakis campaign has failed so far to do the one thing that 
advertising can do well which is show the private person 
she said the campaign should produce an ad similar to one that 
shows bush with his grandchildren at a picnic in a kitchen and 
other domestic settings the democrat sorely needs something that 
shows that when he bends his knees his pants crease she said 
and recommended some sample footage a primaryseason clip of 
dukakis sitting in a little chair at a nursery school singing 
itsybitsy spider with the children 
that should be combined with four or five hardhitting attacks 
on bush jamieson said plus some extended intothecamera 
statements on how things would be different under a dukakis 
administration and lots of hispanic advertising with dukakis 
speaking in spanish about everything they care about 
david axelrod a chicago media consultant who did the ads for 
illinois sen paul simons presidential campaign said he would 
abandon the effort to humanize dukakis hes not going to 
outschmaltz bush and he shouldnt try and theres no time for 
that he said id really go hard negative on bush and try to 
shake some people loose 
axelrod said dukakis has lost the battle to define himself and 
that was one of the critical mistakes thats been made he was not 
wellknown and he allowed the bush people to paint in the blank 
canvas before he did i dont think theres time now to erase their 
picture totally he has to concentrate instead on chipping away at 
bushs vulnerabilities 
dalessandro reacts philosophically to the outpouring of advice 
which even included a call from his own father who is in the 
hospital with a heart ailment and is normally indifferent to 
politics 
we have seen all those ideas we have actually done some he 
said citing as an example a slew of hispanic ads due to start this 
week but he said 99 percent of the decisions already have been 
made so no more advice is needed we have a strategy we know 
what the issues are we know what needs to be done

president reagan campaigning for republican 
white house hopeful george bush had second thoughts about 
declaring the opening of a second front for gop senate candidates 
reagan on wednesday deleted from the prepared text of a campaign 
speech his reference to a broadened political strategy aimed at 
giving more focus to republicans seeking to recapture the senate 
on a day in which bush campaign manager james a baker iii 
accompanied reagan to tout the unprecedented degree of 
cooperation between the bush campaign and the white house reagan 
found himself explaining why he didnt use the secondfront 
reference in his speech to a campaign rally in bowling green ohio 
asked as he arrived at cincinnati airport why he had dropped the 
phrase reagan replied bcause i didnt think it fit the 
president often departs from a prepared speech text to add a joke 
or some other thought but he seldom deletes something that has 
been included in a speech and distributed to reporters 
the deleted portion of the speech said today were opening a 
second front 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that reagan 
removed the sentences because he didnt want to inadvertently 
give any suggestion that the focus was changing from the election 
of george bush the president will campaign as if the vice 
president were 10 points behind 
there has been speculation that the bush campaign and the 
president would make proportionately more appearances through the 
remainder of the campaign in states where the gop might have a 
chance of capturing a senate seat 
baker however has been urging bush campaign officials and 
workers to avoid seeming overconfident or complacent in view of the 
vice presidents advantage over democrat michael dukakis in public 
opinion polls 
baker told reporters he had decided to accompany reagan on 
visits to columbus bowling green and cincinnati because reagan was 
appearing for the first time at events financed by the bush 
campaign 
he called wednesday the first day the president is traveling 
on the campaigns nickel reagans campaign appearances so far 
have been financed either by state republican parties or the 
national party 
in a conversation with reporters aboard the presidents plane 
baker was asked whether bush would change his campaign strategy now 
that he appears to be leading 
were not changing our mix of states he replied weve 
been campaigning in states where there are senate races all along 
the democratic party recaptured the senate from the republicans 
in 1986 even though reagan campaigned vigorously for several gop 
candidates who subsequently lost the democrats now hold a 5446 
majority in the senate 
white house chief of staff ken duberstein said that reagan and 
baker at some point during the campaign day discussed what the 
president would do to provide further help for bush

republican nominee george bush has a sizable but 
not an overwhelming lead in the presidential race and his 
advantage relies heavily on disproportionate support from men new 
polls indicate 
abc newswashington post and harris polls released wednesday put 
the bush lead at seven and nine points respectively both 
considerably less than the 17point bush lead in an nbc newswall 
street journal poll out monday 
the abcpost poll done oct 12 through tuesday found virtually 
no movement since before last weeks presidential debate it put 
the race at 52 percent to 45 percent bush little different from 
its 5145 result oct 511 
john brennan an abc pollster noted that debates historically 
produce little or no sizable change in voter sympathies the harris 
poll however did find movement from 50 percent to 48 percent 
bush on oct 610 to 5344 now 
as in other recent surveys the harris poll found a continuing 
gender gap for bush despite his lead he led among men by 5740 
but the race among women was about even fortyeight percent for 
bush 49 percent for dukakis 
that poll indicated that bush had gained through his attacks on 
dukakis stand on crime sixtythree percent rated dukakis as too 
soft on law enforcement up from 52 percent in late august 
also 49 percent agreed that dukakis seems too liberal in his 
views to get my vote a number that has remained more or less 
stable in the poll since august sixtynine percent said dukakis 
lacked enough foreign policy experience down from 75 percent in 
august but still high 
the nbcjournal poll that had found a 17point bush lead was 
done friday through sunday and nbc pollster laurily epstein said 
it could have missed some movement back to dukakis on monday after 
a big swing to bush following thursdays debate 
epstein commenting on the harris poll before the abcpost poll 
was released noted that the harris and nbcjournal polls found 
nearly the same level for support for the republicans 53 percent 
and 55 percent respectively 
the difference is really on the democratic side not the 
republican side she said it may be that we caught the highest 
spinoff from the debate which polls and other news accounts said 
bush had won 
the harris poll of 1356 likely voters had a margin of error 
of plus or minus three points as did the nbcjournal poll released 
monday the abcpost poll of 1195 likely voters had an error 
margin of about three points

democrat howard metzenbaum is counting on 
a third term as an outspoken consumer advocate in the senate 
despite a wellfinanced and sometimes highly negative challenge 
from the mayor of his native cleveland 
so far the polls are behind metzenbaum who has a reported 10 
million bankroll to back up his reelection effort his republican 
rival cleveland mayor george voinovich scoffs at the doubledigit 
leads and says hell benefit from a grassroots effort in all 88 
ohio counties in the final days and george bushs presidential 
coattails 
voinovichs campaign indicates he will have spent up to 8 
million but possibly as much as 10 million by nov 8 on what has 
been largely a battle of television commercials selected pot 
shots and what some newspapers have called unprecedented sleaze on 
television 
the campaign is being fought over a variety of issues and each 
has charged the other with changing past positions for political 
expediency 
metzenbaum concedes that he has changed his position on capital 
punishment from outright opposition to favoring the death sentence 
for drug pushers who he said can afford competent lawyers 
metzenbaum voted for such penalties in the senate drug bill 
metzenbaum denied voinovichs charge that he changed because 
polls show most ohioans favor capital punishment 
metzenbaum says voinovich called for cuts in social security 
three separate times before announcing he was against any 
reductions 
metzenbaum was angered by voinovich television commercials that 
accused him of being soft on child pornography on oct 10 he 
withdrew his summerlong promises for a fall debate saying the 
gutter is not a fitting place for a debate 
voinovich claimed in the ads that metzenbaum used his position 
on the senate judiciary committee to block a measure that would 
have dealt harshly with child pornography 
metzenbaum however said he was concerned about a provision in 
the legislation that he claimed was unconstitutional and that the 
justice department concurred with his position metzenbaum later 
supported the bill after the provision was revised 
voinovich said metzenbaum is afraid to discuss his record but 
he admitted that the commercials which drew criticism from several 
major newspapers produced an unexpected boomerang effect 
he insisted his allegations were true but said his campaign 
should have set out to prove the charges in another way 
voinovich though mayor of cleveland since he defeated dennis 
kucinich less than a year after the city went into default in 1978 
also dealt with statewide issues as lieutenant governor to james a 
rhodes 
as mayor he presided over clevelands fiscal recovery and as 
past president of the national league of cities he often criticized 
the reagan administrations urban policies 
still voinovich is borrowing lines from reagan and benefiting 
from the presidents visits to ohio on the stump voinovich 52 
charges that the 71yearold metzenbaum is a liberal who is out 
of touch with ohios mainstream having voted for higher taxes 
and cuts in defense spending while championing leftwing causes and 
opposing legislation to help industry create jobs 
twothirds of his bankroll comes from out of state 
voinovich has charged 
most of metzenbaums speeches and ads center on his record and 
claims of numerous accomplishments that include safer baby 
formulas help for victims of rare diseases and a law requiring 60 
days notice of plant closings 
on the attack metzenbaum contends voinovich waffled over the 
plant closing law once vetoed by reagan and that the mayor has 
given tacit approval to rightwing groups that have tried to paint 
the incumbent as a communist sympathizer 
voinovich said he has asked the most visible of those groups a 
goodbye metzenbaum club that raises money and sends mailings from 
cincinnati to back off but he said the club had persisted and 
that by competing with him for money they have actually hurt 
me 
metzenbaum responding to voinovich charges that he is a pawn of 
labor described himself as fiercely independent in recurring 
battles against corporate lobbyists and pressure groups that he 
said are pouring money into the republicans campaign 
there isnt a hit list anywhere between new york and 
california that doesnt have howard metzenbaum at the top the 
senator said 
metzenbaums committee assignments include energy and natural 
resources judiciary labor and human resources and the select 
committee on intelligence

obtaining a government security clearance is 
almost as easy as getting a credit card a critical report on 
federal efforts to curb spying suggests 
the report by the house intelligence committee concludes that 
officials dont do enough to scrutinize employees before they are 
granted bottomlevel security clearances and dont keep a close 
enough eye on those who are privy to the nations most sensitive 
secrets 
while some progress in protecting against spying has been made 
since a harsher report was issued two years ago bureaucratic 
fooddragging has kept counterintelligence gains below what they 
should be the panel said wednesday 
evidence of the lack of progress is the continuing discovery of 
new spy cases in which disgruntled employees or former government 
officials have eluded detection for months or years according to 
the report 
one example of the shortcomings is that many security clearances 
continue to be granted without checking applicants financial or 
employment backgrounds despite repeated past recommendations that 
those criteria be included the committee finds this failure to 
act inexcusable the report said 
asked whether that meant getting a security clearance is easier 
than opening a charge account oversight subcommittee chairman 
anthony beilenson dcalif said thats probably true 
the governments basic security review known as the national 
agency check involves reviewing fbi fingerprint files and dossiers 
at other federal agencies it does not include credit and 
employment checks and costs just 10 to complete 
we spend thousands for physical security measures in some 
programs to protect secret material but for the people part of 
it we are only willing to spend 10 thomas j obrien 
thendirector of the defense investigative service said in 
testimony before the panel last spring all of our losses have 
come from people 
the panels report found a pattern of bureaucratic sluggishness 
throughout the intelligence community in addressing security 
problems and it criticized a preoccupation with hardware and 
gadgetry that ignores fundamental personnel problems 
it also found that little has been done to control the 
proliferation of classified information and concluded that top cia 
personnel were the sources of many revelations in washington post 
reporter bob woodwards book veil about covert operations by 
the cia 
the intelligence panel voted unanimously to release the report 
overriding objections from the central intelligence agency the cia 
had no comment on the document 
the pentagon came in for particular criticism in the committees 
review which noted that at least 54 defense department personnel 
have been identified and punished over the past five years for 
espionage or security breaches despite the problems the 
department does not appear to be looking vigorously for new 
solutions the report said 
while the pentagon claims to have reduced its securitycleared 
personnel from 42 million to 28 million over the past three 
years the figures cannot be verified the panel said 
and with that many cleared personnel in addition to 11 million 
clearances for defense contractors the secretary of defense has 
only six professional staff members overseeing department security 
programs this is a pennywise and poundfoolish approach 
considering these personnel have access to the nations most 
sensitive data the report found 
as an example of failures in security screening of personnel 
the report cites the case of glen michael souther a former navy 
intelligence specialist 
while in the navy years ago in norfolk va southers wife 
voiced suspicions to a naval officer that her husband might be 
involved in espionage he left the navy went to old dominion 
university for russian studies then rejoined the navy as a 
reservist and was granted a top security clearance 
a background investigation did not catch the warning signs and 
souther defected this year to the soviet union taking with him 
classified technical data on weapons systems 
the panel also sought answers from the cia about the sources of 
disclosures in woodwards book published last year the book 
contains numerous references to intelligence details that were not 
widely known and one agency official testified i dont think 
there is a question i think it came from within the agency

a reagan administration official who refused 
to fund a school study program on the holocaust acknowledges that 
her decision was based in part on reviews including one complaining 
that the views of nazis and the ku klux klan werent included 
supporters of the holocaust program entitled facing history 
and ourselves contend that the review boards set up to assess the 
merits of the program for the education department were 
ideologically slanted and predisposed to recommend it not be funded 
but shirley curry a political appointee in the department said 
criticism that somehow the department in general and i in 
particular have operated in some antisemitic mode is 
absolutely absurd 
she told a house government operations subcommittee wednesday 
that the program was denied 70000 in federal funds three times 
those decisions were made either because the program scored low in 
critiques prepared by panels of outside reviewers or because as 
was the case this year when the program received a relatively high 
score a money squeeze prevented funding of an entire category of 
programs 
we looked at categories that we needed and that is what we 
funded she said 
she said she supports secondary school programs examining the 
holocaust the nazis systematic killing of some 6 million jews 
during world war ii she said the facing history curriculum 
would have received a grant if money had been available to fund 
everything 
the program was first denied a federal grant in 1986 after a 
member of an outside review panel faulted it for not including the 
opinions of the nazi party and the ku klux klan in 1987 a 
reviewer called it leftist antiwar antihunting and 
offensive to christian fundamentalits another reviewer said 
it was likely to produce a guilt trip 
rep barney frank dmass told the witness the fact is that 
you selected these reviewers and you gave full weight to their 
scores these two offensive wacko opinions were given full weight 
did you discount them for being crazy he asked 
curry the scores were recorded 
frank were these scores given the same weight as others 
curry yes 
frank you read them you gave them full weight shame on the 
department 
responding to further questions curry said that at the time the 
holocaust program was being considered she was a member of the 
eagle forum whose president is conservative activist phyllis 
schlafly 
mrs schlafly in a 1987 letter to an education department 
official urged that the grant application for the program be 
rejected she said it employed psychological manipulation 
induced behavioral change and privacyinvading treatment 
asked if mrs schlaflys position had any impact on the decision 
not to fund the program curry replied not in my book 
curry said she was reassigned last friday from her position as 
director of the departments national diffusion recognition 
division to become a special assistant to the assistant to the 
deputy secretary for management 
she said she plans to leave her 57000 a year position by the 
end of the year and hesitated when asked what her new duties would 
be 
rep frank told the witness it seems to me that they moved 
you to a political position for a month or two to avoid political 
embarrassment and gave you a month or two vacation at a 57000 a 
year salary 
margot stern strom of brookline mass who was instrumental in 
developing the holocaust teaching project for facing history and 
ourselves national foundation inc said the initial review 
comments on the program were beyond my imagination 
she said she and her colleagues concluded that the outside 
review system amounted to an ideological screen to permit the 
department to deny funding to facing history 
my own reading of the comments showed an extraordinarily 
narrow bias on the part of the reviewers she said

hurricane joan churned toward 
central america with 120 mph winds wednesday and forced thousands 
to evacuate coastal areas after it left 35 people dead or missing 
in colombia 
it will hit nicaragua or costa rica if it keeps on this track 
but there will also be heavy rainfall in panama said forecaster 
max mayfield at the national hurricane center in coral gables fla 
he said the eye of the storm probably would hit the coast early 
friday and that mountainous areas could suffer flash flooding and 
mudslides in the coming days 
rainfall of 5 to 10 inches was forecast for the storms path 
the hurricane center said parts of panama costa rica and nicaragua 
might get even heavier rains 
the colombian islands of san andres albuquerque and providencia 
were under a hurricane warning and a watch was posted for the 
caribbean coasts of nicaragua and costa rica 
joan swept across colombias guajira peninsula as a tropical 
storm monday and became a hurricane tuesday it killed 15 left 20 
missing injured 50 and flooded or destroyed the homes of 27000 
people colombias national emergency committee said wednesday 
preliminary reports from colombian officials on tuesday said 50 
people were dead or missing 
at midnight wednesday the storm was centered near latitude 113 
north and longitude 798 west about 160 miles eastsoutheast of 
san andres or 280 miles east of bluefields nicaragua it was 
moving west at 510 mph and maximum sustained winds were near 120 
mph 
what were really concerned about is that we have not had a 
category 3 hurricane before in this portion of the caribbean 
mayfield said we are very concerned that the people down there 
have never experienced anything like this 
a category 3 storm has maximum sustained winds from 111 mph to 
130 mph 
eladio zarate head of costa ricas weather service said 
evacuations continued in the coastal towns of puerto limon 
tortuguero colorado manitas and pueblo nuevo 
if joan hits puerto limon its could cause a lot of damage 
he said at least 5000 people fled puerto limon on wednesday and 
another 3000 evacuated from other coastal towns said johnny 
alfaro national emergency committee director in puerto limon 
we expect that tonight most of the 10000 residents of limon 
will be out of the city he said 
hundreds of people lined up for buses to flee puerto limon 100 
miles southeast of san jose the capital some said they were 
afraid there wouldnt be enough transportation for everyone 
we could die said alfaro valverde 58 as he waited in line 
in nicaragua the national airline aeronica suspended flights to 
bluefields on a remote stretch of the miskito coast about 180 
miles east of managua the capital 
if the hurricane stays over water it is possible its full 
force will hit bluefields thursday morning or friday morning it 
could be a disaster because most of the buildings there are of 
wood said alejo moreno head of the nicaraguan weather service 
civil defense officials in nicaragua said tuesday that they had 
enough emergency supplies only for immediate needs they said 
the 7year war with the usbacked rebels known as contras has 
drained their reserves 
joan is the fifth hurricane of the atlantic season in 
september hurricane gilbert left more than 300 people dead and 
caused widespread damage in mexico jamaica haiti the dominican 
republic and the cayman islands

the food and drug administration is hoping to 
speed therapies for aids and other lifethreatening diseases to 
market by formally encouraging pharmaceutical companies to work 
with the agency in the earliest stages of drug development 
in announcing publication of the new regulations in the federal 
register on wednesday fda commissioner frank e young acknowledged 
that they essentially codify what the agency already is doing 
the federal register notice itself says that although the 
new program is important it builds upon managerial and 
regulatory options available under existing practices and 
procedures 
young said the new mechanism which essentially allows a drug 
company to bypass finalstage drug testing was similar to that 
used in approval last year of azt still the only recognized drug 
for treatment of aids 
he said at a news conference that the agency is not weakening 
the safety and efficacy standards its uses in moving a drug from 
experimental to broad use but wants to compress the time needed to 
reach a conclusion on those standards 
this is the agencys best attempt to change its image from 
being umpire just calling safe or out to being more involved 
like the catcher calling signals said young 
another analogy he used was that of a college professor giving 
students a clear idea of what was being looked for in an essay test 
question rather than leaving them to try to guess the key points 
the teacher wanted addressed 
translated to the drug approval process young said the idea 
was to let drug companies know in early stages of testing which 
scientific questions the agency considered most crucial to address 
in followup testing 
the move will not satisfy many aids activists who in effect 
want the fda to scuttle its historic role and sign off on safety 
and effectiveness of potential aids drugs before the agency has 
satisfied itself those criteria have been met 
without such fda sanction physicians not participating in 
approved experiments with all the attendant red tape and 
reporting requirements are reluctant to use experimental 
therapies on their patients even though the drugs sometimes are 
available from foreign sources the doctors could face severe 
liability problems if such treatments backfire 
another underlying issue is that health insurance normally does 
not pay for experimental drug treatment but often does once the 
fda approves a drug 
hundreds of demonstrators temporarily shut down the fda 
headquarters building in nearby rockville md last week to demand 
more access to experimental drugs for aids treatment 
however the protest appears to have had no direct bearing on 
wednesdays announcement since it invokes the same fda policy young 
had outlined for demonstration leaders in a meeting several days 
before the protest 
young also traveled to boston earlier this year to defend the 
fda position at an international conference of gay and lesbian 
groups active in pushing for more experimental aids treatment 
the timing of wednesdays announcement three weeks before the 
election was another question 
young insisted that the timing of the announcement which 
referred to vice president george bush as having spearheaded the 
administrations task force on regulatory reform was not 
politically motivated 
this is the time in the continuity of all the things we have 
been doing to come forth with this he said in response to a 
question weve been working on this a long time so i reject 
that 
jean mcguire executive director of the aids action council had 
distributed statements in advance of youngs news conference 
charging the rationale for timing the announcement at this point 
is transparent at best 
she called the announcement politically opportunistic and 
potentially misleading 
the national gay amp lesbian task force said the substance and 
timing of the fdas announcement raises questions as to whether 
this is a preelection gambit rather than a serious attempt to make 
promising experimental therapies available to those with 
lifethreatening illnesses 
mathilde krim a founder of the american foundation for aids 
research was more receptive these are sound proposals she 
said but theres a big catch they come without significant 
dollars attached 
young insisted that additional fda staffers authorized by 
congress for last year and the coming year 126 new positions in 
each year leave the agency capable of assessing any new potential 
aids drugs on the near horizon 
young acknowledged that utilization of the newly published 
regulation would require drug developers to make a larger financial 
commitment up front than is the current practice 
that is because they essentially would have to spend more on 
preliminary human trials long before they have a good feel for 
whether the drug under development eventually will win market 
approval and thus return the research investment 
under the traditional threephase testing procedure a company 
has had considerable experience with a new drug before it goes into 
the expensive final test phase in which hundreds of patients are 
given an experimental drug at multiple centers around the nation 
if the expanded and more expensive phase two tests show 
conclusively that the drug is safe and effective the third phase 
would be dispensed with and the drug approved for market 
jeffrey c warren a spokesman for the pharmaceutical 
manufacturers association said the trade group supports the fda 
plan and in fact had pushed for it 
we have long believed that all drugs must be approved more 
rapidly and we believe extraordinary steps in the case of aids and 
other lifethreatening diseases are necessary he said

the greenhouse effect warming the earth is 
likely to raise ocean levels but lower the great lakes reduce 
crops across the south and turn some northern forests into 
grasslands according to a major government study 
the unreleased report by the environmental protection agency 
says lowlying coastal areas equal in size to the state of 
massachusetts could be submerged 
congress directed epa to perform major studies on the effects of 
the greenhouse effect and what can be done about it both studies 
are expected to be submitted to congress in december a draft of 
the summary of the effects report was obtained wednesday by the 
associated press 
the greenhouse effect is the expected warming of the earth 
from the growing concentration of gases in the atmosphere that keep 
heat from being radiated out to space the principal greenhouse 
gas carbon dioxide has increased 10 percent since 1958 and 
continued worldwide use of fossil fuels and destruction of tropical 
rain forests point to further increases 
some computer models have predicted that droughts could be more 
frequent in the midwest and southeast in the coming century as a 
result of the global warming the epa report says this years 
drought across the united states should serve as a warning even 
though precise predictions are impossible 
we cannot anticipate how changing technology new scientific 
advances urban growth and changing demographics will affect the 
world of the next century epa analysts write 
in this report we did not analyze or anticipate the reductions 
in barge shipments due to lower river levels the increases in 
forest fires due to dry conditions or the impacts on ducks due to 
disappearing prairie potholes all these impacts were made vivid 
during the past year 
the drought dramatically reminded us of our vulnerability as a 
nation but it cannot be viewed as a prediction of things to come 
until a severe event occurs such as the drought of 1988 we 
fail to recognize the close links between our society the 
environment and climate 
most scenarios say the earth will warm on average by three to 
eight degrees fahrenheit in the middle of the next century this 
will expand the volume of the oceans and melt some glaciers 
causing a rise in average sea levels estimated at 20 inches to 6 
feet 
the report says it could cost 73 billion to 111 billion to 
protect developed coastal areas from sea level increases but 4100 
square miles to 9200 square miles still would be lost the land 
area of massachusetts is 7826 square miles 
environmental groups have urged drives to improve energy 
efficiency and conservation and to replant forests which absorb 
carbon dioxide just last week a power company in connecticut said 
it would help plant trees in guatemala that would offset the carbon 
dioxide its new plant would emit over the next 40 years 
in its studies epa convened panels of experts searched the 
scientific literature and ran computer models of the global climate 
some potential effects it foresees

us food production is likely to remain adequate for domestic 
consumption although export capacity is uncertain higher 
temperatures across the country will shift relative agricultural 
productivity northward 
a moderate warming actually could bring economic benefits but 
changes would be negative with the hotter drier climate change 
scenario 
yields of dryland corn wheat and soybeans could decline under 
higher temperatures at particular sites by up to 80 percent mostly 
in the south in very northern areas such as minnesota dryland 
yields of corn and soybeans could double as warmer temperatures 
extend the frostfree growing season 
crop acreage in appalachia the southeast and the southern 
great plains could decrease by 5 percent to 25 percent acreage in 
the northern great lakes states the northern great plains and the 
pacific northwest could increase by 5 percent to 17 percent

the actual range of forests is likely to be reduced for 
centuries because the southern boundary may advance more quickly 
than the northern boundary 
declines may be visible in 30 years in mississippi and northern 
minnesota those forests appear to be very sensitive to small 
changes in climate 
in central michigan forests now dominated by sugar maple and 
oak may be replaced by grasslands with some sparse oak trees

some coastal wetlands could survive rising sea levels by 
migrating inland but one study estimated that if sea levels rose 
about 3 feet 26 percent to 66 percent of wetlands would be lost 
even if wetland migration is not blocked 
heat stress could reduce shellfish harvests in the south but 
bass and lake trout harvests in the great lakes could increase 
higher temperatures could reduce snow pack and increase 
evaporation both of which would lower the great lakes reducing 
shipping capacity but leading to a longer shipping season lake 
superior could fall 15 feet and lake michigan by as much as 8 feet 
higher temperatures and less snow pack also imply that water 
management systems such as those in california would be unlikely to 
maintain current yields

the latest entry in the popular game of rating 
places concludes that cedar rapids iowa is the nations best spot 
to live gary ind the report says finished last 
zero population growth a washington interest group issued its 
ratings of about 190 cities on wednesday comparing them according 
to a variety of population and environmental factors in what it 
called an urban stress test 
just a week earlier an unrelated study also seeking to rate 
urban stress was published by psychology today magazine done by 
robert levine of california state university in fresno that report 
pronounced reno nev the most stressful spot in the nation and 
said state college pa has the least stress 
other recent rankings have included

the newly issued ratings took a year to compile according to 
zero population growth which looked at population and 
environmental factors in contrast to levine who studied the human 
response to stress 
cedar rapids got a stress rating of 16 from zpg edging out 
madison wis which had a 17 rating and ann arbor mich and 
lincoln neb which each rated 18 
not surprisingly todd bergen of the cedar rapids chamber of

things move here at a perfect pace life isnt too fast it 
isnt too slow we enjoy what we do and we enjoy living here

in levines list managed a relatively good 28 rating from zpg 
his report ranked cedar rapids 55th out of 286 and placed the 
region including gary hammond and east chicago in 118th place 
zero population growth said the best large city that is with

a corn belt member of congress is looking at 
the plastic grocery bag as a way of carrying grain farmers to 
better times while improving the environment along the way 
a new biodegradable plastic bag is made partly from cornstarch 
when its tossed away and buried in a landfill it decomposes in a 
few months compared with a century or two for regular plastic bags 
rep jim jontz dind recently sent letters to major grocery 
stores and other retailers asking them to consider a trial program 
using the biodegradable plastic bags 
a spokesman tom buis said wednesday that the proposal still is 
being debated but that it has had a very positive reception so 
far from indiana storekeepers 
jontz said in his letter that the trial program would 
demonstrate to the public the benefits to our environment and our 
economy of using products made from biodegradable plastics 
also he said the use of cornstarch in the bags would help 
farmers corn is indianas no 1 crop and farmers in our state 
would benefit immensely from the increased use of biodegradable 
plastics made from cornstarch jontz said 
a number of farm and trade groups also support the plastic bag 
idea including the national corn growers association and many of 
its state affiliates 
in jefferson city mo biodegradable bags are being used in a 
60day testing program the first citywide campaign to see if the 
cornstarch mixture is practical for trash pickups 
according to the agriculture department research chemists felix 
h otey and richard p westhoff developed processes for using 
cornstarch in plastic at the departments northern research center 
peoria ill 
the usda processes were licensed for use and further development 
by agritech industries inc gibson city ill and for sale to 
other companies 
one firm rollpak corp of goshen ind began operation this 
year making plastic trash bags made of 7 percent cornstarch when 
soil bacteria and fungi consume the starch the remaining 
polyethylene crumbles into small particles that the organisms can 
break down easily 
gary weaver vice president of rollpak said the new bags 
degrade in two to three years compared with 100 years or more for 
regular plastic and some plastics take 300 to 400 years he said 
one problem has been the greater cost of the cornstarch plastic 
bags each priced 10 percent to 20 percent more than regular 
plastic bags according to weaver 
jontz noted the additional expense in his letter to storekeepers 
but added that the benefits of demonstrating to the public the 
advantages of biodegradable plastic are also appreciable

milk production has slowed from earlier 
expectations but still could increase enough in 1988 to set a 
record says the agriculture department 
part of the slowdown was attributed to higher feed costs 
resulting from the droughtreduced grain harvests 
milk output declined in 1987 to 1425 billion pounds from a 
record 1434 billion pounds in 1986 this years production was 
forecast last spring to rise 2 percent to 3 percent from 1987 
but the departments economic research service said wednesday in 
its new outlook report that 1988 milk production may increase only 
around 1 percent from last years level that could still 
exceed the record level of two years ago 
milk cow numbers have slipped since january and were almost 1 
percent below a year ago in julyseptember the report said 
meanwhile milk production per cow posted a moderate 2 percent 
rise from a year ago both milk per cow and milk cow numbers are 
expected to weaken further 
the report added that the effects of the higher feed costs next 
year will be magnified because milk production was already easing 
when the drought began as a result of a series of cuts in 
government supports 
if crops are good next year and feed prices decrease 
production probably will strengthen as 1989 progresses the 
report said however 1989 milk production might not match the 
1988 record 
the seasonal rise in retail prices of dairy products in the 
second half of this year will be larger than in recent years 
the report said even so the increase will not be out of line 
with increases in prices of all food or all items 
overall it said consumer prices of milk and other dairy 
products in 1988 probably will average about 2 percent more than in 
1987

fraud and misconduct touch one of every four 
savings and loan institutions and play a part in more than 
threequarters of all sampl failures a congressional report 
concludes 
the us government is now confronting a growing and longterm 
epidemic of abuse misconduct and criminality in financial 
institutions said the study released wednesday by a panel of 
the house government operations committee 
the problem among commercial banks is serious but not as severe 
the report said it linked a third of all bank failures to 
misconduct 
william b oconnell president of the us league of savings 
institutions acknowledged that fraud played a significant role 
in some past sampl failures 
but he maintained that the report which covered the 3 years 
between 1984 and june 1987 does not portray the savings 
institution business of today 
extensive background checks are now made to keep the crooks 
and high fliers out of our business those who did slip in earlier 
in this decade are now gone he said 
the house study comes during the worst year for failures of both 
banks and sampls since the depression and amid congressional debate 
over whether taxpayers will be required to bail out the fund 
insuring sampl deposits 
federal regulators estimate it will cost 45 billion to 50 
billion to restore the savings industry to health private analysts 
put the price tag as high as 100 billion 
according to rep doug barnard jr dga chairman of the 
government operations subcommittee on monetary affairs recent 
efforts by the justice department to combat bank fraud have been 
severely hindered since april when department officials 
transferred 11 million in travel money to one of former attorney 
general edwin meese iiis favored projects an antiobscenity task 
force 
the report said justice department attorneys working on bank 
fraud cases have been forced to stop traveling to some cities the 
result has been a significant delay in investigations it said 
nearly half of bank and savings and loan failures are 
concentrated in texas and other southwestern states suffering 
economically from the collapse of oil prices in 1986 
but industry critics say many of the institutions have been 
victims of highflying owners and officers who misused their insider 
status running up huge losses through recklessness and sometimes 
outright fraud 
the barnard panel said regulators found misconduct in 168 of 210 
sampl insolvencies during the 3 years ending in june 1987 they also 
found it in another 313 ailing sampls and 295 healthy institutions 
all told that represented about 25 percent of the entire industry 
the report said 
at commercial banks 98 of 354 failures in 1985 1986 and the 
first half of 1987 were associated with fraud and insider abuse 
oconnell however said the reports numbers appear to be 
overblown he said they categorize minor and perhaps 
unintentional infractions of complex regulations as misconduct 
at the end of june 7350 bank and sampl cases were being 
investigated by the fbi and federal grand juries fortysix percent 
involved losses of 100000 and more and a third involved 
institutions in texas california and florida those three states 
have been criticized for lax banking regulations 
barnards subcommittee offered a laundry list of 
recommendations including 
the federal deposit insurance corp which regulates about half 
of the nations commercial banks should increase its examination 
force from 2035 to 2300 inspectors it should boost the pay of 
senior and midlevel examiners to stem a 10 percent turnover rate 
the office of the comptroller of the currency which regulates 
nationally chartered banks and lost a third of its senior 
executives in 1986 and 1987 to higher paying jobs also needs to 
increase salaries 
the fbi should end its practice of assigning junior agents to 
bank fraud cases and of transferring them to other jobs when they 
gain experience 
the justice department should ensure that enough money is set 
aside for travel by fraud unit attorneys it should seek more money 
from congress and hire more lawyers for us attorney offices

consumers would get more details about the 
costs of credit cards and get them sooner than required by 
current federal and state laws under legislation being sent to 
president reagan 
in the blink of an eye the house on wednesday approved by voice 
vote legislation to require banks department stores and other 
issuers of credit cards to provide more information to consumers 
about interest rates and other charges 
it had been anticipated that the house would take a roll call 
vote on the measure which was opposed by rep frank annunzio 
dill chairman of the house consumer subcommittee he had delayed 
final approval of the measure last week when it first came up on 
the floor 
however when the measure came up for a vote it was passed 
quickly and sent to the white house for the presidents signature 
the senate approved the measure by voice vote last week 
except for annunzios objection there was little other 
opposition to the bill banking groups had worked for passage of 
the measure because it would prevent states from imposing a 
patchwork of differing disclosure requirements in what is clearly 
an interstate industry in addition a chief sponsor rep charles 
e schumer dny and others except for annunzio had long ago 
given up on trying to enact a nationwide interest rate cap on 
credit cards 
under the measure card issuers would be required to disclose 
clearly their interest rates fees grace periods before interest 
charges begin to accrue and the method of calculating interest 
charges 
in that way schumer and sen christopher j dodd dconn the 
key senate sponsor said consumers would be able to shop around for 
the lowest interest rates because of competition 
michelle meier counsel for government affairs with consumers 
union said we have waited anxiously for this bill to finally 
become law and wednesdays action takes us to within an inch of 
that goal all consumers not just those in states which have 
passed similar laws will now get the information to fight and 
switch 
donald g ogilvie executive vice president of the american 
bankers association also praised the passage of the measure 
the bill is a victory for both consumers and creditors who 
will benefit from balanced disclosure legislation said ogilvie 
this bill will make it easier for the 107 million credit card 
holders in the us to make informed choices about credit card 
programs since significant card features will be disclosed earlier 
at the time of application or solicitation and in a uniform 
manner under current law creditors are not required to disclose 
this information until the card is issued

the 100th congress rather than recessing with 
a bang may go out with a whisper 
most sessions of congress end with raucous allnight 
billpassing sessions but the 100th congress is nearing an end to 
its productive twoyear session so quietly that many lawmakers may 
not be around to see the gavel fall 
its an election year and many senators and house members have 
already slipped out of town to campaign for reelection back home 
congress already has fallen nearly three weeks behind its original 
adjournment target 
some members arent anxious to come back at all 
senate leaders hinted wednesday as to just how and just when 
the congress might adjourn for the year 
we wont have another vote this year senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas told startled reporters at a morning 
meeting he meant he didnt think the senate would have any formal 
roll call votes but would pass remaining legislation by the 
unanimous consent of those present 
the senate has been passing legislation all week without roll 
call votes a process that requires the presence of three senators 
the presiding officer a single democrat and a lone republican 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva said later that dole 
had made a pretty accurate prediction 
byrd explained in a telephone interview that although 
legislation remains to be passed including a major antidrug bill 
its not the kind of thing senators have to come back for to take 
roll call votes 
two major pieces of legislation remain the catchall antidrug 
bill already passed by the house and senate in differing versions 
and a tax bill if housesenate negotiators can iron out 
differences the senate could pass them both by friday and quit for 
the year 
we ought to be able to finish the whole kit and caboodle by 
the close of business friday byrd said 
are any members complaining about still being here 
my wife has complained byrd responded 
in the house members returned for roll call votes wednesday 
but only after enjoying a fiveday break while waiting for the 
senate to act on bills it already had passed 
house democratic whip tony coelho of california had his own 
theory on why the electionyear congress was taking so long to 
finish its business 
incumbent senators are enjoying having the excuse not to be 
debating their opponents coelho said how can the public 
complain if youre here working on a drug bill 
dole and byrd are showing physical signs of wanting to call it 
quits or in congressional parlance adjourning sine die in 
english that means without setting a date 
dole wore a campaignstyle button on his label the other day 
that proclaimed free the 100th 
byrd showed up the next day with his own button warning sine 
or die

if nancy reagan plans to continue her 
yearslong practice of borrowing highpriced designer fashions 
shes not saying 
but her spokeswoman isnt ruling out the possibility that more 
free fashions might be seen at white house functions 
and president reagan is jumping into the flap to defend his 
wife praising the first lady as a hardworking but unpaid 
government employee 
this evening the president was scheduled to attend an elaborate 
tribute to mrs reagan sponsored by kiwanis international and 
other organizations that have participated in her antidrug abuse 
campaign efforts 
the celebration comes after a day in which mrs reagan shunned 
reporters who were attempting to speak with her about the designer 
gowns lent her by leading fashion houses 
on wednesday as she left the national center for therapeutic 
riding a center devoted to helping the handicapped mrs reagan 
only smiled slightly and continued walking as reporters attempted 
to query her 
the first ladys spokeswoman elaine crispen has acknowledged 
that mrs reagan broke her little promise made in 1982 to stop 
accepting the items lent her by leading couturiers 
reagan denounced the reports which first appeared in time 
magazine over the weekend 
i dont have anything to say about that ridiculous story 
reagan told reporters as he left the white house for a day of 
campaigning in ohio 
and at a speech later in the day reagan came to his wifes 
defense 
he praised the first ladys antidrug abuse campaign and added 
the governments got quite an employee there with no salary 
white house counsel fred fielding informed the office of 
government ethics in 1982 that even though the ethics in government 
act of 1978 did not require mrs reagan to report the borrowed 
material she would include the information on financial disclosure 
forms 
at that time she also pledged to quit using borrowed items 
however time quoted several designers over the weekend as 
saying they have continued to lend mrs reagan expensive clothes 
since 1982 and neither the first lady nor the president has since 
reported the items as gifts or loans on their financial disclosure 
and tax forms 
one los angeles designer david hayes was quoted by time as 
saying hed made some 60 to 80 madetoorder outfits available to 
the first lady over the years she returned more than half and kept 
the others he said 
a spokeswoman for hayes who refused to identify herself said 
he was in conference on wednesday and unable to take a phone 
call 
mrs reagans spokeswoman disputed hayes account contending 
his numbers were extraordinarily high 
i havent seen her wear a david hayes in five years mrs 
crispen said 
mrs crispen also took issue with hayes assertion that she 
hasnt returned some of the dresses made especially for her all 
the items that were borrowed have been returned mrs crispen 
the spokeswoman said she did not know what led the first lady to 
break the promise she made in 1982 to report the borrowed gowns 
i just dont know she made her own rule she broke her own 
rule perhaps because she was told it wasnt against the law i 
just dont know what her personal thinking was mrs crispen said 
the spokeswoman said she couldnt rule out a continuance of the 
practice however 
i wont rule out that possibility that sometime something 
in the future might be borrowed she added

american singer john denver is welcome to fly 
aboard a soviet spacecraft but the cosmonauts hope he will do 
something besides bring his guitar and sing 
cosmonaut alexander alexandrov who has made two space journeys 
and spent a total of 310 days in orbit said wednesday that it is 
the practice of the soviet union to fly representatives of many 
countries on board the mir space station 
that he said would include someone from the united states 
including denver 
but alexandrov speaking through an interpreter added the 
cosmonauts of course are more interested that if they fly with 
someone that their colleagues have tasks or experiments denver 
deals with problems that are not totally connected with space or 
with scientific or technological problems 
denver a recording artist and movie star announced recently 
that the soviets have said he could fly aboard a soviet craft and 
spend time on the mir space station if he would pay a fee of 10 
million and undergo training 
alexandrov teamed with apollo astronaut russell l schweickart 
on a book promotion tour for the association of space explorers 
said soviet cosmonauts are interested in teaching children of the 
world about the importance of space flight and how to preserve 
our earth 
this educational effort could be aided he said by flying 
journalists and teachers particularly teachers into space 
denver could perhaps do the same thing he said 
schweickart said that he has been told by the soviets that the 
10 million fee required from denver is not unique but is a 
standard charge that the soviets have requested from all guest 
cosmonauts 
its not like they are selling a ticket for money said the 
us astronaut 
schweickart and alexandrov said the association of space 
explorers is an organization open to any of the more than 200 men 
and women from 25 countries who have flown in space the current 
membership is 72 from 17 countries said schweickart 
alexandrov said the group feels that the spacefaring nations of 
the world should prepare a craft that will be constantly poised for 
the launch of a rescue mission to recover astronauts or cosmonauts 
stranded in space 
you can have completely unexpected and catastrophic potential 
crises in space said alexandrov there may be a case that in 
order to save a life you would have to rescue an astronaut before 
three days went by 
during his first term in office president reagan asked the 
soviet union to participate in developing space rescue techniques 
that would involve transferring of astronauts and cosmonauts from 
the orbiting spacecraft of one country to that of the other but 
the offer was rejected in 1985 
alexandrov however said the cosmonauts definitely agree 
that there should be rescue capabilities 
there ought to be systems which are always ready to deal with 
this in the ussr and maybe other countries and the united 
states he said this would allow us to go more calmly about 
what we are doing 
the book promoted by the space explorers organization is 
entitled the home planet and is a collection of photographs 
taken in space on american and soviet spacecraft along with the 
pictures are quotations and excerpts from essays by the astronauts 
and cosmonauts 
this book is written for the children of the future so 
children might understand how to develop the science and technology 
of the future and how to preserve the earth said alexandrov who 
returned to earth last december after 160 days on the soviet space 
station mir his second flight 
schweickart who was lunar module pilot on the apollo 9 mission 
which tested equipment in earth orbit as a rehearsal for the moon 
landings said a universal space rescue capability was discussed 
two weeks ago at the association of space explorers fourth annual 
meeting in sofia bulgaria 
he said the group urged reagan nasa and the congress last year 
to include a rescue proposal as a topic of last springs 
gorbachevreagan summit the cosmonauts made a similar petition to 
their government 
but schweickart said the rescue was not discussed he said 
however that the nasa authorization bill this year requires the 
space agency to investigate cooperation with the soviet union of 
such steps as establishing common docking capabilities and 
frequency allocations that would lead to joint rescue capability 
the most important aspect is commitment to the principle 
said alexandrov

almost threequarters of the mishaps recorded 
at the nations civilian nuclear reactors last year involved 
personnel error reflecting inadequate training an advocacy group 
associated with ralph nader says 
the group the critical mass energy project of public citizen 
said that of the 2940 mishaps reported in 1987 to the nuclear 
regulatory commission at the 107 licensed civilian nuclear 
reactors 2197 involved personnel error and 591 were errors by 
commissionlicensed control room operators 
the nrc has failed to satisfy its legal obligation to create 
binding worker training regulations as mandated by congress in 
1982 public citizen charged 
the group said the commissions adoption of a policy statement 
endorsing the accreditation program of the institute of nuclear 
power operations an industry group did not meet the law 
but nrc spokeswoman sue gagner said we think the policy 
statement has worked well the staff thinks the training programs 
of the utilities are working well and are improving 
in addition to the personnel errors public citizen also found 
that reports to the nrc of drug and alcohol use among nuclear power 
plant employees tripled last year almost equalling the sum of all 
reports in the previous 12 years 
through 1987 those incidents totaled 302 according to nrc 
reports inspected by the project while 150 were reported for 1987 
alone 
the group cited that finding as evidence for its contention that 
training and qualification programs for nuclear plant personnel 
were inadequate 
it found that operator errors and errors by other employees are 
growing as a percentage of plant mishaps which the nrc calls 
licensee event reports 
operator errors were 8 percent of 2460 reports in 1984 or 22 
per plant and climbed steadily to 20 percent of 2940 reports in 
1987 or 56 per plant the group found 
total errors by all plant personnel were 66 percent of all event 
reports in 1984 or 19 per plant and 747 percent in 1987 21 per 
plant 
both the three mile island and the chernobyl nuclear disasters 
resulted from operator mistakes 
scott peters of the us council for energy awareness a group 
representing nuclear utilities and others said once again 
public citizen has nitpicked its way through the nrc files to 
undermine public confidence in the nuclear regulatory commission 
contrary to the thrust of public citizens arguments the 
commission doesnt hesitate to shut down plants levy heavy fines 
and flunk operators that dont meet nrc standards he said

the teamsters union reacting to rankandfile 
repudiation of four of five of its biggest contracts this year is 
abolishing a decadesold practice requiring twothirds no votes 
to turn down tentative accords negotiated by its top leaders 
the change in the teamsters constitution requiring a simple 
majority any yes vote greater than 50 percent to approve 
contracts covering some 16 million members was approved wednesday 
by the unions 18member executive board meeting in greenelefe 
fla union sources said 
teamster dissidents and sources within the unions hierarchy 
said the decision was in response to a suit challenging a decision 
by top teamster officials in may to ignore a 635 percent 
membership rejection of a contract covering some 200000 interstate 
truck divers and warehouse workers 
the issue had been a major bone of contention in several 
contracts and in boston teamster leader william mccarthys victory 
over secretarytreasurer weldon mathis to succeed jackie presser as 
the unions president after pressers death in july 
duke zeller a teamster spokesman reached at greenelefe would 
not confirm or deny any changes in the unions constitution zeller 
said mccarthy planned to meet with representatives from 750 locals 
in chicago later this month to talk about new directions in the 
union 
however sources at greenelefe and at the unions headquarters 
here confirmed that the teamsters board had voted to do away with 
the twothirds membership vote requirement for turning down 
tentatively negotiated contracts 
other accords negotiated by teamster leaders but turned down by 
rankandfile majorities this year included tentative agreements 
signed with united parcel service rejected by 53 percent of the 
covered voting members and stroh brewery co rejected by 54 
percent 
a proposed contract covering some 20000 teamsters who drive 
auto transport trucks was renegotiated after it was rejected by 72 
percent on a first ratification vote in july results of a second 
ratification vote are due friday 
the only major contract approved by a majority of affected 
teamster members this year was with anheuserbusch cos covering 
some 9000 brewery workers 
ken paff an organizer for a 10000member dissident faction 
teamsters for a democratic union called the union boards action 
a major victory paff said teamster leaders agreed to the change as 
part of an attempt to work out a settlement to a suit his group 
filed last may in us district court here 
we have been fighting for this steadily for 12 years paff 
said they called us nuts and screwballs but we finally have 
majority rule in this union 
paff said the change had nothing to do with another suit by 
the justice department seeking to wrest control of the teamsters 
from its top officers on grounds they are controlled by organized 
crime 
that suit filed in us district court in manhattan last june 
would empower a courtappointed trustee to run the union mccarthy 
and other teamster leaders have denied that the union is controlled 
by mafia family heads as the justice departments suit alleges 
the feds have shown no interest in this its not a 
racketeering issue paff said of the former twothirds rule 
adopted in the 1950s when the late teamster president jimmy hoffa 
moved to seize control on contract decisions from union locals 
theres no law there has to be any membership vote on 
approving contracts paff said 
but the issue came to a boil in may when 635 percent of voting 
truck drivers and warehouse workers under the nationwide master 
freight agreement returned ballots rejecting a new threeyear 
contract 
mathis then acting as the unions president while presser was 
hospitalized with brain and lung cancer declared the contract 
ratified saying the twothirds requirement for rejecting it had 
not been met 
mccarthy and several other teamster leaders had campaigned 
against signing the accord and lobbied to reopen negotiations 
paff and officials within the unions hierarchy speaking on 
condition of anonymity said wednesday the new language requiring 
majority approval of new contacts instead of just 33 percent 
approval covers both nationwide and local accords negotiated 
separately by the teamsters 750 locals 
however they said it also includes a provision reverting to the 
twothirds rule if less than 50 percent of the affected members 
return ballots in any ratification vote 
meanwhile maurice schurr a teamster vice president and the 
unions top official in philadelphia the past decade retired 
wednesday from the 18member executive board amid a mccarthy move 
to oust him on charges of corruption 
schurr 75 agreed to retire effective nov 1 as the board was 
preparing to vote on internal union charges brought against him 
last month by mccarthy zeller said 
in july schurr had sided with mathis and against mccarthy head 
of the teamsters operations in new england for 20 years in the 
struggle for the unions leadership in the wake of pressers death 
schurr was convicted in june 1984 on charges of taking illegal 
payoffs from wholesale food employers with teamster contracts in 
the philadelphia area and served a brief prison sentence in 1986 
his conviction was repeatedly cited as an example of teamster 
corruption in the justice departments civil suit in june against 
the union

suspicious vans stacked with cages 800 paws found 
on a rubbish dump and thousands of missing felines point to 
catnapping on a massive scale in england and wales a pet charity 
says 
the national petwatch group in a report wednesday warned owners 
to keep cats indoors at night saying increasing numbers of hunters 
are seeking cat pelts for toys fur coats and even food 
in many parts of the country cat theft has become an 
organized crime on a massive scale said joan warne national 
coordinator of the charity which monitors the loss and theft of 
family pets 
in cat stealing a special report the group said it would 
be comforting to take refuge in the old adage cats will wander 
but we must face the real facts of the problem 
the group did not cite statistics on exactly how many cats have 
been stolen police do not keep records on stolen cats and are not 
required to record such cases as they must with dogs it said 
but by monitoring advertisements for missing cats for five years 
and other sources the group said it has uncovered alarming 
evidence which it believes is only the tip of the iceberg 
saying london and urban areas are among the worsthit the 
report quoted excerpts from the peckham mercury newspaper in 
southeast london as saying more than 100 cats were feared stolen in 
the area 
many of the pets have vanished from roads where residents 
report repeated sightings of a white van stacked with cages the 
paper said 
a south london newspaper was quoted as describing a woman 
chasing a man with a bag and when he dropped it out jumped three 
cats including her own 
national petwatch reported that not only have 800 paws been 
sighted on a rubbish dump in manchester but skinned cat bodies have 
been found although it did not say where 
earlier this year the group undertook a computer analysis of 
2027 advertisements for missing cats over a twomonth period and 
said the results pointed clearly to organized catnapping 
it said 162 cats disappeared in the two months in rural 
hampshire more than four times the national average 
in some areas more than 40 percent of the missing cats were 
tabby with dark stripes or tortoiseshell with distinctive 
markings both fur colors popular for coats 
cat fur is cheap to obtain and has become more sought after in 
the fur trade following restrictions on seal and other endangered 
animals fur the report said 
lots of 10000 domestic cat pelts regularly come under the 
hammer at german fur auctions the group said adding that 
scandinavia australia and britain are known in trade circles as 
good suppliers 
an unidentified spokeswoman for the fur trade association 
interviewed on independent television denied that cat pelts used 
in the fur trade were stolen 
there is really no reason to go out and steal pets because 
frankly you wouldnt make any money anyway she said adding that 
pelts cost only about 175 each and are obtained legally from 
veterinarians and there is no demand either 
but the report argued that foreign dealers require so many 
that they are willing to buy them in tens of thousands on a no 
questions asked basis 
the report added that cat pelts are sold in germany pharmacies 
as a cure for arthritis that some cats are stolen as training bait 
for fighting hares and dogs and that others are apparently killed 
for food

to enjoy it 
as long as i can remember i have always wanted to know when i 
was going to die so i could put things in order the milwaukee 
woman said wednesday i want to watch the peoples expressions i 
want to see the way they react 
munson who has pancreatic cancer and has been told she does not

and gown and said the funeral would be an appropriate way to end 
her lifes story 
ill get it all embedded in my mind and when i get home ill 
just write up that final chapter she said 
the rev r l lathan pastor of the new hope baptist church 
has agreed to conduct the service 
this is the first time ive had this kind of request lathan 
said its very very strange and unusual she wanted to be at 
her own funeral and she wanted to be alive 
for munson who says she spent more than 20 years as a drug 
addict until she returned to school in her 40s death is not 
something to fear 
i have a message for all these young drug addicts out there 
and i have a message for the cancer patients she said the 
message is why be afraid weve all got to die 
although munson said her cancer is painful she refuses to let 
it disturb her because im not the type to give in 
munson born in mississippi had only a fourthgrade education 
until she returned to school decades later she said she is strong 
because she has been on her own all her life 
my mother died when i was 3 and i was the youngest of six

a sharecropper 
she saved enough money from picking cotton to buy a bus ticket 
to st louis and arrived with nothing but what was on my back and 
some highheeled shoes that had the heels cut off 
once in st louis munson scraped together enough money to get

prison terms for crimes committed to get the drugs including 
theft prostitution and forgery 
it took me 24 or 25 years to get off that darn stuff she 
said i said to myself either crawl out of the gutter and die 
or get off your butt and do something

wisconsinmilwaukee and although she was not qualified i had so

prime minister yitzhak shamir told dozens 
of israeli arab villagers that his hardline likud bloc offers arabs 
real rights but will fight against those who support the 
palestine liberation organization 
in a campaign speech in this northern village wednesday shamir 
also urged about 250 arab listeners to ask your brothers to stop 
terrorism and start negotiations 
the rightwing leader referred to the 10monthold palestinian 
rebellion against israeli rule in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip during which 301 arabs and six israelis have died 
the uprising in the occupied territories are a key campaign 
issue in the nov 1 general elections 
polls show that likuds principal rival the leftleaning labor 
party may lose half of its israeli arab support because many arabs 
hold labors no 2 man defense minister yitzhak rabin responsible 
for the harsh crackdown on the palestinian uprising 
likud and labor headed by foreign minister shimon peres are 
now running necktoneck and both compete for crucial arab support 
on monday peres took his campaign to the israeli arab town of 
shfaram but encountered a frosty reception as he told the arabs 
they should decide the battle between the two major parties and not 
waste their votes on smaller parties 
shamir however dismissed the importance of the arab vote i 
dont think the arab vote will be the deciding vote he told 
reporters 
but speaking in tamra shamir told arab villagers 
what we offer is real rights the likud will be here for both 
jews and arabs as well 
last year israeli arabs staged several general strikes to 
demand better schools and municipal services and protest 
bureaucracy in solving housing problems 
israeli leaders among them shamir have expressed concern that 
palestinian uprising may spread to the arab sector in israel 
we are searching for peace shamir said were going to 
live together as two peoples ask your brothers to stop terrorism 
and start negotiations but to those arabs who want to support 
the plo we will say go your way as much as we want peace we know 
how to fight those who threaten us 
ismael salaama an arab from the village of turam stood in the 
crowd featuring a likud campaign hat and carrying a party campaign 
pamphlet 
im listening to likud and labor then i will decide he 
said when i go to a labor rally and there are hats i wear those 
hats too 
about 330000 of israels 800000 arabs are eligible to vote 
this year and could control 14 seats in the 120member knesset or 
parliament in the 1984 general elections one in four arabs voted 
labor this year analysts say labor may lose 15 seats in the arab 
sector 
according to recent labor polls cited in the jerusalem post the 
communist party may gain one seat in the arab sector this year 
bringing its total to five 
the communists are fiercely competing for the arab vote against 
the proplo progressive list for peace the group is expected to 
maintain its strength with two seats 
six other parties including likud would share the remaining 
seats in the arab sector an udentified labor official told the 
newspaper

the north carolina yam commission is 
considering changing its name after learning the state produces no 
yams 
north carolina is the nations top producer of sweet potatoes 
but the yam is grown only in tropical climates primarily in 
africa said billy yeargin the commissions executive director 
that bothers us a great deal said yeargin who is worried 
about consumer confusion 
sweet potatoes are smaller than yams which grow up to 100 
pounds when cooked the texture and taste of sweet potatoes and 
yams are similar but yams are offwhite while sweet potatoes are 
orange 
despite the loss of the yam yeargin predicted a growing 
demand for sweet potatoes as consumers become more healthconscious 
and turn to more nutritious foods 
i think the sweet potato has a good future he said

the commander of the suriname army was 
arrested and later released after brazilian police confused him and 
seven heavily armed companions with criminals authorities said 
today 
in paramaribo suriname vice president henck arron denounced 
wednesdays arrest of cmdr desi bouterse over state television 
arron termed the detention of the suriname strongman in this 
industrial city as a sad incident especially in light of 
brazils recent grant of a 3 million credit line to suriname for 
food and raw materials 
arron said bouterse 43 was vacationing in brazil and tried to 
identify himself to officers at a shopping center but instead was 
handcuffed and taken to the police headquarters 
globo brazils largest television network quoted sao paulo 
police as saying officers did not understand what any of the 
heavily armed group said 
brazilians speak portuguese while dutch is spoken in suriname 
suriname a former dutch colony in northeastern south america 
borders brazil guyana and french guiana 
globo said the group was released after phone calls to brazils 
foreign ministry and diplomats at surinames embassy in brasilia 
the capital no charges were filed globo said 
in suriname arron said suriname foreign minister edwin sedoc 
lodged a formal complaint with brazilian charge daffaires henry 
jenne who was summoned to the foreign ministry and asked for an 
explanation 
radio broadcasts quoted luiz antonio fleury head of sao paulos 
state security as apologizing to bouterse over the incident 
bouterse and a band of army sergeants overthrew arrons civilian 
government in 1980 when arron was prime minister 
bouterse named himself army commander and headed a military 
government until national elections were held last february in 
which ramsewak shankar was elected president and arron vice 
president 
although bouterse officially transferred power to the civilian 
government he retains control of the countrys military whose 
blessing is required on all major government decisions 
last may bouterse was vacationing in brazil when his companion 
lt guno mahaden who as a sergeant had participated in the 1980 
coup drowned while swimming at a beach in rio de janeiro

an unfounded rumor about george bush was enough 
to trigger a brief plunge in a stillunstable stock market on the 
anniversary of the crash of 1987 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 2258 points 
wednesday from a postcrash high of 215985 only a hint of the 
508point drop on oct 19 1987 when panic wiped out half a 
trillion dollars of stock wealth 
wednesdays late drop was the biggest excitement on a lowkey 
crash anniversary day that wall street employees marked by trading 
stocks bonds and horror stories and raising an occasional glass of 
champagne 
the rumor was that the washington post would publish a story 
potentially damaging to the republican presidential candidate the 
post denied having or planning any such story 
but traders who had made profits in the markets recent rise 
sold on a hint of problems with the vice president who is leading 
democratic candidate michael dukakis in most polls

when vera beaudin learned that her husbandtobe 
was a kurd her response was whats that 
today from a brooklyn brownstone vera beaudin saeedpour runs 
one the few programs in the world devoted to the history and 
culture of the kurds one of the largest ethnic minorities without 
its own country 
about 20 million kurds live in a mountainous oilrich region 
that includes iraq turkey iran syria and soviet armenia the 
kurds a largely islamic group who speak an indoeuropean language 
similar to persian have been fighting for an independent kurdistan 
on and off for much of this century 
kurds have long claimed they are discriminated against and often 
persecuted particularly in turkey and iraq in september the us 
senate concluded that iraq had killed hundreds possibly thousands 
of kurds in poison gas attacks against kurdish rebels 
saeedpour 58 says she became fascinated with her husbands 
culture because as a jew the kurdish plight reminded her of the 
holocaust and the years before israel was established when jews 
had no homeland 
when i was a kid i thought well how did all those people die 
and nobody did anything well the same thing is happening to the 
kurds 
so when her husband died in 1981 saeedpour left her position at 
a new york real estate company to establish the kurdish program 
which she runs singlehandedly from the first floor of her home 
it has grown into a tiny institute the floors covered with 
what else kurdish woven rugs and the walls bearing huge 
photographs of kurds accompanied by quotes from kurdish poetry 
each year hundreds of scholars from around the world use her 
library 1000 volumes about the kurds written in tongues ranging 
from swedish to persian 
a guest book lists recent visitors from germany england texas 
and alaska a kurdish guerilla leader jamal talabani journalists 
and plenty of new yorkers some kurdish others merely curious 
im dealing with the whole world from this brownstone said 
saeedpour im like an old lady holding fast to a balloon thats 
going up into the sky 
indeed the 5foottall dynamo has her fingers in a dozen pies 
she has organized a troupe to perform kurdish folk dances she 
publishes a semiannual journal called the kurdish times and dreams 
of opening a shop of kurdish crafts 
saeedpour even prints her own mailing labels 1500 of them 
on a home computer 
strewn about her office are clippings of her letters to the 
editor about the kurdish plight published in the new york times 
the wall street journal and other papers 
the phone never stops ringing it could be a scholar wanting to 
use the library a kurd seeking help with an immigration problem 
or one of her children she has five 
i overdo everything she said 
against one wall stand four mannequins dressed in colorful 
layers of traditional kurdish clothes pantaloons a brocade 
jacket cummerbund and a large fringed scarf piled atop the head 
there are also 18th and 19thcentury maps that identify a large 
country called kurdistan just east of algezir now syria 
sometimes a kurd will send me something in a plain brown 
wrapper from someplace really remote a book from soviet armenia 
or something with an inscription in kurdish she said its 
really very moving 
saeedpour does not accept funding from any government agency or 
even from kurdish political parties the programs 35000 annual 
budget is supported by individual contributions 
but she said governments that are unhappy about her work imagine 
otherwise saeedpour said an iraqi magazine called her a zionist 
in the pay of the cia while the turkish media claims she is 
funded by greece and armenians 
i wish it were true she said maybe theyd fix my 
ceiling

rodeo drive isnt what it used to 
be lamented an art gallery proprietor who stood helplessly as a 
judge declared his 200000 rollsroyce a public nuisance for 
hogging a parking spot on the glitzy street 
i just wanted to put glitter and glamor back on the street 
david spellerberg wednesday after superior court judge edward 
kakita issued a preliminary injuction barring him from parking the 
1954 rolls on rodeo drive for more than an hour at a time in front 
of his business 
spellerberg had infuriated city officials by flaunting parking 
regulations in effect using the vintage auto as a promotion for 
his business 
according to the order spellerberg must move the car at least 
500 feet after it is parked an hour in the spot the order also 
prohibits him from blocking the sidewalk or using the sidewalk for 
any commercial advertisements or promotions 
five attorneys representing the city persuaded kakita to issue 
the injunction 
rodeo drive just isnt what it used to be spellerberg said 
after the 15 minute hearing this is the first time a rollsroyce 
has been declared a public nuisance only in beverly hills would 
this happen 
spellerbergs chauffeur has parked the dark blue car in the 
onehour spot in front of his national heritage gallery of fine art 
for the past seven monthshis driver would pump the meter with 15 
in quarters each day 
were paying 20000 a month in rent and i cant even park my 
own car in front of my own gallery spellerberg said 
spellerberg said he bought the rolls after noticing tourists 
walking down rodeo drive known for its posh shops and celebrity 
clientele were frequently heard asking is that all there is 
since parking the rolls in front of the gallery he said an 
estimated 20000 tourists have posed for snapshots in front of the 
luxury car he blames the heavyhanded treatment by the city on 
jealous business owners nearby 
spellerberg said he isnt giving up his fight but he wont 
disclose his next move 
the city hasnt had any sense of humor in this spellerberg 
said they had five attorneys in there this morning i want to 
know what the taxpayers have to say about that

burmas military ruler has warned the 
countrys newly formed political parties against attempts to 
discredit or sow dissension within the army 
since taking power in a sept 18 coup saw maung has crushed 
prodemocracy street demonstrations but allowed formation of 
opposition political parties to contest a general election he has 
promised to hold soon no date has been set for the balloting 
taking advantage of permission for party organizations some 
parties are indulging in efforts to create misunderstanding between 
the army and the public and also create dissension within the 
army saw maung said wednesday in a broadcast over staterun 
radio rangoon 
the army is not participating in the elections but it is 
concerned only with the holding of a free and fair general 
election he said 
political parties are warned not to incite preach write 
or spread rumors aimed at creating dissension among the military 
violations of these warnings will be dealt with effectively he 
said 
the parties have not publicly made the statements suggested by 
saw maung but some opposition figures have said they do not trust 
the administration to conduct fair elections partly because they 
say the national unity party enjoys the backing of the government 
and the army 
the party earlier called the burma socialist program party had 
ruled the country with an iron fist for 26 years as the sole legal 
party before its recent disbandment 
the radio said two more parties registered wednesday bringing 
the total number of parties to 24 
the all burma national youth league registered along with the 
mon national democratic front the fourth ethnic minoritybased 
party in the remote countryside guerrillas of a number of ethnic 
minorities have been fighting the government for four decades 
radio rangoon said us ambassador burton levin called on the 
elections commission wednesday and met with its chairman ba htay 
to discuss the promised general election no details were given in 
the broadcast 
also radio rangoon said saw maungs administration enacted a 
law wednesday changing the countrys name from the socialist 
republic of the union of burma to union of burma 
union of burma was used beginning with the constitution of 1947 
a year before burmese independence it was changed after gen ne 
win mounted the 1962 coup and began a quarter century of repression 
and rigid socialist economic policies ne win resigned july 23 and 
two other leaders followed before saw maungs coup which many 
diplomats believe was engineered by ne win 
the countrys name had already been changed on some recent 
government press releases apparently as part of an effort to 
convince the public that the ruinous policies of the past were 
being shelved 
the broadcast also said the name president or head of 
state is to be replaced by the chairman of the state law and 
order restoration council a title now held by saw maung saw 
maung already is prime minister defense and foreign minister

a government ban went into effect today on british 
television and radio interviews with the irish republican army and 
10 nationalist and protestant groups involved in northern irelands 
sectarian conflict 
news reports today indicated further restrictions are in the 
offing to try to curb the recent rise in guerrilla activity 
sinn fein the outlawed iras legal political wing compared the 
ban announced wednesday by the government with soviet bloc 
censorship in addition to the ira the ban includes sinn fein and 
four protestant groups 
ira guerrillas seek to end british rule in predominantly 
protestant northern ireland and unite it with the roman catholic 
republic of ireland under socialist rule most protestants oppose 
uniting with the republic 
home secretary douglas hurd the cabinet member responsible for 
law and order and broadcasting among other matters on wednesday 
told the house of commons 
the government has decided that the time has now come to deny 
this easy platform to those who use it to propagate terrorism 
junior home office minister of state timothy renton explained 
wednesday night that the whole aim of this ban is to remove 
that extra weapon the ability to go on television immediately 
afterwards to speak in justification of an explosion or a bomb 
appearances by sinn fein president gerry adams and other irish 
nationalist leaders on british television in recent years have 
enraged many viewers 
adams is a member of the british house of commons but in 
accordance with longstanding ira practice he has never taken his 
seat since first being elected for west belfast in 1983 
the republic of ireland has banned tv and radio interviews with 
the ira sinn fein and other groups since the mid1970s 
sinn fein seeks to convince mainland britain that british 
security forces in northern ireland cannot curb the sectarian and 
political violence there and that british forces should be 
withdrawn 
the chairman of the british broadcasting corp marmaduke 
hussey and its directorgeneral michael checkland said in a 
joint statement wednesday night that the ban sets a damaging 
precedent 
roy hattersley deputy leader of the socialist opposition labor 
party said the ban was trivial worthless and almost certainly 
counterproductive 
the ban affects only british tv and radio networks it does not 
affect interviews by foreign tv and radio networks broadcasting to 
audiences outside britain or interviews by newspapers and other 
print media either british or foreign 
the seven irish nationalist groups covered by the ban are the 
provisional and official wings of the ira sinn fein the irish 
national liberation army an outlawed splinter group from the ira 
cumann na mban the iras womens movement na fianna eireann the 
iras youth section and the republican socialist group saor eire 
the four protestant groups covered by the ban are the legal 
paramilitary ulster defense association the outlawed ulster 
freedom fighters who are reportedly the udas military arm the 
outlawed red hand commandos and the outlawed ulster volunteer 
force 
hurd said the ban would not apply to election campaigns and the 
broadcasting of parliament 
david nicholas editor and chief executive of commercial 
televisions independent television news said he feared the ban 
might lead to further reporting restrictions 
the london newspaper the guardian quoted unnamed government 
sources as saying the ban is the start of a series of initiatives 
the british domestic news agency press association said measures 
being considered include removal of a suspects legal right of 
silence so that refusal to cooperate with police can be brought to 
the attention of the courts exclusion from elections of candidates 
who refuse to renounce violence and changes to allow guerrillas to 
be convicted of ira membership on the evidence of a single police 
officer

sen edward m kennedy told newspaper editors the 
news media have been unfair to vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle and said coverage of the campaign has turned it into an 
exercise in style over substance 
it the coverage has not been a fair characterization of 
him the massachusetts democrat said of the republican senator 
from indiana during a speech at the conclusion of the associated 
press managing editors convention 
most of his colleagues would say he does a lot better in give 
and take in the senate ive worked with him and he does a better 
job on the senate floor 
kennedy said wednesday he was impressed with quayle when they 
cosponsored the jobs training partnership act he also called 
quayle a forceful vigorous defender of the conservative issues 
he espouses 
though kennedy began on a light note telling the editors its 
not often i get to address a group whose standing in the polls is 
lower than congress he quickly became serious 
he decried the 1988 presidential campaign saying that the press 
and politics have become dangerously intertwined 
substance has been overwhelmed by image he said both 
sides are guilty of reducing important events to spin control 
kennedy said republican presidential nominee george bushs trip 
to boston harbor to demonstrate his interest in the environment and 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis ride in an army 
tank were typical of the flashy but trivial methods the candidates 
have used to show their stand on the issues 
campaigning has become a meat market said kennedy what 
coverage there is comes in the form of labels negative campaigning 
is drowning out positive campaigning 
kennedy urged editors to try and stem the widening gap 
between issues and candidates by focusing more on real events and 
avoiding horserace style journalism 
also at the convention a panel of three journalists urged 
editors to make more of a commitment to hiring minority reporters 
and editors who they said comprise only 7 percent of working 
american journalists 
norma sosa of the corpus christi texas callertimes called 
the outlook for minority journalists bleak and encouraged 
editors to attend minority journalist job fairs recruit at 
colleges and spend more time in newsroom minority development 
william hawkins editor of the durham nc morning herald and 
the durham sun urged editors to improve their treatment of 
minority journalists once they are hired since many tend to leave 
journalism after a few years 
also wednesday editors witnessed a debate between the principal 
involved in a historic us supreme court decision this year 
backing school administrators in censoring student publications 
robert reynolds principal of hazelwood east high school in st 
louis said he censored articles in the school paper as a way to 
prevent inaccuracies guard privacy and maintain control of 
students 
reynolds said the support he has received from educators and 
parents around the country since the case began five years ago 
seems to send a clear message that many people think we have lost 
control of their schools 
i do not believe i have the right to trample on student 
rights said reynolds but what we have done is to require 
educators to exercise their judgment our interest should be 
bringing a clarification of the purpose of student expression 
reynolds debated david hawpe editor of the courierjournal of 
louisville ky 
hawpe who has been with the courierjournal for 18 years and 
was introduced as the editor of his elementary high school and 
college newspapers said any censorship of student newspapers 
threatens the first amendment 
its a serious assault on the conventional wisdom once 
embraced by the courts hawpe said it gave school officials 
breathtaking powers over school journalists

a principal whose censorship of the high school 
newspaper was upheld in a landmark us supreme court ruling told 
newspaper editors he vetoed sensitive articles to prevent 
inaccuracies guard privacy and maintain control of students 
robert reynolds principal of hazelwood east high school in st 
louis made his remarks wednesday during a debate with david hawpe 
editor of the louisville ky courierjournal at the associated 
press managing editors convention 
reynolds said the support he has received from educators and 
parents around the country since the case began five years ago 
seems to send a clear message that many people think we have lost 
control of their schools 
i do not believe i have the right to trample on student 
rights said reynolds but what we have done is to require 
educators to exercise their judgment our interest should be 
bringing a clarification of the purpose of student expression 
the supreme court ruled in january that reynolds did not violate 
students free speech rights by ordering two pages containing 
articles on teen pregnancy and divorce deleted from an issue of a 
studentproduced newspaper five years ago 
hawpe who has been with the courierjournal 18 years and was 
introduced as the editor of his elementary high school and college 
newspapers said any censorship of student newspapers threatens the 
first amendment 
its a serious assault on the conventional wisdom once 
embraced by the courts hawpe said it gave school officials 
breathtaking powers over school journalists 
hawpe compared the ruling to state censorship 
we ought to be teaching children about the diversity of 
ideas he said but we arent teaching them we should teach 
them that the constitution is a living document not a piece of 
parchment 
reynolds said he decided to delete the material because of 
inaccuracies in the articles and his belief that they violated the 
privacy of those mentioned in the stories 
when its friday the 13th and ferris buellers the editor of 
your school newspaper your luck runs out said reynolds it 
becomes more than just a case of students rights alone 
excellence in school journalism will survive

north korea has proposed creating a new 
nonaligned korean nation in which the communist north and its 
enemy the capitalist south would peacefully coexist 
north koreas deputy foreign minister kang sok ju told the 
43rd general assembly that the new nation would realize national 
reunification leaving the two social systems in the north and the 
south as they are 
there is no hidden attempt to insinuate unification through 
communization and no intention to impose our ideas and system on 
the other side kang said wednesday 
south koreas un mission said in a statement we think the 
north korean delegations speech this morning appears to be a 
compilation of their past proposals 
gen vernon walters the permanent us ambassador to the united 
nations said i dont think there were any new elements except 
the tone the tone was considerably more conciliatory 
the korean peninsula was divided at the end of world war ii 
when the soviets ended japanese occuption in the north and the 
allies landed in the south 
the new korea which kang called the democratic confederal 
republic of koryo would have a national assembly with an equal 
number of representives from the north and south 
kang said the proposal was first suggested by north koreas 
president kim ilsung in 1980 and reiterated this september 
koryo was one of three nations on the korean peninsula 600 years 
ago preceding the lee dynasty that unified the three countries and 
lasted 500 years before japan annexed korea 
kang said the new koryo would abolish former military alliances 
and treaties have a unified military command and dissolve the 
demarcation line dividing north from south at the 38th parallel 
the new nation also would be the sole representative of the 
entire peninsula in diplomatic relations with other nations and 
hold the sole korean seat in the united nations he added 
both koreas currently hold nonvoting observer status in the 
general assembly and speak to the assembly by special invitation 
koryo would be a neutral nonaligned nation and the peninsula 
would become a nuclearfree zone and ban the presence of foreign 
troops kang said 
on tuesday south korean president roh taewoo called for a 
summit meeting with kim to adopt a nonaggression pact but also 
told the general assembly that before reunification could occur 
mutual trust between the nations must be established 
roh is to meet president reagan today in washington the south 
korean leader is expected to ask washington to improve its 
relations with north korea

abc expects to lose 20 million on the 32hour 
miniseries war and remembrance due in part to author herman 
wouks restrictions on advertising says cap citiesabc chairman 
john s murphy 
the restrictions on products that can advertised and the number 
of commercial minutes per hour were written into wouks contract 
for the 1983 miniseries based on his novel winds of war before 
cap cities bought abc three years ago 
war and remembrance the sequel cost 110 million to 
produce 
abc is limited to six minutes of national advertising per hour 
and is prohibited from promoting its own shows 
abc television network president john sias who joined murphy on 
wednesday at a session with television critics said wouk wont 
allow advertising of food or personal care products and of retail 
stores 
if i go on im going to break down in tears sais said 
if we dont do well with it its certainly something well 
take a bath with financially because well have makegoods but 
weve had those before and well survive said murphy referring 
to free advertising time the network has to give advertisers if the 
show doesnt live up to ratings guarantees 
he would not say what rating the network is promising 
advertisers but said the 20 million loss estimate was based on 
the presumption of selling out commercial time and meeting the 
guarantee 
sias said murphy had tried to change wouks mind but had only 
received very eloquent turndowns 
hes a very very special man murphy said we would be 
delighted to make some sort of financial arrangement if that would 
help but its strictly a matter of principle hes a very unusual 
man

parents said they were outraged by a 
27hour high school field trip during which youths were 
stripsearched hogtied and forced to eat fishhead soup to 
simulate life under a thirdworld despot 
this is not anything i would have signed a consent for 
connie northrop said at a school board meeting monday 
her son was among 34 wheaton north high school juniors and 
seniors who participated in the mock lockup 
she said she unaware that when she gave her son written 
permission to participate he would be hogtied and left in a room 
naked and alone for 2 hours for refusing to eat fishhead soup 
the optional field trip to wheaton college during the columbus 
day weekend was intended to give students a taste of 
criminaljustice systems including that of an imagined third world 
country 
this is an outrage the word outrage doesnt even begin to 
touch how i feel said another parent kay mckeen whose child 
did not participate 
the board of education has asked school administrators to 
reevaluate the program arranged by high school american 
government teacher david oliphant and report back by nov 14 
i believe conceptually its a very good one program but we 
certainly can improve on our communication on some of the 
specifics of what students were to be subjected to said school 
board president james carr 
among those specifics of the program were being stripsearched 
handcuffed eating fishhead soup and hearing chants of youre 
the scum of the earth and youre dirty 
oliphant declined to comment other than to say it had become a 
media circus 
students who participated were almost unanimous in their praise 
im shaking im so angry at these parents said senior 
kelly kyler 18 its not that i ever wanted to go to prison but 
now i have a view of what these incarcerated people went through 
i learned about myself 
i think its very unfair mr oliphant has got to go through 
this 
some parents agreed 
i would like to say the teacher in question has been my 
seniors most inspiring teacher so far said chris sietz 
the intent of the program was to have the young people learn 
and gain an appreciation for our system of democracy and our system 
of laws carr said also to give them somewhat of an 
understanding of what it would be like to be in prison other than 
perhaps in du page county example a third world situation 
the simulation was held on the fifth floor of the billy graham 
center in connection with the christian schools institute for 
prison ministries 
students from the college have participated in simulated lockups 
through the sociology department since 1983 other high school 
students have gone through it and it has been the topic of feature 
stories in the chicago tribune and the chronicle of higher 
education

the use of radiation decades ago to treat ringworm 
of the scalp is causing an increase in rare tumors of the head and 
neck according to a study published today 
now many years later we are finding out that there were 
hazards linked with this treatment said dr john d boice jr a 
coauthor of the national cancer institute study 
radiation was once commonly used to treat many minor 
afflictions including acne and enlarged tonsils it has been 
largely out of favor for such purposes since the 1950s 
the latest study published in the new england journal of 
medicine was conducted in israel on 10834 children who received 
radiation for ringworm between 1948 and 1960 
the researchers found that 60 have developed tumors of nerve 
tissue compared with eight among a comparison group they had 
seven times the usual risk of all tumors and eight times the 
typical risk of nerve tumors of the head and neck 
however 48 of the 60 had relatively benign tumors of nerve 
wrappings the rest had malignant cancers 
boice said the radiation doses received by the youngsters were 
100 to 1000 times greater than ordinary diagnostic xrays

days close of 12685 yen opening at 12746 yen the currency 
moved slightly lower while ranging mainly between 12705 yen and 
12753 yen 
the us currency started trading higher in the wake of the 
stronger dollar on wall street overnight following the rebound of 
oil prices and news the united states did not want the dollar to 
decline further dealers said 
although speculative investors bought dollars in early trading 
the currency failed to recover much due to the waitandsee mood 
that dominated the market they said 
the market lacked fresh incentives to inspire trading today 
said a dealer with a major commercial bank in tokyo speaking on 
condition of anonymtiy 
on the stock exchange the 225share nikkei stock average gained 
9688 points or 035 percent to close at 2739055 the index 
gained 3336 points shortly after the market opened and continued 
rising the nikkei closed wednesday at 2729367 points 
trading today was mainly affected by the bank of japans 
approval of lower interest rates for short term transactions said 
manji ueda of nomura securities japans largest brokerage firm 
since all the economic factors including lower interest rates 
the money supply in the market and company achievements have been 
good it is only natural for the share prices to rise ueda said 
but as long as uncertainty persists over ailing emperor 
hirohitos health which has already dampened market activity the 
index is unlikely to recover quickly 
in active trading today with volume on the first section 
estimated at 1 billion shares steels and oil issues were among the 
most traded issues

a newly devised mathematical formula will let 
researchers predict if a region is likely to be rocked by a strong 
earthquake within three years soviet and us scientists reported 
today 
the formula is based on changes in seismic activity before 
powerful quakes in california and nevada the scientists used the 
formula in hindsight to successfully predict 16 of 20 powerful 
quakes in the soviet union central asia romania belgium and the 
us northeast 
the technique hasnt been used to predict future quakes and 
wont allow scientists to predict that a quake will occur in a 
precise time and place 
but it will allow them to make intermediateterm predictions 
that a strong earthquake is likely within three years somewhere in 
a broad region said leon knopoff a coauthor of the study 
published in the british journal nature 
this is a step toward improving the prediction of large 
earthquakes in time and space knopoff a geophysics professor at 
the university of california los angeles said wednesday 
scientists now are pretty much limited to making longrange 
forecasts for example the us geological survey predicted in 
july that within 30 years a major or great quake measuring 7 to 8 
or more on the richter scale is 60 percent likely on the san 
andreas fault in southern california and 50 percent likely on the 
the hayward or san andreas faults in the san francisco bay area 
knopoff conducted the study with vladimir keilisborok and im 
rotwain of the soviet academy of sciences institute of the 
physics of the earth and california institute of technology 
geophysicistgeologist clarence allen the former chairman of the 
national earthquake prediction evaluation council 
if the new method is proven valid it will help government 
officials and private citizens because even a vague description 
of the area that could be at risk and a refinement in the time 
scale is valuable said mike guerin spokesman for californias 
office of emergency services 
knowing a big quake is likely within three years in a certain 
region sets a deadline in which they need to accomplish certain 
preparations and plans he added 
but such a vague prediction would make it very difficult to do 
anything more than is already being done in california in terms of 
preparedness countered randall updike executive secretary of 
the quake prediction council and deputy chief of the geological 
surveys office of earthquakes volcanoes and engineering in 
reston va 
the council reviewed the method during a meeting in june 
members decided that while it was a step forward and should be 
studied further it would be premature to use it immediately to 
predict threeyear periods in which large quakes were likely said 
james davis a council member and chairman of the california 
earthquake prediction evaluation council 
the sovietamerican team devised a mathematical formula to 
identify times of increased probability roughly threeyear 
periods in which certain patterns of seismic activity are likely to 
culminate in a strong earthquake 
they developed the formula by studying seismic patterns that 
preceded 14 earthquakes of 64 magnitude or more in california and 
nevada between 1938 and 1984 
the scientists then tested the formula by applying it to 20 
quakes in five other regions of the world since 1963 the formula 
found that 16 of those quakes were preceded by times of increased 
probability for large temblors 
the patterns incorporated into the formula included above or 
belownormal numbers of smaller jolts the rate at which such 
quakes increased or decreased the size of those smaller quakes 
the number of aftershocks following such quakes and whether such 
quakes in one area were followed immediately by quakes in a distant 
area

happy birthday to you a song that seems to 
belong to everyone can be bought by whoever purchases the company 
that owns its copyright 
the sengstack family of princeton nj which for half a 
century has owned birchtree ltd the company that holds the 
copyright to the song has decided to sell the company the new 
york times reported today 
the concern could sell for 12 million or more 
happy birthday brings in about 1 million a year the 
newspaper said the songs 75year copyright expires in 2010 when 
it enters the public domain 
patty smith hill and her sister mildred j hill two 
kindergarten teachers from louisville ky who also taught sunday 
school wrote the song it was included in song stories for the 
sunday school a book they wrote in 1893 
in its original version the happy birthday melody had the 
lyrics good morning to you good morning to you good morning 
dear children good morning to all 
only later did the sisters add the birthday words 
happy birthday is one of the three most popular songs in 
the english language along with auld lang syne and for hes a 
jolly good fellow according to the guinness book of world 
records 
happy birthday is also sung in many other languages 
including spanish dutch swedish and malaysian 
the sengstack family acquired the song when john f sengstack a 
new york accountant bought the clayton f summy co a chicago 
sheetmusic retailer that published the hill sisters work the 
copyright was registered by summy in 1935 
besides owning the copyright to about 50000 titles birchtree 
owns the suzuki method a musical instrumental instruction method 
for children and the francis clark library for piano students 
some peculiar situations have arisen as a result of an effort to 
enforce the copyright of a song as popular as happy birthday 
by law any public performance for profit or mechanical 
reproduction should require a fee 
summy sued postal telegraph in the 1940s when the song was used 
in singing telegrams the lawsuit was dropped when company lawyers 
were stymied by the argument that even though the song was used for 
profit it was not sung in public 
the company also objected when fredericks of hollywood 
advertised underwear that played happy birthday 
casio digital watches that can be programmed to play the 
birthday song every hour on the owners birthday bring birchtree a 
penny a watch

israeli leaders vowed today to punish the 
iranianbacked hezbollah for a suicide car bomb that blew up at a 
border crossing in lebanon killing seven israeli soldiers and 
wounding 10 others 
the attack on the army convoy wednesday afternoon was the worst 
against an israeli target in lebanon since israel withdrew most of 
its occupation troops from the country three years ago 
i am sure that the state of israel and its army will not 
remain still until we reach the source of the evil the source of 
the attack foreign minister shimon peres told israel radio 
what must be clear to hezbollah is that it will receive its just 
punishment 
israels just and secure hand will reach the killers each and 
every one of them prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
israels inner cabinet the countrys top decisionmaking body 
met today to discuss the attack which occurred wednesday when a 
suicide assassin drove a bombladen truck between two israeli 
convoys 
in beirut the military wing of hezbollah or the party of god 
claimed responsibility for the attack and said it had mobilized its 
forces for an israeli reprisal 
hezbollah has been demanding action to force israel to withdraw 
its troops from south lebanon 
but islamic resistance a loose coalition of proiranian 
lebanese groups also claimed responsibility for the attack 
israeli radio stations reported shiite moslems in south lebanon 
fleeing to the north in fear of an israeli attack the reports did 
not elaborate 
despite the tensions the good fence crossing point at 
metullah was reopened this morning and lebanese workers were 
permitted to head to jobs in northern israels galilee 
however soldiers refused to let reporters through the gate to 
lebanon to examine the site of wednesdays blast 
the army said the bomb exploded 300 yards north of the good 
fence border crossing at 125 pm as two groups of israeli 
military vehicles passed each other one headed home and the other 
into lebanon 
it was a very powerful charge said maj gen yossi peled 
head of israels northern command 
there was something large black and black smoke came out 
and many things flew in the air our van was burning about to 
explode an unidentified injured soldier said on army radio 
an israeli officer said a white toyota truck driven by an arab 
exploded between the two convoys 
the commanders got out to talk the toyota came in between the 
two groups of vehicles and exploded the officer said on 
condition of anonymity 
seven soldiers died and eight soldiers and two lebanese women 
were wounded the army said 
the blast left a 15footwide crater witnesses said they saw 
pools of blood trees were scorched 
the body of the assassin was not found and his vehicle was 
unrecognizable 
israel television quoted army experts as saying the truck 
contained up to 330 pounds of explosives blasts were heard four 
miles away and broke windows in this small border town 
wounded soldiers were taken to israeli hospitals and the army 
said one was in critical condition 
the army command identified five of the dead as capt ron 
verner 22 sgt shalom benami 23 sgt moris dahan 31 cpl 
saguy blau 19 and pvt yakov benshaanan 44 
the israelibacked south lebanon army a predominantly christian 
militia interrogated hundreds of shiite moslems in southern 
lebanon wednesday israel radio said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said the incident nevertheless 
proved the value of israels selfdeclared security zone a buffer 
six to 10 miles deep in south lebanon 
the last major car bomb attack occurred near the border crossing 
on march 10 1985 shortly before most israeli troops were 
withdrawn after three years of occupation the attack claimed by 
the prosyrian lebanese syrian socialist nationalist party killed 
12 israeli soldiers and wounded 14 
israel created the good fence in 1976 to provide medical and 
other aid to refugees from lebanons civil war it is used today 
mostly by lebanese workers who travel to israel daily

a judge begged for help over a 
courthouse intercom moments before her estranged husband an 
offduty police officer fatally shot her in her chambers 
authorities said 
district judge carol s irons 40 was shot in the throat at 
least once wednesday and stumbled into a hallway where her 
husband clarence ratliff 53 followed her and fired at least two 
more shots police said she was pronounced dead in a jury room 
minutes later 
judge irons came out of her chambers bent over with her hands 
reaching for her throat asking please help me police 
chief william hegarty said at a news conference 
ratliff a 21year police department veteran briefly exchanged 
gunfire in a corridor with officers who answered irons pleas and 
then barricaded himself in her chambers 
he surrendered within minutes and was arrested at the 
courthouse the site of the couples marriage four years ago 
ratliff was held in the city jail today pending the filing of 
formal charges 
the police chief said ratliff had no history of mental problems 
and there was no reason to believe irons feared him ratliff who 
was on night patrol duty was in civilian clothes when he entered 
the chambers at midday 
moments later the judge apparently triggered an alarm in her 
chambers and a police dispatcher called there on an intercom said 
police lt vic gillis the dispatcher asked if anything was 
wrong gillis said she said something to the effect that she 
was not ok that her exhusband was in there and holding a gun on 
her 
officers responded quickly because the police department is next 
to the hall of justice within seconds ratliff began firing 
authorities said hegarty said it was unknown if ratliff used his 
service revolver 
the courthouse has no metal detector but hegarty said he 
doubted such security would have prevented the shooting 
the couple were in divorce proceedings it was the second 
marriage for both the pair had no children together although 
ratliff has children from a previous marriage 
when she told me she was filing for divorce she mentioned she 
thought the worst of it was over and thought it would be much 
easier from then on said chief district judge donald johnston 
who spoke with irons minutes before she was killed 
but there were no indications that there was any violence in 
their marriage or that she was fearful of him said johnston who 
married the couple 
irons a former assistant kent county prosecutor was elected in 
1982 as the first female judge in the county the wayne state 
university graduate was running unopposed for reelection this fall 
the kent county hall of justice which houses the district and 
circuit courts as well as the police department for michigans 
secondlargest city closed for the day after the shooting 
psychologists were being called in for court employees shaken by

the foreign ministry said the vietnamese community in australia 
asked sen margaret reid to take up the issue after reading of the 
sentences in a vietnamese newspaper earlier this month the 
ministry said ms reid then brought the matter to evans attention 
evans said ambassador graham alliband was told to take the 
matter up with the appropriate vietnamese authorities making it 
clear as we have with a number of other instances around the 
world the australian governments abhorrence of and complete 
opposition to capital punishment

authorities say they have arrested 
a former us resident who faces a death penalty in the soviet 
union for allegedly killing latvian women and children during world 
war ii 
boleslav maikovskis 83 was being investigated in connection 
with charges of murder and attempted murder said klaus schacht 
a prosecutor with dortmunds war crimes investigation office 
the announcement that maikovskis was arrested wednesday came 
just one day after officials said he had applied for political 
asylum in west germany after fleeing the united states last year 
maikovskis a former head of a latvian police force created by 
the nazis is accused by the soviets of burning down villages in 
addition to fatally shooting women and children in 1965 the 
soviets sentenced maikovskis to death in absentia for his alleged 
war crimes 
schacht said maikovskis was being held in a prison hospital but 
did not specify where 
he needs constant doctors care schacht told the associated 
press today he said he would release further details at a news 
conference later today 
maikovskis had been living in mineola ny since 1951 and but 
had been fighting deportation proceedings in recent years on 
friday the us justice department acknowledged that he fled the 
country and that it had lost track of him 
maikovskis was picked up at his residence in muenster early 
wednesday after officials decided he might attempt to flee west 
germany schacht said 
investigators were basing their initial probe on evidence 
presented at another war crimes trial in west germany in 1976 
during which maikovskis was mentioned several times 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said tuesday 
in moscow that the soviets are ready to give all the necessary 
information to west germany 
schacht said that his office would welcome any assistance from 
moscow he declined to speculate on whether maikovskis would be 
deported to the soviet union 
schacht said prosecutors are checking 20 volumes of court 
records relating to the war crimes case in which maikovskis had 
been mentioned 
he said maikovskis entered the country on a passport issued by 
the latvian government in exile which is recognized by west 
germany 
on tuesday the nurembergbased federal office for political 
asylum requests said maikovskis applied for asylum about a year 
ago a decision on the request is expected by late november 
maikovskis probably has been living in west germany since 
submitting the request in november 1987 said federal asylum office 
spokesman wolfgang weickhardt decisions on asylum requests 
normally take a year 
the united states began deportation proceedings against 
maikovskis in 1976 his final appeal was denied by the us supreme 
court in 1986

six mountain lions guarding a suspected 
drug traffickers home were among the property seized during a 
series of raids that led to 33 arrests on marijuana smuggling 
charges authorities said 
one state official had to fend off an attack from one of the 
150pound cats during the raids which culminated a twoyear 
federal probe of alleged gulf coast marijuana smuggling operations 
the 33 suspects arrested including many commerical fishermen 
were among 89 people indicted wednesday by a federal grand jury on 
a charge of conspiracy to import at least 300000 pounds of 
marijuana into florida most were still at large today 
authorities in southwest florida also seized more than 35 
million in boats and homes in connection with the case 
the mountain lion attack came as three us customs service 
agents in disguise accompanied three state wildlife officers to 
warren and linda stewarts home which was surrounded by an 
electified 8foot fence 
the officers arrived on the pretense of inspecting the six 
western cougars kept by the couple who had permits for them 
but when a wildlife officer went into a bedroom a cat pounced 
all he saw were eyes and teeth said lt jim huffstodt of 
the state game and fresh water fish commission 
a bulletproof vest protected him from the cougars claws 
huffstodt said the cats were taken to a panther expert for 
safekeeping 
the stewarts were among those accused of taking part in 10 
failed seagoing ventures aimed at bringing 300000 pounds of 
marijuana which had an estimated street value of 147 million 
said us attorney robert genzman 
several of those arrested were accused in multiple indictments 
charges include taking part in a continuing criminal enterprise 
smuggling conspiracy to smuggle marijuana possession with intent 
to distribute and conspiracy to possess 
if convicted the 89 people indicted face a mandatory minimum of 
10 years in prison said assistant us attorney doug frazier

serbs angered by the outcome of a 
threeday central committee meeting today resumed a boycott of 
school and university classes in the ethnically troubled province 
of kosovo 
the boycott first started in late september with a march by 
several hundred slav students in kosovos capital pristina but was 
called off in advance of a marathon threeday meeting of the 
central committee in belgrade that ended wednesday 
serbs said the meeting did little to resolve the countrys 
current economic and ethnic crisis 
at the meeting four politburo members formally resigned and 
another one a leader identified with a serbian campaign for 
greater control over kosovo offered to step down after losing an 
unprecedented vote of confidence 
the evident dissatisfaction among serbs and montenegrins with 
the outcome of the meeting prompted them to continue the class 
boycott in kosovo thursday the state news agency tanjug said 
slavs in kosovo also scheduled a mass rally today to express 
their unhappiness about the outcome of the meeting in belgrade 
serbs and montenegrins are slavs they have been rallying by the 
hundreds of thousands to push for more control over kosovo an 
ancient slav heartland bordering albania that is now dominated by 
ethnic albanians 
at todays rally to be held in a suburb of kosovos capital 
pristina kosovos 200000 serbs say they will decide whether they 
will leave the region permanently in the face of what they allege 
is constant harassment from the ethnic albanian majority they 
would go to serbia 
kosovo has been at the center of a drive by serbian communist 
party leader slobodan milosevic to extend serbian control over the 
province 
that campaign was dealt an implicit blow wednesday when a close 
ally of milosevic in the politburo failed to muster enough votes 
from the 165member central committee to win a secret vote of 
confidence 
national party chief stipe suvar at a news conference said it 
was the first time a member of the presidium or politburo had 
failed to win such a vote 
ten of the 23member presidium were up for the vote which 
exempted four members who had resigned earlier and nine who hold 
their seats as party chiefs of yugoslavias six republics two 
provinces and the armed forces 
as serbian party leader milosevic was therefore exempt 
but his close ally dusan ckrebic got only 68 of the 83 votes he 
would have needed to win the secret ballot the other nine members 
won given the central committees support 
ckrebic immediately offered to resign but a visibly angry 
milosevic intervened twice to postpone acceptance until the next 
session of the presidium due by the end of this month 
this was seen as a clear victory for opponents of milosevic who 
fear his popular support in serbia is jeopardizing the fragile 
ethnic balance in this balkan nation 
the session offered no real solutions to the countrys mounting 
ethnic and labor unrest and its deepest economic crisis since 
world war ii inflation is 217 percent over the last 12 months 
the four politburo members whose earlier resignations were 
officially accepted by the central committee included two former 
party heads bosko krunic and milanko renovica a senior communist 
from liberal northern slovenia franc setinc and an ethnic 
albanian leader from kosovo kolj siroka 
they resigned for different reasons but all had come under 
increasing fire in the state media and at mass public rallies 
staged by serbs to press their demands over kosovo 
in an apparent attempt to defuse tension and keep protests off 
the streets belgrade authorities on wednesday postponed 
indefinitely a mass rally scheduled for saturday in the capital 
up to 1 million serbs had been expected at the gathering 
intended to give support to milosevic and to the slav minority in 
kosovo

the environmental committee of the chamber of 
deputies has voted overwhelmingly to impose a 13cent tax on 
plastic shopping bags to discourage their use 
the decision to tax plastic shopping bags must be put to a vote 
by the full chamber and the senate but passage was expected 
because all the major parties supported the wednesdays measure 
most supermarkets already charge consumers for each plastic bag 
usually 7 cents some shoppers bring their own bags to supermarkets 
so they dont have to pay extra to take home their purchases 
under the proposal supermarkets would begin charging customers 
around 21 cents per plastic bag other stores would charge 13 cents 
a bag 
the proposed law comes at a time when italy is struggling with 
garbage disposal problems 
the vote was 225 unlikely political allies the 
environmentalist greens and the neofascist italian social movement 
voting for it the italian news agency agi reported the no 
votes were cast by italys largest party the christian democrats 
which is pressing for a tax on all plastic 
assoplast the producers association for the plastics industry 
said in a statement that the measure doesnt resolve in the least 
the environmental problems connected with plastic bags which only 
pollute in the sense that they can be an eyesore and make up only 
78 percent of urban garbage

vice president salvador laurel said 
today the government should have served notice it would close us 
military bases before beginning talks with washington on their 
future 
laurel also said the new bases agreement shows that president 
corazon aquino plans to renew their lease when it expires in 1991 
the accord signed monday in washington by us secretary of 
state george schultz and foreign secretary raul manglapus allows 
the united states to maintain six military bases here in exchange 
for 962 million in military and economic aid during the leases 
last two years 
had we considered only the larger national interest instead of 
the purely mercenary consideration we should have instead first 
issued a notice of termination laurel told foreign and local 
businessmen 
it is obvious that the aquino leadeship has already if 
secretly committed itself to renegotiate extension of the bases 
beyond 1991 laurel added 
laurel broke with the administration in september and formed his 
own political party after mrs aquino refused his call for her to 
resign 
the senate created a special committee wednesday to determine 
whether the new bases agreement violates the philippine 
constitution 
the committee is also to determine whether the accord actually 
an amendment to a 1947 agreement is subject to approval by the 
senate as some senators claim mrs aquino said it is not 
the agreement has been attacked by the press and various groups 
but mrs aquino dismissed the criticism on wednesday and the 
largest political party in the philippine congress pledged to 
support it 
the united states had been paying 180 million a year for use of 
clark air base subic bay naval base and four smaller installations 
despite the increase the agreement has met with criticism 
because of the government raised expectations that it would hold 
out for 12 billion a year 
mrs aquino argued that the agreement was for substantially more 
than the agreement negotiated by ousted president ferdinand marcos 
a western diplomat speaking on condition he not be further 
identified said the original philippine demand was for nearly 24 
billion a year

the defense opened in the mcmartin preschool 
molestation trial with a attorney calling himself as the first 
witness to attack a jailhouse informants credibility 
danny davis attorney for principal defendant raymond buckey 
took the stand wednesday seeking to prove that his client never 
confessed to the informant that he had sexually abused children 
buckey 30 and his 61yearold mother peggy mcmartin buckey 
are charged with 65 molestation and conspiracy counts in the case 
of the school where children said they were molested and subjected 
to bizarre satanic rites the manhattan beach school was closed 
five years ago 
the prosecution alleges buckey and his mother molested children 
but the defense has said it will show that if children were 
sexually abused it happened elsewhere and people other than the 
defendants did it 
during his unusual testimony davis insisted he had no memory of 
the events he was testifying about he referred instead to a memo 
he dictated 
the tactic was apparently used so that davis could avoid 
violating his attorneyclient privilege with buckey by abstaining 
from references to conversations between the two men that 
prosecutors might want to explore in questioning 
i dont independently recall the conversation without 
referring to the document said davis referring to a memo 
written after interviewing both buckey and the informant george 
freeman at the county jail on march 28 1984 
davis recalled that he went to the jail when he heard that 
buckey had been moved into a cell with another prisoner he said he 
was concerned for buckeys physical safety 
i was also concerned that mr freeman might be an individual 
who would concoct a story about my client davis said 
freeman a convicted felon and jailhouse informant who testified 
early in the 17month trial claimed that buckey confessed to him 
about molesting a child the informant also contended that davis 
tried to intimidate him 
in his jailhouse visit davis said freeman did tell me some 
things that he said my client had told him 
did freeman indicate that mr buckey made any statements about 
having relations with children asked attorney edward rucker who 
was brought in to conduct the witness stand examination 
no he did not said davis 
did mr freeman indicate that ray buckey denied wrongdoing 
yes he did said davis 
davis further said freeman spoke of having been a hells angel 
and said he had lied as a snitch before 
he said buckey admitted discussing the case with freeman and 
telling the informant that it was a setup 
but specifics of the conversations were not related because of 
attorneyclient privilege the prosecution did not get a chance to 
crossexamine 
later davis adamantly denied that he had ever threatened 
freeman 
i didnt do that he said under questioning by mrs buckeys 
lawyer dean gits 
another issue argued wednesday was whether jurors should be 
taken to see the former school prosecutors objected because they 
said the defense has removed shrubbery which blocked people from 
looking inside

the government today suspended 
military operations against antigovernment sinhalese militants for 
one week and said it would soon release 788 political prisoners 
national security minister lalith athulathmudali said both moves 
were aimed at restoring peace on this island nation racked by five 
years of ethnic violence 
the minister said the changes would give a chance to those 
involved in political murders to stop those acts and get on to more 
democratic forms of protest 
this step has been taken by the government purely to save 
innocent lives athulathmudali said 
the peoples liberation front an extremist sinhalese group 
opposed to the governments peace overtures with the minority 
tamils have been accused of killing at least 500 people the past 
year 
most victims have been government supporters and people trying 
to make peace with tamil extremists fighting for a separate nation 
in the northeastern province 
the minister also said the government would expedite the release 
of the 788 political prisoners against whom charges have yet to be 
filed 
the peoples liberation front led by rohana wijeweera a medical 
dropout from moscows patrice lumumba university is opposed to an 
indiabrokered peace accord because it claims the pact gives too 
many concessions to tamils who comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 
16 million people 
there was no immediate reaction on the governments offer 
the accord signed in 1987 calls for greater autonomy for 
provincial councils in the northeastern district where tamils are 
in a majority under terms of the accord the north and eastern 
provinces were merged into a single adminstrative unit 
the pact has however failed to stop bloodshed in sri lanka 
after the most important of the tamil rebels groups the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam reneged after initially agreeing on its 
terms saying it did not meet their aspirations 
india has an estimated 47000 troops in sri lanka to disarm the

after months of public outcry the cabinet has 
lifted restrictions on subscriptions to popular newspapers and 
magazines pravda reported today 
the action by the council of ministers in a meeting wednesday 
signaled a victory for soviets who had deluged the press with 
letters complaining about the restrictions 
the council said huge inadequacies and oversights were 
committed by the communications ministry and state publishing 
committee in limiting 1989 subscriptions to certain newspapers and 
magazines 
last year it was announced that applications for 1989 
subscriptions would be accepted throughout 1988 in previous years 
orders were taken only after aug 1 but when jan 1 rolled around 
soviets were told they could only sign up for newspapers and had 
to wait until august for magazine subscription applications 
on july 20 the communications ministry issued an order limiting 
the number of 1989 subscriptions to their 1988 level further 
restrictions applied to 41 publications including such popular 
sellers as ogonyok soviet sport and literaturnaya gazeta 
communications minister vassily a shamshin told the council of 
ministers on wednesday all the restrictions have been lifted and 
that the period during which requests for 1989 subscriptions would 
be accepted has been extended until nov 15 in addition requests 
for 1990 subscriptions will be taken beginning jan 2 instead of 
august as originally scheduled 
in imposing the limits the communications ministry said there 
was not enough paper to print all the newspapers and magazines 
needed to keep up with demand but in september the government 
found new paper supplies for next year the communications 
ministry however did not then lift the subscription restrictions 
the council said 
thousands of soviets have been turned away from post offices 
where they hoped to apply for 1989 subscriptions and some have 
claimed the paper shortage explanation was just an excuse by 
conservatives to stifle president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of 
openness and his economic and social reforms

antiapartheid organizations 
today called for a nationwide protest on the final day of voting in 
segregated municipal elections 
officials of churches trade unions and human rights groups said 
in a statement that the protest next wednesday was intended to 
demonstrate opposition to these apartheid elections in the 
clearest possible way 
stateofemergency regulations prohibit calls for politically 
motivated strikes and work stoppages but previous national 
protests during the 28monthold emergency have taken the form of 
widespread general strikes 
the government has outlawed calls for an election boycott this 
prohibition has been defied openly by antiapartheid clergymen 
including anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
wednesday is officially designated as election day but the 
government seeking to maximize the turnout has allowed voters to 
cast votes in advance during a 12day period ending saturday 
the elections mark the first time south africans of all races 
are voting at the same time and the government depicts the 
balloting as an important extension of democracy antiapartheid 
groups disagree saying black municipal councils are 
governmentcontrolled and rejecting participation in local 
elections until blacks get voting rights on the national level 
the municipal elections are undemocratic fradulent and 
unjust said titus mafolo an official of the banned united 
democratic front at a news conference announcing the protest 
these elections are being forced on our people by the security 
forces the state propaganda system and collaborators 
in soweto the largest black township less than 4 percent of 
the 347000 registered voters had voted as of wednesday officials 
said nico malan the white town clerk who oversees soweto said he 
would be satisified with a final turnout of 20 percent 
in several large townships no elections are taking place 
because of a lack of candidates elsewhere black candidates homes 
have been bombed in what the government says is an intimidation 
campaign waged by the outlawed african national congress 
the main focus of the white election is the contest between the 
governing national party and the extremeright conservative party 
which seeks to intensify segregation laws the conservatives are 
favored to outpoll the nationalists in transvaal the most populous 
of the four provinces 
earlier this year in an effort to placate conservative whites 
the government drafted a bill to tighten enforcement of the group 
areas act which mandates residential segregation on wednesday 
president pw botha postponed action the bill leaving little 
chance it could become law before election day

a woman went undercover for six weeks often 
wired with a microphone to help police nab the suspected drug 
dealers who sold drugs to her daughters authorities said 
the woman a 44yearold bartender who asked that she be 
identified only as pat helped break up a major methamphetamine 
operation in polk county on wednesday said dallas police chief jim 
harper 
she said she wants her daughters ages 24 and 21 and each with a 
child of their own to be prosecuted so they will be forced to get 
drug treatment 
the woman said she decided to speak about her experience because 
ive come to the conclusion that maybe if other people can see 
somebody like me go in and do this they might take the initiative 
to do something 
the woman who often wore a hidden microphone while she worked 
undercover was accompanied by police early wednesday when she went 
to holman state park west of salem to sell chemicals to a suspect 
harper said 45 officers from six agencies later served search 
warrants at three polk county residences they arrested five people 
and seized one ounce of methamphetamine and several gallons of 
chemicals used to manufacture the drug he said 
this lady really came through harper said talk about 
being involved and making that sacrifice she really did 
the woman said she decided to get involved because her daughters 
use methamphetamine and were virtually living out of their cars 
the people were getting all their money for drugs the woman 
said 
she said she accompanied her daughters to a farm where they 
allegedly purchased drugs and gave the address to dallas police 
the department was aware of the farm but didnt have enough 
evidence she said 
she began visiting the farm under the pretense that she was 
looking for her daughters and became acquainted with people there 
before offering to supply chemicals 
i led them to believe i wanted to get into it because of the 
money she said 
she said she was scared most of the time but used the 
conversational skills learned as a bartender to ask the right 
questions and get good information while she was wearing the hidden 
microphone 
i dont know how i pulled it off she said it amazes me

the failure of the worlds secondlargest 
diamond to sell at auction is no indication that the diamond market 
is weakening officials at christies auction house said 
the flawless goldenhued diamond weighing 40748 carats and the 
size of an egg was withdrawn from the auction block by its owners 
wednesday after they rejected a record bid of 12 million 
officials said 
it was the second time in as many days that a precious stone 
expected to sell for a record amount was pulled off the block on 
tuesday sothebys was forced to withdraw the 48carat royal red 
mandalay ruby which carried a presale estimate of 15 million 
when a high bid of 76 million was rejected as insufficient by the 
gems owner 
the giant diamond was offered for sale by new york jewelry 
dealers marvin samuels and louis glick and the zale corp a 
dallasbased jewelry retail chain zale purchased it as an uncut 
890carat stone in august 1984 
the 12 million bid the highest ever at an auction for a gem 
was made by theodore horovitz a genevabased jeweler according to 
christies 
the fact that the diamond didnt find a buyer is no reflection 
on the state of the diamond market which is extremely strong 
francis curiel head of christies jewelry department said in a 
statement 
the gem was described as the largest ever offered at a public 
auction it is second in size only to the 53020carat cullinan i 
which is set in britains imperial sceptre as part of the crown 
jewels 
christies had resisted estimating how much the diamond would 
bring although curiel noted that an 8591carat white diamond was 
auctioned april 19 for 931 million a record for any gem

iran has rejected an iraqi plan for 
repatriating prisoners of war from the persian gulf conflict 
tehran radio said today 
the radio monitored in nicosia quoted irans parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani as saying iraq must accept a united 
nationssponsored plan for ending the eightyear war before 
prisoner exchanges can start 
according to the red cross iran has 50182 prisoners and iraq 
has 19284 prisoners but un officials and diplomats in iran and 
iraq believe iran holds 60000 to 70000 pows and iraq 30000 to 
50000 
iraq not doubt realizes the only way to have the prisoners of 
war released is not to obstruct un resolution 598 and if the 
iraqi regime had accepted peace negotiations more than half the 
prisoners would have been released by now rafsanjani was quoted 
as telling the house 
un resolution 598 calls for an immediate ceasefire 
withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundaries and 
the exchange of prisoners 
iraq earlier this week proposed to the international red cross 
and un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar that 
repatriation of prisoners should begin on humanitarian grounds if 
iran reciprocates 
but iraq also made it clear that its offer was unrelated to 
peace negotiations which stalled five days after a ceasefire was 
declared in the iraniraq war on aug 20 
rafsanjani was quoted as saying iran is willing to release the 
prisoners of war as soon as possible but in the framework of 
resolution 598 
irans ambassador to the united nations mohammed jaafar 
mahallati said in new york on wednesday that technical issues on 
prisoner exchanges must be settled within the framework of the un 
resolution he also said iran wants withdrawal to internationally 
recognized borders to be the next step 
the peace talks have deadlocked over iraqs insistence that the 
disputed shattalarab waterway which forms its southern border 
with iran should be cleared of silt and ships sunk early in the 
war 
iran has rejected the dredging demand saying it is a secondary 
issue that can be settled later in the negotiations

thousands of serbs jeered communist 
party leaders today and turned their backs on politburo members who 
tried to speak during a rally in the ethnically troubled province 
of kosovo 
taunts of thieves and you betrayed the people greeted 
politburo members marko orlandic and kasura jasari kosovos 
communist party head when they arrived to address the serbs in 
kosovo polje a suburb of the kosovo capital of pristina 
the serbs are unhappy at the outcome of a threeday central 
committee meeting which they say did little to solve the 
countrys ethnic and economic crisis 
students in kosovo an autonomous province in the republic of 
serbia boycotted classes to express their dissatisfaction with the 
meeting the boycott was staged by slavs who include both serbs 
and ethnic montenegrins 
the rally began with about 5000 serbs waving flags singing 
national songs and chanting central committee members you have 
shown your true face 
at the central committee meeting in belgrade which ended 
wednesday a serbian member of the poliburo failed to win a vote of 
confidence from committee members it was a blow to the serbs 
fight for greater control over kosovo 
dusan ckrebic was the only one of 10 politburo members facing 
the vote who could not muster a majority from the 165member 
central committee he has offered to resign 
national party chief stipe suvar said it was the first time a 
member of the politburo had failed to win such a vote 
when orlandic and jasari arrived the crowd booed and jeered at 
least one stone was hurled at the podium but it missed 
protesters had hoped the central committee would take steps to 
protect kosovos minority serbs and montenegrins from alleged 
harassment by the majority albanians 
the crowd gathered in a large school field and literally turned 
its back on orlandic and jasari moving away from the podium to the 
far side of the field 
after about 15 minutes local party officials persuaded about 
half the crowd to go back to the podium but the other half left 
many in the crowd carried pictures of serbias communist party 
leader slobodan milosevic and waved serbian and communist party 
flags as they sang national songs and chanted kosovo is 
serbia and a strong serbia is a strong yugoslavia 
milosevics drive to impose more serbian control over kosovo has 
angered fellow communist leaders they fear he is using popular 
emotion to increase the influence of serbs yugoslavias largest 
ethnic group in national affairs 
a milosevic supporter politburo member vasil tuporkovski 
implied these leaders had acted in tandem to deliver a blow to 
milosevic by making ckrebic lose the confidence vote ckerbic a 
close ally of milosevic received only 68 votes in the secret 
ballot he needed 83 
an unprincipled coalition was behind the action tuporkovski 
said his charge was reported today by serbian media 
serbs have threatened to leave kosovo if they are not given more 
control over the province which borders albania ethnic albanians 
make up 90 percent of kosovos 2 million population 
protesters are also unhappy with yugoslavias economic 
situation which is at its worst point since world war ii 
inflation was 217 percent over the past 12 months unemployment is 
15 percent and the foreign debt is 21 billion

that drew a sharp retort from alderman george hagopian an 
outspoken opponent of gay rights legislation 
do you mean to tell me if i see someone who walks like a duck 
talks like a duck and acts like a duck i cant call it that 
hagopian asked 
hopkins reply you call it a person alderman was 
interrupted by the committee chairwoman alderwoman anna langford 
who chided hagopian for being out of order 
the resolution to curb aldermens language was introduced by 
alderwoman kathy osterman who was upset about the way some aldermen 
badgered nominees to the police and school boards on their 
religious backgrounds and the derivation of their last names in 
recent hearings 
the proposed resolution would bar council members from engaging 
in irrelevant and inappropriate questioning of witnesses about 
their religious preferences gender ethnic or cultural backgrounds 
one alderman robert shaw complained the proposal would only 
hamstring the councils work 
the full council will consider the measure next week

investigating an insider trading scandal involving the firm 
justice ministry officials said 
hiroshi matsubara 47 a former top aide to the head of 
recruitcosmos co was charged with offering cash to yonosuke

business leaders who sold the shares after the stock jumped in 
value in a public offering 
authorities said matsubara brought a candy box containing 
38000 to narazaki on three occasions in august and september and 
asked him to relax his investigation

that narazaki allowed into his home 
please save recruit matsubara told narazaki in the footage 
which nippon television network has broadcast repeatedly during 
newscasts we understand politics cost money we intend to 
support you for the rest of your political career 
narazaki refused to accept the money and filed a complaint last 
month with the tokyo district prosecutors office against 
matsubara recruitcosmos president tomoyuki ikeda and hiromasa 
ezoe founder of the parent recruit co ezoe resigned his post 
immediately after the scandal broke in july 
on wednesday prosecutors searched the offices of the two 
companies and matsubaras residence and confiscated more than 1000 
boxes of documents

scheme yasuchika negoro director of the criminal justice 
department at the justice ministry told parliament today 
it was the first time prosecutors entered the scandal 
the gate of the recruit scandal has just opened narazaki 
told reporters referring to the watergate scandal that led to the 
downfall of president nixon in august 1974 
the insider trading scandal surfaced last summer when it was 
disclosed that dozens of politicians business leaders and 
journalists acquired and sold shares in recruitcosmos 
trading stock on privileged information has been a common 
practice in japan but new laws passed since the scandal unfolded 
deal more stringently with insider trading

republican dan quayle promised jobs and 
economic prosperity as he courted reagan democrats today in the 
hotly contested campaign for votes in industrial ohio 
in a speech to 1000 students at marietta college gop nominee 
george bushs vice presidential running mate said the reagan 
administration had created 12 million new jobs and rejected 
suggested they were lowpaying 
it adds up to a job for all who want to work quayle said 
he said that for the first time ever the government stands 
ready to keep its promise of full employment 
campaign aides said quayle would hammer away at the jobs theme 
during a daylong tour through eastern ohio 
spokesman david prosperi said polls which he did not identify 
showed bush with a narrow lead over democratic rival michael 
dukakis in ohio and that quayles job today was to expand that 
lead by stressing jobs jobs and more jobs 
quayle planned appearances in mcconnelsville zanesville and 
newark ohio before heading south friday to tennessee and georgia 
in rural missouri on wednesday quayle assailed dukakis as 
dangerous and naive and having different values than those 
like himself who come from the middle west 
much of quayles regional pitch centers on family issues but he 
broadened his appeal to include defense policy as the campaign 
begins a television campaign on the same theme 
in a speech to college students in liberty mo quayle asked if 
you really want the person thats going to sit across from the 
general secretary soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev to be a 
liberal governor 
dukakis views on defense quayle said are dangerous and 
naive because he would unilaterally give up us advantages 
before even sitting down with the soviets 
the speech was a toughening of the rhetoric that aides went out 
of their way to underscore to reporters 
working to paint a picture of a relaxed and confident campaign 
quayle even made a surprise stop at a barbecue restaurant in 
independence mo to personally pick out three huge platters of 
ribs for reporters traveling with him he put down two crisp 100 
bills to pay the check 
he also said hell be taking the weekend off though the 
election is less than three weeks away 
so we dont make any mistakes those last two weeks quayle 
said dont want to get tired and mess up might possibly cost 
you to lose the election 
im being cautious its also called going home he said 
quayle had opened his campaign day in chicago where he held 
closeddoor meetings with jewish supporters 
he emerged from the meetings saying republicans are shooting for 
a clear majority from that traditionally democratic voting 
group 
evidently we havent done as good a job as we should have in 
communicating where the republican party stands vis a vis israel 
where the republican party stands vis a vis the jewish community 
quayle said 
quayle ended his campaign day with a rally in parkersburg w 
va where he was greeted by protesters chanting coward and 
chickenhawk referring to his national guard service at the 
height of the vietnam war 
is that a dukakis supporter out there asked quayle if i 
had to support dukakis id yell too

two tenacious brothersinlaw used 
400 deicers to enlarge the breathing holes of three stranded 
whales accomplishing in hours what it had taken a day for workers 
in the 500000 rescue effort to do 
greg ferrian and rick skluzacek of lakeland minn flew to 
alaska at their own expense wednesday when rescue coordinators 
politely rejected their offer to bring in the device used to free 
boats in frozen marinas 
early today under the skeptical supervision of the rescuers 
they used six small deicers to clear ice and slush from the two 
breathing holes the california gray whales have been using since 
becoming trapped last week 
the cylindrical devices about 9 inches around and 14 inches 
long churn up warm water from below the surface to melt the ice 
eskimo whalers and other volunteers have labored with chain 
saws pickaxes and steel bars to keep the holes open but in a 
matter of hours the devices had accomplished what took all day to 
do by hand 
ferrian said he first learned of the whales plight monday night 
while watching the televised struggle to keep the breathing holes 
open 
it looked to me like a hard way to go about it and i had an 
easier way he said ferrian called his brotherinlaw skluzacek 
he was thinking the same thing ferrian said 
he immediately began calling rescue coordinators in alaska but 
as with numerous other often impractical wellwishers the offer 
was politely brushed off other suggestions that have been rejected 
included dropping everything from explosives to bowling balls 
through the ice 
lying in bed that night ferrian became more and more convinced 
he had a solution 
my wife kept pushing me on the deal she said if you feel 
that strongly about it go for it 
the two said they spent about 5000 to make the trip to barrow 
once we got to the airports and people found out what the 
equipment was for it was pretty much a free ride for the 
machines ferrian said 
after meeting with rescue officials wednesday afternoon they 
got their chance 
it wasnt costing us anything and they were here so we 
figured why not said ron morris a national marine fisheries 
service biologist in charge of the rescue operation 
working in the predawn dark in subzero temperatures they 
hooked up a portable generator and put the machines to work 
the question of whether the deicers would disturb the already 
stressed whales was quickly answered within minutes the whales 
surfaced just two feet from the devices which hum like a sewing 
machine and spew a jet of water similar to a jacuzzi 
the deicer or water agitator floats in the water suspended 
beneath a styrofoam slab a small doubleblade propeller pulls 
warmer water up from below and emits it with 34 pounds of thrust 
unlike most liquids which become denser as they cool water 
becomes lighter below 38 degrees fahrenheit six degrees above 
freezing skluzacek explained as a result warmer water sinks and 
cooler water rises to the surface and freezes 
weve sold thousands of them not for whales but for 
boats ferrian said 
the devices are used in marinas to keep boats from becoming 
frozen and theyve been used in places like lake superior where 
the weather can be as severe as in the arctic he said 
the device was developed about 15 years ago by skluzaceks 
father bill and the family owned business in lakeland minn a 
st paul suburb has been refining it ever since 
skluzacek said that within 24 hours the breathing holes should 
be about 30 feet by 70 feet three or four times the original size 
that wont free the whales but it should help buy time 
north slope borough veterinarian tom albert said earlier 
expansion of the breathing holes reduced stress on the animals 
which for a time almost had to shoulder their way to the surface to 
breath 
borough biologists craig george and geoff carroll admitted they 
were among the skeptics 
so far its performing far better than i expected george 
said watching the hole grow in the light of a snowmachine 
headlight 
when they first came in the office i thought we had a couple 
of crackpots carroll admitted i really admire those guys 
pluck knowing they had just the right equipment for the job and 
having the guts to come up here and prove it

an indian airlines jet made an emergency 
landing today officials said a day after two airline crashes 
killed 165 people 
investigators were not ruling out sabotage as the cause of the 
crashes a government official said two crashes on the same day 
in two hours is too much of a coincidence said the official who 
is closely associated with the investigation into wednesdays 
disasters 
an indian airlines airbus carrying 209 people made an emergency 
landing shortly after takeoff today from the southern city of 
madras airline officials in new delhi said the plane bound for 
singapore apparently developed technical problems they said but 
did not elaborate 
on wednesday a boeing 737 operated by indian airlines crashed 
while trying to land in heavy fog at ahmadabad airport in central 
india the plane clipped a tree struck a power line and exploded 
on its final approach 
all but five of the 135 people on board died 
less than two hours after the disaster a 30yearold fokker 
friendship propeller plane leased by indian airlines to another 
domestic carrier vayudoot slammed into a hill in eastern india 
during a severe rainstorm 
jc barua a senior official of vayudoot in guwahati confirmed 
today that all 31 passengers and four crew members died all were 
indians 
the united news of india news agency quoted one villager as 
saying the plane caught fire and exploded before crashing 
the causes of the crashes were not immediately known both 
planes lost radio contact shortly before crashing and airline 
officials said they suspected technical malfunctions 
the government owns indian airlines vayadoot and airindia 
which operates only on international routes 
federal aviation minister shiv raj patial has ordered 
investigations into the crashes 
these two things have happened on the same day there i am 
keeping my fingers crossed whether it is a mere coincidence or some 
design he was quoted as saying in the the hindustan times 
indian airlines flight 131 was flying from bombay to ahmadabad 
with 129 passengers and six crew members when it went down 
indian airlines has come under fire for allegedly failing to 
maintain safety procedures and to adequately supervise its pilots 
wednesdays crash was the carriers 16th major accident in its 
26year history 
one airline official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the pilot may have confused floodlights at a construction site for 
the runway 
a recording between the pilot and the ahmadabad control tower 
gave no indication of trouble authorities said 
survivor paag vasavda 28 said the pilot told passengers he was 
having trouble landing in the fog vasavda said he heard two 
explosions 
afterward the plane broke apart he said 
the passenger manifest said victims included two japanese three 
germans and an industrialist from bahrain 
the fokker friendship crashed into a 1400foot hill near 
guwahati airport about 960 miles east of new delhi it was nearing 
the end of a flight from silchar 
the plane reported zero visibility then lost contact with the 
guwahati control tower two minutes before the crash said c das 
civil administrator for guwahati district

millions of elderly americans will receive free 
flu vaccinations this year under a test program that could lead to 
free shots for all the nations medicare recipients according to 
published reports 
federal health officials call the 50 million program an 
unprecedented preventative effort that could prolong thousands of 
lives the atlanta constitution and the new york times reported 
today the elderly are considered most at risk for fatal flu 
complications but medicare does not now cover the shots 
federal officials are expected to announce next week the six to 
10 sites nationwide that will be the first to receive federal 
funding for the shots 
they hope the special program can inoculate 4 million to 8 
million people annually against influenza about 22 million 
americans now regularly receive flu shots 
the program will be administered by the atlantabased centers 
for disease control and the federal health care financing 
administration 
cdc epidemiologist dr nancy arden said the sites may include 
nursing homes hospitals state and county health departments 
medical schools or other programs for elderly americans to 
determine the most costeffective way to reach the most senior 
citizens 
the program authorized last year by congress gives health 
officials up to four years to demonstrate the value of influenza 
shots for the elderly health officials have been concerned that 
only 20 percent of the nations elderly get yearly flu shots 
if the test program proves costeffective by cutting the cost 
of treating people who become sick with influenza flu inoculation 
will be covered for all the nations 32 million medicare recipients 
the congressional budget office estimates that it would cost 
medicare 39 million a year to immunize all recipients against 
influenza 
officials estimate that flu costs the country more than 1 
billion annually for hospitalization and up to 10 times that much 
for other costs including doctors visits and lost work time 
flu and pneumonia its most common complication together are 
the leading cause of death from infectious disease in the united 
states contributing to about 68000 deaths each year between 80 
percent and 90 percent of those deaths occur in people over 65 
in years of epidemics officials say the number of flu deaths 
can exceed 50000 
the american lung association recommended this week that elderly 
people and children and adults who live with them get annual shots 
to reduce the risk of outbreaks in the past the association had 
recommended annual flu shots only for elderly americans and people 
who are chronically ill

some television stations would have to reduce 
advertising and refocus their childrens programming efforts under 
a bill approved by congress and hailed as a victory for americas 
children 
the measure won final passage on a voice vote in the senate on 
wednesday but the reagan administration opposes it and the justice 
department recommends that he veto it on constitutional grounds 
the measure would limit advertising time during childrens shows 
and require tv stations to provide informative programming for 
children as a condition of license renewal 
supporters say the legislation is the most important statement 
by congress on childrens television in a generation 
this legislation will challenge broadcasters to educate 
children creatively rather than to exploit children commercially 
said rep edward j markey dmass a coauthor of the measure 
peggy charren president of action for childrens television 
called passage of the bill a landmark victory for parents and 
children 
what this bill does is create a new climate in broadcasting 
and signals a sea change in the way broadcasters and the fcc 
federal communications commission will view childrens 
programming said charren whose cambridge massbased group has 
lobbied for 20 years to set into law advertising limits for 
childrens shows 
but the administration opposes the bill as inimical to the 
spirit of the first amendment because it injects the government 
into programming and advertising decisions of tv stations the 
justice department recommended a veto on constitutional grounds 
following house passage 32878 in june 
the legislation would break from the course of the reagan 
administrations efforts to deregulate the broadcast industry the 
fcc lifted its childrens tv commercial limits four years ago 
fcc chairman dennis patrick said the legislation was both 
unnecessary and illadvised particularly because the fcc has 
been considering taking action related to the commercialization of 
childrens television 
the fcc abandoned its advertising limits on the theory that 
commercial content during childrens shows would be best regulated 
by the open marketplace 
but childrens tv advocates said the fccs philosophy of 
deregulation was harming children they said that since the imits 
were dropped in 1984 stations have increased advertising during 
childrens shows and the quality of childrens programming has 
deteriorated as toy manufacturers have become heavily involved in 
developing shows based on their products 
markey said reimposing advertising limits will help stem the 
creeping commercialism presently plaguing childrens television 
stations would be allowed no more than 10 minutes per hour of 
advertising in kids shows on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on 
weekdays stations would have until jan 1 1990 to comply with 
the advertising limits the fcc would be authorized to modify the 
time standards after jan 1 1993 
george schweitzer cbs communications vice president said the 
network now has 95 minutes of commercials per hour in its weekend 
childrens shows with an additional minute of time sold by the 
affiliate stations 
critics of tv commercials say some shows have up to 165 minutes 
of commercials in an hour 
the measure also would require stations to serve the 
educational and informational needs of children in overall 
programming and would require the fcc to evaluate those efforts 
every five years when a station applies for renewal of its license 
the national association of broadcasters did not oppose the bill 
because we share the interests of congress in assuring the 
provision of programs that serve the needs of the child audience 
according to spokeswoman susan kraus 
in a small way it does legislate content and that would always 
be a concern of ours but because it does it in such a small way we 
thought it was worth it to live with this bill she said 
martin franks a cbs vice president said clearly its going 
to require us to rethink some of the ways weve done our business 
but its a compromise we were a part of and more than willing to 
accept 
it will result in some cutbacks in advertising he added 
but declined to estimate how much 
the compromise legislation was stripped of proposals that would 
prohibit programs that feature toy manufacturers products 
referred to by critics as programlength commercials 
sen tim wirth dcolo who favored such an approach said the 
measure that was passed begins to address the issue but doesnt go 
far enough 
his chief complaint is that it does not explicitly require 
programming specifically designed for children rather the bill 
simply says childrens interests must be served through 
broadcasters overall programming efforts 
broadcasters certainly could argue that familyoriented shows 
such as the cosby show are of benefit to children and such 
programming efforts would satisfy the requirements of this 
legislation he said

one of the three main engines on space shuttle 
discovery developed a leak when it lifted off from the kennedy 
space center in florida on sept 29 nasa said today 
the leak was on a line between the combustion chamber and the 
nozzle said karl kristofferson a space agency spokesman at cape 
canaveral it started near where the nozzle joins the bell 
housing 
the problem was not noticed at the time but engineers now are 
reexamining flight data for any telltale signs the leak was found 
during a routine check of discoverys engines while the shuttle is 
being prepared for its next flight in february 
kristofferson said engineers do not believe the leak will have 
any impact on the next flight that of atlantis scheduled for 
around thanksgiving 
we dont know whether the problem indicates a generic failure 
or whether discoverys engine can be fixed or must be replaced 
he said the parts were welded together before launch leading 
officials to believe the leak developed during ascent 
the engine had not been dissasembled and kristofferson said 
engineers did not know how serious the problem was or what its 
consequences might have been for the flight 
the shuttle completed its fourday onehour mission the first 
since the challenger accident in 1986 without a hitch landing at 
edwards air force base in california

democrat lloyd bentsen vowed today to 
take them on and answer every negative republican campaign 
advertisement despite his acknowledged risk that the fightback 
strategy might obscure the democrats broader message 
im going to take myself on an assignment he told workers 
at a huge general electric appliance plant here every time they 
issue a falsehood im going to take them on and straighten that 
one out 
bentsen said the presidential campaign should be fought over 
issues like health housing and americas economic future but he 
said the republicans instead were distorting the prison furlough 
issue and lying about democratic nominee michael dukakis position 
on gun controls 
bentsen a world war ii veteran said he took it as a personal 
insult to me that the republicans were trying to portray dukakis 
as weak on defense 
we have seen the republicans running on symbols and twisting 
the facts said bentsen the democratic vice presidential 
candidate 
were going to tell them that you cant devalue the currency 
of our democracy he said 
bentsen spoke after touring the dishwasher plant that is part of 
a giant ge complex employing more than 13000 people he shook 
hands with workers and viewed robot equipment that has helped boost 
plant productivity and profits 
bentsen told reporters wednesday that the gops negative 
campaign ads were an outrage 
he cited the script of a new commercial featuring dukakis riding 
in a battle tank and claiming that the massachusetts governor 
opposed every new defense program which bentsen said was 
completely untrue 
from louisville bentsen headed for texas to take part in an 
hourlong national student satellite teleconference from corpus 
christi state university 
in the teleconference bentsen will answer questions from 
students from 26 colleges in 11 states those scheduled to 
participate at campuses around the country included the rev jesse 
jackson and sen al gore of tennessee at memphis state and former 
kentucky gov martha layne collins at the university of kentucky 
arkansas gov bill clinton was to serve as moderator 
although bentsen says hed rather spend his time discussing home 
ownership trade education and other democratic issues he 
conceded those messages were not yet getting through his attack 
lines meanwhile are proving popular at rallies where the crowds 
seem more pumped up than before 
a louisville crowd roared wednesday night when bentsen described 
his opinion of how the republicans have distorted dukakis record 
down in texas wed say they painted him lower than a snakes 
belly in a wagon rut he said 
bentsen met briefly with reporters on wednesday before leaving 
california where he unveiled his new tactics he acknowledged the 
republican campaign was working and it showed in the polls 
thats why i finally had enough because apparently these kind 
of charges when theyre not answered even though they are as 
ludicrous as they are have some damaging effect he said 
im not going to put up with it any more he said im 
going to take them head on every time they distort the truth 
through election day 
this is my idea bentsen said this is not something i was 
asked to do

officials from southeast asian nations 
failed today to agree on a plan to end the 10yearold cambodian 
conflict but participants pledged to meet in december to try again 
the main stumbling block at the fourday meeting was vietnams 
insistence on linking its promised troop pullout from cambodia to 
preventing the khmer rouge from returning to power and ending arms 
aid to the cambodian guerrillas 
other demands by vietnam included a timetable for the pullout 
and an international body to supervise and control it said the 
chairman of the group of southeast asian representatives john p 
louhanapessy 
louhanapessy director general for political affairs in 
indonesias foreign ministry said the group will meet again dec 
1214 in jakarta and possibly a third time in january 
the representatives are from the association of southeast asian 
nations along with vietnam laos and the warring factions of 
cambodia asean comprises indonesia malaysia the philippines 
brunei singapore and thailand 
the khmer rouge who massacred hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians during their 19751978 rule were absent from this 
weeks talks 
louhanapessy said the guerrilla group sent word it could not 
attend because almost all its staff were at the united nations but 
diplomatic sources said the khmer rouge boycotted the meeting 
because of aseans opposition to their return to power after 
vietnam withdraws all its troops as promised by 1990 
louhanapessy said he hoped the khmer rouge would attend in 
december

a defendant in a murder trial was 
mistakenly handcuffed to a key prosecution witness and the two 
scuffled after being left alone in a sheriffs department van 
officials said 
i find this difficult to understand how such a regrettable 
breach of security could have happened circuit judge lawrence 
glazer said 
glazer on tuesday ordered an immediate investigation into how 
the two men could be placed in the same sheriffs department van 
let alone be handcuffed together 
there was an oversight said ingham county sheriff capt 
richard abbott 
the suspect jonathan sheppard and the witness kelly whitt 
who is a cousin of the murder victim started fighting as soon as 
they were left unguarded both sustained minor injuries 
whitt a prisoner at the western wayne correctional facility in 
pontiac testified monday and tuesday he is one of only two men 
who can place sheppard at the slaying scene even though sheppard 
has admitted he shot john wright during a drug deal that went sour 
on april 29 
authorities usually transport defendants and witnesses who are 
in custody in separate vehicles abbott said court deputies in 
lansing failed to tell transport officers that the two men had to 
be separated 
deputies had to subdue whitt although it was unclear who 
started the fight

george bush and michael dukakis have resorted to what the 
republican calls silly things from exchanging stares with the 
three little pigs to riding an m1 tank to get the ultimate in 
exposure a free minute on the network news 
the job of making that picture and sound bite irresistible to tv 
producers falls to imagemakers for the two presidential candidates 
these imagemakers exert control over what gets seen on 
television by confining reporters and camerasound crews to a 
twilight zone close enough for cameras but too far away for 
microphones to pick up any unscripted speech 
the result often enough pictures of flagdraped campaign 
rallies with the candidates offering snappy oneliners but no clear 
discussion of the issues 
thats life says richard salant former president of cbs 
news almost everything except natural disasters are done to a 
greater or lesser extent to draw the attention of the media 
the influence of television in the political arena goes by the 
numbers 
at this time of year the three network newscasts reach more 
than 25 million american homes every night 
deduct station breaks and commercials and the three network 
newscasts have about 22 minutes to cover the world 
one minute during one network news show costs a commercial 
sponsor 90000 making that oneminute splash on all three news 
shows the campaigns call it free media is a windfall worth 
more than a quarter of a million dollars 
to get their share of that limited time campaigns must 
outguess the producer in terms of whats going to be important 
says robert j murphy abcs vice president for television news 
coverage 
whats new is the next logical step from the point of view of 
the campaign manager once you get your view in how do you keep 
everything else out of it he said thats what the reagan 
administration has done very effectively and thats now what 
campaign managers are being judged on 
the managers especially the bush managers are being judged in 
some quarters as entirely too effective 
more than ever before the whole campaign is in the control of 
imagemakers says salant 
bush who has many of the same advisers who worked with reagan 
has used his status as a sitting vice president to produce some 
striking images in the campaign he was shown witnessing the 
destruction of the first us missiles under the treaty with the 
soviet union and greeting the discovery astronauts after the space 
shuttle landed in california 
dukakis sought to turn that around unleashing a series of 
television commercials on the packaging of george bush 
the democratic presidential candidate also has tried to use 
free media to his own advantage 
just this week dukakis borrowed a trumpet and played a few bars 
of happy days are here again it was a madefortv visual and 
sound bite but one that may have backfired because it was coupled 
with reports showing dukakis dropping in the polls 
during a recent campaign stop in illinois bush acknowledged 
we all do silly things in campaigns 
i wish you could have been with me out there in disneyland 
he said i was standing there and these three little pigs kept 
staring at me so i know what it is to be on the receiving end and 
do dumb things 
but the one that takes the cake was him riding around in that 
tank the governor of massachusetts in that tank bush said 
dukakis ride in an m1 tank across a grassy field in michigan 
on sept 13 was undertaken to respond to bushs charges that he was 
soft on defense 
roger ailes media adviser to richard nixon ronald reagan and 
now to bush has said that the news is much more important than 
advertising in defining a candidate it is ailes job and the job 
of his counterparts in the dukakis campaign to define the news 
what happens when control is threatened 
after the presidential candidates met in two debates with 
formats dictated by the two campaigns bush declined an offer by 
abcs nightline for a freeforall session with dukakis 
frankly our campaign schedule requires the candidate to be on 
the road after the second debate taking his message to the voters 
directly bush spokesman mark goodin explained he did not 
mention the minimum of 5 million households that tune in nightly to 
nightline 
robert a mosbacher sr bushs finance chairman has said that 
30 million to 35 million of the campaigns funds will go for 
television advertising the lions share of the 544 million it is 
allowed to spend overall 
the dukakis campaign has said it plans a comparable tv blitz 
its nobodys fault its whats happening with the times 
frederick koenig professor of social psychology at tulane 
university said of the campaigns heavy reliance on television 
koenig says studies showed voters in the past chose a candidate 
by picking up information from speeches and then discussing it with 
others i can remember growing up that people would sit around 
and argue politics sitting on their porches or in bars he said 
now in a time when the ac nielsen co says the average viewer 
has the tv set on for 6 hours 59 minutes per day and increasing 
numbers of families have more than one set people dont even 
discuss television shows with each other koenig said 
there has been a fragmentation of opinionforming he said 
at the same time the candidates are getting less time on the 
air 
voters used to hear halfhour and even onehour political 
speeches on radio or television said kathleen hall jamieson a 
professor of communications at the university of texas and author 
of packaging the presidency by 1964 she said 60second spots 
became popular and now the 30second spot is the norm 
network news executives believe long stories drive away 
audiences she said and that reinforces the publics expectation 
that it will get short stories 
there has been more substance in this campaign than is clear 
to people who are watching the network news jamieson said 
michael robinson associate professor of government at 
georgetown university says that suits voters too they have 
always been interested in brevity and we have this romantic notion 
that at some point the voters were really actively involved in the 
process they werent robinson says 
cbs correspondent bob schieffer who has traveled with the bush 
campaign said i think we do have to resist a pretty picture 
every so often schieffer said he drew the line on labor day when 
bush set out to help load fish in san diego 
i declined to use the pictures in my story because i thought 
it was silly because i didnt think it had anything to do with his 
qualifications to be president schieffer said 
jamieson said television still can help voters become deeply 
informed 
the cspan cable television channel runs unedited speeches by 
the presidential candidates most evenings for example and public 
televisions macneillehrer newshour tackles issues in depth

there and very neatly cut the whole batch 
donald walsh chairman of the racine county republican party 
said the incident was stooping awfully low and that no local 
gop member was involved 
im disappointed if indeed it did happen walsh said 
every time an act of god or something happens you cant run 
paranoid to the fact that someone is trying to sabotage your

the new york power authority shut down its 
indian point 3 nuclear power plant early today when a small amount 
of radioactive water mixed with the water that turns the turbine 
generator 
there was no public health threat the authority said in a 
statement the radioactive gas released into the atmosphere was 
less than 01 percent of the level permitted by the federal 
government during normal plant operations 
plant officials declared an unusual event the lowest of 
four classifications for occurrences at nuclear power plants at 
1125 pm wednesday the release said 
federal and local officials were notified and the gradual 
shutdown of the plant in westchester county north of new york 
city was completed early today 
a small perforation in a tube in one of the plants four steam 
generators allowed water that is heated by the nuclear reactor 
and which becomes radioactive to mix with water in a separate 
system that is meant to turn to steam from the heat and turn the 
turbine the power authority said 
it was not immediately known how long the plant will have to 
remain shut down said authority spokesman carl patrick 
it will depend on what the inspection shows and what repairs 
are necessary he said 
indian point 3 had reopened sunday after a oneweek shutdown 
caused by an unrelated problem he said before that it had 
operated for 116 days without a problem

us customs agents led to the arrest of a city electrical engineer 
who has been charged with obtaining sophisticated weapons parts for 
shipment overseas 
agents arrested ali foyuzi yousefi 45 on wednesday said 
police lt charles cabaniss he was charged with violating the 
federal arms exportation control act said larry hunter head of 
us customs office in columbia 
hunter said yousefi was an illegal alien when asked what 
country the parts were being shipped to he responded mr 
yousefi is an iranian he did not elaborate 
the parts involved belonged to a hawk missile a source close to 
the investigation told the rock hill herald 
yousefi was questioned for about two hours at his office at the 
citys operations center before officers led him away in handcuffs 
his house also was searched for evidence 
yousefi was to be arraigned before a federal judge in columbia

hens fed a special diet have produced eggs 
with less than half the cholesterol of regular eggs say farmers 
who hope the new eggs will appeal to consumers concerned about 
cholesterol 
but a heart disease specialist said they are not a huge 
breakthrough 
excessive deposits of cholesterol are thought to produce 
arteriosclerosis which might lead to artery and heart disease 
if the doc says you need a lowcholesterol diet this is just 
the thing declared paul may manager of rosemary farm in santa 
maria where the specialdiet hens are laying the eggs 
may said about 25 percent of his farms 300000 chickens are fed 
a diet currently being kept secret while lawyers see if it can be 
patented 
the eggs are also a little lower in sodium which has been 
associated with high blood pressure he said may said the eggs 
have 55 milligrams of sodium compared with 70 milligrams in a 
regular egg 
the eggs which went on sale tuesday in san luis obispo santa 
barbara and ventura counties are 30 percent more expensive to the 
consumer than regular eggs may said 
a state permit confirmed the claims that the eggs have an 
average of 125 milligrams of cholesterol compared with an average 
278 milligrams in a standard grade aa egg according to ardie 
ferrill supervisor of egg inspection for the state department of 
food and agriculture in sacramento 
the lowcholesterol claims for the new eggs are absolutely 
true ferrill said 
after running the eggs through laboratory tests the agency 
issued a permit that allows the farm to boast on labels that its 
eggs are lower in cholesterol he said it is the only such permit 
issued in california 
the eggs were developed in part through consultation with 
university of california scientists and a nutritionist may said 
he added that they contain no drugs or additives 
the american heart association recommends that an adult keep the 
average daily dietary intake of cholesterol below 300 milligrams 
university of california at san francisco biochemist john kane 
an authority on diet and heart disease is not sold on the new eggs 
when it comes to eggs less cholesterol is not the same as low 
cholesterol he said 
these eggs are not a huge breakthrough said kane who 
nevertheless acknowledged the advantage in reducing cholesterol in 
eggs

in the streets of khartoum capital of the 
desert african nation of sudan 7 percent of homeless children test 
positive for exposure to the aids virus 
in northern thailand the first positive aids tests popped up 
just this year 
in the jungles of suriname reachable only by air or boat at 
least five members of a south american tribe are dying of aids 
steamboats trucks family reunions and space rockets have all 
helped aids spread to some of earths most isolated populations 
according to researchers sociologists and health workers at the 
first international symposium on education and communication about 
aids being held here this week 
there are 40 million street children in the world and we 
suddenly realized theyre all at risk for aids because so many turn 
to prostitution said peter dalglish who founded street kids 
international and ran an aids testing program in the sudan 
dalglish citing unicef figures for the number of homeless 
children in the worlds largest cities said the deadly disease 
entered the sudan via truck drivers and nile river steamers from 
central africa where aids incidence is high 
poverty guerrilla war illiteracy countrysides empty of 
televisions or even radios and lack of resources combine to 
frustrate workers trying to reach isolated populations 
were talking about some countries where a national health 
budget of one dollar per person per year is a drain on the 
economy said dr manuel carballo head of the social and 
behavioral unit at the world health organization in geneva 
all the negative factors affect the jungles of southern 
suriname home to 35000 maroons descended from african slaves who 
escaped from coastal plantations 
despite their seeming isolation said dr ruben del prado the 
space age helped ease the path of the aids virus when maroon men 
traveled to french guyana to work on roads and on buildings at the 
european space agencys launch facility at kourou 
where they were infected suriname or french guyana is a 
sensitive political question said del prado who works for 
medical mission a private interreligous organization in suriname 
but french guyana is where they went and there is a great inflow 
and outflow of europeans there a factor associated with the 
spread of the virus 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is transmitted through 
sexual contact infected blood transfusions and the sharing of 
syringes it impairs the bodys ability to fight off disease and 
no cure has been found 
the cases detected among the maroons were not just positive 
tests or exposure to the virus which can incubate for years but 
advanced cases of the disease itself he said 
del prado who spent three years among the maroons said health 
workers havent been able to enter the area for a year because of 
an insurgency movement against the central surinamese government 
he worries that aids once at large in the closed maroon 
society will become rampant because of frequent exposure to 
tropical and venereal diseases complete lack of education or 
social support and the fact that sexual activity routinely starts 
as early as age eight 
in thailand it is bangkoks sex industry that poses a danger 
even in the remote north said werasit sittitrai aids project 
coordinator for the thai red cross society 
in northern thailand there are almost no girls 15 to 20 years 
old said sittitrai theyre all in the south and its quite 
open families visit their girls in the south boyfriends theyll 
all stay in the same hotels 
the first case of evidence of aids in the north cropped up last 
summer but sittitrai who is running an agressive outreach program 
for prostitutes is optimistic that the epidemic will be contained 
we believe we can teach even prostitutes how to have safe sex 
if we keep working he said 
cultural and political factors can make areas newly open to aids 
difficult to work in health professionals say dalglish said he 
talked to arab merchants who freely admitted having sex with boys 
but they dont consider that homosexuality so they wont admit 
one of the risk factors exists 
theres usually a period of denial said anthony meyer who 
is head of health promotion for whos global program on aids 
then you see a national committee made up of scientists then you 
see the health minister the education minister joining the 
committee and you know theyre taking it seriously 
that happens said sittitrai because of the pressure of 
aids the disease keeps spreading and people keep dying he said

officials launched a nationwide campaign to rally 
citizens behind new economic reforms the xinhua news agency 
reported thursday 
officials of the secretariat that conducts the daily affairs of 
the ruling communist party are meeting with provincial officials to 
try to unify the nations thinking and action 
local officials who have gained substantial autonomy over 
economic decisionmaking largely have ignored government efforts 
to reduce the more than 20 percent inflation rate and widespread 
black market activity 
the new campaign indicates the leaderships determination to 
assert central control and enforce austerity measures 
hu qili head of the secretariat told the meeting that the 
purpose of the drive was to make party officials and citizens 
rally around a program to restore economic order xinhua said 
the government last month ordered reductions in capital 
investment and spending a halt to most public construction 
projects tighter loan policies by banks and a crackdown on illegal 
business practices 
implementation of the reforms first proposed more than two 
years ago were delayed in order to allow prices of consumer goods 
to adjust to market forces 
the central government has the double burden of convincing local 
officials to cooperate with the changes and assuring citizens of 
their commitment to development and economic reform 
the official economic daily responded to the new campaign 
thursday in a frontpage editorial that tried to placate worries 
about economic strategies 
the article posed a series of questions challenging the new 
policies and answered each one reassuringly 
if reform doesnt go forward wont it go backward it asked 
the answer the adjustment of the timetable for price reform 
is not a retreat but merely a step backward before the main 
attack 
addressing concerns that tighter central control will stifle 
needed development the newspaper said reform cannot be simply 
equated with giving up all centralized control the reform 
necessitates a new division of central and localized powers

house and senate negotiators reached 
agreements on a compromise antidrug bill today as they raced to 
complete the only measure keeping congress in session this election 
year 
with many members already campaigning for reelection back home 
colleagues writing the drug bill came to tentative agreement on 
deathpenalty language they closed in on an agreement to deny some 
federal benefits to convicted drug offenders including users 
senate leaders have said the chamber might approve the drug bill 
by voice vote if enough members are reluctant to return to 
washington to conduct a roll call house members returned wednesday 
after nearly a week off and are expected to remain at the capitol 
for the drug vote which would be scheduled friday at the earliest 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate 
judiciary committee said negotiators agreed to drop senatepassed 
language designed to strengthen antiobscenity laws house members 
argued successfully that the language gave the federal government 
too much power over what americans view or read 
in return biden said the house appeared willing to accept 
senate language on denial of benefits to drug users the punishment 
would deny grants contracts loans mortgage guarantees and 
permits but not affect social security medicare veterans 
assistance and welfare 
the senate language would give judges discretion over whether to 
deny benefits 
negotiators agreed that the death penalty could apply if a 
murder is committed during a felonylevel drug crime and if the 
killer was engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise was 
trafficking in major amounts of cocaine heroin or other drugs 
intentionally gave an order that resulted in a killing or killed a 
police officer 
one key house law enforcement section was dropped from the bill 
wednesday night 
the house provision would have permitted introduction in federal 
court of evidence seized illegally but in good faith even 
when a search was made without a warrant current law permits the 
good faith exception only when searches are conducted with 
warrants 
the negotiators accepted senate language on child pornography 
including a 20year to life prison term for anyone convicted of 
facilitating use of a child for producing sexually explicit 
materials 
the buying and selling of children to produce child pornography 
would be made a federal crime 
the lawmakers agreed to language that would require the justice 
department to devise a system to allow gun dealers to check whether 
gun purchasers are convicted felons 
the provision originated in the house as a substitute for an 
optional sevenday waiting period for handgun buyers 
the final bill negotiators agreed will include civil fines for 
those found in possession of illegal drugs including marijuana and 
cocaine but the records can be expunged from the record after a 
period of time 
lawmakers agreed that states would initially have to contribute 
25 percent of the cost to receive federal grants for antidrug 
crime programs after the first year of the fouryear program the 
state match would go to 50 percent 
senate language requiring that 10 percent of federal anticrime 
grants go for streetlevel enforcement was dropped and the 
decision would be left to the states

the leader of a religious group whose daughter 
was killed in oregon said today that negative media coverage of his 
organization was responsible for her beating death 
irresponsible media put me in a precarious situation 
eldridge broussard jr said in an appearance on oprah winfreys 
syndicated television talk show 
broussard is head of the los angelesbased watts christian 
center and the nowdefunct ecclesia athletic association 
for the last year and a half i have had to walk around this 
country as a suspected cult leader he said adding reporters had 
labeled him the new jim jones 
broussards 8yearold daughter dayna lorea died friday 
authorities say the death was the result of beatings at a camp run 
by broussard outside portland ore for youngsters from the los 
angeles district of watts 
four men associated with broussards group have been charged 
with manslaughter in the childs death 
but broussard 35 denied today that children were beaten or 
abused at the camp 
he told ms winfrey they were spanked and that the 
militarylike discipline reported at the camp was necessary to 
enable the children to endure city life 
abuse may be to do anything that does not prepare them to be 
on their toes in a rather paranoid triggerhappy los angeles 
situation broussard said we teach our children the moment 
someone of authority says something to you you snap to it 
broussard said standards of discipline in oregon were different 
than those in watts and that if authorities from los angeles were 
to inspect his daughters body they would draw different 
conclusions than those reached by oregon officials 
he said the negative publicity ecclesia received when the group 
arrived in oregon last year cost his group financial backing and 
led to suspension of its activities as a result broussard said 
staff members were performing duties for which they lacked proper 
qualifications 
i feel that if we hadnt been misinterpreted by the media our 
people wouldnt even have been in sandy that night he said 
broussard said ecclesia was dissolved last year and the children 
who were taken into custody by state officials in oregon were part 
of the watts christian center school and training program 
broussard smiling and apparently unemotional for most of the 
hourlong show at one point broke down in tears asking ms winfrey 
to help him uncover the real facts surrounding the case 
i dont believe anyone else will give me a chance broussard 
said 
after his daughters death 53 children attending the watts 
christian center school and training program headed by broussard 
were taken into custody at a rural house near sandy about 30 miles 
east of portland 
two other children involved with the group were taken into 
custody in los angeles 
the clackamas county juvenile department has charged that 
children at the camp were routinely beaten with paddles or 
electrical cord some children were beaten up to 800 times while 
others were forced to watch and keep count the department said in 
a court petition 
donald welch director of clackamas county juvenile court said 
leaders of the group had beaten and whipped children as an integral 
part of its program to heighten athletic performance much like 
harrassment commonly used in militarystyle basic training

president augusto pinochets cabinet 
resigned today the government announced opponents hoped the move 
would clear the way for talks on democratic reforms 
orlando poblete the government secretarygeneral with 
ministerial ranking said he and the 15 other cabinet members 
handed in their resignations to give maneuvering room to pinochet 
loser of an oct 5 referendum 
the resignations allow the 72yearold leader to select his 
people and take the steps he considers proper in this 
postplebiscite stage of government poblete said 
poblete made the announcement to reporters at the government 
palace immediately after a brief meeting of the full cabinet he 
gave no details but it was widely assumed that pinochet would 
accept at least some of the resignations and that key changes would 
be made 
pinochet the rightwing army commander lost by more than 
800000 votes in the yesno ballot ballot on a proposal to extend 
his 15year rule to 1997 he won 43 percent of the vote and 55 
percent voted no 
the morning after the vote his cabinet offered their 
resignations but pinochet rejected them evidently needing time to 
evaluate and pick replacements 
according to the 8yearold constitution his term expires in 
march 1990 when the winner of an open election planned for 
december 1989 will assume power 
a 16party opposition coalition that led the campaign for 
pinochets defeat has called for several reforms in the 
constitution it maintains that the changes are needed for full 
democracy under the new elected government 
in the two weeks since the vote the coalitions leaders have 
said they were waiting for a cabinet change as a sign that pinochet 
was willing to negotiate the changes 
key cabinet members including poblete helped direct pinochets 
political campaign for the referendum and have been blamed for his 
defeat 
pinochet has maintained no changes will be permitted in the 
constitution especially in its timetable for a return to elected 
rule the opposition has called for him to show more flexibility 
and said government intransigence could spark unrest 
pinochet took power in a 1973 coup that deposed the elected 
government of salvador allende a marxist who died in the coup

people who express undue love or assume another 
inappropriate role when writing to celebrities are just as likely 
to try approaching them as those who make threats a new study 
suggests 
some of the worst incidents that have been preceded by a 
letter were preceded not by a threat letter but by a love letter 
or some other peculiar or inappropriate communication said 
researcher park dietz 
results suggest laws in many states that cover harassment should 
be broadened to cover such circumstances as being bothered by 
wouldbe lovers and others he said 
in one example of harassment a canadian farmer has been 
convicted 11 times since 1980 of bothering canadianborn singer 
anne murray robert kieling 52 is convinced she is in love with 
him under court order not to contact her or her family kieling 
was convicted june 29 of violating the order by calling her office 
263 times in the first six months of this year 
dietz a professor of law and psychiatry at the university of 
virginia spoke in a telephone interview before presenting the 
study thursday in san francisco at the annual meeting of the 
american academy of psychiatry and the law 
the study involved more than 1000 inappropriate letters 
written to performers by 214 people it also focused on attempted 
approaches because they raise a risk of violence although most are 
benign dietz said 
sponsored by the national institute of justice part of the 
justice department the study was aimed at looking for clues that 
could help protect both ordinary people and celebrities from 
violence he said 
the work is an important and meaningful first step in an 
area that has not been rigorously studied commented mark j mills 
a forensic psychiatrist in santa monica calif and member of the 
american psychiatric associations council on psychiatry and the 
law 
analysis of letters in the study found that 17 percent of the 
writers considered themselves suitors of the celebrity while an 
equal percentage cast themselves as special fans expressing such 
sentiments as im your greatest fan you owe me a lot if it 
werent for me you wouldnt be so famous dietz said 
ten percent of the writers acted like intimate friends saying 
such things as they understand the celebrity has been too busy to 
send a birthday card another 10 percent sought sex with the 
celebrity 9 percent considered themselves a business associate or 
potential collaborator and another 9 percent considered themselves 
ordinary fans but included an inappropriate message like a threat 
altogether 23 percent of the letters contained some form of 
threat ranging from promises to kill the celebrity at a specific 
time to statements along the line of send me a credit card or i 
will cause southern california to drop in the sea dietz said 
but people who wrote threatening letters were no more likely to 
try approaching the entertainer than other writers that is 
probably because most approaches are not made with the intent of 
doing harm dietz said 
most of them are about efforts to fulfill some delusional 
belief and hope where violence occurs its not necessarily 
because the person intended to do any violence but rather what 
they expected to happen did not happen 
the celebrity does not say yes we can now join our hands in 
marriage and live happily ever after that is such a surprise to 
the person whose life has been devoted to finding this perfect 
union that it is upsetting and they dont want to take no for an 
answer 
overall 15 percent of the letterwriters tried to approach the 
celebrity the most popular place accounting for 42 percent of 
initial known attempts was the celebritys home dietz attributed 
that partly to maps and bus tours that point out celebrity homes in 
hollywood 
fourteen percent of attempted approaches were at an agency 
representing the public figure 11 percent involved such behavior 
as climbing on stage or insisting on going backstage at a public 
appearance and 10 percent were at a business associated with the 
celebrity 
dietzs collaborators included janet warren of the university of 
virginia psychiatrist daryl matthews of kapaa hawaii 
psychologist daniel martell of new york university and tracy 
stewart of yale university

ptl founder jim bakker says his faith will 
pull him through the hard times including the 52 million lawsuit 
filed against him by the ministry he left in disgrace after 
admitting to a sexual encounter 
after two years of what ive been going through nothing is 
humbling my faith is in god i believe god will bring me through 
all of these things bakker said today as he left us bankruptcy 
court 
ptls lawsuit claims bakker his wife tammy and former top 
aide david taggart mismanaged the ministry and used ptl funds for 
their personal gain the ministry entered bankruptcy protection in 
1987 
ptl attorneys presented their side of the argument during the 
first week of the trial before judge rufus reynolds in september 
the trial resumed monday with the defense and ended today 
reynolds did not issue an immediate verdict the attorneys have 
until oct 27 to submit further information or pleas he then will 
present his draft findings within 10 days 
the attorneys will have another 10 days to submit their 
responses after which reynolds will issue a verdict 
in testimony wednesday bakker said he wants his ptl documents 
and a chance to prove he didnt abuse the tv ministrys funds 
im pleading for my documents he said i just want a fair 
shot were doing it piece by piece but were doing it 
bakker said many records are scattered among a federal grand 
jury in charlotte nc ptl offices and bankruptcy court 
for more than a year the grand jury has been investigating 
whether the ministry raised money for one purpose and used it for 
another 
during crossexamination today ptl attorney brad leggett asked 
bakker if expenditures such as 900 for a shirt and trousers for a 
music director and cash tips of as much as 600 were customary at 
ptl 
i have no idea i simply dont know bakker replied 
leggett also crossexamined bakker on how much time he actually 
spent on his duties at ptl and the heritage usa theme park near 
fort mill

from ptl board meetings and other documents showing bakker 
reimbursed the ministry for thousands of dollars in cash advances 
i have always ordered that any cash advance for me personally 
was always paid back 100 percent bakker testified 
hovis presented minutes from a september 1981 meeting showing 
that the board had then granted bakker a salary of 102000 that 
the church was to be responsible for the upkeep of the parsonage 
and for utilities and that the parsonage was to be turned over to 
bakker upon his retirement 
in other testimony independent financial analyst james wilson 
retook the stand wednesday suggesting that bakker was underpaid 
for the number of responsibilities he held at the heritage usa 
christian retreat near fort mill 
the ministry entered bankruptcy protection three months after 
bakker left in march 1987 when he admitted to a sexual encounter 
with former church secretary jessica hahn 
when asked by hovis whether he authorized any payment to ms 
hahn bakker replied i did not he added but i knew we were 
being blackmailed and i take full responsibility 
under crossexamination wednesday by leggett bakker said he 
also did not instruct any member of my staff not to make a 
payment to ms hahn 
an irs report lists a number of objects that bakker had received 
through ptl for his personal benefit beyond reasonable compensation 
but bakker said he bought a houseboat an unfinished 300foot 
water slide and two rolls royces out of his own money he said he 
donated those and other items to ptl 
i had in regular practice given back to the ministry part of 
christianity is giving he said the heritage village church 
has never ever purchased a rolls royce for me or my family

of the trial in september that the bakkers received about 95 
million in bonuses salaries and other compensation from 1983 to 
1987

vice president george bush today warned 
against relaxing us military strength in the face of peace 
gestures from the soviet union and said the nation can ill afford 
to elect rival michael dukakis who he said has literally no 
experience in foreign affairs 
the republican presidential candidate addressing 600 supporters 
in a knights of columbus hall here in central new jersey before 
heading to queens ny to accept the backing of new york city 
police accused the massachusetts governor of opposing the us 
invasion of grenada the strike against libya and its policy in the 
persian gulf to protect the flow of oil there 
i believe that weve got to fight terrorism and if we ever 
again face clear evidence of terrorist aggression terrorist 
involvement in the taking of american lives as we did in the case 
of libya i would not hesitate to strike again bush said we 
have got to punish statesponsored terrorism 
bush and dukakis were appearing on the same stage later tonight 
when they address a catholic charities dinner in new york city 
taking note of the changing colors of the autumn foliage bush 
said the leadership of the soviet union is changing but old 
ambitions die hard systems die hard and the leaves may be 
falling but the trees are fundamentally the same 
as much as we welcome the change in the soviet union now is 
not the time to abandon realism about what makes the soviet union 
move he said 
those who want to abandon the policy of peace through strength 
in the hopes of selfinduced soviet restraint are dead wrong he 
said he criticized dukakis for opposing the mobile mx and 
midgetman missiles but insisting he wants to modernize the 
landbased us strategic force 
he doesnt understand that we cant give away our best cards 
and then sit down and expect to negotiate a fair treaty with the 
soviets bush said 
i dont think we should risk turning over the leadership and 
security of this free world of ours to a manwith literally no 
experience in foreign affairs 
bush was trolling for votes in new york where polls show him 
within striking distance of dukakis 
we think if we can win new york we totally destroy his 
ability to win the election campaign manager lee atwater told 
reporters on the campaign trail wednesday in michigan 
bush and his aides continued to insist there is to be no 
shifting of gears or lessening of campaign efforts because of his 
strength in opinion polls atwater said bush would spend 80 percent 
of his time in dukakis must win states but he declined to 
name them other than new york 
however the campaign aide said the key states of the rest of 
the campaign in addition to michigan and new jersey are illinois 
ohio and california 
internal campaign polling shows bush one or two points behind 
dukakis in new york a state democrats usually count on for its 
rich prize of 36 electoral votes atwater said 
bush told reporters he was encouraged by a new field poll 
showing a 50 percent to 41 percent lead over dukakis in california 
but that the poll reflects a more positive position for him than 
his campaigns internal polls 
a campaign source said internal polling shows bush with a 
sixpoint lead in california the field poll had a margin of error 
of 47 percent 
next week bush and president reagan will appear together at a 
gala campaign event in los angeles 
the california strategy also includes saturation use of 
commercials attacking dukakis because the glut of ads for state 
ballot initiatives dilutes the effect of the ads if they dont run 
long enough atwater said 
in a speech at the university of michigan on wednesday bush 
said he wants a renewed bipartisan approach to us foreign affairs 
although he frequently blasts the democraticcontrolled congress 
as the perpetrator of poor policy bush said he wants 
bipartisanship to be once more the vibrant heart of a foreign 
policy that is decided by a debate which ends at the waters edge 
but he did not hesitate to deride his democratic opponent in the 
same speech 
lacking foreign policy experience he has a rather unrealistic 
view of americas role and the way in which we lead bush said 
bush also said that if elected he would convene a summit of 
nato allies to consider future use of the allied forces with an 
eye toward budgetrestraint and burdensharing 
asked later if he would stop criticizing congress in the 
interest of bipartisanship bush said no im going to keep the 
pressure on and get them to work in a bipartisan spirit with the 
next president its very important

relatives of 10 people killed when an air 
force jet careened into a hotel visited the accident scene today on 
the first anniversary of the crash and accused government officials 
of showing little compassion 
the us air force has failed to treat survivors of the crash 
with human dignity rather the air force has chosen to hide behind 
indianas wrongful death law said robert goldberg whose 
daughter beth was among the victims 
this unjust law declares that the lives of single adults 
without dependents are worth nothing he said 
air force master sgt larry martin who lost his daughter dawn 
shelly said since my daughters death the air force has shown 
little compassion for our family we have not received one letter 
or phone call or personal visit from a chaplain 
the family members say they want a jury to decide whether the 
crash was caused by negligence and if it was they believe a jury 
should be able to award damages 
indianas wrongful death law does not allow damages for adults 
who died because of someone elses negligence but who have no 
dependents 
the air force and the hotels owners have been unable to agree 
on a cost for damages and the ramada inn hotel remains mostly 
untouched since the accident with the smell of smoke still 
lingering there are pieces of metal dangling from the ceiling 
hotel papers stained with water and charred edges that still litter 
what once were rooms 
the accident happened when maj bruce l teagarden en route 
from pittsburgh to nellis air force base in nevada tried to land 
his powerless fighter jet at the nearby indianapolis international 
airport 
teagarden was making his second attempt at the runway when he 
ejected and the a7d corsair plummeted skipping off a bank 
building before ramming into the lobby of the ramada across the 
street 
nine hotel employees were killed at the scene a salesman who 
had stopped to make a telephone call died several days later

republican george bush renewed his criticism of michael dukakis 
as inexperienced in foreign policy today as dukakis sought to 
portray bush as having no feeling for the problems of everyday 
americans 
im never going to forget the people ive met during this 
campaign people who need a helping hand not a cold shoulder 
dukakis told telephone company workers in new haven conn 
george bush doesnt care that working women earn only 64 cents 
for every dollar that men earn he said george bush doesnt 
even know that almost 40 million americans mostly working people 
and their families dont have a dimes worth of health insurance 
george bush wants to help the people who already have it made 
i want to help every american family make it 
a day earlier dukakis accused the republicans of distorting his 
record on crime while frontrunner bush criticized the democrat as 
lacking needed foreign policy experience 
the vice president returned to that topic today at a rally in 
south river nj saying the nation cannot afford to elect such a 
president 
he said dukakis opposed the us strike against libya a 
contention dukakis denies 
i believe that weve got to fight terrorism and if we ever 
again face clear evidence of terrorist aggression terrorist 
involvement in the taking of american lives as we did in the case 
of libya i would not hesitate to strike again bush said we 
have got to punish statesponsored terrorism 
dukakis criticized by some in his party for not responding more 
strongly to gop charges angrily answered his republican accusers 
on wednesday when presented with a brochure attacking him as soft 
on crime 
friends this is garbage dukakis said as he held up the 
mailing for a crowd in southern illinois this is political 
garbage 
the gop brochure which was sent to voters in the state 
suggested that convicted massmurderer john wayne gacy would be 
eligible for weekend passes under massachusetts prison furlough 
program 
later in palmyra mo dukakis told the crowd ive never 
seen such a pack of lies in my life 
bush meanwhile said that dukakis had an unrealistic view of 
americas role in the world and he told students at the 
university of michigan that he and the massachusetts governor were 
light years apart on foreign policy 
today dukakis traveled to connecticut where the latest 
statewide poll showed bush holding a 10point lead 
the two presidential candidates were expected to put aside their 
political rhetoric and replace it with humor as they both took 
center stage tonight at the annual alfred e smith dinner in new 
york city 
the event traditionally calls for comedy not criticism from 
the candidates 
the dukakis campaign shaken earlier in the week by a nbc 
newswall street journal poll showing bush ahead by 17 points 
received better news on wednesday from two new surveys 
an abc newswashington post poll gave bush a sevenpoint lead 
while a harris poll showed the gop nominee leading by nine points 
considerably less than the earlier survey 
the abcpost poll conducted oct 12 through tuesday questioned 
1195 likely voters and had a margin of error of about three 
percentage points either way the harris poll of 1356 likely 
voters was done friday through monday and had a margin of error of 
three points 
in an effort to cut the margin dukakis was planning a series of 
television appearances and his campaign was considering purchasing 
blocks of tv time for either a speech by the candidate a town 
meeting style program or a national callin show 
meanwhile dukakis used most of his campaign time for 
counterattacks 
my positions are being distorted on a number of these issues 
that seems to be what the bush campaign is all about dukakis 
told reporters 
the gacy brochure suggested that the man convicted and sentenced 
to death in 1980 for murdering 33 young men and boys would be 
eligible for a weekend pass in massachusetts the second brochure 
by the illinois republican party said in bold print all the 
murderers and rapists and drug pushers and child molesters in 
massachusetts vote for michael dukakis 
this isnt worthy of a presidential campaign dukakis told 
voters in illinois 
aides to the governor said that gacy would not be eligible for a 
pass under the massachusetts furlough program 
the democratic candidate who toured the rural midwest area by 
bus also charged that bush cares more about corporate 
operators than family farmers 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen today 
renewed his criticism of the republicans negative campaign ads 
saying at a campaign stop in louisville ky im going to take 
myself on an assignment every time they issue a falsehood im 
going to take them on and straighten that one out 
dan quayle the republican vice presidential nominee campaigned 
today in marietta ohio promising jobs and prosperity if the gop 
wins he said that already under the under the reagan 
administration there is a job for all who want to work

by using karate kicks as best i could to keep them at bay ford 
said the dogs were so vicious they momentarily turned on each 
other and that gave me time to get to a tree 
ford who was bitten on the legs arms and hands was treated at 
a hospital and released

important thing is they were not rabid

members of a food and drug administration 
panel responsible for a delay in approving a drug that breaks down 
blood clots say there is no room for emotionalism in the handling 
of new drugs 
dr peter r kowey of the medical college of pennsylvania in 
philadelphia and other members of the panel took the unusual step 
of writing an article about their action for fridays journal of 
the american medical association 
they described pressure from the public press and 
pharmaceutical companies to recommend fda approval of the drug tpa 
or tissue plasminogen activator 
the pressure included an editorial in the wall street journal 
calling for the immediate release of tpa despite researcher 
concerns the editorial argued that the panels decision to 
postpone approval would sacrifice thousands of american lives on 
an altar of pedantry 
following the panels decision the fda requested additional 
information from the drugs manufacturer genentech inc of south 
san francisco a second and third panel reconsidered the drug and 
finally gave approval in november 1987 six months after the 
decision to postpone the ok 
tpa is an enzyme used to break down blood clots particularly in 
the vessels feeding the heart muscle following a heart attack as 
with other clotdissolving drugs recipients risk internal bleeding 
kowey said the panel members decided to reply to the criticisms 
because of the complex reasons for their decision and the attention 
it received 
people began to lose sight of what the facts were he said 
emotionalism can be very dangerous to the public all the 
physicians knew was that we had turned down the drug this the 
article gives us a way to tell people what we were thinking 
kowey said the panel had very real concerns that the drug 
might cause excessive bleeding based on the available data the 
members decided that the presumed benefit of the therapy might be 
unacceptably mitigated by its risk 
kowey said he thought the medical journal article could help 
educate physicians treating patients who do not understand the fda 
approval process 
the fda to its credit did not succumb to the media 
campaign the authors wrote commissioner frank young and his 
staff endorsed the committees findings but most appropriately 
did promise to expedite review of any new information the sponsor 
wished to present in support of the application 
the authors maintain the panel made the correct decision in 
recommending a delay 
although the decisionmaking process is complex maintaining 
an objective attitude is mandatory to ensure that safe and 
effective drug products reach the marketplace according to the 
authors the public airing of problems having to do with this and 
other new drug applications and the strong stand taken by the 
committee and the fda should convince industry the medical 
community and the public that the method of drug review is sound 
in the past two years public outcry has successfully prodded 
the fda to speed up the approval process of drugs that could help 
patients suffering from serious diseases 
young announced wednesday a new plan to reduce the time required 
for human testing of drugs for lifethreatening and severely 
debilitating diseases which he said included severe heart disease 
aids parkinsons disease deadly cancers and blindness 
young said the tpa experience played a crucial role in the new 
fda policy as agency officials learned they could intervene in the 
drug development process to hasten approval by asking pointed 
questions and eliminating unnecessary research

the government today proposed ending the right of 
criminal suspects in northern ireland to remain silent as part of a 
new crackdown on the irish republican army 
the measure which will end a historic right dating from the 
17th century was put forward immediately in the commons and is 
likely to become law within three months 
the annoucement by northern ireland secretary tom king came a 
day after the government banned broadcast interviews with members 
of the outlawed ira and 10 other militant roman catholic and 
protestant groups in northern ireland 
the measure announced today applies to all criminal suspects in 
northern ireland but it is aimed at terrorist suspects 
another cabinet minister douglas hurd said the government is 
considering introducing similar legislation to end suspects right 
to silence in england and wales 
prime minister margaret thatchers conservative party has a huge 
majority in the 650member commons so the measures are likely to 
be approved 
king in a statement accompanying his announcement to commons 
said 
members of terrorist organizations are being trained to refuse 
to respond to questions put by the police and this technique is 
increasingly being adopted by those suspected of serious crimes 
including racketeering justice is being thwarted 
the ira is fighting to drive the british out of the majority 
protestant province of northern ireland and unite it with the 
catholic republic of ireland 
this is the first time a british government has announced it 
will introduce laws to end the right to silence 
courts now are not allowed to take into consideration that a 
suspect refused to answer police interrogation 
in a written statement to the commons king said under the new 
law a judge will be able to draw whatever inferences appear 
proper from the fact that a suspect refused to answer police 
questions 
sources said judges and juries will be able to conclude that a 
suspects silence is an indication of guilt particularly if the 
suspect produces a detailed defense in court after refusing to 
answer police questions 
king said the republic of ireland also has restricted the right 
to silence of suspects as part of its drive against the ira 
sinn fein the iras legal political wing said the measure 
effectively moves that british government closer to the 
governments of chile and south africa 
the right to silence is a centuryold civil liberty enshrined 
in the legal systems of most of the worlds civilized countries 
sinn fein said in a statement 
spokesman kevin mcnamara of the opposition labor party said in a 
radio interview northern ireland is being used as a laboratory 
for draconian measures to be used later in other parts of the 
united kingdom 
in addition to ending the right to silence the government has 
said it plans legislation this winter enabling it to freeze and 
seize the funds of terrorist organizations 
it also plans to require candidates in northern ireland 
elections to take an oath disavowing violence 
this is aimed at sinn fein which is formally committed to 
armed struggle to unite northern ireland with the republic of 
ireland under a leftist administration but the sinn fein 
leadership says it will have no problem taking a noviolence oath 
hurd on wednesday banned radio and television interviews with 
members of the mainly roman catholic ira sinn fein the ulster 
defense association a militant protestant organization and other 
northern ireland groups 
the ban which was imposed by decree and did not require 
legislation provoked an immedate outcry from opposition and civil 
liberties groups 
but hurd the cabinet minister responsible for broadcasting 
said the government has decided that the time has now come to 
deny this easy platform to those who use it to propagate 
terrorism 
the british broadcasting corp said the move set a damaging 
precedent but like the other british network the commercially 
funded independent television said it would comply 
sinn fein likened the ban to soviet bloc censorship 
timothy renton deputy minister of the home office told 
american reporters in london the whole aim of this ban is 
to remove that extra weapon the ability to go on television 
immediately afterwards to speak in justification of an explosion or 
a bomb 
the ban which follows closely a 15year ban on ira and sinn 
fein interviews in the republic of ireland does not affect foreign 
networks or the british print media 
sinn fein which gets about onethird of the vote of the 
catholic minority in northern ireland has one member in the 
british commons gerry adams who has never attended and about 70 
members on local northern ireland councils

while george bush warns against 
overconfidence by his supporters evidence abounds that the 
cautionary note is not sinking in with his entourage many are 
convinced hell be living in the white house come january 
a local secret service agent matteroffactly provided a typical 
example this week 
he walked up to bushs official photographer david valdez in 
the hallway of a hotel where bush holed up before a late afternoon 
speech 
the agent said he had a friend who was chaplain for a new york 
police organization and this chaplain wants to know if he can 
represent them at the inauguration who should he talk to 
valdez mindful of his bosss public admonition that any member 
of the campaign who shows overconfidence or signs of letting up in 
the final push is history made no comment on the mans 
request instead he tactfully suggested the agent look for some of 
the traveling campaign staff

bush later spoke at a local high school where some of michael 
dukakis supporters showed that a bit of this years political 
lexicon has made the crossover from campaign jargon to everyday 
usage 
as bushs motorcade rolled by the line of dukakis demonstraters 
outside heritage high school two raised a large cardboard sign 
that read spin this atwater 
spin is the word for what political operatives often do when 
talking to reporters they evaluate the current political 
situation or a given event in terms that serve their campaigns 
strategy and make their candidate look as good as possible 
spinning has a negative connotation among people who see it as 
attempted manipulation or outright deception 
lee atwater bushs campaign manager is one of the masters of 
spin 
atwater who does not generally travel with the campaign 
happened to be on the road with bush this day when a tv crew got 
the sign and showed it to him he laughed and seemed quite pleased 
at the acknowledgement of his speciality 
he later raised the sign aloft in the press bus while asking if 
anyone had any questions and continued the days spinning in the 
campaign plane later with the sign perched atop his seat

a us appeals court has denied ferdinand e 
marcos bid to avoid the threat of jail for failing to comply with 
grand jury subpoenas and president reagan reportedly is refusing 
to intervene 
at the white house today the president declined to discuss the 
case i just dont want to get into the subject because it is 
something that may not come to my desk at all he said when asked 
if he would intervene 
the los angeles times reported today that the president has 
decided not to intervene on marcos behalf 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals on wednesday upheld a 
lower court finding against the ousted philippines president and 
his wife imelda that subjects them to possible arrest for civil 
contempt of court 
marcos 71 and his 59yearold wife have been targets of a 
federal grand jury probe investigating charges that marcos 
allegedly diverted enormous sums of government money to secret bank 
accounts after he fled the philippines in august the couple balked 
at complying with a series of subpoenas prompting the contempt 
charge by judge john walker 
generally persons found in civil contempt can be jailed for the 
life of the grand jury usually about 18 months or until they 
comply with the courts directive whichever comes first 
but us attorney rudolph giuliani whose office is conducting 
the investigation refused to comment on what steps might be taken 
reagan also was asked today if he had promised marcos a safe 
haven in the united states the president replied i couldnt 
have made a blanket statement of that kind 
the president based his decision of noninterference on evidence 
indicating that marcos allegedly diverted us aid money to the 
philippines for his own use after he fled his country and took 
refuge in the united states at reagans invitation the los angeles 
times reported earlier today 
meanwhile in the philippines president corazon aquino said 
today that us prosecution of marcos would hasten her governments 
recovery of the billions of dollars he allegedly plundered during 
his 20year rule 
mrs aquino said us authorities had not informed her whether 
they plan to arrest marcos 
the chairman of the presidential commission on good government 
said last week he may delay filing criminal charges here against 
marcos so the united states could go ahead with its own prosecution 
mrs aquinos government has long been threatening to indict 
marcos on criminal charges but so far has filed 39 civil suits 
against him seeking to collect 967 billion in damages 
officials say in private that criminal charges have not been 
filed because of fears that marcos return would destabilize mrs 
aquinos administration the philippine constitution prohibits 
trial in absentia 
several times since taking refuge in hawaii in february 1986 
marcos has personally appealed to reagan for help with his legal 
problems and mrs marcos sent nancy reagan a handwritten letter in 
september 1986 the times said 
the twopage letter asked mrs reagan for her invaluable help 
to prevent the couple from being deposed under court order by 
attorneys for the philippines government said the times which 
obtained a copy of the letter 
i understand that a suggestion from the white house or the 
state dept could prevent these indignities to an ally and 
friend mrs marcos wrote according to the times 
a grand jury in new york has been investigating since june 1986 
whether the marcoses violated federal racketeering laws according 
to the appeals courts 21page opinion 
essentially the government believes the marcoses and 
others acting in concert with them fraudulently diverted enormous 
sums of money that belonged to the philippine government and the 
government of the united states which money was intended for the 
benefit of the philippine people the threemember appeals court 
wrote outlining the allegations against marcos and his wife 
specifically the grand jury was investigating reports that the 
couple or their agents may have used embezzled funds to buy real 
estate and other items in the united states and transferred other 
misappropriated money to secret swiss bank accounts 
the grand jury has not handed down any indictments the 
appeals court noted 
the subpoenas sought the marcoses fingerprints palm prints 
voice and handwriting examples along with their authorization for 
foreign banks to turn over their financial records 
when the couple refused claiming through their lawyers that 
they still retained headofstate immunity prosecutors presented 
an aug 9 diplomatic note from the philippines government waiving 
any immunity that the marcoses might possess 
the appeals court in an opinion written by circuit judge 
richard j cardamone noted that the language of the philippines 
governments waiver of the marcoses immunity could scarcely be 
stronger and therefore thwarted the couples claim

democrat michael dukakis struck back at 
george bushs negative attacks today by comparing his republican 
rivals campaign to the watergate coverup of the nixon white house 
truth was the first casualty in the nixon white house and it 
was the first casualty in the bush campaign dukakis said in a 
speech to southern new england telephone co employees 
i believe the american people value the truth in politics and 
im going to do everything i can to make sure the truth wins he 
said 
in campaign appearances in illinois and missouri on wednesday 
dukakis denounced republican campaign literature as garbage and 
a pack of lies 
the massachusetts governor also stressed his commitment to 
family values and the concerns of working americans today and said 
bush was both unknowing and uncaring 
im never going to forget the people ive met during this 
campaign dukakis said people who need a helping hand not a 
cold shoulder 
dukakis flew to connecticut after three days of campaigning in 
the middle west and was immediately asked about a hartford courant 
poll which said he was trailing bush by 10 percentage points in 
this new england state that borders his home state of massachusetts 
you know the polls they go up and down he responded 
in his speech to the telephone workers dukakis said 
george bush doesnt care that working women earn only 64 cents 
for every dollar that men earn 
george bush doesnt even know that almost 40 million americans 
mostly working people and their families dont have a dimes 
worth of health insurance 
george bush wants to help the people who already have it made 
i want to help every american family make it 
the democratic nominee described his family as more precious 
to me than anything in the world and no matter what else one has 
in life theres nothing more important than that 
later today dukakis was heading to new york to film campaign 
commercials and attend the annual alfred e smith charity dinner 
where he will share the spotlight with bush 
the dinner sponsored by the roman catholic archdiocese of new 
york customarily attracts the presidential candidates of both 
major parties who are under instructions to keep their remarks 
humorous rather than political 
on wednesday during a bus tour through rural southern illinois 
and missouri dukakis erupted angrily over a steady barrage of 
republican attacks on the massachusetts prison furlough program 
dukakis campaign officials trying to counter the damage done by 
bush crime ads were considering airing their own commercial 
with dukakis admittedly trailing bush in these closing weeks of 
the campaign his strategists also were looking for ways to get his 
message out to voters and close the gap 
were playing with different ways to more dramatically 
communicate with people said dukakis adviser leslie dach 
among those under consideration were buying five minutes on the 
major television networks for a dukakis speech and the purchase of 
larger blocks of time as long as 30 minutes for either a town 
meeting style program or a national callin show 
all sorts of different options are being weighed said press 
secretary dayton duncan 
in the effort to widen his audience dukakis also was appearing 
on the abc show good morning america on friday and probably 
would be on the abc program nightline next week 
dukakis and bush were invited to separate interviews on 
nightline but the vice president declined 
the democratic nominee got mixed news on the polling front 
a new abc newswashington post poll released wednesday said bush 
was leading dukakis by seven points a margin cheered by the 
democratic candidates aides who were looking for any sign that a 
recent nbc newswall street journal poll that had the margin at 17 
points was incorrect 
a louis harris poll said the bush lead was nine points a week 
earlier the same survey said bush was leading by two points 
dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas said the candidate 
decided to respond forcefully to the republican attacks after he 
was shown material mailed to voters by the illinois republican 
party 
all the murderers and rapists and drug pushers and child 
molesters in massachusetts vote for mike dukakis a brochure was 
headlined in bold type 
the material alleged that convicts in massachusetts have the 
right to vote 
it cited the governors opposition to the death penalty and his 
support for the states controversial prison furlough program 
in quincy ill dukakis held up the gop campaign material and 
told an outdoor rally this is garbage this is political 
garbage 
this isnt worthy of a presidential campaign

iran has withdrawn all its armed 
speedboats from a persian gulf island that was a major base for 
attacks on merchant shipping diplomatic sources said thursday 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 20 to 25 
speedboats were withdrawn recently from abu musa island in the 
southern gulf 
not a single speedboat is now in the vicinity of abu musa 
one source said 
the speedboats at abu musa were mainly swedishbuilt boghammar 
marin craft armed with machine guns rocketpropelled grenade 
launchers and antiaircraft cannon 
abu musa 30 miles off the coast of the united arab emirates 
was one of the principal bases for speedboat operations 
us and other foreign warships steered clear of the 12mile 
territorial limit claimed by iran around abu musa and other islands 
along the 600mile gulf 
iran has a speedboat base on farsi island in the northern gulf 
but shipping attacks from there ceased late last year and did not 
resume until just before a ceasefire took effect aug 20 in the 
iraniraq war 
since the ceasefire tehran has been trying to improve 
relations with its arab neighbors in the gulf and ease tensions in 
the waterway 
tehran has moved to normalize relations with kuwait which it 
accused of aiding iraq during the eightyear war 
irans parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani has indicated 
tehran seeks to restore relations with saudi arabia which severed 
relations in april citing iranian subversion and terrorism 
there has been a decrease in iranian interceptions of merchant 
ships suspected of carrying warrelated materials to iraq 
the moves are seen as part of an effort by iran to appear more 
flexibile than iraq in peace talks aimed at ending the war the 
talks began in august but are deadlocked 
naval and shipping officials say there have been no iranian 
stopandsearch interceptions since the ceasefire took effect 
before that iranians were stopping scores of vessels each month 
iranian warships in the strait of hormuz the entry to the gulf 
still question commercial vessels by radio about their destinations 
and cargoes this is legal under maritime law until the warring 
nations sign a formal peace treaty 
some gulfbased shipping executives said these iranian radio 
interrogations have dropped to onethird of what they used to be 
the sources also said iranian warships are now seldom sighted in 
the southern gulf where they had been most active 
the iranians had fortified abu musa with tanks but these were 
withdrawn for use elsewhere in ground fighting us officers said 
recently 
there were indications earlier this year that the iranians were 
building a launching site for chinesemade silkworm antiship 
missiles on the island but as far as is known it was never 
finished 
some 550 ships were sunk or damaged in the tanker war and 
more than 300 seamen killed 
us officers have credited the presence of attack helicopters 
and boats from two secret us bases off saudi arabia with stopping 
the attacks

the honduran president said other 
nations should pressure nicaragua to become a democracy and 
blamed the sandinista regime for the hundreds of thousands of 
refugees from the civil war 
president jose azcona hoya said 55000 nicaraguans are in 
refugee camps along his countrys southern border in addition to 
about 8000 contras who retreated after us military aid ended in 
february 
azcona hoya blamed nicaraguas leftist sandinista government for 
the problem a government that creates refugees and political 
exiles cannot be a good government he said in an interview 
tuesday 
he said there must be an international reaction to pressure 
nicaragua into a political solution of the problem 
let us assume that president reagan was wrong and his 
policies of support for the contras were wrong well now the 
united states is stepping aside there is no more military aid 
azcona hoya said 
what is to be done other countries must become involved and 
force nicaragua to become a democratic country it is time the 
democratic countries of the world take a firm stand on this he 
said 
the contras are receiving nonmilitary aid under a 17 million 
program congress approved in march the same month nicaraguas 
leftist government and the contras began a ceasefire the truce is 
still in place but peace talks that would lead to a permanent 
solution have broken down 
last month honduras issued a call at the united nations for a 
peace force involving canada spain and west germany to patrol its 
borders with nicaragua and el salvador few believe the proposal 
will be carried out 
azcona hoyo called it a drastic move to show that we are not 
interested in attacking nicaragua whose government has not 
acted like someone concerned about peace 
when they could push for a dialogue they have toughened their 
stand internally jailing political opponents now that the contra 
is silenced completely they go to the opposite side and do not try 
to look for reconciliation 
honduras the recipient of substantial us military aid hosts 
us military forces and has long harbored contras in their war 
against the sandinistas more than 1000 us soldiers are 
stationed in honduras 
the united states has built installations in honduras to monitor 
activity in nicaragua and staged joint military exercises with 
honduras the americans have directed honduran troops to the border 
at least once to repel nicaraguan troops chasing contras 
more than 200000 nicaraguans live in honduras a nation of 5 
million people honduras is also home to tens of thousands of 
refugees from the civil war in neighboring el salvador

seven mississippi delta farmers have been 
fined by the state department of natural resources for violating 
bans on irrigation during this past summers drought 
in a related development the commission on natural resources 
has voted to ban irrigation pumping from several other delta rivers 
and bayous because of continued low water 
officials said the ban would not affect growing crops at this 
time of year but would restrict manmade flooding for waterfowl 
habitat 
the bans are the latest in a series of restrictions on water use 
in a region of the state once known for its abundance of water 
the drought lowered water in the delta which normally drains 
into the mississippi river and streams which flow into it are too 
low to replenish it 
we have one heck of a problem with water in the delta said 
commissioner robert travis of jackson 
during its wednesday session the commission imposed a reduced 
fine on the only delta farmer to request a hearing on the summers 
irrigation ban violations 
donald aylward of pace manager of laban planting co said he 
felt the fines for violating orders banning pumping from delta 
streams were unreasonable 
the commission voted to reduce aylwards fine to 1500 because 
he agreed to pump well water from one of his upstream farms into 
the bogue phalia river to replace water he was pumping from the 
river downstream he had faced a maximum fine of 6000 
six other farmers were fined the maximum

hispanic leaders on thursday charged both 
presidential candidates with ignoring issues affecting hispanics 
black and the poor to avoid being labeled liberal 
neither candidate or campaign has done a reasonable job of 
addressing these concerns or articulating an economic agenda that 
will lift us out of the height of economic depression said ruben 
bonilla jr general counsel of the league of united latin american 
citizens a hispanic umbrella organization 
we believe they are not addressing the issues because they 
dont want to antagonize or offend the anglo community lulac 
president jose garcia de lara told a press conference 
we want to hear them say what we are going to do to eliminate 
poverty in this country what governmental beneficial programs are 
we going to initiate what are we going to do about the lack of 
affordable housing he said 
de lara mentioned democratic nominee michael dukakis housing 
plan based on cashing in an individual retirement account to use as 
a down payment on a house 
the problem is that the poor do not have iras this shows how 
out of touch these candidates are he said 
bonilla singled out for criticism dan quayle the republican 
vice presidential nominee 
he said the indiana senator has the most regressive voting 
record on capitol hill noting the candidates opposition to 
bilingual education voting rights act bilingual ballot child 
nuturition programs and his support of taxing certain veterans 
benefits

thousands of serbs rallied in 
ethnically troubled kosovo province thursday against a setback 
dealt their nationalist leader and they jeered two politburo 
members who tried to address them 
parliament eased an unpopular austerity program allowing salary 
increases for some workers that will compensate in part for the 
annual inflation rate of 217 percent 
weeks of strikes and turmoil over ethnic and economic problems 
have threatened the stability of yugoslavia a fragile federation 
of several nationalities whose leadership has been weak since 
president tito died in 1980 
about 5000 people in a historic suburb of pristina kosovos 
capital taunted politburo members marko orlandic and kacusa jasari 
with chants of thieves and you betrayed the people 
they turned their backs when the party leaders tried to speak 
and police hustled orlandic and mrs jasari away when serbs tried 
to mob them 
a crowd police estimated at more than 20000 gathered nearby for 
a later rally protesting a blow by the national party leadership to 
the effort by slobodan milosevic communist party chief of the 
serbian republic to gain more control over kosovo 
the southern province heart of ancient serbia borders albania 
and ethnic albanians now make up 90 percent of the population 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and party structure serbia 
is the largest republic and both provinces kosovo and vojvodina 
are part of it but not fully subject to its control 
tito put the decentralized system of government in his 1974 
constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway after his 
death but the result has been ineffective government by compromise 
dusan ckrebic a serbian communist closely identified with 
milosevic lost a secret confidence vote wednesday at the end of a 
threeday session of the national party central committee 
he was the only one of 10 politburo members subject to the vote 
who did not get a majority in the 165member central committee and 
has offered to resign the vote was seen as a defeat for milosevic 
at the larger rally thursday serbs chanted we will not give 
up ckrebic we will not give up dusan and central 
committee members you have shown your true faces 
kosovos 200000 serbs and montenegrins had hoped the central 
committee would dismiss some ethnic albanians jfrom the kosovo 
party leadership 
no action was taken however nor were measures announced 
against what the minority describes as constant harassment from 
ethnic albanians thousands of slavs have left the province since 
1981 when at least nine people were killed in an outburst of 
ethnic violence 
orlandic and mrs jasari head of the kosovo communist party 
tried to placate the angry crowd in kosovo polje built on the site 
of a 14th century battle in which the serbs defeated the turks 
few listened and after about an hour some serbs tried to grab 
the microphone the politburo members were driven away in their 
black limousine down a side street under police escort 
miloslav minicof the serbian central committee promised those 
attending the later rally that their demands for the ouster of azem 
vlasi an ethnic albanian party leader in kosovo would be 
considered by the federal leadership the crowd began dispersing 
peacefully as darkness fell 
a 15member committee of kosovo serbs was formed to press for 
the dismissal of ethnic albanian leaders it announced plans for 
street protests and urged slavic members of the kosovo leadership 
to resign as an example and protest 
milosevic told a crowd of workers in a belgrade industrial 
suburb only the serbian party had the right to decide whether his 
ally ckrebic should resign from the national politburo 
stipe suvar chief of the national party said loss of a 
conference vote by a politburo member was unprecedented 
party leaders from other regions have been angered by 
milosevics support of nationalist rallies by serbs and suspect 
him of seeking greater power at their expense 
parliaments relaxation of the austerity program allows raises 
of 140152 percent for workers in profitable enterprises and in 
social services like health and education 
the changes were approved by the international monetary fund 
which demanded the austerity program as a condition for helping 
yugoslavia deal with its 21 billion foreign debt

a huge icebreaking barge today began its 
journey to rescue three trapped whales as scientists worried that 
plunging temperatures and polar bears would threaten the mammals 
they have named bonnet crossbeak and bone 
early today a national guard helicopter rigged to tow the 
185ton hoverbarge resumed the 230mile trip along the 
desolate arctic coast from prudhoe bay it moved about five miles 
wednesday through sand bars mud and shallow water 
the 24 to 30footlong california gray whales whose species is 
endangered became trapped in the ice two weeks ago while migrating 
south 
eskimo whalers using chain saws in subzero temperatures have 
been cutting holes in the thick arctic ocean ice to help the 
mammals breathe they got a boost wednesday when two 
brothersinlaw from minnesota brought six 400 deicers to the 
500000 rescue effort 
greg ferrian and rick skluzacek of lakeland flew to alaska at 
their own expense to demonstrate the devices invented by 
skluzaceks father when rescue coordinators politely refused their 
offer to help 
early today under the skeptical supervision of the 
coordinators they quickly cleared ice and slush from the two 
breathing holes accomplishing in hours what had been taking the 
rescue team using chain saws pickaxes and steel bars a day to do 
the cylindrical deicer about 9 inches around and 14 inches 
long floats in the water suspended beneath a styrofoam slab a 
small doubleblade propeller pulls warmer water up from below and 
emits it with 34 pounds of thrust 
within 24 hours the breathing holes should be about 30 feet by 
70 feet three to four times the original size skluzacek said 
the devices are used in marinas to keep boats from becoming 
frozen in the winter ferrian said 
the tired whales can survive for several more weeks despite 
being battered and bleeding from grating against jagged ice said 
john lien professor of animal behavior at memorial university in 
canada 
they can bleed a barrel and still be fine said lien who 
has helped free whales from ice for 20 years were talking about 
a big animal here between five to 20 tons 
the whales also may have to contend with polar bears reporters 
flying by helicopter wednesday spotted five prowling the ice a few 
miles from the whales 
there are polar bears that are certainly going to be attracted 
to this said ron morris of the national marine fisheries 
service if theyre going to take the whales were not going to 
stop them 
he said polar bears hunt at night when biologists are usually 
the only people near the breathing holes 18 miles northeast of 
this eskimo village 
the whales were named by biologists so the mammals respiration 
could be monitored when they surfaced one was dubbed bone 
because so much of its snout has been scraped away by the ice 
eskimos have given them their own names siku ice putu icehole 
and kanik snowflake 
a national weather service ice analysis showed no open water in 
the whales vicinity but a lead or pathway through the ice had 
been spotted about five miles from the whales said jim brooks 
acting director of the fisheries service in alaska 
there are open water leads throughout the chukchi sea and 
beaufort sea out for a long ways the ice is always moving its 
very dynamic he said 
brooks said there was no guarantee the whales could reach open 
water about 200 miles southwest even if they could get to the 
leads 
but the hope is that they will be able to make it through the 
leads via these open leads used by bowheads and belugas in their 
migration but the gray whale is not an iceadapted animal it just 
doesnt seem to be able to contend with the ice as well as other 
species of whale he said 
rescuers sought ways to coax the animals in the direction of 
open water if icebreaking efforts were successful including using 
lights as a lure near two new breathing holes cut for them but the 
mammals have shown little interest 
greenpeace representative cindy lowry said tape recordings of 
the sounds of other gray whales were being shipped to barrow to try 
to lure the animals to open water if they dont respond to that 
biologists said they have tapes of killer whales that might spur 
the three young whales to escape 
the barge was not expected to reach barrow at least until midday 
friday officials said 
were pretty optimistic said pete leathard president of 
veco inc the oil service company that owns the propulsionless air 
cushion vehicle it looks like it will be moving a little faster 
now that its cleared most of the mud and sandbars in the harbor 
another national guard skycrane helicopter assigned to the 
towing mission may be used instead to lift a huge reinforced 
concrete cylinder to barrow where it will be dropped to smash holes 
through the ice the slabs are leftover supports from construction 
of the transalaska oil pipeline fitted so they can be carried by 
helicopters 
thats going to plan b said sheryl deveau a spokeswoman 
for the guard we have a 9000 and a 14000pound concrete 
reinforced slab theyll start dropping that from the barrow

republican vice presidential candidate 
dan quayle courted bluecollar workers and students in a hotly 
competitive state thursday declaring economic recovery during the 
reagan administration means a job for all who want to work 
rejecting the democrats contention that many new jobs are 
relatively lowpaying quayle said this economy is generating 
millions of jobs in highpaying occupations taken together wages 
and fringe benefits have gone up 40 percent about a third faster 
than inflation 
in addition to his statements on traditional republican themes 
he challenged businesses in a state where the democrats have been 
strong to offer day care and to include minorities in the economic 
recovery 
smarter employers will understand they cant recruit good 
people if they have employment practices that force them to choose 
between being good workers and good parents said quayle 
employers who arent so smart will fail and deserve to 
a remaining economic challenge is the full integration of 
blacks and hispanics into the economy he said the last seven 
yeras have built a foundation for doing exactly that 
on another subject at a shopping mall rally quayle ridiculed 
dukakis complaints that the republicans have distorted his record 
on crime issues 
lets give a few facts on crime and ill try not to add any 
comments that further embarrass mr dukkakis quayle said 
he said dukakis opposes the death penalty no matter how 
horrible the crime and defended his furlough program throughout 
his governorship 
he refused to change it until forced to do so by public 
pressure in this election year quayle said 
he recited other positions he said showed dukakis was weak on 
crime and led a crowd of more than 1000 in chanting good night 
mike 
earlier before cheering college students he touted the 
administrations economic record 
it means for the first time ever we can make and keep the 
promise of a job for every american who wants a job said quayle 
it adds up to a job for all who want to work 
he said the reagan administration has created 12 million new 
jobs paying more than 20000 including more than 5 million 
averaging closer to 30000 a year 
polls indicate the presidential race in ohio is close and 
quayle stumped through the eastern part of the state in an effort 
to secure a republican victory 
the message aides said was aimed at bluecollar voters by 
telling them the nation is far better off than when president 
reagan took office 
reagan campaigned in ohio on wednesday to emphasize the 
importance republicans are placing on the midwestern industrial 
state 
underscoring the economic message quayle was joined in his bus 
caravan by labor secretary ann mclaughlin 
his bus caravan wound through small industrial communities on 
thursday with stops in mcconnelsville newark columbus and 
chillicothe he planned on spending friday in georgia and tennessee 
before taking the weekend off the campaign trail 
dont want to get tired and mess up said quayle explaining 
his time off less than three weeks before the nov 8 election 
might possibly cost you to lose the election 
quayle spoke with groups of schoolchildren briefly dismissed 
from class telling them to pay attention to your teachers you 
know what you might grow up and run for vice president some day 
in his speeches the message was sharper though he said he was 
only raising issues dukakis wont discuss 
if i had their liberal ideas i guess i wouldnt want to talk 
about them either said quayle since they dont want to talk 
it well talk about it 
you know and i know that their liberal approach to economics 
will take us backward to higher inflation high interest rates 
higher unemployment 
the bus caravan was a festive affair winding through the fall 
colors taking an occasional break for smalltown parades in 
antique automobiles 
it started on a gloomy day in dense fog conditions quayle likes 
to call dukakis weather but that weather soon gave way to 
bright sunshine

civil servants across the country staged a oneday 
strike for better pay thursday disrupting public services and 
presenting premier michel rocard with the toughest challenge of his 
five months in office 
there was no way to determine how many of the estimated 5 
million civil servants participated 
in paris subway and bus service was cut by onehalf to 
twothirds many commuters feared the worst and drove into the 
city resulting in huge traffic jams some highways leading into 
paris were backed up as much as 17 miles 
air france canceled 31 flights and major rail lines were running 
at onehalf to twothirds their usual number 
mail went undelivered and teachers didnt show up for classes in 
many parts of the country and many public offices were closed 
the worst thing that could happen would be that the government 
continue in its obstinacy said jean kaspar national secretary 
of the socialistrun french democratic confederation of labor at a 
demonstration in central paris 
andre bergeron head of the worker force union said the 
government must concede something and come to an agreement next 
week or risk finding itself in an inextricable situation perhaps 
involving more and longer strikes 
public service employees received a 1 percent raise in march and 
1 percent in september they have been offered a 22 percent 
increase for 1989 
inflation is expected to hit 28 percent in 1988 and the public 
workers see themselves losing 08 percent in purchasing power 
maintaining purchasing power is not the only demand of the seven 
different unions representing public workers but it is far and 
away the most important one 
rocard has been criticized by the conservative opposition and by 
his own socialist party 
civil service workers in france traditionally vote left and 
they are especially disappointed by the lack of sympathy they 
perceive on the part of the socialists who took over from the 
conservatives after spring elections 
the government received a shock in august when the monthly trade 
deficit nearly tripled to 15 billion with little prospect of the 
trade deficit improving much officials are afraid any relaxation

the roman catholic diocese of tucson says 
severe financial strain from continued ownership of television 
station kdtu has forced elimination of 14 jobs suspension of some 
services and imposition of salary cuts 
the financial resources of the diocese have been severely 
pressured by the continuing financial demands caused by the 
diocesanowned television station bishop manuel d moreno said 
in a letter to parishes 
he said efforts have failed over the last three years to sell 
the uhf station channel 18 which went on the air in 1984 and the 
continuing demands caused by its operations have forced 
reductions in diocesan services to parishes 
the bishop said the cutbacks however would not affect regular 
parish operations nor parish employees since parish budgets are 
administered independently he also said catholic community 
services catholic schools and cemeteries would be unaffected

mining claims valued up to 400 million 
may be endangered by a pair of nesting spotted owls considered an 
endangered species by the state 
the rare owls are believed to inhabit the slopes above wells 
creek canyon where a spokane mining company hopes to dig for gold 
and silver 
but audubon society officials see possible problems if the 
sighting of young owls means nests are nearby 
it just doesnt seem feasible for mining not to impact the 
owl says audubon staff member chuck sisco 
the spotted owl is a major issue and we are bringing in 
biologists to study this said wallace mcgregor president of the 
mining company steelhead resources ltd 
mcgregor and other company officials briefed government and 
environmental representatives tuesday at the site of the great 
excelsior mine opened at the turn of the century 12 miles south of 
the canadian border 
glacier a hamlet consisting mainly of a ranger station and a 
tavern was where the 1935 film call of the wild starring clark 
gable and loretta young was filmed 
geologists have made a total of 61 test borings into the 
volcanic rock in steelheads 1250acre claim and have identified 
approximately 160000 ounces of gold and 10 million ounces of 
silver worth about 130 million at current prices 
mcgregor says extensions of the known ore zone as well as a 
potential for finding new deposits could boost the value of 
steelheads claims to 400 million 
he estimates the mine would be worked for 10 to 20 years with 50 
to 100 local people employed at any one time 
to begin operations however the miners must obtain 36 federal 
and state permits undergo an environmental impact study and meet a 
stillundetermined list of county requirements 
mcgregor estimated it would be two to four years before the 
operation could begin 
spotted owls including young offspring have been reported in 
the area since the late 1970s indicating there may be a nest 
someplace such as the cavity of a rotting old tree in the area 
where the pit miners would dig said brady green a wildlife 
biologist with the mount bakersnoqualmie national forest 
what we are trying to do is work with them the mining 
company the best we can until it is determined what they are going 
to do with the site and then try and minimize the impact so we 
dont further jeopardize it as spotted owl habitat green said 
the forest service has designated the region as a spotted owl 
habitat area but cindy correll a mining specialist with the mount 
baker ranger district said an 1872 law gives miners the right to 
prospect explore and develop valuable mineral deposits in 
national forests 
the spotted owl is not designated an endangered or threatened 
species by the us fish and wildlife service although it is on 
the forest supervisors list of sensitive wildlife 
in washington state the spotted owl is considered endangered 
while the state lacks authority to protect the birds habitat in 
federal forests wildlife department officials said the intentional 
killing of a spotted owl could result in criminal prosecution 
tom juelson manager of nongame programs for the state wildlife 
department said the problem could be hard to resolve if a nest 
were found 
if it were an easy resolution it would have been resolved 
he says those who have the mining permit have a great deal at 
stake the spotted owl is an endangered species these kinds of 
conflicts dont lend themselves to an easy solution

the government said thursday following a 
visit by a us deputy secretary of state that relations with the 
united states are not improving fast enough 
the oct 1213 visit by deputy secretary of state john c 
whitehead was a step forward in mutual relations though it is 
not yet what one could expect said foreign ministry spokesman 
stefan staniszewski 
it was whiteheads second visit to poland this year and his 
third since a thaw in uspolish relations began in early 1987 
leading to a lifting of us economic sanctions imposed after the 
1981 martial law crackdown on the solidarity trade union 
the united states despite its earlier declarations 
encouraging us to bold reforms in fact continues to stick to its 
waitandsee attitude staniszewski said 
staniszewski said he was referring to a lack of steps to develop 
economic relations including aid from the united states to poland 
us backing of aid through international organizations and 
investment in poland by private american companies 
as far as specific possibilities of utilizing credits whitehead 
could only mention loans allowing poland to buy up to 8000 tons of 
surplus us food he said 
if poland were to use the credits to buy butter the most 
expensive item then they would be worth 16 million he said we 
can buy butter cheaper elsewhere he added 
whitehead said at the conclusion of his visit that future aid to 
poland depended on favorable trends in political and economic 
liberalization he also said that the united states continues to 
hope for relegalization of solidarity 
poland has a foreign debt of nearly 40 billion the highest in 
the east bloc it seeks western credits to allow it to rebuild 
aging factories and develop new sources of hardcurrency earnings

on thursday denied that party members were removed because they 
opposed president najibs drive for a peaceful settlement with 
usbacked rebels 
government radio meanwhile said seven people including an 
american were killed when their car hit a mine in southeastern 
afghanistan 
radio kabul monitored in islamabad pakistan said the car was 
loaded with weapons for the guerrillas it said the seven 
including the american four pakistanis and two egyptians were 
killed in zabul province but did not say when and gave no names

entered afghanistan from pakistan and 450 cars containing weapons 
have been found

democratic party of afghanistan 
he said najib accused the united states of taking advantage of 
the soviet withdrawal to intensify shipments of arms to the rebels 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in december 1979 and 
about 100000 have helped the marxist government fight the rebels 
under a un agreement signed in april all the troops are to be 
out by feb 15

denied it was because they disagreed with najib 
the health of the two was not so good said wali chief of 
the central committees organization department 
one of the pair zalour razinjo is in his early 30s and is not 
known to have any ailments

monopoly of power and the party is ready to take further peaceful

a black man who fought for almost 30 
years for the right to practice law in florida was posthumously 
reinstated to the florida bar on thursday by a unanimous state 
supreme court 
in its decision to reinstate virgil darnell hawkins the court 
said hawkins struggle for equal justice under the law should be 
memorialized 
hawkins who died feb 11 resigned from the bar more than three 
years ago 
his struggle began in 1949 when at the age of 41 he was denied 
admission to the university of florida school of law because of his 
race seven years later the us supreme court ordered that 
hawkins was entitled to prompt admission to the university 
however the florida supreme court refused to admit hawkins to 
the university because of the potential for great public 
mischief resulting from admitting blacks to white state schools 
the public mischief referred to in the opinion consisted of 
threats by white parents to have their children leave or transfer 
schools if blacks were admitted 
hawkins finally attended law school in boston but was later 
denied permission to take the florida bar exam because the school 
was unaccredited 
in 1976 the florida supreme court in an attempt to remedy 
injustices of the past ordered that hawkins be admitted to the bar 
without having to take the exam 
the next year at the age of 69 hawkins opened his law office 
in leesburg seldom turning away an indigent client in need 
the court noted 
however hawkins ultimately faced disciplinary proceedings as a 
result the court said of a practice that reflected his age the 
strain of practicing alone and the lapse of years since law school 
he pleaded no contest to misappropriating 15000 in clients 
funds and filed a petition to resign from the bar that was accepted 
on april 18 1985 
when i get to heaven i want to be a member of the florida 
bar hawkins told the court he died feb 11 
many attorneys from throughout the state joined a petition filed 
by harley scott herman of leesburg to reinstate hawkins 
posthumously 
rutledge liles president of the florida bar applauded the 
courts decision to do so noting hawkins unique contributions 
to opening the practice of law in florida to persons of all races 
to his undying memory it is a tribute to the man that he 
fought successfully and unselfishly to correct such a wrong he

a government official said thursday that 
investigators are not ruling out sabotage as the cause of two 
domestic airline crashes that killed 165 people 
another commercial airplane an indian airlines airbus carrying 
209 people made an emergency landing after takeoff thursday from 
the southern city of madras airline officials said they said the 
plane apparently developed technical problems 
rescue workers gave up hope of finding survivors from the crash 
of a fokker friendship airplane that slammed into a hill wednesday 
in the eastern state of assam 
federal aviation minister shiv raj patil made a threehour trek 
to the crash site 
bodies were strewn all around he told reporters after 
returning to guwahati there can be no survivors the plane 
carried 31 passengers and four crew members 
vayudoot the domestic carrier that operated the plane 
suspended service in the region for at least five days because of 
an aircraft shortage united news of india reported 
it normally operates four planes in the area but another plane 
was damaged recently when it hit an indian airlines truck at 
calcutta airport uni said 
in the western city of ahmadabad investigators were examining 
the wreckage of an indian airlines boeing 737 that crashed 
wednesday while trying to land in thick fog all but five of the 
135 people on board died 
forensic experts collected samples of bloodstained debris 
grass and soil to check for residue from explosives 
two crashes on the same day in a few hours is too much of a 
coincidence said one government official speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
the two planes crashed within two hours of each other 
villagers in the area said they heard an explosion shortly 
before the fokker crashed but vayudoot officials blamed the 
accident on the rainy weather the pilot reported zero visibility 
minutes before losing radio contact said 
jc barua a vayudoot spokesman said the pilots last message 
to the control tower at guwahati airport was i cant see 
anything 
the government has set up courts of inquiry to investigate both 
crashes and announced compensation of about 14000 each to 
families of victims 
both airlines have come under fire recently for poor management 
and failing to meet safety standards the charges were repeated in 
thursdays newspapers 
the indian post in bombay said aviation experts had warned of a 
major air disaster in view of the highly questionable manner in 
which civil aviation particularly indian airlines and vayudoot 
has been managed 
demoralization indiscipline and slippages in technical 
maintenance compunded by overflogging planes and pilots have 
dangerously affected the performance of the airline the 
newspaper said 
indian airlines flies to 73 airports in india and operates some 
flights to neighboring countries vayudoot flies mainly to smaller 
domestic centers not covered by indian airlines both carriers are 
owned by the government 
a third stateowned airline airindia flies only international 
routes

pete wilson and leo mccarthy bristle 
at suggestions that theyre politicians cut from the same cloth 
similar in experience temperament and speaking style wilson 
who is seeking his second term as californias junior senator and 
mccarthy his democratic challenger are both cautious career 
politicians who are more inclined to pragmatic compromises than to 
extreme ideological posturing 
little wonder it has taken this long for the contest to catch 
fire 
wilson has led in every poll but the margins have steadily 
slipped from a high of 22 percent in early 1987 to a low of 3 
points last week the race appears tight in the closing weeks 
the candidates are each spending millions in californias 
superheated television wars one wilson ad shows the closed gates 
in front of a posh san diego condominium complex where mccarthy 
owns two units and wonders where does all of mccarthys money 
come from 
a mccarthy ad has drawn howls of protest from wilsons campaign 
it features republican senate leader bob dole talking about a 1985 
budget vote that was so close an ill and sedated wilson was wheeled 
in from the hospital i said vote yes he voted yes we rolled 
him out again he does better under sedation dole says 
wilson 55 and mccarthy 58 are both attorneys who have spent 
most of their adult lives in public office wilson was elected to 
the state assembly at age 33 and mccarthy to the san francisco 
board of supervisors also at age 33 
they served together in the assembly for three years 1968 
through 1971 when wilson was elected mayor of san diego mccarthy 
went on to become speaker of the assembly a post he held from 1974 
to 1980 while wilson served 11 years as mayor wilson was elected 
to the senate in 1982 in the same election that mccarthy won his 
first of two terms as lieutenant governor 
even though their careers took parallel paths their differences 
are clear on the issues 
wilson is a fiscal conservative who believes the key is less 
government interference while mccarthy is a liberal who doesnt 
hesitate to use the authority of the government to achieve his 
goals 
we shouldnt spend money in congress to create jobs says 
wilson what we should spend it for is to keep america strong in 
order to keep america free 
mccarthy takes exactly the opposite approach criticizing 
wilsons record of unwavering support of the economic policies of 
president reagan and vice president george bush 
the contrast is even sharper on defense and foreign policy 
issues 
we ought to take 1 billion from star wars and put it in the 
classroom so our kids can get a decent education mccarthy says 
wilson has supported aid to the contras in nicaragua backs 
reagans strategic defense initiative defense system and champions 
californias defense industry 
mccarthy has been an outspoken critic of reagans policies 
throughout central america and especially in nicaragua and is 
skeptical of the levels of spending throughout the defense

a couple have been ordered to stand 
trial for murder for allegedly killing their baby daughter with a 
cocaine overdose 
a superior court judge tuesday overturned a lowercourt decision 
and ordered gilbert and debbie delgado to stand trial for the 1986 
death of 2monthold stephanie delgado a municipal judge ruled 
there was not enough evidence to charge the couple with murder 
the childs death at first linked to sudden infant death 
syndrome was later blamed on cocaine when tests found small 
amounts in the childs system authorities said 
we believe that the delgados by selling and using large 
amounts of cocaine in a very tiny apartment and in very close 
proximity to a 2monthold child were creating an inherently 
dangerous environment deputy district attorney richard king 
said it was just a matter of time before this child died of 
cocaine 
superior court judge jean rheinheimer set a jan 23 trial date

prosecutors thwarted by a judges 
ruling that they cannot force a lawyer to reveal the name of a 
client involved in a hitandrun fatality ordered depositions 
thursday from people with cars similar to the mans 
several of the car owners complained that their vehicles have 
already been checked and cleared by police 
the accident victim mark baltes died march 9 1986 after what 
is believed to be a white 1984 or 1985 buick riviera ran over him 
in a street where he lay after a night of drinking 
a person who claimed to be driving the car contacted attorney 
barry krischer and demanded the lawyer not reveal his identity to 
police while negotiating with authorities prosecutors sought to 
force krischer to give them the name but last week a judge ruled 
that attorneyclient privilege protects the suspects identity 
so prosecutors tried a different tack this week 
nine people were ordered to give sworn statements in palm beach 
county state attorney david bludworths office on thursday seven 
of them own or drive 1984 or 1985 white buick rivieras the palm 
beach post reported of the remaining two one is the husband of a 
woman subpoenaed the paper said the ninth person subpoenaed did 
not have a white buick riviera registered in palm beach county 
assistant state attorney kenneth selvig would not say why these 
drivers were selected from the owners of 2800 buick rivieras 
registered in palm beach and broward counties 
all i can say is were continuing to pursue the 
investigation he said 
most of those subpoenaed said police have already examined their 
cars and determined they were not involved in the accident 
stockbroker jeffrey randall said two detectives searched his 
white buick riviera six weeks ago and questioned him about it 
i can understand the persistence said randall of boca 
raton but all of a sudden somebody turned up the heat real high 
and its starting to irritate me i dont know if its the 
political thing or what 
selvig denied any connections between the subpoenas and 
bludworths nov 8 reelection bid this has nothing to do with 
the election he said 
palm beach hairdresser michael vulpio said detectives also 
looked at his vehicle he said the front end of his car was 
repaired after an accident but that he knew nothing about the 
baltes hitandrun 
pamela cherry a west palm beach real estate agent was 
interviewed by police last year court records show officers 
determined that cherrys vehicle was in no way involved in this 
case 
mary sussils 1984 riviera was searched twice by police mrs 
sussil a legal secretary gave a statement and allowed police to 
search her car when police said it seemed to have a new grill and 
fresh paint 
on may 12 police eliminated her car because they found the 
grill was the cars original 
im kind of mystified about the whole thing said mrs 
sussils attorney david kelley weve cooperated fully her 
car was not involved

a woman who became an undercover agent for 
six weeks to try to free her grown daughters from the grip of drug 
dependence also helped break up a major methamphetamine operation 
authorities say 
the 44yearold bartender who asked to be identified only as 
pat aided in the arrests of two of the five men taken into custody 
wednesday said police chief jim harper of nearby dallas 
several additional suspects were being sought harper said 
thursday 
pat a grandmother of two said she decided to get involved 
because her daughters ages 24 and 21 use methamphetamine and had 
been virtually living out of their cars 
the people were getting all their money for drugs pat said 
the woman who often wore a hidden microphone during her 
undercover work was accompanied by police early wednesday to a 
state park west of salem where she had arranged to sell chemicals 
to a suspect 
harper said 45 officers from six agencies later served search 
warrants at three polk county residences two men were arrested at 
the park and three others were arrested at a farm in dallas a town 
of 8900 about 15 miles west of salem 
officers also seized an ounce of methamphetamine and several 
gallons of chemicals used to manufacture the drug harper said 
this lady really came through the chief said talk about 
being involved and making that sacrifice she really did 
pat said she had accompanied her daughters to a farm where they 
allegedly purchased drugs then gave the address to dallas police 
the department was aware of the farm but didnt have enough 
evidence at the time she said 
i led the people at the farm to believe i needed money and i 
needed it bad and told them i knew some people where i could get 
some chemicals she said they really took the bait 
she became wellacquainted with the people and most of the time 
wasnt too worried about the environment she said but once she 
became afraid when she was carrying a hidden microphone and one of 
the suspects said i want the wire listening device youre 
wearing 
i didnt realize he was kidding she said you cant tell 
when hes kidding i was scared to death 
she eventually supplied some chemicals given to her by the 
dallas police 
pat said shes heard talk of marijuana and cocaine in her jobs 
but knew little about methamphetamine 
i just cant believe the chemicals that go into it she 
said i just cant believe the chemicals people put into their 
bodies one of them is used to develop pictures that tells you 
something 
her experience convinced her methamphetamine use is rampant 
its like an epidemic they cant make this stuff fast 
enough she said a pound sells for 16000 
she said her daughters knew nothing of her undercover work 
before the arrests but now that her actions have been disclosed 
she said her oldest daughter is angry at her but her youngest 
daughter isnt 
now that her cover is blown she says shes a bit worried about 
her safety 
but its not going to stop me if theres more she can do

a 41yearold woman who had a heart 
transplant two years ago said thursday she was elated at the birth 
of her first child a 3pound boy who knows my voice already 
he doesnt like to be messed around with a whole lot said 
the childs father gary v snell sr who joined his wife

medical college of virginia hospitals hes a little fighter 
the boy delivered eight weeks prematurely on oct 14 is only 
the third child known to be born to a heart transplant recipient 
the other two births were in europe and california 
during the early stages of my pregnancy i thought it was 
cardiac rejection said mrs snell who received her new heart 
aug 17 1986 at the hospital center 
yet despite the risks posed by the strain of carrying a child 
and having to take antirejection drugs from the transplant she 
decided against initial counseling to terminate the pregnancy 
dr james a thompson a cardiologist said mrs snells heart 
therapy was not altered during her pregnancy and she came through 
the most critical first three months without problems 
dr patricia hays mrs snells obstetrician said the special 
circumstances of the case made an induced early delivery a 
consideration until mrs snell had a premature rupture of the 
membrane 
the infants condition is not unusual for a premature baby and 
gary jr is expected to be home with his parents by thanksgiving 
the doctors said 
so far everything looks perfectly normal said dr gary

towing a 185ton barge 230 miles 
across arctic ice with a huge skycrane helicopter to try to save 
three icebound whales is not the sort of job for which you can 
practice 
none of us has ever towed anything like this before period 
chief warrant officer tom williams said thursday but were 
confident in flying the helicopter 
were kind of learning as we go he said we learned a lot 
yesterday we were a little apprehensive but were more relaxed 
now 
williams is copilot of the primary alaska army national guard 
skycrane helicopter dragging an icebreaking barge to point barrow 
in an effort to break open a channel for three whales trapped at a 
small breathing hole surrounded by miles of ice a second skycrane 
also is available 
the skycrane dubbed isabel by its threeman crew was designed 
for lifting heavy loads not acting like a tractor but it tugged 
and pulled the barge for four hours across five miles of muck 
shallow water and sand bars wednesday before darkness stopped the 
operation 
we sure got hopeful we were able to move it pretty well there 
for awhile then it bogged down again williams said were 
trying to get out of that area to deeper water basically where we 
think we can travel when we hit pockets of deeper water we can 
travel pretty well 
once we get into open water the fellow operating the barge 
says well be able to make five up to 20 knots 
the 3 million barge was donated by veco inc an oil field 
construction and service company it is 80 feet long 61 feet wide 
and 26 feet tall and rides on an air cushion generated by 
dieseldriven fans like a hovercraft allowing it to be towed over 
water ice or solid ground 
it can carry 100 tons and has a deck large enough to carry at 
least three tractortrailer rigs 
the helicopter can lift about 25000 pounds not enough to lift 
the barge but enough to tow it on its air cushion 
skycranes are the secondlargest helicopters in the us 
military inventory they are second only to hh53 troop carriers 
used by the us marine corps guard officials said 
there are probably 60 of the vietnamera skycranes left in 
national guard units across the nation with four in alaska the 
aircrew said 
williams aircraft piloted by chief warrant officer gary 
quarles is 18 years old its 45foot rotor blades are powered by 
twin engines generating 9600 horsepower 
the aircrafts cargo hook is attached to the bow of the barge by 
about 700 feet of nylon and steel cable 
from an altitude of as low as 25 feet the helicopter pulls the 
craft in a steeply nosedown attitude 
were kind of staring at the ice and hanging in our shoulder 
harness williams said we have to lock our shoulder harnesses 
its real tiring from our viewpoint 
while one pilot is flying the other pilot is constantly 
calling out power nosedown attitude and reading the instruments 
the skycrane must refuel about every two hours williams said 
and cant tow at night

the house joined the senate on thursday in 
threatening a renewal of military aid to the nicaraguan rebels 
unless the sandinista government observes the central america peace 
accords 
the action came as the house by voice vote sent to president 
reagan a bill which designates 143 million acres of forest service 
land in montana as wilderness 
the measure contains several unrelated nonbinding resolutions 
attached by the senate on foreign policy issues in addition to 
the warning about contra aid they formally embrace chiles move 
toward democracy and urge american allies to resist soviet efforts 
to acquire millions of us dollars through third countries 
the contra amendment supports unspecified continuing efforts 
to strengthen the internal democratic opposition and the 
independent media of nicaragua 
it also calls for maintaining the nicaraguan freedom fighters 
as one of the few pressure points on the sandinistas by providing 
the resistance urgently needed humanitarian assistance 
white house officials and gop lawmakers have said prospects are 
nil for obtaining a 165 million cache of weapons for the rebels 
in the waning days of the 100th congress 
the dwindling contra forces are subsisting on 27 million in 
food clothing and medical supplies approved by congress last 
month they have received no weaponry from the united states since 
lethal aid was halted in february 
though congress has been strongly opposed to new military aid 
the bill says a sandinista failure to comply with central american 
peace accords will inevitably cause the congress to approve 
additional military assistance for the nicaraguan resistance 
the wilderness bill affects more than 6 million acres of montana 
and is the result of a compromise worked out among competing 
interests including conservationists and the timber and lumber 
industries 
the bill designates about 143 million acres of forest service 
land as wilderness 360000 acres as special management areas and 
another 20000 acres as federal study areas it also releases for 
nonwilderness uses more than 10 million acres in montanas 10 
national forests

the communist party chief of lithuania was 
replaced thursday tass reported less than a year after he took 
office and on the eve of a lithuanian nationalist groups 
conference 
ringaudas songaila a 58yearold agricultural expert retired 
and lithuanian party leaders chose algirdas brazauskas to replace 
him the official news agency said 
lithuania became the second baltic republic to get a new leader 
just before the convening of a local nationalist group the changes 
appear to signal the kremlins intention to put more reformminded 
officials in charge of the region 
brazauskas 56 an engineer is known in lithuania as a 
strategist of the new tass said it said brazauskas has 
proved to be a sincere advocate of change 
songaila became the party head in december within a few months 
he had to deal with a burgeoning nationalist movement in the 
republic of 36 million people 
nationalists on june 3 founded the lithuanian restructuring 
movement and the group is to hold a conference saturday and sunday 
in the lithuanian capital vilnius 
activist vytautas bogusis invited to the conference as a guest 
of honor said in a telephone interview thursday that songaila 
never achieved much popularity he stayed largely out of the public 
eye and did not address rallies of the restructuring movement 
party chiefs in the baltic republics of estonia and latvia have 
spoken to nationalist groups there 
he songaila sits in the catacombs and has a stalinist 
conservative position there has been no perestroika from him 
said bogusis referring to mikhail s gorbachevs economic and 
political reform program 
bogusis a member of a more radical group called the lithuanian 
freedom league said songailas reputation worsened after police 
beat and kicked two dozen people and arrested at least 100 others 
in nationalist protests last month 
bogusis said many lithuanians blamed songaila for the brutal 
treatment of the demonstrators who were protesting soviet control 
over the republic 
lithuania latvia and estonia were independent countries from 
shortly after the 1917 bolshevik revolution until the soviet union 
absorbed them in 1940 under a pact signed with nazi germany 
on oct 4 the latvian communist partys policymaking central 
committee named the republics president jan vagris as its first 
secretary he succeeded boris pugo who was transferred to a job in 
moscow 
the latvian peoples front met oct 89 and adopted a program 
endorsing radical nationalist demands for the republic to have more 
autonomy in its economic political and cultural affairs 
gorbachevs reformist kremlin is allowing the baltic republics a 
measure of independence 
at the urging of the nationalist groups all three republics 
governments have adopted or are considering laws to legalize 
display of the flags that flew when the areas were independent to 
make the dominant nationalities languages official and to free 
local culture businesses and industry from the control of central 
ministries in moscow

the state department on thursday responded to 
the latest outbreak of violence on lebanons border with an appeal 
for security and stability and without directly calling on israel 
to forego revenge for the slaying of seven of its soldiers 
hezbollah or party of god a lebanese militia claimed 
responsibility for the suicide bombing that caused the deaths the 
proiranian group has been identified by counterterrorism experts 
at the state department as holding all nine american and six other 
foreign hostages 
israeli leaders promised retaliation against the group we 
have to strike at these people of blood and terror everywhere and 
at every opportunity prime minister yitzhak shamir said in 
jerusalem 
the soldiers were on the lebanese side of the border within a 
security zone israel maintains in order to prevent infiltration and 
attacks 
charles e redman the state department spokesman said the 
united states regrets the tragic loss of life and injuries 
sustained in south lebanon yesterday we deplore this bloody attack 
and the continuing violence in lebanon that has resulted in the 
death and injury of so many people israeli and lebanese alike 
asked if he had any warning for israel about revenge the us 
official said i dont have any reaction to that threat 
redman said the slaying of the seven israeli soldiers was part 
of a continuing occurrence unfortunately that we have seen in 
lebanon and its exactly the kind of thing that weve been trying 
to come to grips with by doing something in that country by 
helping to do something in that country that can bring more 
stability and security for everyone 
asked if the state department had urged restraint on israel the 
spokesman said im going to leave my reaction where it is im 
not going to try to deal with every possible aspect of this 
question its a continuing problem in the area weve been through 
what we have referred to many times as a cycle of violence 
pressed by reporters again redman said the whole thrust of 
our effort throughout is to bring security and stability and that 
is another way of saying restraint that is a continuing aspect 
of what we have tried to do in the region 
secretary of state george p shultz and other us diplomats 
have tried to promote arabisraeli peace talks as well as a 
settlement of lebanons civil disorders neither problem has been 
resolved

despite drought the net cash income of 
farmers in 1988 is expected to nearly match or exceed last years 
record 571 billion unchanged from the outlook a month ago the 
agriculture department said thursday 
the departments economic research service said higher commodity 
prices inventory drawdowns and only moderate decreases in 
government subsidies are the main reasons for forecasting 1988 net 
cash income in a range of 55 billion to 60 billion 
however the fortunes of individual farmers have changed 
sharply some gaining from higher prices received and others losing 
from heavy crop losses or higher livestock feed costs the 
agency said in its new outlook report 
net cash income is the amount of money farmers have to spend 
during the year and represents the difference between gross cash 
income and cash expenses for example 1988 sales of grain stored 
from harvests in earlier years are counted as part of the current 
gross 
another method of usda bookkeeping measures net farm income 
for the calendar year not simply the cashin cashout system 
involved in net cash income 
in this method changes in the value of farm inventories are 
taken into consideration and allowances are made for nonmoney 
items such as depreciation the family consumption of farmgrown 
food and the net rental value of dwellings 
net farm income in 1988 was forecast at 38 billion to 43 
billion also unchanged from the september report but down from 
1987s record 463 billion

state radio said the four are the patriotic youths organization 
youths union for burmas progress all burma democratic peoples 
power organization and the national progressive youths of burma 
analysts said none of the four were politically significant 
with the possible exception of the progressive youths which is led 
by procommunist lawyers who were student leaders 
the all burma democratic peoples power organizations includes a 
number of lesser known film actors directors and poets 
gen saw maung ended weeks of massive antigovernment protests 
sept 18 by calling troops into the streets to shoot unarmed 
demonstrators the government says more than 450 people have been 
killed in the lawandorder drive 
but the government has allowed the formation of political 
parties to contest a general election to be held sometime in 1989 
rangoon radio also announced a ban on making selling and using 
firecrackers in the capital and other towns during the annual 
buddhist festival of lights which will be celebrated next week 
children traditionally set off firecrackers and other fireworks 
opposition leaders fear that the tight control over virtually 
every aspect of life indicates free and fair elections will not be 
possible 
the government has pledged to remain neutral but it is widely 
believed that the power elite will back the national unity party 
which under a different name exercised unchallenged control since a 
1962 military coup 
the coup was staged by gen ne win who formally retired in 
july but diplomats generally agree that ne win is still the real

george bush raiding turf that his aides say is 
slipping away from michael dukakis dramatized his campaigns 
anticrime message thursday by accepting a police shield from the 
father of a slain officer 
along with the badge of officer edward byrne came the 
endorsement of about 30 police organizations including the 
40000member police benevolent association of new york 
its time for america to take back the streets declared the 
republican presidential nomineee in accepting the endorsments he 
called them an exclamation point for his campaign 
bush campaigned in new york and new jersey and planned a monday 
foray into connecticut maine and vermont 
dukakis northeast political base is cracking said bushs 
national political director rich bond we want to make his 
electoral math impossible for him 
bond said bush was comfortably ahead in new jersey and at least 
drawing even in heavily democratic new york 
bush was to share the dais later thursday with dukakis at the 
annual alfred e smith dinner sponsored by the roman catholic 
archdiocese of new york a nonpartisan event that benefits catholic 
charities 
the vice president accepted the police endorsements at a 
catholic high school in queens not far from the site where officer 
byrne was gunned down last february in his car while guarding a 
witness in a drug case 
matthew byrne a retired new york police lieutenant said he was 
giving bush his sons shield and commendation bar because we 
believe he and his administration will stand up for us 
i was a police officer long before i was a grieving father 
said byrne who also said he sided with bushs advocacy of the 
death penalty for those who murder police officers 
bush pinned the commendation bar on his lapel and said byrne 
and the families of other slain police officers were not alone in 
their mourning 
these tragic instances stand as a cruel reminder that the 
war against drugs is a shooting war bush said 
for the latest police endorsements the bush campaign selected 
christ the king high school in the middle of a rowhouse lined 
heavily bluecollar democratic neighborhood 
once represented in congresas by 1984 democratic vice 
presidential candidate geraldine ferraro the district is heavily 
populated with reagan democrats democrats who voted republican 
in 1980 and 1984 
the endorsements send a very powerful message said rep guy 
molinari bushs new york campaign manager it will be very 
helpful to the vice president and detrimental to michael dukakis 
position 
bush had previously picked up similar police backings in boston 
hartford conn and patterson nj while dukakis has also 
received a number of lawenforcement endorsements 
throughout his campaign bush has been seeking to depict dukakis 
as soft on crime touting his own police endorsements and referring 
repeatedly to a former massachusetts prison program that permitted 
some firstdegree murderers to be released on weekend furloughs 
on thursday bush called that program disgraceful 
phil caruso president of the new york police benevolent 
association called dukakis past suppprt for the prison fulough 
program maniacal and referred to the democratic candidate as 
cutemloose duke 
other police groups endorsing bush thursday included the 
metropolitan police conference of new york state the port 
authority police benevolence association and the police conference 
of new york 
earlier the vice president told a predominently polishamerican 
audience of about 600 in south river nj that he would deal with 
the soviets with a firm hand and suggested that dukakis would not 
he has a different concept of a strong presidency than i 
have bush said asserting that dukakis would not have the 
capability of acting quickly when us interests were threatened 
despite recent reforms within the soviet union bush said old 
ambitions die hard the leaves may be falling but the trees are 
fundamentally the same

blowing out the candles and making a wish 
may get you a rendition of happy birthday to you but you cant 
buy it for a song the ditty is for sale for at least 12 million 
says the company that owns it 
cooed by marilyn monroe to president john f kennedy sung 
recently by 90000 fans to michael jackson and a staple of 
childrens birthday parties for almost a century the song that 
seems ageless while reminding us we arent is on the block with the 
other musical holdings of birchtree ltd of princeton 
the first six notes of happy birthday are as recognizable as 
the first four notes in beethovens fifth symphony said gary 
hanson of the cleveland orchestra of course happy birthday is 
played a lot more than beethoven 
david sengstack chairman of birchtree said he can only guess 
what made the song so popular 
i think it was the movies that did it he told the new york 
times 
translated into dozens of languages the composition began as a 
classroom greeting in 1893 with louisville ky teachers patty 
smith hill and her sister mildred j hill the two kindergarten 
and sunday school teachers wrote the song with the lyrics good 
morning to you as part of a book song stories for the sunday 
school 
since then it has become one of the three most popular songs in 
the english language along with auld lang syne and for hes a 
jolly good fellow according to the guinness book of world 
records 
birchtree which owns the copyright to about 50000 titles says 
royalties will still be coming in until the year 2010 when the 
copyright expires it brings it about 1 million a year according 
to the times 
everybody uses it said kate shen a spokeswoman for 
birchtree it gets used in movies and plays and greeting cards 
music boxes television shows and commercials its just about 
everywhere 
even underwear 
the company objected when fredericks of hollywood advertised 
underwear that played happy birthday but it had no problem 
when casio programmed the song into digital watches that play it 
every hour on the watch owners birthday the song brings birchtree 
a penny a watch 
a lawsuit against postal telegraph in the 1940s attempted to 
keep the song from being used in singing telegrams but the suit 
was dropped when lawyers argued that even though it was sung for 
profit it was not heard in public 
since then the song has been used and paid for in the films 
10 the great santini oh god and fame 
i dont know really why it became so popular ms shen said 
it seems to bring out the little kid in a lot of people its 
something weve all grown up with 
the songs melody originally had the lyrics good morning to 
you good morning to you good morning dear children good morning

at least 750000 us children are taking 
stimulant medications to curb their overactivity or 
inattentiveness but researchers said thursday it is not known how 
many are getting the drugs appropriately 
medication treatment for hyperactive children in the united 
states has emerged from its minor treatment role in the 1960s to 
become dominant child mental health intervention in the late 
1980s the researchers said 
a national estimate of 750000 youth receiving stimulant 
medication in 1987 can be viewed as a conservative one they 
wrote in fridays journal of the american medical association 
for reasons unclear to scientists drugs that otherwise are 
stimulants act on the central nervous system to calm hyperactive 
children improve their attention spans and concentration and 
reduce impulsive disruptive and aggressive behavior 
a furor has arisen over giving children stimulants such as 
ritalin dexedrine and cylert they once were prescribed mainly to 
stem hyperactivity but now also are given to nonhyperactive 
children who have trouble paying attention the researchers said 
both uses are appropriate if a youngster has a problem that 
meets the strict psychiatric definition of hyperactivity or 
attention deficit or a combination of the two the researchers 
said 
if present trends continue over 1 million us children will 
be receiving stimulant medication by the early 1990s with possibly 
onefourth receiving the medication for inattentiveness 
associated with a learning impairment the researchers said 
dr daniel j safer lead author of the study and regional 
director of child mental health services for the baltimore county 
health department said more research will be needed to determine 
how many youngsters nationally are getting the drugs appropriately 
but previous findings in baltimore county where 6 percent of 
schoolchildren are given stimulants left him generally 
reassured he said in a telephone interview thursday 
he said teacher ratings indicated that more than 90 percent of 
children studied had clearly improved after taking the drugs and 
threequarters of them had improved by more than 50 percent 
we cant speak for the country but in baltimore countny we 
feel the medication was generally quite appropriate he said 
estimates of the national prevalence of stimulant use were drawn 
from drug company estimates of production and school surveys the 
researchers said 
at least 13 lawsuits in four states and the district of columbia 
have been filed on behalf of parents distressed at the effect of 
ritalin on their children in one for example parents claimed the 
drug caused insomnia depression and loss of appetite in their son 
who was later diagnosed as having a brain injury not treatable with 
the drug 
defendants in the cases have included pediatricians 
psychiatrists teachers and school districts 
a 19yearold los angelesbased group called the citizens 
commission on human rights a longstanding opponent of psychiatry 
and linked to the church of scientology has made the goal of 
banning ritalin an allout campaign it has been instrumental in 
many of the lawsuits 
it claims the drug is highly addictive and is being given to 14 
million children putting them in a chemical straitjacket and 
predisposing them to delinquency the group says teachers and 
schools are pressuring parents into giving it to troublesome 
children 
russell barkley director of psychology at the university of 
massachusetts medical center in worcester has acknowledged that 
some children are being medicated unnecessarily by medical 
professionals who among other things are seeing the children 
once a year and renewing the prescription by telephone 
but safer characterized the california group as a few vocal 
people who want to make a name for themselves 
there is clear agreement among physicians that the medication 
is useful and that side effects were usually temporary and minor 
he said

two cosmonauts spent more than four hours outside 
the mir orbital platform thursday to replace a faulty component on 
an xray telescope a task they failed to accomplish earlier this 
year tass reported 
vladimir titov and musa manarov used new tools recently brought 
to their space station by a progress cargo rocket to remove a 
detector that had been developed by british and dutch scientists 
for the telescope the official news agency said 
components of the unit melted because of exposure to cosmic 
radiation radio moscow reported tass said titov and manarov 
replaced the part with an upgraded detector that would help 
prolong the life of the telescope 
on june 30 titov and manarov tried unsuccessfully to replace 
the damaged unit of the telescope which is mounted on an 
observatory module called kvant attached to the mir but the 
cosmonauts at that time couldnt unfasten the clasp holding the 
detector to the telescope 
in thursdays spacewalk which lasted four hours and 12 minutes 
titov and manarov wore new spacesuits that tass said free 
cosmonauts from the need to remain tethered to their spacecraft 
tass said however that the two men did remain linked to the 
mir because they had to repair the telescope before testing out the 
suits 
the new suits also are equipped with new life support systems 
and the wearer communicates by radio tass said 
while outside the mir they also installed a fastener near the 
airlock that will be used in a joint sovietfrench mission 
scheduled for next month tass said it said the fastener would be 
used during a sovietfrench spacewalk apparently to keep the 
cosmonaits tethered to the mir 
titov and manarov also fastened a radio aerial to the outside of 
their spacecraft tass said 
the two soviets have been aboard mir since december and are 
scheduled to set a new space endurance record before returning to 
earth before the end of the year soviet officials have said 
a third cosmonaut dr valery polyakov arrived aboard mir in 
september to monitor the health of titov and manarov polyakov 
stayed inside the station thursday to check onboard systems tass 
said 
the mir was launched feb 20 1986 and the kvant orbiting 
observatory was attached to it in early 1987

democrat michael dukakis drew 
comparisons with the watergate scandal thursday in accusing george 
bush of distorting his record 
above all the truth should matter a lot in a presidential 
campaign because as we learned in watergate it matters a lot in 
the oval office dukakis said he said that in the bush campaign 
as in the nixon white house truth was the first casualty 
the democratic presidential nominee struggling to catch up with 
the vice president less than three weeks before the nov 8 
election raised the issue of abortion in depicting bush as 
insensitive to the needs of struggling families 
referring to bushs opposition to a womans right to an abortion 
in most cases dukakis said george bush wants the government to 
make one of the most personal choices a woman can make i 
believe a choice that personal must be made by the woman herself 
he recalled that bush had said during their first debate on 
sept 25 that he was undecided whether women who receive abortions 
in the event they are declared illegal should be punished as 
criminals 
dukakis did not mention that the day after the debate bush said 
through campaign chairman james baker iii that he believed those 
women should be treated as victims rather than criminals 
dukakis raised the abortion issue in a speech to telephone 
company employees in new haven conn that was aimed at appealing 
to working women and struggling families 
he recalled the transgressions of the watergate era when he 
renewed his complaint that the republicans had deliberately 
distorted his record 
truth was the first casualty in the nixon white house and it 
has been the first casualty in the bush campaign dukakis said 
i believe the american people value the truth in politics im 
going to do everything i can to make sure truth wins and that we 
win on the 8th of november he said 
campaigning in the town where bush attended yale university the 
massachusetts governor strolled through an italian neighborhood and 
spoke to a large street rally crowd 
dukakis headed later for new york city to attend the annual al 
smith dinner where he was to share the stage with bush at a 
traditional bipartisan campaign event presided over by roman 
catholic archbishop john oconnor 
the governor seemed unperturbed when informed on his arrival in 
new haven that a hartford courant newspaper poll showed him 
trailing bush in connecticut by 10 percentage points you know 
the polls they go up and down dukakis told reporters 
but state democratic chairman john f droney made clear he was 
unhappy about the way the dukakis campaign was being managed 
i just believe that the way his campaign has been handled has 
been bad droney said i think he should have hit harder 
earlier i dont think weve marketed the product as well as the 
republicans 
droney said other democratic state chairmen around the country 
have expressed similar concerns to the higherups in the dukakis 
campaign 
dukakis press secretary dayton duncan said the candidate had 
purchased five minutes of time on the abc television network 
starting at 955 pm edt saturday to broadcast an address to the 
nation that was being taped thursday 
in connecticut the dukakis campaign outlined a proposal aimed 
at helping parents hold jobs while caring for young or sick 
children it includes a guarantee for unpaid parental leave without 
threat of firing for up to 10 weeks to care for a newborn newly 
adopted or sick child or an ailing parent 
if elected president dukakis said he would issue an executive 
order allowing parental leave for federal workers and would work 
with congress to assure that all employers except small 
businesses provide family and medical leave to their workers 
dukakis said bush doesnt care that working women are paid 
an average of 64 percent of males earnings and pledged his 
support for pay equality 
george bush likes to talk about family values he talks 
about a kinder gentler nation dukakis said but his record 
sends a very different message 
his record tells working women i dont care if youre forced 
to choosebetween the jobs you need and the children you love 
dukakis said 
the democratic nominee asserted again that he and not bush 
represents middleclass america 
was he on your side when those republicans in congress said 
no to letting working people take time off to care for a sick 
child or a sick parent or grandparent without living in fear of 
losing their jobs dukakis asked 
was he on your side when those republicans in congress said 
no to american parents who want day care for their children

ritualistic beatings apparently were a 
routine part of athletic training for 55 children who were taken 
into protective custody after they were forced to watch the beating 
death of an 8yearold girl 
the children mostly from the watts area of los angeles were 
kept in a sparsely furnished fourbedroom farmhouse near sandy 
about 30 miles southeast of portland 
authorities say the children were subjected to whippings of up 
to 800 strokes with a paddle or electrical cord while the others 
were forced to watch and keep count 
the beatings were an integral part of the groups program to 
heighten athletic performance much like harassment used in 
military training said donald welch director of the clackamas 
county juvenile court 
although the children were removed from the house a week ago 
parents have made no attempt to reclaim the youngsters said alice 
galloway spokeswoman for the state childrens services division 
many of the parents came to oregon and set up interviews with 
social workers but canceled them abruptly at the request of 
ecclesia athletic association founder eldridge broussard jr she 
said 
the parents display no lack of confidence in eldridge 
broussard she said they trust him implicitly 
the dead child was broussards daughter dayna lorae 
in an appearance on oprah winfreys syndicated television talk 
show thursday broussard blamed negative news coverage for his 
daughters death 
he also denied that children were beaten or abused saying they 
were only spanked 
abuse may be anything that does not prepare them to be on 
their toes in a rather paranoid triggerhappy los angeles 
situation he said we teach our children the moment someone of 
authority says something to you you snap to it 
asked why he thought his daughter was dead broussard said 
the lord determined we were supposed to pass through this right 
now 
he said the standards of discipline were much different between 
oregon and gang and drugridden watts 
in watts parents have seen brutality that would trip the mind 
of the average american he said the people that are a part of 
my school when they see brutal they see ears coming off they see 
giant huge lacerations 
i wish someone would come from los angeles and examine these 
children i contend we would get conflicting reports 
the ecclesia athletic association first used the farm as an 
athletic training camp a year ago 
broussard formed ecclesia in 1975 to steer children away from 
drugs and crime and to motivate them through tough discipline and 
athletics it is now operating under the auspices of the watts 
christian center founded by broussards father in the 1950s 
broussard a former college basketball star said negative 
publicity when ecclesia arrived in oregon last year cost his group 
financial backing and led to suspension of its activities a year 
ago as a result broussard said staff members were performing 
duties they werent qualified for 
on oct 14 four of the groups staff members took the broussard 
girls body to a nearby fire station she had been beaten and 
whipped and died from multiple blunt force injuries medical 
examiner larry lewman said 
that night 53 children were taken from the house where they 
were sharing sleeping bags on the floor investigators said the 
children ranging in age from 1 months to 16 years had eaten only 
a tomato apiece that day 
two other children involved with the group were taken into 
custody in los angeles 
broussard who came to portland from los angeles after the 
girls death said in a statement addressed to the news media 
now murders involved and i accuse you on national television 
of murder in the first degree 
broussard 35 was a basketball star at pacific university in 
forest grove ore and later tried out with the portlan trail 
blazers surviving until the final cut 
he later won praise in los angeles for the sportsmanship and 
good manners of the ecclesia youngsters after the group renovated 
a gymnasium and formed a 32team basketball league 
last year broussards organization brought more than 70 adults 
and children to the oregon farmhouse to form an athletic training 
center for the children the group proposed living in tents on an 
18acre farm using portable toilets and showers 
neighbors opposed the plans expressing concern over the 
militaristic treatment of the children who they said appeared 
to be doing mostly manual labor and calisthenics 
they also pointed to an ecclesia vow of poverty that 
required the signer to declare all of my ambitions desires past 
and future commitments relationships expectations assets gifts 
talents and connections under the total control of eldridge john 
broussard jr i relinquish even the rights of decisionmaking 
ecclesia withdrew its zoning permit applications and returned to 
los angeles two months later 
the children were returned to oregon in late july and had been 
scheduled to return to los angeles as soon as a new youth center 
was completed said broussards spokeswoman carolyn van brunt 
six of broussards associates have been charged in connection 
with the girls death four with manslaughter and two with 
hindering prosecution broussards brother alvin was arrested for 
investigation of child endangerment at the watts christian center

favorable winds thursday buoyed hopes for 
three whales trapped in arctic ice as a huge military helicopter 
again headed out to slowly drag an icebreaking barge from prudhoe 
bay 
while the whales still were 200 miles away from the open water 
of the chukchi sea an easterly wind was breaking leads or 
pathways in the vast expanse of pack ice near the whales said 
gary hufford of the national weather service it was pushing the 
ice east and north away from shore and the forecast called for 
east winds and a slight warming trend until tuesday 
but weather is an unpredictable beast hufford said 
a satellite photograph thursday showed the ice was cracking open 
all over the arctic ocean and chukchi sea hufford said but 
subzero temperatures were quickly freezing any open water 
the animals were trapped about 100 yards off the desolate arctic 
ocean coast about two weeks ago by bitter cold and the constantly 
shifting ice pack they have been breathing through small air holes 
about 18 miles northeast of this inupiat eskimo village 
while biologists earlier worried that the animals were fading 
they said the giant mammals respiration rates have stablilized 
you can set your watch by them every 10 minutes said 
craig george a north slope borough biologist 
biologists named the whales bonnet crossbeak and bone the 
latter having much of its snout scraped away by the ice eskimos 
have given them their own names siku ice putu icehole and 
kanik snowflake 
the whales were at least three miles from the nearest lead and 
whether they would make it to open water was uncertain 
whether they will be able to navigate leadtolead to get to 
the open water i dont know said ted meyers national marine 
fisheries service chief of habitat conservation in alaska they 
must go through areas of ice for some distance before they reach 
open sea 
at the prudhoe bay oil fields a huge army national guard 
skycrane helicopter lifted off after first light and prepared to 
hook onto the 185ton barge and begin the 230mile journey to the 
whales the trip was expected to take 2540 hours that means the 
barge could not arrive at point barrow before sometime friday 
the helicopter and propulsionless barge progressed only five 
miles wednesday before the operation was halted because of 
darkness the rescue effort had been delayed more than two days by 
freezing weather equipment repairs and mud bogging down the barge 
which had to be relieved of excess weight 
the army national guard said a second skycrane assigned to the 
towing mission may be diverted to lift a 9000pound reinforced 
concrete cylinder to barrow where it will be used to smash holes 
through the ice 
they are not going to send it to barrow until they are sure 
they will not need it here said sheryl deveau a spokeswoman for 
the alaska national guard at prudhoe bay 
two generatorpowered deicers provided by a minnesota family 
business were keeping the whales breathing holes clear allowing 
biologists and whalers to take a break they had been using 
chainsaws around the clock to keep the holes open 
the 24 to 30footlong california gray whales whose species is 
endangered became trapped in the ice two weeks ago while migrating 
south the species which numbers about 20000 and has been growing 
at an annual average of 25 percent for the past decade spends 
winters in the warm waters off mexico and southern california

the bad news for newspapers this presidential 
election season is that most voters follow the campaign on 
television political columnist jack germond told the associated 
press managing editors convention thursday 
we are not in on the making of the agenda germond told the 
audience of 300 newspaper editors if we think we are were 
fooling ourselves 
germond was the lone journalist in a forum titled all about 
george bush convened during the weeklong convention wednesdays 
schedule included a panel called all about michael dukakis 
despite the designated subject of thursdays panel the 
discussion quickly became a comparison between the campaign run by 
the republican vice president and his democratic rival for the 
white house massachusetts gov michael s dukakis 
american voters have decided that mike dukakis cant take 
direction and that george bush is more in tune with the 
electorate said maines republican gov john mckernan who was 
there to speak for bush 
he has been successful at painting dukakis as being out of the 
mainstream the dreaded big l liberal mckernan said 
mckernan said new england as a whole is doing well economically 
and he received the biggest laugh of the 90minute session when he 
minimized dukakis role in the economic comeback of massachusetts 
we ought to give credit where credit is due he said and 
dukakis has been smart enough to stay out of the way of progress 
john martilla a market researcher and active democrat 
predicted the race could be closer than it appears from current 
polls which give bush a sizable lead conventional wisdom has 
been so wrong this year martilla said there is still room 
here to bring this back in governor dukakis direction 
he said dukakis problem is partly that he is carrying a 
legacy of failure of the democratic party at understanding the 
basic values of the american people 
another panelist gop strategist david keene picked up this 
point 
the bush campaign is run by men and women with a good 
perspective on national concerns keene said their counterparts 
working for dukakis are bright but too ideological and parochial 
he said 
one result was the way bush altered the public perception of 
dukakis 
bush seized on issues of little substance such as the pledge 
of allegiance prison furloughs that created a caricature 
dukakis couldnt escape from keene said in this way bush 
changed the perception of dukakis message he said 
germond had the last word 
we have had the most wretched campaign we have seen the 
veteran journalist said its a campaign of shameless irrelevance 
by the vice president and staggering ineffectuality by dukakis 
dukakis has been a terrible candidate because he failed to 
understand you have to understand voters are taking a risk electing 
a new person 
newspapers do their best to be fair at times being too 
evenhanded when the campaigning gets nasty germond said but 
voters look to tv to follow the campaign not to newspapers he 
said 
he faulted the networks for generally uncritical reporting and 
devotion to the good piece of film

scientists have devised a way to make crops 
survive a biodegradable weedkiller a method they said may save 
farmers money boost crop yields and protect the environment from 
heavy use of toxic herbicides 
the potential benefit is mindboggling terry medley of the 
us department of agriculture said of the study by calgene of 
davis calif and similar efforts by monsanto co and ei du pont 
de nemours amp co to develop herbicideresistant crops 
such crops will save the farmer money and give the farmer the 
ability to spray less herbicide and use an environmentally safe 
herbicide said david m stalker author of a study published in 
fridays issue of the journal science 
stalker and other molecular biologists at calgene said they 
successfully removed a gene or hereditary instruction from soil 
bacteria and inserted it into tobacco plants the gene makes the 
plants produce an enzyme that destroys the biodegradable herbicide 
bromoxynil said roger salquist calgenes president and chief 
executive officer 
the plants survived without damage when sprayed with eight times 
the dose of bromoxynil that normally kills them said the study by 
stalker kevin mcbride and lorraine malyj 
calgene scientists also engineered tomato and cotton plants to 
resist the weedkiller salquist said 
bromoxynilresistant crops should let growers reduce their 
chemical costs because bromoxynil belongs to a new class of 
weedkillers that are used in relatively low doses and dont 
persist in the environment said salquist stalker and jodie s 
holt a plant physiologist at the university of california 
riverside 
those are chemicals we want to keep on the market as opposed 
to using older more toxic and more persistent chemicals holt 
said 
something that would allow use of this new generation of safer 
herbicides is important said medley the usdas director of 
biotechnology and environmental coordination the benefit to 
society not just to the farmer can be great 
salquist said bromoxynil now is used only to kill weeds in 
fields of crops that resist it naturally including corn wheat and 
barley 
calgenes study was funded by rhone poulenc agrochemie the 
french firm that sells bromoxynil under the name buctril salquist 
said calgene and the french company obviously want to make money 
selling seeds for buctrilresistant crops and buctril itself but 
farmers and the environment also will benefit 
some genetically engineered plants produce fewer seeds but 
salquist said field tests of calgenes altered tomatoes showed no 
damage to their yields 
genetically engineered crops tolerate bromoxynil well so they 
should have higher yields than natural crops that are sprayed with 
other herbicides that slightly stunt crop growth while killing 
weeds stalker said 
the calgeneowned stoneville pedigreed seed co of mississippi 
the nations second leading producer of cotton seeds plans to 
market bromoxynilresistant cotton seeds by 1992 salquist said 
he estimated use of the seeds and bromoxynil should reduce the 
382 per acre cost of growing cotton in the mississippi delta by 
46 to 57 including reduced herbicide costs and increased crop 
yields 
one theoretical concern is whether bromoxynils breakdown 
products could be toxic to humans who eat plants sprayed with the 
herbicide holt said those chemicals occur naturally in corn 
wheat rye and oats which have natural resistance to the 
herbicide and are not known to be toxic 
stalker said he expects ongoing studies will show that 
bromoxynil is completely broken down in the resistant crops 
leaving no residue 
another concern is that weeds might become resistant to 
bromoxynil either by crossbreeding with the genetically engineered 
crops or because natural selection will favor survival of mutant 
weeds resistant to the herbicide while vulnerable weeds die 
medley said the usda found no risk of herbicideresistance being 
transferred sexually to weeds from tomatoes cotton and tobacco 
holt said she agreed with stalker that because bromoxynil breaks 
down in a couple weeks development of mutant bromoxynilresistant 
weed populations are less likely than with longerlived herbicides

a former uss stark sailor who can 
trace some of his mental problems to a missile attack that killed 
37 shipmates is unable to help defend himself on murder charges 
psychologists have told a judge 
walter thomas taylor remains incompetent to stand trial on 
charges he killed a woman and her daughter according to a report 
issued wednesday by psychologists at florida state hospital in 
chattahoochee for circuit judge r hudson olliff 
taylor 22 is charged with firstdegree murder in the august 
1987 slayings of paula smits and her 3yearold daughter amanda 
of mayport if convicted taylor could face the death penalty 
the killings occurred within days of the damaged starks return 
to mayport its home port 
the psychologists said they trace some of taylors problems to 
the may 1987 missile attack in the persian gulf on the stark the 
ship was hit by two missiles fired by an iraqi jet 
mr taylor did report experience of auditory and visual 
hallucinations involving seeing the faces of dead shipmates 
superimposed on the faces of others the report said 
taylor also experiences flashbacks to the stark explosion when 
he sees an explosion or killing on television the report said 
but the psychologists also said taylor understands the charges 
against him as well as the possible penalties and might be 
manipulating the system to avoid his trial

president reagan on thursday increased import 
duties on selected brazilian products in retaliation for what he 
said is brazils failure to protect us pharmaceuticals and fine 
chemicals from unauthorized copying 
the presidents proclamation said the new duties and the 
products to which they will apply will be published in the federal 
register 
an administration official speaking on condition he not be 
identified said the products would include paper products 
antibiotics microwave ovens television cameras and record players 
the order stems from hearings held by the office of the us 
trade representative 
reagan said brazils failure to provide patent protection 
permits the unauthorized copying of pharmaceutical products and 
processes that were invented by us firms 
he said he determined that the appropriate response was to 
impose increased duties of 100 percent on the selected products 
he said the increases would remain in effect for such time as 
is appropriate 
the trade representative is authorized to modify or terminate 
them

original blessing a primer in creation spirituality first 
published in 1983 is the rev matthew foxs best known work here 
are some excerpts 
 
patriarchal religions and partiarchal paradigms for religion 
have ruled the worlds civilizations for at least 3500 years the 
creationcentered tradition is feminist wisdom and eros count more 
than knowledge or control in such a spirituality together 
feminist women and men are invited to rebirth a religious vision 
that is more creationcentered and they can have fun doing it 
because play is a grace in such ritualmaking and rebirthing 
liberation movements are a fuller development of the cosmos sense 
of harmony balance justice and celebration this is why true 
spiritual liberation demands rituals of cosmic celebrating and 
healing which will in turn culminate in personal transformation 
and liberation of peoples 
 
fallredemption theology concentrates on sin yet sin after 
all is part of the anthropomorphizing of our existence for if the 
universe is twenty billion years old human sin is only as old as 
humanity or at most four million years old this means that 
fallredemption theology leaves out nineteen billion nine hundred 
nintysix million years of divineearthly history one result of 
this rather substantial lacuna is ironically the very 
trivializing of sin the inability to grasp sins like geocide and 
ecocide and biocide of which the human race is fully capable 
 
 
how much of the piety of jesus is my best friend or jesus 
saves comes perilously close to pure projection when in fact 
jesus like all the prophets taught peole to heal themselves and 
others to be instruments of new creation and to do works greater 
than he did how much of the gospel how much of the person and 
message and spirit of jesus christ has been lost by over 
concentration on fallredemption religion in the west 
 
 
the universe teaches universality without cosmic consciousness 
all universality is torn asunder and only parochialisms ego trips 
and with them institutionalized violence reign 
 
 
it will come as no surprise to anyone to suggest that the 
fallredemption spiritual tradition which has ignored creativity as 
our divine birthright and responsibility has not invested heavily 
in preaching to us about the motherhood of god the patriarchal 
tradition has pretty much ignored the implications of gods 
motherly side and of our responsibility to develop the mother in 
ourselves whether we are women or men maried or celibate 
heterosexual or homosexual 
 
 
the motherhood of god is celebrated wherever panentheism is 
celebrated where images of roundness and encircling take 
precedence over linear imaging in other words the work of 
every artists divine or humandivine is a maternal work at 
the same time that patriarchal society has neglected creativity and 
motherings fundamental spiritual and cultural values it has 
elevated sadomasochism to positions of glory in just about all of 
our institutions from medicine to education to religion to 
government to the military to sports to business

eastern airlines flight attendants wont join 
other unions in trying to block the 365 million sale of the 
northeast shuttle to real estate magnate donald trump an attorney 
said in court thursday 
union attorney arthur luby said the transport workers of america 
was attempting to negotiate a contract with trump for the 300 
flight attendants who work on the bostontonew yorktowashington 
shuttle the only profitable operation at eastern 
because of the very very difficult working conditions the 
union couldnt in good conscience go and do something that forces 
them to continue to work for eastern when they might have a chance 
to do something to improve their lot luby told us district 
judge barrington d parker at a hearing on the proposed deal 
two other unions the international association of machinists 
and aerospace workers and the air line pilots association have 
announced plans to seek a preliminary injunction to block the sale 
the two unions contend that the deal is part of an attempt by 
easterns parent texas air corp to undermine the strength of 
organized labor the company says it needs to sell the shuttle to 
get needed cash in order to save eastern from financial failure 
the unions have sought to use the mandatory bargaining 
provisions of the railway labor act to stop eastern from laying off 
employees and cutting operations by the financially troubled 
airline 
parker whose order barring eastern from laying off more than 
3000 employees was overturned last month by a federal appeals 
court gave the two unions until nov 21 to request a preliminary 
injunction 
although he suggested that the unions might be baying at the 
moon in light of the appeals court ruling on the layoffs parker 
said he considered the shuttle deal a discreet issue and i am 
prepared to hear arguments on a discreet issue 
the shuttle deal is scheduled to be completed on dec 15 parker 
indicated he would hold a hearing in the first two weeks of 
december a schedule that sets the stage for another eleventhhour 
court battle between eastern and the unions

the university of north dakota is under 
pressure from jewish leaders to educate students about the 
holocaust with some of the 5 million it was promised by a casino 
owner who collects nazi memorabilia 
ralph engelstad owner of the imperial palace hotel and casino 
in las vegas and a 1954 graduate of und pledged the money to 
support the schools hockey program 
engelstad has been under fire since it was revealed earlier this 
month that he had amassed a large collection of nazi war equipment 
and twice held theme parties celebrating nazi leader adolf hitlers 
birthday 
engelstad has apologized for the parties and offered to give his 
collection to the national holocaust memorial museum in washington 
morton ryweck regional director for the antidefamation league 
of bnai brith said wednesday that engelstads collection and 
parties had trivialized the holocaust 
engelstads apology would mean more if he would rededicate part 
of his 5 million endowment to education on the evils of nazism and 
the holocaust ryweck said in a letter to und president thomas 
clifford 
in the future there would be fewer people ignorant about it 
and fewer people who are apt to trivialize it as was done in las 
vegas with these parties ryweck said 
mara saponshevin a member of the grand forks jewilys hands kraft 
died in 1953

michael dukakis huge advantage over george 
bush among women has been all but wiped out as the republican 
candidate has gained support among both men and women a study 
indicated thursday 
bush has picked up support from women along with his gains among 
men due to a combination of factors said ethel klein a columbia 
university political science professor who worked on a study for 
the business and professional womens clubs 
between may and october the gender gap between the 
preferences of men and women narrowed significantly women gave 
dukakis an 18point lead in a may cbsnew york times survey but by 
october 810 they were favoring bush at 44 percent to 41 percent 
for dukakis 
men meanwhile favored dukakis by 1 percentage point in may and 
bush by 8 points in the oct 810 survey when they were split 41 
percent for dukakis and 49 percent for bush 
by september when the general election began in earnest the 
reublicans took control of the campaign agenda leading to a 
general shift in preference toward bush klein said in a written 
report 
she said the bush campaign was able to attract women by 
addressing economic concerns including health care work and 
family responsibilities and questions of values and ideology at a 
time when dukakis did nothing to lure voters along those lines 
however klein noted the same message was pulling men to the 
bush corner at the same time 
the gender gap is not going to make a difference in a race in 
which all the dynamics are going one way in this race all the 
dynamics are going republican she told a news conference 
these women are not voting for george bush because they have 
become convinced that reagans economic policies worked and 
therefore we should stay the course klein contended in a summary 
of the survey many women who are economically vulnerable are 
supporting george bush because they have no sense of where the 
democrats would lead them 
the gender gap that existed at the end of the primary season was 
a factor of party affiliation dislike by women of the reagan 
administration record economic circumstances and womens greater 
uncertainties about the nations economic future the study said 
at that time dukakis was mostly unknown and bush was not well 
liked the study said 
after the summer nominating conventions the kinder gentler 
george bush emerged in the phrase he used in his acceptance speech 
to describe his vision of america 
this new persona revealed a man who played with his 
granddaughter in the morning and reviewed the troops after lunch 
men really liked this george bush and decided to support him for 
president the survey indicated 
women were less enamored with this george bush than men but 
they did not dislike bush any more than they had and his negative 
ratings among women dropped 6 points between may and september 
going from 34 to 28 percent 
by september when character emerged as an issue male bush 
supporters who strongly liked him and disliked dukakis accounted 
for 31 percent of his support compared to 21 percent among women 
that compared to 9 percent strong support among men and 7 percent 
among women in may the figures grew to 36 percent among men and 28 
percent among women in october 
meanwhile dukakis was strongly liked by 19 percent of the men 
and 19 percent of the women in may that went to 20 percent among 
men and 18 percent among women in september and 22 percent among 
both men and women in october

lloyd bentsen went on the 
counterattack against republican critics thursday with the 
backslapping help of jesse jackson and other democratic allies on a 
television hookup with college students in 11 states 
michael dukakis vice presidential running mate took friendly 
questions on more than a dozen issues from gun control to welfare 
reform during the hourlong session several of the student 
questioners selected in advance by the bentsen campaign 
identified themselves as college democrats 
at most of the campuses linked by satellite television the 
texas senator found a partisan backer hosting a rally 
jackson who was at memphis state university with sen al gore 
dtenn told students the 1988 campaign was not about dukakis 
lack of passion but bushs lack of compassion and quayles lack of 
understanding 
said gore you know george bush thought sept 7 was pearl 
harbor day and he thinks the election has already taken place 
bentsen laid out the same positions he has stressed in his stump 
speeches 
on gun control he said i wouldnt be on the ticket with a 
fella who was going to take my shotgun away from me 
he said republicans have talked vaguely of a thousand points 
of light and a gentler america while savaging the electorate with 
vicious negative campaigning 
as the microphone switched from city to city bentsen received 
warm welcomes from such democratic luminaries as former kentucky 
gov martha layne collins michael kennedy son of the late sen 
robert f kennedy dny and actor rob lowe 
bentsens press secretary mike mccurry said the event cost 
about 14000 and that about 3000 students took part he said the 
satellite feed was made available to tv stations nationwide 
obviously were delighted with the format mccurry said 
its a great way to campaign in 11 states simultaneously with 
local reporters at each site 
bentsens popularity on campuses as caught his campaign staff 
somewhat by surprise some students in the audience at stanford 
university had camped out wednesday to hear him speak thursday 
lloyd bentsen is bmoc big man on campus mccurry said 
speaking earlier to workers at a general electric plant in 
louisville ky bentsen promised to respond to republican campaign 
charges until election day nov 8 
im going to take myself on an assignment he said every 
time they issue a falsehood im going to take them on and 
straighten that one out 
bentsen said the gop was lowering the level of the campaign by 
distorting such issues as the prisoner furlough program in 
massachusetts where dukakis is governor 
we have seen the republicans running on symbols and twisting 
the facts he said 
bentsen a world war ii veteran said he took it as a personal 
insult to me that the republicans were accusing dukakis of being 
weak on defense 
were going to tell them that you cant devalue the currency 
of our democracy he said

a moderately strong earthquake jarred 
residents of parts of maine and new hampshire on thursday but no 
property damage was reported 
it shook the whole house pictures on the wall everything in 
it went flopping back and forth said 78yearold leo perron a 
resident of this glacial plains town near the quakes epicenter 
i thought it was a load of lumber falling said sandy 
endicott a secretary at ph chadbourne amp co lumber yard in 
bethel maine 
george nickerson a maintenance supervisor at chadbournes said 
the temblor wiggled the maintenance garage 
the weston observatory in weston mass said the quake measured 
40 on the richter scale enough to cause moderate damage the us 
geological survey in menlo park calif said the temblor measured 
39 on the richter scale 
walter anderson director of the maine geological survey said 
the difference in the two readings could be regarded as 
insignificant 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude thus a reading of 45 reflects an earthquake 10 times 
stronger than one of 35the san francisco earthquake of 1906 
which occurred before the richter scale was devised has been 
estimated at 83 
thursdays quake struck at 909 am and was centered five miles 
northeast of berlin the weston observatory said 
authorities said rumblings and booms were reported all the way 
from central new hampshire to yarmouth on the maine coast to 
augusta in the southcentral part of maine 
police in berlin received more than 100 telephone calls thursday

the state department on thursday criticized 
two americans who were arrested in laos earlier this month while 
trying to obtain information about any american servicemen who may 
still be held in indochina 
james copp of hampstead nc and donna longof jacksonville 
nc were arrested on oct 3 after entering laos for the purpose 
of advertising a 24 million reward for the safe return of a live 
american war prisoner department spokesman charles redman said 
we understand the motives behind this kind of effort redman 
said but our view is that this could jeopardize ongoing uslao 
cooperation to resolve the powmia issue 
we also are concerned that any reward reinforces the 
perception widely held in indochina particularly among refugees 
that information and remains are items of barter 
the spokesman said there is no evidence that the previous 
attempts to obtain information about american pows through the 
offer of rewards has produced positive results 
copp and ms long were arrested in a remote area of laos for 
illegally entering the country and later were taken to the capital 
vientiane where they were reported monday by a us consular 
official to have been well treated and well fed redman said 
he said the us government is asking laotian authorities for a 
determination on whether they will be charged or released 
the united states is deeply committed to the return of any and 
all americans who may still be held in indochina we believe the 
issue can only be resolved through governmenttogovernment 
cooperation which has recently increased in the case of laos 
redman said 
he said a team of lao officials next week will visit an army 
laboratory in hawaii where remains of returned american servicemen 
are identified in addition us experts soon will visit a site in 
laos where americans are believed to have died in a plane crash 
during the war 
that visit will occur after the same experts carry out a joint 
investigation in vietnam on the whereabouts of missing americans 
copp and ms long reportedly were aboard a boat that floated to 
the lao side of the mekong river they were said to be attempting 
to float packets containing reward notices written on us dollar 
bills and other paper currency the river borders on or cuts 
through laos cambodia and vietnam where a combined total of 
about 2400 americans are unaccounted for 
on wednesday three vietnam veterans said they were prepared to 
risk arrest in laos to publicize their claim that the us 
government ignores evidence that some americans captured in 
indochina are still alive 
this government this administration has failed miserably in 
their stated highest national priority the prisonerofwar 
issue said ted sampley chairman of the national steering 
committee for american war veterans a private veterans lobby 
based in kinston nc

a special exhibit of works by contemporary 
artist jasper johns that premiered in italy last summer opens this 
weekend at the philadelphia museum of art for its only us showing 
but the exhibit doesnt focus on his familiar images of numbers 
targets and american flags 
jasper johns works since 1974 which runs from oct 23 
through jan 8 1989 is a survey of johns recent work the 
exhibit moves from the crosshatch paintings of 1974 the 
artists first purely abstract canvases to his more expressive 
personal imagery of the 1980s culminating in the quartet of 
paintings known as the seasons 
the exhibition comprises 21 paintings in oil and encaustic a 
process in which the color is suspended in hot wax to produce a 
vivid soft surface also included in the exhibit are 10 drawings 
and watercolors and a book of prints created in collaboration with 
playwright samuel beckett 
the exhibit was compiled by the museums 20thcentury art 
curator mark rosenthal and johns himself 
rosenthal called it the first major exhibit of johns most 
recent work and said the goal of the exhibit was to isolate the 
new work from the more familiar the works come from the artists 
personal collection the tate gallery the museum of modern art 
and the private collections of philip johnson si newhouse jr 
robert and jane meyerhoff 
the johns exhibit won grand prize in june at the 43rd venice 
biennale exhibit the venetian competition founded in 1895 is the 
oldest and most famous continuing international exhibition of 
contemporary art in the world it is held every other year 
susan larsen an art historian and curator of the whitneys 
permanent collection called johns an unqualified genius 
johns is above all a philosopherpainter larsen said she 
said johns paintings show the clear demarcation from the realm of 
life and objects and the illusory world of painting 
rosenthal said johns astounded the new york art world in the 
1950s because he painted subjects in a calculated way rather than 
indulging in the emotional abstraction then popular 
he paints with this incredible kind of care and juiciness 
said rosenthal he played with peoples expectations 
the exhibit in philadelphia is grouped chronologically 
following johns movement from abstract to figures to shadows 
playing on symbols of death the works use the art medium to 
comment on the creation of art over time layering the medium with 
mirrors and images of the artist 
born in augusta ga in 1930 johns attended the university of 
south carolina after a twoyear stint in the army in japan johns 
arrived in new york city in 1952 where he became friends with 
abstract artists robert rauschenberg minimalist composer john 
cage dadaist marcelle duchamp and samuel beckett 
in the 1950s johns produced a series of painting called the 
target paintings in which he chose graphic images a target 
flag or numeral to reflect the very nature of those images as 
objects 
johns extended into sculpture creating a series of bronze and 
sculpmental works of beer cans bulbs and flashlights by the early 
1960s he had begun to blur the line between painting and 
sculpture inserting objects into slits in the canvas and applying 
sculpmetal directly to the surface of the work

police beat and briefly detained 
surinames military strongman desi bouterse and seven members of 
his entourage after mistaking them for common criminals the 
surinamese embassy said thursday 
however a newspaper quoted a police officer as saying the 
foreign visitors were not beaten 
although he stepped down from the presidency after a civilian 
took over this year bouterse remains surinames army commander and 
de facto leader he was in brazil as head of a trade mission 
suriname lodged a formal complaint with the brazilian 
government embassy official ronald samichar said by telephone from 
brasilia the capital suriname a former dutch colony on the 
northeastern coast of south america shares its southern border 
with brazil 
about 20 state policemen stopped bouterse and seven members of 
his mission wednesday afternoon as the group strolled along a busy 
street in downtown sao paulo samichar said some members of the 
group were acting as bodyguards and carrying guns 
bouterse and the others at first showed diplomatic credentials 
but police apparently didnt understand the dutchspeaking 
surinamese and took them for common criminals the embassy official 
said portuguese is the language of brazil 
the police punched and slapped the surinamese officials

the government will allow the remains 
of premier imre nagy who was executed and secretly buried after 
leading the 1956 uprising to be reburied in a marked grave a 
politburo member said 
whatever the circumstances of the death someone who has lived 
in this country deserved to be buried in a marked grave janos 
berecz in a television interview wednesday 
nagy defense minister pal paleter and other leaders of the 
popular anticommunist revolt were executed in june 1958 and buried 
in anonymous graves 
berecz a member of the politburo the hungarian communist 
partys supreme body said no date has been set for the burials 
which he called a painful and timeconsuming task 
the remains must be exhumed and an agreement reached with the 
families concerned berecz said adding that the families would 
be free to make their own funeral arrangements 
in an interview with the dutch news agency netherlands press 
association in september berecz proposed a monument to nagy as a 
gesture of humanity and reconciliation 
the government has granted a partial amnesty to some leaders of 
the 1956 revolt but has ruled out rehabilitation for nagy and his 
associates 
the amnesty covers the revolutionaries sentenced to prison for 
crimes against the state or those whose death penalty had been 
commuted to imprisonment but the pardon does not extend to those 
convicted of treason or espionage or convicted of murder robbery 
or causing danger to the public the official mti news agency said 
no figures were available on how many of the pardoned are still 
alive 
on oct 23 1956 a popular anticommunist revolution broke out 
in hungary a new coalition government under nagy declared the 
country neutral and withdrew from the warsaw treaty organization 
but janos kadar one of nagys ministers declared a 
countergovernment and asked the soviet union for military support 
soviet forces suppressed the revolution and nagy and some of his 
ministers were abducted and executed kadar became premier and 
nearly 200000 hungarians fled the country

reagan said that is a possibility but it would not be one of 
us just withdrawing it would be one of being no longer needed 
the united states has long had about 42000 troops stationed in 
south korea under a mutual defense pact 
gaston sigur assistant secretary of state for east asian and 
pacific affairs asked after the meeting about reagans remarks 
said the two presidents did not discuss the subject of troop 
reduction 
we are not talking about anything taking place at any 
particular time sigur said we have no intention of anything 
of that sort 
we would have to have a firm belief on the part of our country 
and the republic of korea that the threat from north korea was 
over he said that threat is not over we have certainly no 
intention of changing our policy of maintaining our ground forces 
in south korea 
korean embassy children and roh supporters waved flags as roh 
entered blair house the presidential guest quarters before 
meeting reagan in nearby lafayette park about 50 people staged a 
noisy demonstration against rohs government and the us military 
presence in south korea the demonstrators oriental drums 
clashing cymbals and chants of roh taewoo out out out us 
troops out out out were audible as the visiting presidential 
party entered the white house 
choi sungil chairman of the united movement for democracy and 
unification in korea said the demonstration was sponsored jointly 
by his group and two others young koreans united and the coalition 
of young koreans for reunification of korea 
when asked if he detected any indications that the need for the 
troops was lessening reagan replied i couldnt put my finger on 
some definite signs but i can just say seeing other areas of the 
world that tensions have lessened if theres a possibility of 
that yes that should happen 
asked whether he saw a greater prospect of this than when he 
took office eight years ago reagan said there have been a great 
many changes over eight years and i think its possible to see 
some things that we couldnt foresee then 
he said the us role in relations between south and north korea 
is to be of any help we can 
tensions on the korean peninsula have been almost constant for 
more than 30 years and roh seeks accommodation with his countrys 
communistruled neighbor to the north 
roh proposed a summit meeting between the two koreas in a speech 
tuesday at the united nations general assembly he called for both 
countries to meet with the united states the soviet union china 
and japan to lay the groundwork for an era of peace and prosperity 
in northeast asia 
the state department welcomed rohs imaginative and 
constructive policy of reconciliation and accommodation although 
it did not endorse any specific proposal 
on wednesday north koreas deputy foreign minister kang sok 
ju spoke to the general assembly and proposed creating a new 
nation out of north and south korea with a shared military command 
and a national assembly with equal representation from both sides 
state department spokesman charles redman said wednesday the 
administration has no plans to remove north korea from the list of 
countries that us officials say engage in international terrorism 
he added that north koreas wellestablished track record of 
belligerence and state terror makes a very cautious approach to 
this issue necessary 
but redman reaffirmed that the united states is reviewing its 
policy toward north korea following the resumption of talks between 
the two koreas at panmunjom and the show of north korean restraint 
during the seoul olympics last month 
there had been concern that north korea would attempt to disrupt 
the olympics 
a state department official who briefed reporters on tuesday on 
condition of anonymity said the administration will probably have 
an announcement on policy changes toward north korea in a few 
days 
we certainly want to be responsive to president rohs policy 
changes and what he wants to do the official said

the senate sent legislation to president 
reagan on thursday that alters the nations trademark laws and 
makes it easier for companies to sue each other over false 
advertising 
the measure sent to the white house on a voice vote would 
allow businesses to protect a trademark for three years even if the 
product it signifies is not yet for sale currently companies can 
only use a trademark if the product is already available to 
customers a requirement that critics say is often ignored by small 
firms 
some courts have interpreted the existing trademark law to bar 
companies from issuing false descriptions of their own products 
the new law makes it illegal for anyone to misrepresent his or 
hers or another persons goods services or commercial activities

the majority of the village council in 
this tiny community has resigned leaving the board without a 
quorum and the hamlet without a way to pay its bills 
its been dumped in my lap said elizabeth vanhore one of 
three remaining council members following last weeks resignations 
four members quit in part because of a family dispute with no 
quorum the council is now unable to conduct the business of the 
village which is 25 miles southwest of traverse city 
but vanhorn said she and remaining trustees emmet moore and 
wynott clapp will meet soon to appoint a fourth council member who 
in turn will join them in selecting a fifth and restoring a quorum 
what we will do to be fair is advertise to anybody who wants 
to serve on the council that they send in a resume to me i 
guess she said the council should be able to pay its october 
bills and resume business as usual by the time of its next 
scheduled meeting nov 10 vanhorn said 
the standstill began during the oct 13 council meeting when 
trustee ted kline resigned because he was moving to neighboring 
cleon township village president don myers and trustees vickie 
mathis and dennis collins quit for different reasons 
it just comes down to the difficulties weve had on the 
council said myers reached at his hardware store 
things began simmering last year when state police investigated 
allegations of missing village records and 2000 worth of gasoline 
and oil no one ever was charged 
in march linda collins defeated incumbent betty collins her 
sisterinlaw and dennis collinss wife for the clerktreasurers 
job myers said the bad blood resulting from that election and the 
state police investigation left the council in constant turmoil 
it got quite personal on a lot of this stuff he said i 
just didnt want to be part of it any more 
what if no one applies for the openings 
dont say that to me vanhorn said

the british government introduced legislation 
thursday to abolish the right of suspects in northern ireland to 
remain silent under police questioning ending a centuriesold 
pillar of british jurisprudence 
the latest measure in britains crackdown on the irish 
republican army provoked renewed outcries that historic civil 
liberties are crumbling in britain and followed wednesdays 
government ban on broadcast interviews with members of the outlawed 
ira and 10 other militant groups in northern ireland 
in the house of commons the government of prime minister 
margaret thatcher put forward legislation to end the right to 
silence in northern ireland and said it also planned to introduce 
similar restrictions in england and wales the measure is expected 
to become law by january 
members of terrorist organizations are being trained to refuse 
to respond to questions put by the police and this technique is 
increasingly being adopted by those suspected of serious crimes 
including racketeering northern ireland secretary tom king said 
justice is being thwarted he said 
at present courts are not allowed to take into consideration 
that a suspect refused to answer police questions 
king said under the new law a judge will be able to draw from 
silence whatever inferences appear proper 
this means a court can regard an accuseds refusal to answer 
police as an indication of guilt 
king said the change will be aimed particularly at suspects who 
refuse to respond when arrested and then come up in court with a 
defense they could have put forward immediately such as detailed 
alibis 
the new measure was virtually certain of passage in the 
650member commons where mrs thatchers conservatives have a huge 
101seat overall majority 
opposition labor party deputy leader roy hattersley said the 
right to silence was an essential element of a free society 
to abolish the right to silence is to place a terrible risk 
against those who are verbally inadequate those who are afraid 
who simply are cautious and wish to speak to a solicitor lawyer 
before saying anything said hattersley 
under a historic 1966 ruling in the case of miranda vs arizona 
the us supreme court said police must tell suspects before 
interrogating them that they have a right to remain silent to 
confer with a lawyer before answering any questions and to have a 
lawyer provided if they cannot afford to hire one the court said 
such warnings are needed to protect suspects privilege against 
selfincrimination assued by the us constitutions fifth 
amendment 
like the broadcast ban the new measure was part of a security 
package promised by the thatcher government after an upsurge of 
killings and bombings by the ira since this spring 
mrs thatcher hinted in the commons on thursday that the 
government might soon require election candidates to swear an oath 
renouncing violence if we go ahead with that we will do it by 
legislation and will do it at the earliest possible opportunity 
she said 
in addition the government plans to introduce laws this winter 
to freeze and seize the funds of guerrilla organizations 
home secretary douglas hurd said thursday that a report on the 
right to silence in england and wales was due in the new year and 
legislation will be brought forward at the earliest possible 
opportunity 
nothing was said about scotland which would require special 
amending legislation under its separate legal system 
the latest announcements provoked fears that the thatcher 
government was sacrificing democratic fundamentals in its battle 
against the mainly catholic iras violent campaign to end british 
rule in protestantdominated northern ireland 
northern ireland is being used as a laboratory for draconian 
measures to be used later in other parts of the united kingdom 
said laborite kevin mcnamara 
the republic of ireland where the ira is also banned already 
forbids broadcast interviews with members of the ira or its legal 
political front sinn fein and restricts suspects right to 
silence 
sinn fein said the latest british move brought mrs thatchers 
government closer to the administrations of chile and south africa 
the right to silence is enshrined in the legal systems of 
most of the worlds civilized countries sinn fein said in a 
statement 
in britain the right dates from the 17th century and was 
designed to protect illeducated suspects from unfairly 
incriminating themselves 
violence cannot be defeated by injustice said sarah 
spencer general secretary of the national council for civil 
liberties removing the right to silence amounts to an attack on 
one of the cornerstones of our system of justice that the burden 
of proof is on the prosecution 
britains human rights record in northern ireland has come under 
consistent scrutiny 
in 1976 the european commission of human rights ruled that 
interrogation techniques by northern ireland police then 
contravened stipulations against inhuman and degrading treatment 
and torture 
techniques which police say they have since abandoned included 
hooding of ira suspects under interrogation standing them against 
walls and depriving them of food and sleep 
in june amnesty international said there were inadequate 
safeguards in northern ireland against unlawful killings by 
security forces the human rights organization called for an 
inquiry into allegations that northern ireland police the royal 
ulster constabulary operated a shoottokill rather than 
capture or wound policy against the ira in 1982 
legal rules in northern ireland took a fundamental depature from 
the those of the rest of the united kingdom when nojury onejudge 
courts were introduced in the province in 1973 because of the 
difficulty of getting frightened juries to convict or witnesses to 
testify at ira trials

jim bakkers longtime bodyguard disputed 
his former boss and testified the television evangelist pushed to 
get himself bonuses as a trial ended thursday in ptls 52 million 
suit against its founder 
us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds did not issue an immediate 
verdict in the case which he began hearing in september but he 
indicated he would award a compromise judgment 
i am going to prepare a fair and just adjustment between these 
parties he said as the hearing closed 
in bankruptcy court ive seen suit after suit like this one 
and never a dime collected reynolds said if you cant get 1 
million why look for 2 million 
so if you find the court a little soft in the amounts then 
you can understand why said reynolds who is hearing the case 
because he is presiding over ptls chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization 
the attorneys have until thursday to submit any further 
information or pleas reynolds plans to present draft findings 
within 10 days of that and the attorneys will have another 10 days 
to submit responses before a final verdict 
ptl presented testimony and evidence that bakker and his wife 
tammy received about 95 million in bonuses salaries and other 
compensation from 1983 to 1987 but bakker has said he would not be 
able to pay a judgment against him 
the ministry is charging the bakkers and an aide david 
taggart with mismanaging the ministry into ruin and receiving 
excessive salaries and spending ministry money for personal gain 
ptl received bankruptcy protection in june 1987 three months 
after bakker resigned following a sexandhushmoney scandal 
involving former new york church secretary jessica hahn 
bakker testified his salary and bonuses were approved by the 
ministrys board of directors and that he never requested bonuses 
and was not present during meetings in which they were discussed 
but don hardister who served as ptls head of security and 
bakkers personal bodyguard during his 11 years there said 
thursday during rebuttal questioning by ptl attorney tom white he 
was often present outside of board meetings where he heard 
discussion of bonuses between mr bakker and david taggart 
i remember one occasion where jim was very emphatic that david 
ensure mrs bakker receive a bonus hardister told reynolds 
also during rebuttal questioning thursday dana cadwell an 
accountant in ptls finance office testified that an external 
audit in august 1984 showed abuse of the ministrys cash advance 
system 
she said executives of ptl which operated a satellite 
television network and christian theme park at fort mill failed to 
repay advances of up to 10000 
the audit recommended that we establish a maximum employee 
advance amount she said many of the outstanding cash advances 
were over six months old 
bakker said thursday as he left the courthouse that hes glad 
the trial is over 
after two years of what ive been going through nothing is 
humbling my faith is in god i believe god will bring me through 
the real point in this case is that it was built on an irs 
document that is erroneous it has never been proven its a 
preliminary report that is not gospel that is disturbing to me 
bakker said 
the defense has argued that ptls records have been dispersed as 
a result of its bankruptcy its division into separate forprofit 
and church entities and investigations by a federal grand jury and 
the internal revenue service making it impossible for the bakkers 
to justify every payment they received 
as i begin to find the bits and pieces i become angry the 
documentation is there if we have to appeal it were ready to 
go he said

federal agents testified thursday they saw 
three polygamist clan members brandishing and at times firing 
weapons during a standoff that ended in the fatal shooting of a 
state corrections officer 
testimony on the opening day of a preliminary hearing for the 
three charged with second degree murder in the officers death 
centered on the 13day standoff with police at the groups marion 
farm last january 
third circuit judge maurice jones will decide after hearing 
prosecution testimony whether there is sufficient evidence to bind 
the three over for trial 
much of the testimony thursday duplicated that given during an 
earlier trial in federal court in which the three were convicted of 
a variety of charges related to the jan 16 bombing of a nearby 
mormon chapel and the ensuing stalemate with 100 officers 
clan ringleader addam swapp 27 his brother jonathan swapp 21 
and john timothy singer 22 have pleaded innocent lt fred house 
a 35yearold police dog handler died jan 28 during the 
siegeending shootout 
house was slain as he was ordering two police dogs to subdue the 
swapp brothers as they walked back to the main farmhouse after 
milking a goat evidence presented during the federal trial 
indicated singer fired the fatal bullet from a 30caliber carbine 
the judge overruled objections by defense attorneys that 
testimony about events leading up to the shooting was irrelevant 
and inflammatory assistant us attorney creighton horton said the 
questions were relevant because they showed continuing armed 
resistance by the defendants 
fbi agent richard intellini testified that addam swapp 
shouldered and pointed his rifle toward officers on jan 28 moments 
before house was shot 
intellini said house stood in the doorway of another home on the 
compound and tried in vain to urge a police dog to subdue the swapp 
brothers 
when the dog barked addam swapp looked over his shoulder twice 
the second time raising his rifle and pointing it toward the 
lawmen intellini said adding that jonathan swapp started to slip 
his rifle off his shoulder 
intellini said he then fired through a window which shattered 
and obscured his view after he fired he said he heard several 
rounds hitting the house and wood splintering soon after he found 
house wounded 
fbi agent mike kelly testified he was at a surveillance post in 
a nearby home on jan 22 when he saw a window open in the singer 
home and a rifle protrude then heard a gunshot and saw a muzzle 
flash in the direction of the surveillance post 
under crossexamination kelly said the shot also was in the 
general direction of a bank of lights set up by law officers to 
illuminate the clans compound 
agent devlyon barker said that on jan 25 he was taking photos 
of the compound when jonathan swapp pointed a rifle in his 
direction others testified of similar instances 
the three defendants and vickie singer 45 mother of john 
timothy singer and of addam swapps two wives were convicted in 
us district court in may on charges related to the bombing and 
siege addam swapp was sentenced to 15 years in prison mrs singer 
to five years and jonathan swapp and john timothy singer to 10year 
terms 
addam swapp who was seriously wounded in the shootout has said 
the bombing was ordered by god as a sign of the impending collapse 
of the mormon church and all government and that it would trigger 
the return of family patriarch john singer slain by police nine 
years before for resisting arrest 
the clan maintained singer was killed in a churchstate 
conspiracy and that the family had been harassed for years by 
police and neighbors

one of the 41 million engines that powered 
the space shuttle discovery into orbit last month developed a small 
coolingsystem leak and will be replaced for the ships next flight 
in february the national aeronautics and space administration said 
thursday 
layers of nickel and copper from which the engines combustion 
chamber is fabricated were found to have separated in one area 
said jerry berg a spokesman at nasas marshall space flight center 
in alabama the leak resulted 
it is too early to tell whether the engine change will affect 
the flight schedule he said 
the problem was found during a postflight inspection wednesday 
at the kennedy space center in florida the engine will be removed 
and sent back to the manufacturer the rocketdyne division of 
rockwell international corp for repair 
its not possible to tell precisely when it happened said 
berg pressure tests were conducted before he flight and 
indicated the separation was not present 
berg said the leak did not show up on any of the instruments 
that monitored discoverys performance on the first flight since 
the challenger accident in january 1986 it only became apparent 
once we got into detailed inspection he said 
discovery completed its fourday onehour mission without a 
hitch landing at edwards air force base in california 
nasa officials said workers preparing discoverys sister ship 
for a late november flight will inspect an engine component on 
atlantis to make sure it was not damaged during preflight testing 
at the stennis space center in bay st louis miss 
officials were uncertain how the developments would effect 
launch dates for atlantis scheduled to fly no earlier than nov 23 
the atlantis inspection was ordered after an engine being tested 
for use on space shuttle columbia sustained damage said conrad 
nagel who is in charge of preparations for the second 
postchallenger mission 
we have no reason to believe weve got a problem nagel 
said but we had a problem on another engine and theyve asked us 
to go back and look at it on ours 
space shuttles are propelled into orbit by two solidfuel rocket 
boosters that drop off when they are spent and by three engines 
that are fed supercool liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen from the 
shuttles huge fuel tank 
nasa meanwhile appointed a board to investigate the fire that 
damaged the magellan spacecraft during a power systems check on 
monday night the fire resulted when a technician for spacecraft 
builder martin marietta corp forced an electrical plug into the 
wrong receptacle 
the damage to the spacecraft which is to conduct an eightmonth 
mapping mission of venus is not expected to affect the april 1989 
launch date

catholic intellectuals nationwide are 
demanding restoration of the outlawed solidarity trade union 
loosening of party control on the economy and free access to the 
mass media it was announced thursday 
the demands from representatives of 49 clubs of catholic 
intelligentsia were listed in anticipation of promised roundtable 
talks between the opposition and authorities but a club spokesman 
said a deep impasse with officials was making the talks seem 
increasingly remote 
about 100 representatives of the clubs one in each of polands 
49 provinces adopted the statement at a twoday meeting in the 
southwestern city of wroclaw oct 1516 said jacek moskwa 
spokesman for the warsaw club 
the clubs each of which is autonomous represent about 18000 
lay catholics nationwide and are considered centers of moderate 
opposition to polands communist government three members of the 
warsaw club declined an invietation from prime minister mieczyslaw 
f rakowski to join his new government 
the warsaw clubs president andrzej stelmachowski is acting as 
mediator in setting up the roundtable talks promised aug 31 by 
interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak to solidarity leader lech 
walesa 
but moskwa said it was uncertain when the talks originally 
scheduled for monday might start on tuesday the government said 
they have been postponed until after oct 24 
as of today everything is in a very deep impasse moskwa 
said 
the sides disagree in their views of the roundtable with the 
opposition insisting on a place for important decisions while 
the government wants a discussion forum moskwa said this is 
the basic difference 
the statement passed by the club representatives said the talks 
should lead to principal changes in the shape of public 
life 
we demand restoration of a legal framework of trade union 
pluralism including foremost the legalization of solidarity 
said the first of the statements nine demands 
fulfilling this postulate is an essential condition for real 
reform of political and economic life 
another demand was for separating political authority from 
economic authority meaning the communist party would abandon 
control of enterprises and party that loyalists in the 
nomenklatura would cease to get management jobs automatically 
the statement also called for 
unrestrained access by democratic social groups churches 
and religious communities to television and radio 
freedom to form political organizations and economic social 
and cultural associations 
a system of parliamentary democracy with separation of powers 
between the executive legislature and judiciary 
legalizing private schools and separating state activities in 
education and culture from the ideology of atheism the school 
should not spread atheism the statement said 
an end to all official forms of political indoctrination of 
youth and the right of free and democratic social activity for 
young people 
lifting of a 1957 law allowing legal abortions 
democratization and selfgovernment in rural life with equal 
treatment for private cooperative and state farms

fmc corp the manufacturer of the bradley 
fighting vehicle has been accused by former employees of 
overcharging the army for parts for the armored troop carrier abc 
news reported thursday 
by last december the chicagobased company had delivered about 
3100 bradleys at a cost of 10 billion critics of the vehicle 
most of which have been stationed in europe say it doesnt work 
and is unsafe 
a report aired on abc world news tonight said the network has 
obtained documents from the company showing that there were 
problems with billing for certain parts on the bradley 
sometimes the fmc simply didnt tell the army what the prices 
were other times the prices billed were too high abc reported 
a man who worked for the government and was assigned by the army 
to audit the cost of bradley parts told abc theres been times 
that i have caught some excessive prices quite a few excessive 
prices but theres a lot of things i couldnt do anything about 
it 
a woman who was in charge of parts billing for the bradley told 
abc that fmc executives often ordered her to inflate the price of a 
part 
sometimes i would take it to an engineer and he would say oh 
just fix this price i would go to another manager oh add 50 
percent give us this price said the woman who requested 
anonymity 
she sometimes was told to raise the price as much as 100 
percent she said it was my job i had to do it 
an engineer at fmc told abc the company overbilled the army from 
the beginning sometimes tripling the price of parts 
when production of the bradley began in 1980 the estimated cost 
of each vehicle was 548000 according to a document issued by the 
deputy chief of staff for the army in 1984 the cost per bradley 
was frozen by contract at 12 million where it remains today 
abc news said fmc declined to discuss on camera their pricing 
procedures for the bradley but the company did provide written 
answers to questions submitted over the phone the network said 
the company stated that appropriate markups are added to 
parts and that it does not condone and would not tolerate 
illegal activities or actions violating fair business practices 
in july the company announced that the army had awarded it a 
289 million contract for continued production of the bradley at 
the companys plant in santa clara calif 
congressional army and fmc records show numerous mechanical and 
electrical components on the vehicle have failed repeatedly in 
recent years last december pentagon officials told congress they 
planned to thicken the armor on the vehicle to make it 50 percent 
more survivable in battle

rep pat swindall acting as his own attorney for 
his trial next week on federal perjury charges told a judge 
thursday during a pretrial hearing he may put himself on the 
witness stand 
swindall was indicted monday on 10 counts of lying to a grand 
jury during a money laundering investigation he is being given an 
expedited trial at his own request to seek a verdict before the 
nov 8 general election in which he faces democrat ben jones 
jury selection is to get under way friday morning in preparation 
for the trial 
the 38yearold twoterm republican has said he is defending 
himself because no other attorney could prepare for the case in 
such a short period of time 
swindall told us district judge robert l vining there may 
be some awkwardness should i choose to testify and said that with 
the judges permission he would enlist the aid of another attorney 
to lead his testimony 
the indictment stems from negotiations swindall undertook last 
year with atlanta businessman charles lechasney to finance a 
mortgage loan for his 12 million home 
lechasney an acquaintance from republican circles introduced 
him to michael mullaney an undercover internal revenue service 
agent posing as a financier as part of a nationwide 
moneylaundering investigation 
secretlymade government tapes showed swindall continued 
pursuing the loan after being told it might be financed with 
laundered drug money 
he accepted a 150000 check but returned it uncashed three days 
later saying he was suspicious of lechasneys business dealings 
the indictment charges that swindall lied before the grand jury 
in saying there were never any discussions about the possibility of 
drug money involvement in the deal

thursday threatened to add to south africas already extensive news 
media curbs unless journalists stopped quoting the propaganda of 
tyrants 
botha speaking at an election rally did not elaborate on what 
measures he was considering nor did he specify the tyrants

national congress guerrilla group 
he said if the media did not exercise self restraint the 
government might introduce measures similar to those britain has 
placed on the irish republican army the british government on 
wednesday banned broadcast interviews with members of the outlawed 
ira and 10 other militant groups in northern ireland 
under existing media restrictions in south africa it is illegal 
to broadcast statements by the anc without government approval the

terrorist organization and does not interview its members

board said he hoped the talks would help end south africas 
isolation in the sport south africa is barred from international 
competition because of its apartheid policies of racial segregation 
botha said the anc was trying to appear reasonable in order to 
stab you in the back with a dagger 
there are still politically blind moles in the country who 
fail to see this botha said in an apparent reference to craven 
the anc based in lusaka zambia wages a bombing and sabotage 
campaign in its bid to oust south africas whiteled government

the leftist government enacted a 
30day state of emergency thursday that restricts civil liberties 
and unauthorizes storm news in order to prepare for a hurricane 
heading toward nicaragua 
the announcement of the presidential decree came as hurricane 
joan lumbered in the caribbean with 105 mph winds more than 200 
miles from the nicaraguan coastal town of bluefields 
nicaragua has been under a state of emergency for most of the 
nine years that the sandinista government has been been in control 
the sandinistas first imposed restrictions on civil liberties in 
1982 shortly after a war with usbacked rebels known as contras 
intensified that law was revoked in january in keeping with a 
central american peace plan 
however the measures issued thursday were weaker than earlier 
ones that barred freedom of movement and granted police 
wideranging powers 
instead they deal mainly with the press they prohibit all mass 
media from publishing or broadcsting news on the storm unless it 
was provided by the presidency or authorized sources 
the law signed by president daniel ortega said the government 
could temporarily commandeer vehicles if needed to fight the 
effects of the hurricane 
in addition it suspends several basic constitutional freedoms 
including the right to express beliefs in public or private 
individually or collectively in oral written or any other form 
that move was apparently aimed at forestalling criticism of the 
governments stormrelief efforts 
thursdays law also suspends the right to truthful 
information 
the afternoon newspaper la prensa ran a frontpage editorial 
under the headline an absurd and illegal ban referring to the 
ban on unauthorized news it said once again the government 
violates the human rights of nicaraguans and its own constitution

an iranian national who works as a city 
engineer was charged thursday with illegally exporting a vital 
component of the sophisticated surfacetoair hawk missile to 
europe 
ali reza foyuzi yousefi 45 of rock hill allegedly tried to 
ship a cathode assembly to zurich switzerland in violation of the 
arms export control act us attorney vinton d lide said 
yousefi appeared thursday before us magistrate charles w 
gambrell who scheduled a detention hearing for monday 
the government will argue that yousefi should not be granted 
bail assistant us attorney joseph r mccrorey said even if 
yousefi is released on bail the immigration and naturalization 
service will take him into custody mccrorey said 
yousefi is an illegal alien because his workrelated visa 
expired in august 1986 said an affidavit signed by us customs 
agent larry hunter 
the affidavit said yousfei using the name allen young 
contacted varian and associates inc of palo alto calif to seek 
price quotes and repair information on subassemblies of a 
hightech microwave component considered a key part of the hawk 
missiles tracking and firing systems 
according to the affidavit youngs voice was recognized as 
having a persian or middle eastern accent williamson believed 
young was attempting to conceal this by simulating or faking a 
southern accent youngs request for information on the 
subassemblies was considered by varian officials to be 
inappropriate and unusual 
a tip from varian allowed an undercover agent to set up an 
89000 deal with yousefi and sell him the first of 100 promised 
cathode assemblies on oct 12 officials said 
yousefi went monday to a federal express office at 
charlottedouglas international airport in north carolina to send a 
package to zurich the affidavit said customs agents seized the 
package and found the cathode handwritten notes and two polaroid 
snapshots of a cathode the affidavit said 
yousefi was arrested at his office in rock hill a city of 
35000 people south of charlotte and 77 miles north of columbia 
mccrorey would not comment on what country authorities thought 
the cathodes were headed to but the affidavit notes that since 
1980 the united states has prohibited exporation of defense 
articles to the countries of iran and iraq in an effort to 
maintain a neutral stance in the iraniraq war 
violation of the arms export control act carries a maximum 
prison term of 10 years and a fine of up to 1 million 
the attorneys who represented yousefi on thursday tom roper of 
rock hill and jack swerling of columbia did not return calls to 
their offices after the hearing

when john a frustrated middleaged playwright 
asks his uppercrust parents for their permission to produce a play 
he has written about them the reaction is swift and severe 
dad is furious accusing his son of fouling the nest mom 
says write a book instead its less public she sniffs 
johns artistic effort sets in motion the cocktail hour a 
wise witty and humane comedy by ar gurney that examines the 
often myopic relationship between parents and children 
the play which opened thursday at offbroadways promenade 
theater deals with family perceptions how parents view their 
children how children look at their parents and how children see 
each other 
in the case of john his parents bradley and ann and his 
sister nina their particular views of each other have skewered 
their entire lives john a standin for gurney is a bit of a 
misanthrope hes jealous of a younger brother named jigger the 
darling of both parents jigger is talked about but never shows up 
for the big family meeting to discuss johns play 
the family conference is held during the cocktail hour when 
upscale people gather for upscale chatter that strange tribe known 
as wasps have provided the principal characters of nearly every 
gurney play having been most successfully delineated in the 
dining room and the perfect party the cocktail hour 
examines them in detail exposing their flaws but doing it with an 
affection that is almost genial 
consider the unhappy daughter nina she feels neglected 
particularly after she learns that the daughter in johns play is 
only a supporting role she says she has spent her whole life in a 
supporting role looking after her parents when what she really 
wants to do is go off to cleveland to train guide dogs for the 
blind 
if nina feels unappreciated john is bitter particularly at his 
father a man he says married for money never had to work for a 
living and got where he did through the right connections of family 
and friends 
bradley the patriarch rails against the loss of values in 
family and in the arts even though his own father committed 
suicide for a reason never revealed in the play 
its left to john and his mother to forge a new relationship 
during what is the best scene in the play in confronting the past 
they discover an unexpected bond 
the scene is helped immeasureably by nancy marchands portrayal 
of the flinty but very proper matriarch miss marchand is a marvel 
wearing sensible but elegant pumps a flowered dress and the 
requisite pearls she is a model of efficiency a woman who will 
make do no matter what 
keene curtis doesnt quite convey the aristocractic starch that 
the father should have but his indignation at his sons public 
exposure of the familys faults is real 
bruce davison as the playwright son has the difficult task of 
turning what could be a traitorous character into someone who 
genuinely is trying to find out about his family and he succeeds 
holland taylor plays the brittle sister with a style and flair for 
sarcasm that ooze upper class 
jack obrien has directed the play with restraint not pushing 
the actors into the laughs but letting the comedy develop from the 
situations steven rubins plush living room set sprawls across the 
promenades wide stage and looks appropriately expensive but then 
the whole production is firstclass 
the cocktail hour mixes impeccable style a lowkey charm 
and some highstyle performances to produce a winning concoction

goldbuttoned jackets dipped in the back teamed with white or 
beige pants and jumpsuits skirts were just above knee level or 
quite long

clothes than the littlegirl froufrous that shot him to fame 
besides lovely linen suits or flared coats over straight pants he 
showed some good wide jumpsuit shorts and longer pants 
the combinations of acid green olive coral lipstick red 
ruddy brown and lavender were stunning 
the sunny south was always on his mind in wonderful combinations 
of provencal prints on jersey outfits with long full skirts as 
well as the tunic knits with picasso or miro motifs on them sheer 
pullovers had greek vase motifs and heads of bulls vaguely 
evoking arles in southern france and its ancient history 
some of the bright boleros in pink and green worn with white 
pants or full black skirts had handsome swirly embroidery looking 
like strikingly informal party or cruise wear 
after a great line of bathing suits some with little skirts 
lacroix showed a whole series of champagne dresses with guipure 
lace embroidery or tucks all over 
he ended with a big line of every kind of fluid black or navy 
cocktail dress imaginable and there was not a pouf in sight by the 
man who started them unless one considers a puffy organza number 
worn as a funny grace note to the show 
kenzos offering was sunny too though more sedate than his 
usual show in a circus building this time he showed in his 
leftbank shop just for fun he showed cotton tailcoats with 
shorts but his long and colorful linen suits with cropped trousers 
or narrow skirts with a kick pleat in the back were serious fashion 
he picked on the french revolution bicentenary coming up to 
highlight his show the striped lean pants tiered skirts and 
revolutionary stocking caps came out in red white and french blue 
besides cute suits with full short skirts he showed long ivory 
suits with jackets opened like a tulip shape over a panel 
underneath he got some costumey inspiration as well tiered gypsy 
dresses and zodiacprinted numbers had enough fantasy for any beach 
party 
and the beachcomber could do no better than the tropical leaf 
and exotic bird prints on shorts billowy sheer tops and shortie 
beach coverups 
rei kawakubo at comme des garcons has taken to showing wearable 
clothes especially if you like full short culottes or bloomers 
with some nice harlequindiamond or square black and white sheer 
tops the clothes had more symmetry than usual 
the prettiest numbers were the filmy shiny and sheer muslins or 
organzas billowing in pastel layers of tops overskirts and pants 
yohji yamamoto showed enough black suits for an undertaker but 
his excellent and easy cut in the pants suits jumpers and longer 
dresses had a certain austere style 
its very wearable handsome and elegant my favorite 
collection so far said selma weiser owner of charivari a store 
with several branches in new york 
some of the dresses in light crepe with droppedwaist 
ballooning tiered effects with pastel shoulder wraps were 
attractive under their edwardian hats and the trapeze dresses had 
poorgirl chic though they arent budget numbers 
for welcome color yamamoto showed saffron and rust 
paisleyprint fullskirted trench coats and suits with outsized 
jackets and wide pants 
nino cerrutis show had plenty of grownup charm in narrow pants 
suits long or short skirts and full shorts a series of pinks and 
beiges in silk and linen was based on fluid pyjamas fitted jackets 
with ribbed or welt seaming a few loose duster jackets 
the colors were mostly based on sand and navy with some 
remarkable dark silk flowerprinted flowing culottes worn with 
tailored short jackets a dinner suit for summer 
cerrutis prettiest summer lateday clothes were the long pants 
or short white linen skirts generously edged in wide bands of 
eyelet 
thierry mugler is still enamored of tootight clothes and 
vampires his show was something between a scifi tv miniseries and 
a trip to draculas den the spacewomen came out in slick jumpsuits 
with crescentshaped tucks all over or in complicated draped 
dresses 
his bright blue or turquoise suits had jeweled vampirepointed 
fronts on the jacket clinging skirts vinyl details all over

michael dukakis compared george bushs campaign to the watergate 
scandal of richard nixon on thursday saying truth was the first 
casualty in both instances bush received new police endorsements 
along with the badge of a slain officer in new york 
the democratic governor and the republican vice president dueled 
from a distance on the campaign trail before sheathing their 
political swords and dining together at the annual nonpartisan 
alfred e smith charity dinner in manhattan sponsored by the roman 
catholic archdiocese of new york 
dukakis urged by supporters to get tough in the face of polls 
that show him trailing bush did just that during an appearance in 
new haven conn 
truth was the first casualty in the nixon white house and it 
was the first casualty in the bush campaign dukakis said 
above all the truth should matter a lot in a presidential 
campaign because as we learned in watergate it matters a lot in 
the oval office 
i believe the american people value the truth in politics and 
im going to do everything i can to make sure truth wins and that 
we win on the eighth of november the democratic nominee said 
dukakis also made a point of drawing a distinction with bush on 
the emotionally charged subject of abortion 
george bush wants the government to make one of the most 
personal choices a woman can make i believe a choice that 
personal must be made by the woman herself 
in almost every speech he makes bush says he opposes almost all 
abortions while dukakis does not 
in an odd episode in an already negative campaign dukakis 
national field director resigned thursday after saying bush should 
fess up about a rumor that rippled through wall street on 
wednesday 
the remarks by donna brazile to reporters also led dukakis to 
apologize directly to bush in new york 
at the al smith dinner dukakis spoke first and got in a few 
jibes at bush as well as some selfdeprecating digs at himself 
he began by saying how pleased he to be at an event where all 
thought of politics is banished and i can concentrate on what i do 
best comedy 
dukakis apologized for the fact his wifes absence 
kittys in a hotel room in dallas tonight he said maybe 
she qualifies as a texan a dig at the fact bushs texas 
residence is a hotel room in houston 
bush joked about his background he noted dukakis pride in his 
immigrant roots and said my people landed at ellis island they

swarms of pink locusts possibly 
blown thousands of miles from africa by tropical storms have 
invaded at least 12 caribbean nations and officials say they 
endanger sugar and corn crops 
the un food and agriculture organization has sent experts to 
the islands to help in eradication frederick zenny the fao 
regional head in barbados said thursday 
locusts rarely seen in the caribbean are migratory 
grasshoppers that often travel in vast swarms and strip areas they 
pass of all vegetation because locusts feed on grass the two 
major grass crops in the region sugarcane and corn are most in 
danger 
zenny said the locusts could be part of a swarm the fao has been 
tracking since early october officials say the insects pose no 
danger to people 
we had been tracking a swarm earlier this month that had blown 
off course from africa towards the cape verde islands and we have 
tracked this swarm to about 1500 miles away from french guiana in 
south america he said 
since tropical storm joan now a hurricane swept through the 
eastern caribbean last week the locusts have been sighted in 
barbados st vincent antigua st lucia dominica trinidad 
grenada guyana puerto rico the us virgin islands and the 
french islands of martinique and guadeloupe 
agricultural experts in guyana grenada and barbados said they 
suspected the locusts were blown in from africa by joan and other 
tropical storms this season 
however dominicas agriculture ministry issued a report saying 
this may not be an african species of locusts but south or 
central american 
dr david nellis of the virgin islands department of planning 
and natural resources said the locusts probably came from northern 
south america 
the locust is 3 inches long has speckled wing covers and 
salmon pink legs nellis said 
chris seiler a virgin islands resident said the locusts are 
the same as those that helped destroy agriculture in his native 
ethiopia he said the only means of prevention is to chemically 
spray where the locusts are expected to hit next 
in guyana on south americas northern coast the government 
asked farmers to report any locust sightings to the police or 
agriculture ministry saying the insects never seen before in 
guyana could wipe out crops 
we are asking anyone who notices the creatures to notify 
authorities immediately said an agriculture ministry statement 
read over government radio they are dangerous to agriculture 
if what we fear is true there is a serious threat to the 
agricultural industry said a ministry spokesman 
the dominica governments chief agricultural adviser colin 
bully said no reports of crop damage have surfaced so far 
the ministry said three field survey teams are covering dominica 
to assess the density of locusts and will issue a report on 
possible crop damage 
barbados mounted an islandwide survey and planned a massive 
spraying campaign for saturday and sunday 
agricultural officials in have set up three hot lines for 
farmers and residents to report sightings

four young protestant activists 
were sentenced to life in prison at belfast crown court thursday 
for the murders of two roman catholics and a fellow protestant 
activist last year 
the four darren larmour 22 robert molyneaux 20 alfred 
howcroft 20 and joseph morrison 23 are all members of the 
paramilitary ulster defense association 
in passing sentence judge james nicholson said catholics should 
appreciate the determination of the police in combating such crimes 
by protestant extremists 
nicholson said the legal ulster defense association formed in 
1971 as an umbrella organization for protestant vigilante groups 
was comparable to the outlawed mainly catholic irish republican 
army 
he said the two catholics edward campbell and james meighan 
were killed simply because of their religion and the ulster defense 
association man thomas dickson was killed because he was disliked 
had it not been for the determination of the police the 
killings would have gone unsolved nicholson said 
but for their police efforts catholics in north belfast 
would be in greater danger than they are now many of the relatives 
and friends of the deceased must be aware that the police and only 
the police could solve these murders the judge said 
many catholics in northern ireland are wary of the provinces 
predominantly protestant police force the royal ulster 
constabulary 
larmour pleaded guilty to murdering campbell and dickson 
molyneaux and howcroft each pleaded guilty to murdering campbell 
and meighan morrison pleaded guilty to murdering meighan and 
dickson 
the ulster defense association claims 18000 members the ulster 
freedom fighters said to be the associations military wing is 
outlawed 
the british government on wednesday banned television and radio 
interviews with the ulster defense association the ulster freedom 
fighters the ira and eight other groups from both sides of 
northern irelands sectarian divide in a bid to deny guerrillas a 
propaganda platform 
the ira is fighting to end british rule in protestantdominated 
northern ireland and unite it with the 95percent catholic republic 
of ireland under socialist rule protestant militants oppose any 
suggestion of uniting the province with ireland

the food and drug administration is hoping to 
speed therapies for aids and other lifethreatening diseases to 
market by formally encouraging pharmaceutical companies to work 
with the agency in the earliest stages of drug development 
in announcing publication of the new regulations in the federal 
register on wednesday fda commissioner frank e young acknowledged 
that they essentially codify what the agency already is doing 
the federal register notice itself says that although the 
new program is important it builds upon managerial and 
regulatory options available under existing practices and 
procedures 
young said the new mechanism which essentially allows a drug 
company to bypass finalstage drug testing was similar to that 
used in approval last year of azt still the only recognized drug

the greenhouse effect warming the earth is 
likely to raise ocean levels but lower the great lakes reduce 
crops across the south and turn some northern forests into 
grasslands according to a major government study 
the unreleased report by the environmental protection agency 
says lowlying coastal areas equal in size to the state of 
massachusetts could be submerged 
congress directed epa to perform major studies on the effects of 
the greenhouse effect and what can be done about it both studies 
are expected to be submitted to congress in december a draft of 
the summary of the effects report was obtained wednesday by the 
associated press 
the greenhouse effect is the expected warming of the earth 
from the growing concentration of gases in the atmosphere that keep 
heat from being radiated out to space the principal greenhouse 
gas carbon dioxide has increased 10 percent since 1958 and 
continued worldwide use of fossil fuels and destruction of tropical 
rain forests point to further increases

while too little iron in the body is clearly a 
health hazard a study published today suggests that too much of 
the essential nutrient also may be bad possibly increasing the 
risk of cancer 
the study found that men with high levels of iron in their 
bodies are more likely to have cancer of the colon lungs bladder 
and esophagus suggesting that the widespread habit of 
supplementing the diet with iron may not be in the best interests 
of people who are already getting enough 
people have long studied the consequences of iron 
deficiency commented dr katherine mcglynn of the fox chase 
cancer center in philadelphia its only recently that people 
have studied iron overloading and raised the possibility that we

some television stations would have to reduce 
advertising and refocus their childrens programming efforts under 
a bill approved by congress and hailed as a victory for americas 
children 
the measure won final passage on a voice vote in the senate on 
wednesday but the reagan administration opposes it and the justice 
department recommends that he veto it on constitutional grounds 
the measure would limit advertising time during childrens shows 
and require tv stations to provide informative programming for 
children as a condition of license renewal 
supporters say the legislation is the most important statement 
by congress on childrens television in a generation

a reagan administration official who refused 
to fund a school study program on the holocaust acknowledges that 
her decision was based in part on reviews including one complaining 
that the views of nazis and the ku klux klan werent included 
supporters of the holocaust program entitled facing history 
and ourselves contend that the review boards set up to assess the 
merits of the program for the education department were 
ideologically slanted and predisposed to recommend it not be funded 
but shirley curry a political appointee in the department said 
criticism that somehow the department in general and i in 
particular have operated in some antisemitic mode is 
absolutely absurd 
she told a house government operations subcommittee wednesday 
that the program was denied 70000 in federal funds three times 
those decisions were made either because the program scored low in 
critiques prepared by panels of outside reviewers or because as 
was the case this year when the program received a relatively high 
score a money squeeze prevented funding of an entire category of 
programs

smurfs the lovable blue gnomes with 
four fingers and a special language were born in 1958 when a 
preoccupied cartoonist called peyo asked a friend to pass the salt 
but said schtroumpf instead 
three decades after they appeared as minor characters in a 
belgian series on knights and kings they are among the worlds 
favorite cartoon characters 
their adventures have been told in 13 books translated into 25 
languages they have appeared in 250 smurf television programs and 
four featurelength movies 
a smurf is a pitufo in spanish the original schtroumpf in 
french a schlumpf in german and smolf in danish italians call 
them puffos and to the japanese they are sumafus a smurf is a nam 
ching ling to the chinese and the hebrew word is dardassim 
all this has brought fame and fortune to peyo who in real life 
is pierre culliford a 60yearold native of brussels who now lives 
in switzerland 
he is grateful and threw a smurfday party oct 16 in the belgian 
capitals historic grand place square attended by about 5000 
children and adults 
i feel a bit groggy he said looking out at the crowd 
the party featured a giant cake drawing contests puppet shows 
a magician and replicas of the smurfs toadstool homes in a 
setting of some of the finest gothic and baroque architecture in 
europe 
cullifords slip of the tongue in 1958 created an industry 
smurfs now appear on 2000 consumer products around the world from 
writing gear to mugs knapsacks to sweatshirts spaghetti packages 
and yogurt jars to petroleum products 
unauthorized uses have included an appearance on the sides of 
water cannon trucks used by panamanian security forces 
we know about that from a belgian television crew that was 
filming in panama but we have not authorized the smurfs to be used 
in that form said nadine peeters of imps the brussels agency 
that approves commercial use of the smurfs 
the cuddly culliford creations use the word smurf both as verb 
and noun in a language that can be confusing but at times is rich 
in poetic harmony 
educators once scorned the strange tongue which children 
usually understand better than adults but it gradually won 
acceptance and even appears in an official dutch dictionary 
early on parents complained because their kids started to 
talk smurfish peyo said at the giant birthday party but now 
he is planning a 60acre smurf entertainment park near metz 
france a smurf monthly magazine and a 14th book about an 
ambitious smurf who wants to open a bank 
much of the smurf surge of recent years is attributable to their 
appearance on television and development of the us market 
when peyo spent that evening with a fellow cartoonist at seaside 
restaurant 30 years ago he was drawing johan and pirlouit a 
cartoon series set in the middle ages 
he wanted to introduce gnomes of which he was fond but most 
of them are too scary or immoral to feature in cartoons for kids 
the dinnertable gaffe gave him the smurfs with their funny 
language and they caught on quickly 
first came their own strip then books and in 1975 the first 
smurf movie the flute with the six smurfs 
plastic and stuffed smurfs reached the united states in 1978 
four years later an estimated 9 million youngsters were watching 
them on saturday morning television 
cullifordpeyo gives this explanation of their success the 
smurfs do not fit into any category every culture can absorb the 
smurfs because the smurfs do not belong to any culture everybody 
understands the blue gnomes

comedy is serious business at 1395 a copy 
babe 
and so comedian richard belzer sitting in the frank sinatra 
room of the show biz haven the friars club keeps a straight face 
while discussing his first tome how to be a stand up comic 
why a book well no one had ever written one and a lot of 
people have always asked me a lot of questions been curious about 
it and i was surprised to see that nobody had written an insiders 
view he said 
yeah but is the book a joke or does it have some real pointers 
there are things in there that are very useful offers a 
stillsomber belz whose live shows have made him the favorite 
comic of among others robin williams having seen hundreds of 
people try to be comedians over the years ive learned some 
insights that ive relayed in the book 
for example there are tips on handling hecklers what do you 
use for birth control your personality 
there are tips on jokes to avoid never never ever make fun 
of frank sinatra dead comics tell no jokes if you get my drift 
and there are tips on slipping funny country names into your 
standup cameroon lichtenstein canada lapland and of course 
sri lanka 
belzer who declined to give his age was born in bridgeport 
conn he did not complete college and claims he was asked to leave 
because of his uncontrollable wit 
he has never written any previous books but has appeared in 
several movies including night shift with michael keaton and 
scarface with al pacino he also was cohost of a morning radio 
show a cable tv show hot properties and appeared offbroadway 
in the national lampoon show he lives with his wife and two 
daughters in manhattan 
belzer started performing as a standup comic in 1972 id 
done everything else in my life i was a teacher i was a census 
taker a jewelry salesman i was a freelance writer 
and finally i just wound up saying well ive been funny 
all my life let me try and make a living at what i should be 
making a living at 
in his first two times onstage he experienced the high and the 
low of the business 
the very first time i was on stage i was at the escape 
hatch in new jersey thats where i killed he recalled 
first time i ever performed for some reason i just did great 
and then i bombed at maxs kansas city 
since then its been mostly highs for belzer who lists his 
favorite comics albert brooks richard lewis jay leno gilbert 
gottfried but refuses to name those he finds unfunny 
can you imagine if i gave you one name said belzer finally 
breaking into a smile it would reverberate through the echoes of 
the industry 
after loosening up a bit the comic then provided a belzeyes 
view of several public figures 
preacherpatron jimmy swaggart i think hes proved you can 
apologize to anything and get away with it cause he apologized to 
his son his wife his car aluminum he sinned against everything 
so he set the world record for apologies 
president ronald reagan well im going to miss ronald 
reagan but hes not gone yet we may be in nicaragua sooner than 
you think 
mayor edward i koch i think hes a selfserving 
demagogic megalomaniacal fool with one of the most corrupt 
administrations in the history of the city but aside from that 
hes doing a good job 
finished here a serious belzer goes back to the serious 
business of promoting his book and providing advice to the aspiring 
laughgetter 
dont give up too early cause its very hard its 
discouraging but if you really want to do it its great he 
said i mean its great if you can make a living at being a 
comedian its a wonderful thing

so what if two tiny faraway rocks crumble or sink 
into the pacific japan might lose fishing and mining rights to 
155000 square miles of ocean thats what so it is spending about 
236 million to shore them up 
the rocks called north dew and east dew each barely large 
enough for a person to sleep on are japans southernmost points 
and hold the key to treasure in this age of national 
economiccontrol zones extending 200 miles from shore 
since april about 200 workers using helicopters and 
shipmounted cranes have surrounded them with thousands of 
fourpointed steel blocks like anchors the blocks form protective 
circles 165 feet in diameter on a coral reef about 10 feet below 
the surface 1100 miles south of tokyo 
haruo aoki of the construction ministrys coastal department 
said the work has cost 17 billion yen 134 million so far and 
total is expected to be 30 billion yen he said the circles will be 
filled with concrete beginning next year 
at high tide the rocks extend 3 to 10 feet above sea level if 
the tide should cover them the reef no longer could be defined as 
an island and japan no longer could claim a 200mile economic zone 
around it 
that means the nations southermost point would move about 300 
miles north between the volcano islands on the east and the 
yaeyama islands 
north dew and east dew are about a mile apart on the reef which 
was an island called parece vela when it appeared on 17th century 
spanish navigation charts 
the japanese call it okinotorishima remote bird island and 
official records say it was put under tokyos jurisdiction in 1931 
it is recognized as japanese in the world war ii peace treaty 
japan declared a 200mile exclusive economic zone around the 
reef in 1977 following the international trend to such areas of 
control 
both rocks are shaped like mushrooms with thin stems attached to 
the submerged reef which is about three miles square north dew is 
about 15 feet in diameter and east dew just over half that size 
agriculture ministry figures say 2577 tons of bonito tuna and 
other fish were caught in the 200mile zone around them in 1985 
the last year for which figures are available the catch was worth 
7 million at the current rate of exchange 
no signs of oil have been reported but surveys are continuing to 
determine whether mining of cobalt nickel and other metals would 
be feasible on the undersea mountain capped by the reef said 
motohiko kato of the international trade and industry ministrys 
national resources and energy agency 
the mountain rises 16400 to 19700 feet from the ocean floor 
no estimate has been made of how much japan would lose if the 
rocks slipped below the surface and the area around okinotorishima 
became international an agriculture ministry official said

cartoon movies are a universal hit with 
youngsters peter dalglish reasoned so that should be the best way 
to teach street kids of the world the perils of aids 
the canadian youth workers short animated film survivors is 
being made on a budget of 500000 415000 us by the national 
film board of canada whose awardwinning experience with animation 
dates back nearly five decades 
it should be ready for distribution in 20 languages by the time 
more than 10000 health workers and other experts gather in 
montreal next june for the fifth international conference on aids 
for which no cure has been found 
were trying to reach kids in the 30 largest cities of the 
developing world dalglish 31 said in an interview its a 
film for the front lines i think were two or three years ahead of 
the game 
a preliminary version of the cartoon without music or full 
animation has been tested on young audiences in the philippines 
kenya sri lanka brazil and new york 
we saw very strong identification with the characters 
dalglish said the story tested extremely well 
dalglish went to africa after finishing law school and in 
khartoum sudan founded street kids international which forms 
bicycle courier services to provide jobs it now employs 20 
children at any given time and is planning expansion to other 
cities with capital raised in canada 
you have to be able to provide an alternative to 
prostitution dalglish said given a choice theyll all choose 
riding a bicycle over sleeping with someone 
in khartoum he became increasingly concerned about the 
potential for disaster as aids becomes a disease concentrated among 
the urban poor 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring 
canada has reported more than 2000 aids cases and estimates for 
1992 run up to 12000 but the scene of survivors is 
specifically third world depicting children picking pockets or 
turning to prostitution 
no reliable estimates are available of how prevalent aids has 
become among street children who may number 40 million throughout 
the world but dalglish said the prevalence of other sexually 
transmitted diseases might make the projections pessimistic 
he said the idea of an animated film was born in khartoum when 
he borrowed a projector from the us embassy to show his 
youngsters a tom and jerry cartoon and for the first time that 
anyone could remember we had the complete attention of every kid in 
the room 
survivors is intended for showing to small groups of 
children aged 6 to 14 with a youth worker present to lead a 
discussion afterward 
it makes it easy for kids to talk about aids about health 
with street workers dalglish said we could be subtle while 
being reasonably explicit at the same time 
he hopes to raise funds for accompanying instruction guides and 
comic books 
dalglish and the production team went to mexico and guatemala so 
the animators could get to know their audience and create an 
authentic atmosphere but the setting is intentionally vague in 
order to broaden the films appeal 
even new york street kids were intrigued by it dalglish said 
but survivors is not really intended for those raised on

the genteel world of british publishing is 
awakening to the age of the conglomerate and wrestling with the 
question of whether books can be sold like bars of soap 
publishing has become a pitiless world the stuff of boardroom 
battles and heartrending drama no place for gentlemen writes 
margaret pringle in the independent newspaper 
publishing was very much a cottage industry here its now a 
business says joanna goldsworthy a publishing director at 
prestigious victor gollancz business people forget that without 
authors theyre nothing 
such comments have sparked a heated debate about the place of 
corporations especially american ones in british publishing 
where dreamy images of a gaslighted dickensian era linger 
the big guns deny they are cheapening literature and few top 
authors are complaining about the vastly fatter advances being 
offered 
you can find a dickensian publisher but no one wants to 
observes londonbased american agent ed victor its no good 
looking back and being wistful the old days are gone youre not 
going to go out and buy a remington typewriter when you can buy a 
word processor 
the trend toward conglomerates has encouraged some small quality 
imprints to take wing rather as a neighborhood supermarket will 
spawn highquality delicatessens around it 
were the good old days really all that good said ian 
chapman chairman of collins publishers one of britains most 
acquisitive houses 
conditions of employment wages and salaries were 
appalling he said at a recent publishers seminar 
since the mid70s weve had to look to our laurels and 
become much more professional were having to recognize that books 
should make a return on investment but they can still have 
the same love and care he said 
theres no shortage of books in 1987 59837 titles were 
published in britain compared to 36322 a decade before but the 
increase is in output rather than quality hobby and special 
interest books rather than in exciting new fiction 
meanwhile the gentleman publisher is becoming a thing of the 
past 
in february 1986 macmillan in britain bought the small british 
house of sidgwick and jackson for 175 million pounds about 25 
million one year later random house bought the publishing 
consortium cvbc for 175 million pounds about 31 million 
that purchase ended the independence of four noted british 
imprints chatto and windus virago bodley head and jonathan cape 
and gave random house a longsought british foothold virago 
which specializes in feminist literature bought its way out six 
months later and is now 90percent independent 
takeover fever is not exclusively american over the past four 
years britishowned octopus has purchased methuen secker and 
warburg and heinemann three london houses esteemed for their 
independence and the attention they lavished on their authors 
british publisher robert maxwell has bid unsuccessfully for 
harcourt brace jovanovich and is now trying to buy macmillan in the 
united states the two macmillans have common ancestry but are now 
separate companies 
meanwhile the prices paid for books have skyrocketed chatto 
and windus bought michael holroyds threevolume biography of 
george bernard shaw for 625000 pounds about 1 million novelist 
salman rushdie left jonathan cape for viking penguin and a twobook 
deal reported at 850000 pounds about 143 million 
penguin a pioneer of british paperbacks has also become an 
important publishing outlet in the united states 
bookshops reflect the changing status in the business sleek 
chain stores with shopping carts and glaring lights are supplanting 
those quiet musty idiosyncratic establishments of 84 charing 
cross road where one could browse and lose oneself for an entire 
day 
if literature now represents lucre some are wondering at what 
price 
authors at the moment are getting rather a raw deal said 
gollanczs goldsworthy publishing is becoming so much more of a 
business that publishers are forgetting at their peril that 
they need authors 
novelist malcolm bradbury agreed that practices had changed 
since his first novel eating people is wrong appeared in 1959 
im worried the author said in an interview these 
changes in ownership may result in remote companies whose prime 
interest is not in publishing but in publishing balance sheets 
the danger will be if we reach a point where commercial 
pressures become so intense that publishers can only afford to go 
with books that can sell in very large quantities 
octopus purchase of secker and warburg the imprint that gave 
britain george orwell thomas mann and italo calvino prompted an 
anguished open letter from literary agent giles gordon to punch 
magazine 
most of our significant literary houses are now shackled and 
restricted in the hands of managers bureaucracies corporate 
strategies gordon wrote your shareholders may be pleased we 
readers are appalled i beseech you think it possible you may 
be mistaken 
calls to octopus for comment were not returned 
anthony burgess author of a clockwork orange argued in the 
observer that the united states had set the precedent and he saw a 
dilemma for authors 
the impersonality of the whole proceeding is mitigated for 
the author by money but money strangely enough cannot easily 
compensate for the authors sense of being reduced to a commodity 
like soap or peanut butter he wrote 
bradbury said that whatever the problems the changes have 
advantages 
the greater commercialization in the system has improved 
bookselling no end he said more books are bought and newish 
writers are acquiring audiences through this distribution system at 
a far greater speed than they would have done when i started 
writing 
meanwhile bucking the prevailing trend are a few new publishing 
houses seeking to fill the void created by the takeovers 
in september 1986 nigel newton launched bloomsbury press with 2 
million pounds then about 3 million in capital saying the surge 
in conglomerates spurred him on 
newton said bloomsbury offered authors a tailormade service 
increasingly unavailable elsewhere its fiction list includes both 
acclaimed newcomers such as jeanette winterson and mary flanagan 
and such veterans as margaret atwood john irving and paul bailey 
one of its first commercial coups was the purchase of british 
rights to presumed innocent american novelist scott turows 
best seller 
but might bloomsbury itself be taken over 
no it wont said newton weve received offers but are 
committed to autonomy

tens of thousands of european homes 
have high radon levels but officials say many people question the 
danger in spite of research linking the colorless odorless gas to 
fatal lung cancer 
some researchers feel the continent may be years behind the 
united states in developing programs to meet the threat 
we were two years behind the united states in recognizing the 
problem and it will take another two to three years to catch up 
said bernd franke of the west german institute for energy and 
environmental research in heidelberg 
a traditional popular belief that the gas has curative powers 
compounds the problem a few radon spas still operate in austria 
and hungary and people still descend into deep caves in hopes the 
gas will help cure rheumatism and other ailments 
radon is a radioactive gas produced in the decay of uranium of 
which at least trace amounts are present in all soil and rock 
it tends to concentrate on the lower floors of buildings and 
kills by leaving its a residue in the lungs that irradiates the 
tissues for a lifetime smoking substantially increases the danger 
from radon according to health officials 
us health officials say radon exposure is second only to 
smoking as a cause of lung cancer and up to 20000 americans die of 
its effects each year legislation pending in congress would 
require inspections of public schools and set a longterm goal of 
making air equally low in radon indoors and outdoors 
american officials have declared 4 picocuries of radon per liter 
of air 150 becquerel per cubic meter to be the level at which 
homeowners should take preventive action that is the equivalent of 
smoking 10 cigarettes a day or having 200300 chest xrays a year 
west germany recently set radon action limits at 250 becquerel 
per cubic meter the equivalent of 66 picocuries the limit for 
new houses in sweden is 75 becquerel or 2 picocuries 
extensive testing and research programs are under way in 
britain west germany sweden norway and switzerland 
its going to take a long time to pin down the houses at 
risk said matthew gaines of the national radiological protection 
board in britain well be testing until the end of the century 
recent european studies have found 
more than 20000 british homes have high radon levels and 
800900 people die annually as a result of exposure to it the 
radiological protection board is testing a sample 17000 homes 
most of them in devon and cornwall where the problem is most 
serious 
in sweden about 40000 homes have unsafe levels of radon and 
roughly 60000 houses are tested each year more than 700 deaths a 
year are attributed to the gas and officials say the rate could 
reach 1100 in the early 1990s 
up to 190000 homes in west germany have radon levels above 
government safety standards and about 2000 radonrelated deaths 
occur annually initial tests show the highest levels in the south 
and southwest 
homes in volcanic areas of the upper lazio region north of rome 
had italys highest radon concentrations 
most homes in denmark holland belgium spain and greece 
showed little radon risk to residents 
french officials have said radon is not a serious health risk in 
that country and some have discounted publicity about the gas in 
the united states and elsewhere 
its a question thats been a bit blown up in the media 
said jeanpierre moroni of the government radiation control agency 
theres a very simple measure open a window when you get up 
its a matter of good sense it amounts to not living all closed 
up 
french environmental activists disagree 
to say there is no problem in france is a mistake said 
corinne castanier who speaks for the independent regional 
commission for information on radioactivity 
she said her group established after the chernobyl nuclear 
accident in 1986 has found high levels in some homes in the 
mountainous massif central region 
officials in britain and west germany say they have trouble 
convincing residents of the danger 
i think a lot of the reaction is a bit skeptical said 
albert weeks chief building control inspector for the kerrier 
district council in cornwall southwest england 
its almost a nonbelief they dont really think its that 
bad they say weve been living with it for x number of years and 
it doesnt seem to affect us weeks said 
sweden where 10 percent of the land area contains highrisk 
levels of radon has led the way in testing and helping homeowners 
reduce their risk of radon exposure 
a new law provides financial help for homeowners who make 
radonreducing improvements the government also has begun a study 
of 4500 people to gain more information on the relationship 
between radon and lung cancer

the south long considered an educational 
backwater is recognizing that its high illiteracy and school 
dropout rates can only drain its economic health the problem was 
highlighted this month by a report warning that the region is at 
risk of creating a permanent massive pool of undereducated 
citizens unable to support themselves this story examines some 
local efforts to teach people to read

afraid of being left behind economically and 
culturally this central georgia city is mobilizing for battle the 
enemy is illiteracy 
and macon is not alone as communities all over the south are 
waking up to the dollarsandcents drawbacks of illiteracy 
one of every three macon adults is considered to be functionally 
illiterate the highest rate in the nation for a city with more 
than 100000 people according to the us census bureau 
were supposed to have a 37 percent illiteracy rate said 
cheryl kelly the director of project read in macon we know 
weve got a big problem here but the truth is were not all that 
much different from the rest of the state or the region for that 
matter 
kelly and a visitor were surrounded by banks of computers and 
colorcoded typewriters in bibb countys spanking new reading 
laboratory the lab which officially opened on national literacy 
day sept 8 is the first of five such centers to be installed in 
the county over the next several years 
aimed at adults who either read poorly or not at all project 
read has a 350000 war chest including a 100000 knight 
foundation grant and 46000 from the junior league of macon 
project read is one of several ambitious undertakings in which the 
public and private sectors have joined forces to help southerners 
learn to read 
the city of readers project in chattanooga tenn is such 
an effort backed by a 35000 grant from the general electric 
foundation the chattanooga project also began sept 8 it differs 
from macons approach in that it is aimed primarily at school 
children and their parents 
we are stressing that reading can be fun said shirley 
spiers director of city of readers were giving away books 
setting aside a reading hour in the schools and making every 
effort to get parents and children involved in recreational 
reading 
according to the southern regional education board one of every 
seven adults in the south reads below a fourthgrade level in 
addition the sreb said the south claims nine of the 10 states 
with the highest percentage of high school dropouts listing the 
highest rates first the states are kentucky mississippi south 
carolina arkansas north carolina west virginia tennessee 
georgia alabama and louisiana 
because of such factors shortages of educated and skilled 
workers become an increasing barrier to the competitiveness of 
southern business and industry according to a report presented 
to congress earlier this month by the sunbelt institute a 
nonprofit research organization that studies regional issues 
the report urged congress to do more to eradicate illiteracy and 
to get private groups and businesses to join the battle 
skirmishes are breaking out in alabama gov guy hunt just 
signed a 24 billion education budget highest in the states 
history florida georgia north carolina and tennessee have set up 
literacy programs and virginia has appropriated nearly 3 million 
to attack adult illiteracy next year 
mississippi hired a former federal education official at 76000 
a year 13000 more than the governor is paid to head the new 
governors office for literacy 
weve all got much the same situation said kelly a former 
elementary school reading teacher in macon many of our older 
functionally illiterate adults those who read below a fourthgrade 
level quit school early to go to work in agriculture or in the 
textile mills 
the younger ones those in their 20s tend to be 
semiilliterate reading on an eighthgrade level because they 
attended class longer but they frequently were pushed along 
through school from grade to grade on the mistaken assumption 
that we were doing children a disservice by holding them back 
macon leaders realized the severity of the problem when local 
industries began complaining about the shortage of qualified 
applicants 
last year a census report on black americans listed bibb county 
at the bottom in educational attainment by blacks 
but kelly says macons illiteracy is not segregated 
in fact she added there doesnt seem to be any 
particular pattern among the people who have come to us seeking 
help our average participant last year was 39 and the ratio of 
men and woman and blacks and whites broke down to about 5050 
a major catalyst for project read kelly said was local 
response to a television program on illiteracy aired two years ago 
by abc and public television 
the day after the special ran we were inundated with calls 
from people wanting help and from people wanting to help she 
said the county director of adult education was swamped and he 
turned to me and said do something i went out looking for 
volunteers a few months later when it was apparent to everyone 
that we were totally unequipped to deal with the problem the mayor 
called a meeting of community leaders a steering committee 
created project read in january 1987 
at the time she said the countys main adult education thrust 
was aimed at helping people get their high school equivalency 
diplomas 
it never seemed important or desirable to educate our total 
population before said robert williams recently retired as a 
bibb county deputy school superintendent 
charles gatlin of the greater macon chamber of commerce said the 
old approach was out of step with changing labor needs 
in the past he said we were able to get by and keep a 
low unemployment rate with a poorly educated work force because our 
labor needs had traditionally stressed manual dexterity over 
scholastics now were picking up the kind of jobs that require 
more education technical jobs connected with the aerospace 
industry over at robins air force base and new jobs in 
manufacturing and retailing 
project read now has two fulltime teachers a secretary five 
fulltime vista volunteers and a couple of hundred volunteers from 
the community kelly said the volunteers do oneonone training 
while the vista volunteers go out in search of program participants 
were using an ibm reading program is designed to move people 
rapidly along toward literacy kelly said students work on video 
screens which they touch to change cartoon story lines 
progressing from phonetic sounds to inserting complete words 
kelly said project read also includes an intense media campaign 
stressing the need to read 
were ready to teach 16 people an hour in the lab kelly 
said however there is a slight hitch we have a target 
population of 33000 adults in bibb county but so far only 125 
people have signed up 
you can see we have our work cut out for us getting people to 
overcome their fears and reluctance is going to be a challenge

what could easily be one of only operas ever 
performed in ancient langauge of the aztecs will be staged at the 
pyramids of teotihuacan in mexico 
tenor placido domingo singing in nauhatl will star in the 
premiere of lalo schifrins songs of the aztecs on the stone 
stage of the square of the moon built centuries ago by ancient 
mesoamericans 
schifrin will conduct the mexico philharmonic at the oct 29 
event a benefit to launch a campaign for the restoration of the 
aztec temple of teotihuacan an hours drive from mexico city 
american express has pledged 100000 toward the restoration 
the composer said doing an opera in nauhatl was not a serious 
problem the chorus and singers are used to the phonetics of a 
foreign language he said 
i thought it would be better to do it in the original 
language with a translation the use of a dictionary and grammar 
i was able to work it out chocolatl was a secret drink of the 
aztecs we say chocolate our word coyote comes from their 
coyotetl 
he was helped by a nauhatl authority dr georges beaudo of the 
university of toulouse in france 
schifrin wrote the music after finding some precolumbian 
poetry in spanish by nezahualcoyotl 143272 
it was so beautiful i decided to use it he said the 
last line of the poem is it cannot be in vain why we come to this 
earth let us leave some flowers let us leave some songs 
for the oct 29 performance 10000 chairs will be set up a new 
sound system built and tv screens put in to provide subtitles in 
spanish and english were trying to make some of the prices very 
popular he said a thousand people are going to pay very very 
high prices i cannot tell you how much money it takes to preseve 
something that is very important to know where were coming 
from is going to help us to know where were going 
the pyramids at teotihuacan date from 100 bc to 100 ad 
the site of the concert schifrin said is in the city of the 
gods in a square of stone the square of the moon 
the square is raised its exactly the place for the full 
symphony full chorus soloists and conductor where musicians used 
to play 500 years ago he said it was a stage they built it 
for us along a stone avenue are ruins of temples and stairways 
the whole place looks very impressive we go to greece and rome to 
find architectural riches but we have it right here 
that schifrin is the composer of so esoteric a work may surprise 
those who know him either from his jazz days with dizzy gillespie 
or as a composer of more than 80 film and tv scores 
schifrin who is 56 was born in buenos aires where his father 
was concertmaster of the buenos aires philharmonic he studied 
composition and piano at the paris conservatory and returned to 
buenos aires where he became a composer arranger conductor and 
pianist in pop jazz and classical music 
ive seen opera since i was a child i had a dramatic 
instinct this is probably one of the first times im saying this 
openly but i think movies are the opera of today he said 
in the cincinnati kid where i had ray charles playing along 
with a symphony orchestra it was not pop music this was really 
serious music to me and i think to many people 
the score of bullitt is being played by symphony orchestras 
now i did an arrangement of symphonic sketches from the score of 
cool hand luke 
he moved to the united states in 1958 and played piano in 
gillespies quintet from 196062 he composed gillespiana suite 
for the first record he on which he played with dizzy 
many people think i went to hollywood to make money she 
said i didnt have any idea about how much money i was going to 
make there is a group of composers in new york and there is no 
outlet to play their music duke ellington was the only example 
since haydn to have his own orchestra to play his own music the 
reason i went to hollywood was there was an outlet for hearing 
your music you composed 
lately he has done less film composing and more conducting 
last december he became music director of the paris philharmonic 
their first recording together ravels mother goose 
stravinskys petrushka and schifrins double bass concerto with 
soloist gary karr is being released this fall 
i think music is to be shared and not only through mechanical 
means like records you can be in a theater or even a stadium 
doing something for several thousand people that is very 
thrilling

president reagan likes to boast that marxists 
have not gained a single square inch of territory during his 
tenure and one of his more satisfying moments occurred when a 
communist government actually was uprooted 
rolling back communism was once an american cold war battle cry 
but marxist regimes always proved remarkably resilient in the 
postworld war ii era the trend was constant when marxists took 
power they were there to stay 
five years ago that pattern was interrupted on oct 25 1983 
us troops aided by forces from seven friendly caribbean 
countries deposed the leftist government in grenada 
was the administration telling the truth when it said the 
invasion was justified by dangers confronting the more than 700 
american medical students on the island or was that just an excuse 
for striking a blow against a country simply because it had ties to 
the soviet bloc 
was grenada an event of transcendental importance or merely a 
speck on the historical horizon did the soviets see grenada with 
its deep water port as an ideal stopping off place for nuclear 
missile submarines 
to michael ledeen a former administration aide who spent months 
studying official documents captured on grenada by us military 
forces the events of october 1983 had an enormous impact 
psychologically 
it may well be that 20 years from now people will say that 
was the beginning of the end of the soviet empire ledeen said 
the russians had always claimed that once a country became 
part of communist world it was there to stay grenada proved that 
it wasnt 
but former national security council aide oliver l north felt 
that grenada could not be regarded as a major defeat for 
international communism because the government there was ousted by 
foreign invaders not by a popular uprising 
assistant secretary of state langhorne a motley who like 
north played a key behindthe scenes role in coordinating the 
invasion said the episode sent a clear message to americas 
friends and adversaries 
it showed that the united states was prepared to use force in 
the defense of its national interests said motley who left 
government service in 1985 
motley insisted that the driving force behind the invasion was 
concern for the fate of the american medical students on the island 
after leftist opponents of prime minister maurice bishop deposed 
and then executed him and about 50 of his supporters on the 
bloodiest day in grenadas history 
afterward the revolutionary military council which ousted 
bishop imposed a 24hour curfew motley noted there was no official 
us presence on the island and said state department efforts to 
obtain information about the students were unsuccessful 
he and other officials were haunted by the memory of the 52 
american hostages who had been detained by iranian militants for 
444 days as motley described it alarm at the state department 
mounted as the days passed with no word on whether the students 
were safe 
he ridiculed the notion that the prime us concern in going 
ahead with the invasion was the existence of a prosoviet 
government in grenada 
the primary and overwhelming consideration was the safety of 
the students he said 
but cuban president fidel castro has said the administration 
fabricated a mountain of lies about the supposed dangers 
confronting the students he felt the administration was guided 
above all by aggressive intentions 
ramon sanchez parodi head of cubas diplomatic mission in 
washington said the stated us concern about the students was a 
very thin veil covering the reagan administrations true intent 
there was no effort of a nonmilitary nature to take the 
students out sanchez parodi said the united states he said 
had no purpose other than to impose its will on the people of 
grenada in the aftermath cuba moved quickly to bolster its own 
selfdefense worried that it might be the next american target 
answering critics reagan noted that the us intervention was 
carried out at the request of the organization of eastern caribbean 
states which was worried about grenada being used as a base of 
subversion against caribbean democracies some had security forces 
totaling only a few dozen compared with grenadas force of 4000 
when the reagan administration took office in 1981 it found the 
trends in the caribbean area worrisome leftist governments had 
assumed power over the previous two years in grenada nicaragua and 
suriname 
in grenada bishops government moved quickly to establish close 
ties with cuba a large contingent of cubans began constructing an 
airport capable of handling cubas large fleet of mig jet fighters 
although bishop insisted that the airport was designed for 
commercial purposes us military analysts were concerned that the 
facility had the potential for enabling cuba to project its 
military power for the first time into the northern tier of south 
america captured documents showed that grenada had entered into 
three military agreements with the soviet union and one each with 
cuba and north korea all secret 
whatever the objectives of the soviet bloc in grenada might have 
been the ouster of a friendly government there and its replacement 
by an avowedly proamerican regime was a setback especially for 
castro 
cuba had committed substantial resources in grenada for more 
than four years and castro had nothing to show for it the 25th 
anniversary of his own revolution which occurred nine weeks after 
the grenada invasion was a low key affair instead of the big 
extravaganza he had planned 
the invasion also produced shock waves in nicaragua and 
suriname in managua defense minister humberto ortega was 
determined not to allow the united states to use the same pretext 
for invading nicaragua as it did in grenada 
he called us ambassador anthony quainton and offered him 
unlimited use of nicaraguas bus fleet to evacuate americans from 
the country in suriname military leader desi bouterse worried 
that the large and growing cuban presence in his country might be 
seen as a provocation by the united states ordered the cubans home 
delighted that the invasion seemed to make americas adversaries 
in the hemisphere squirm one official facetiously said at the time 
that the best way to deal with nicaragua was to set up a medical 
school for americans in the country 
the invasion of course was not costfree eighteen americans 
45 grenadans and 29 cubans were killed during the fighting 
but given the fact that the students were spared potential harm 
and the soviet bloc had lost an ally in the process the 
administration felt the loss of life was worth it 
the episode helped ease the anguish of what was perhaps the 
darkest moment of the reagan presidency the deaths of 241 us 
marines in a bombing incident in lebanon just two days before the 
grenada invasion

on the day vicki belcher wanted to fly from 
washington to miami an eastern airlines advertisement proclaimed a 
189 roundtrip fare with advance purchase 
but ms belcher her mother and aunt needed a flight right away 
to attend an uncles funeral and the cheapest fare they could get 
was almost 600 each 
we just didnt go says the washington librarian lamenting 
the 1800 cost for the three tickets 
the reason for the divergent fares the airline deregulation 
act which ended government controls over airline fares and routes 
and was designed to bring competition to the airline industry and 
lower fares 
on the 10th anniversary of president carters signing of the 
measure air travel bargains still abound but so do shockingly 
high fares for travelers who do not have the luxury of planning far 
ahead or being flexibile and the cost of travel no longer has 
anything to do with how many miles one flies 
while a recent traveler booked a restricted vacation flight on 
braniff airlines that took him from washington to los angeles to 
orlando fla and back to washington for 364 an unrestricted 
roundtrip coach fare from washington to charleston sc on 
piedmont was 390 and one from washington to chicago on united 
airlines was 498 
and after a decade of air travel without strict government 
controls there also are 
increasing complaints about the concentration of the industry 
around a few megacarriers and about the dominance they wield 
in and out of some cities and through links with commuter airlines 
to entire regions of the country 
unprecedented congestion at busy airports and in the skies 
surrounding them with some airport planners notably in boston 
resorting to high landing fees to keep out smaller aircraft 
concerns among aviation safety with critics both in and out of 
the industry complaining that the federal government is unable to 
keep up with traffic growth and industry fluctuations to assure a 
continuing high level of safety 
predictions of catastrophe and defacto reregulation unless 
airports are expanded new airports built and the federal aviation 
administrations air traffic control system is modernized 
complaints that airline service continues to deteriorate 
especially in rural areas while prices are allowed to soar 
unfairly high in some markets especially between busy hub 
airports dominated by one or two airlines 
a realization by industry insiders that the days of aviation 
entrepreneurs starting an airline from scratch and taking on the 
competition has long passed the victim of the same 
megacarriers 
unless you go with one of the major carriers in a market 
sharing arrangement it would be extremely difficult to start 
something from scratch today says harold hap pareti who has 
done it twice first with people express and later with 
presidential airways 
perhaps nothing marks more clearly the first decade of 
deregulation as the emergence of the megacarriers that 
dominate air travel they are the product of 3 years in which the 
transportation department approved 21 straight airline mergers 
at the end of 1987 the countrys five biggest airlines carried 
nearly 70 percent of the traffic according to industry figures 
single airlines account for eight of every 10 flights in and out of 
st louis minneapolis pittsburgh memphis and charlotte one 
airline controls more than half of all flights in and out of 18 
hub airports across the country says an analysis by the boeing 
co 
while there is little hunger for a return of government controls 
on fares and routes sen john danforth rmo during a recent 
hearing on airline concentration echoed the sentiment of other 
members of congress and even otherwise staunch supporters of 
deregulation the concern that is before us is whether 
competition is truly working and if it is not working what are we 
supposed to do about it 
rep norman mineta dcalif chairman of the house aviation 
subcommittee agreed the question which the new congress and the 
next administration must explore in depth are first whether there 
is still enough competition to sustain the consumer benefits of 
deregulation and second if not what should be done 
alfred kahn the former civil aeronautics board chairman and one 
of the architects of airline deregulation remains one of its 
strongest defenders but also concedes some elements of todays 
marketoriented industry have gone awry and urgently cry out for 
at least some government remedies 
nevertheless says kahn the overwhelming majority of 
passengers are clearly reaping huge benefits and deregulation 
overall has brought to the overwhelming majority of travelers in 
abundant measure most of the benefits that we expected 
there have been dozens of reports and papers that draw the same 
conclusion 
virtually no one espouses bringing airline fares and routes back 
under government control some industry insiders suggest that since 
the airline industry has so dramatically reorganized itself 
committed itself to a freemarket environment and adopted such 
complex systems of established fares down to a sophisticated 
seatbyseat fare structure that to try to bring back government 
control would only lead to chaos 
and supporters of deregulation are quick to tick off what they 
call its overwhelming benefits 
last year 450 million passengers boarded commercial airliners 
compared to 275 million in l978 in another 10 years the number is 
expected to reach 800 million 
with nine out of 10 air travelers flying on some sort of 
discount fare the average cost of travel on an airliner has 
dropped 13 percent over the last decade if inflation is taken into 
account according to the transportation department 
deregulation has allowed air travel to become commonplace with 
nearly three of every four adult americans having flown at least 
once in their lifetime according to a gallup poll 525 million 
adults took an airline trip last year 
a planeload of passengers takes off from an airport somewhere 
in the country on an average of every 48 seconds 
we have indeed become a vehicle of mass transportation says 
jim landry vice president and counsel for the air transport 
association the industry group that represents the major airlines 
several studies of deregulation contend that travelers and the 
economy as a whole have immensely benefitted according to one by 
the brookings institution an estimated 10 billion in l988 dollars 
has been saved because of airline deregulation about a third in 
lower fares and the rest in better service and increased 
productivity 
but if service has improved it wasnt very evident in l986 and 
on into l987 when air travelers almost were threatening revolts 
because of long and frequent delays and shoddy service on some 
airlines 
delays attributed to air traffic problems alone shot up 25 
percent in l986 and complaints from irate airline customers to the 
transportation department quadrupled in those days travelers on 
northwest eastern or continental all airlines struggling to deal 
with massive mergers had a chance of one in two of getting to 
their destination within 15 minutes of schedule 
the industry acknowledged the problems 
service is deteriorating complaints are rising the skies and 
airports are crowded and the entire system is creaking as we seek 
to accommodate the waves of customers brought to our ticket 
counters by deregulation and cheap fares american airlines 
president robert crandall told an audience in june l987

the government sprang into action though some said it was too 
late 
congress came close to approving a broadranging air travelers 
bill of rights that called for airlines to disclose such things 
as ontime performance lost baggage and passengers bumped it also 
demanded that schedules be made more realistic and called for 
restrictions on flights at virtually all major airports to solve 
the delay problem a provision particularly worrisome to the 
airline industry 
while the bill still rests in congress it was enough to prompt 
the transportation department to direct for the first time a year 
ago that the airlines disclose monthly consumer information 
including their ontime performance 
the department also called on the air carriers to make their 
schedules closer to actual flying time and spread out flights at 
the busiest airports during peak travel periods ending such 
absurdities as had been common at chicagos ohare airport 36 
flights scheduled to arrive at precisely 915 am 
this year the number of both delays and complaints has been down 
dramatically something industry experts attribute to the fact that 
several of the largest airlines continental northwest and twa 
have overcome early merger problems and the tougher government 
stance 
in any case airline deregulation was never intended to be a 
nirvana we knew there would be bumps in the road and 
unforseen economic consequences says philip bakes now the 
president of eastern airlines but in the l970s a senate staffer 
influential in drawing up the deregulation law and later an 
attorney for the civil aeronautics board 
the scorecard clearly says its been good for the consumer 
but deregulation was never claimed to be a cureall says bakes 
adds kahn the principle failures by far have been failures 
on the part of government to fulfill its responsibilities 
nowhere has the critism of the federal government been more 
acute with the possible exception of its monitoring of safety 
than in its handling of airline mergers 
there has been an almost total hands off approach by 
government you can call it a honeymoon we went from total 
regulation to total deregulation says edmund greenslet a 
longtime airline analyst and follower of the industry the 
government said literally anything you guys want to do you can 
do 
when the government in l985 approved united airlines request to 
buy pan american world airways pacific division it unleashed the 
avalanche of airline consolidation 
the prime objective of every airline today is to establish 
critical mass says robert joedicke an analyst for shearson 
lehman sutton 
and the transportatin department critics say has done 
everything it can to help in that objective it reviewed 21 mergers 
and approved them all 
northwest airlines which felt threatened by a strong united 
pushing into the pacific absorbed republic airlines twa wishing 
to consolidate its hold on st louis bought arch competitor ozark 
air lines texas air corp the parent of continental went on a 
buying spree and captured eastern people express and frontier 
delta air lines seeking to spread along the west coast merged 
with western airlines american airlines wanting to do likewise 
bought air california and usair fearing it would become a target 
itself bought pacific southwest and then piedmont 
in the final years of the civil aeronautics board nearly a 
decade ago a proposed merger of continental and western airlines 
was turned down because of fears that it would create too much 
concentration at denver recalls elizabeth bailey a former board 
member and now a dean at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh 
such mergers as twaozark and northwestrepublic both opposed 
by the justice department would have had a very hard tough time 
getting through our regulatory board she says 
in effect says oris dunham director of the dallasfort 
worth international airport a private market cartel has begun to 
form as the largest airlines have staked out their territories 
in the markets dominated by one or two carriers the airlines 
have begun jacking up prices and use longterm leasing 
agreements advantages of frequent flyer programs and their 
airlineowned computer reservation systems to keep out competitors 
adds dunham the chairman of the airport operators council 
international 
an analysis by the boeing co says that at 18 hub airports 
where a single airline had 50 percent of the traffic travelers 
flying through the hub on connecting flights pay as much as 30 
percent below average fares but travelers whose trip begins or 
ends at the hubs usually pay as much as 40 or 50 percent more in 
some cases 
mark cooper who watches the airline industry for the consumer 
federation of america calls it price gouging and suggests 
whatever benefits there are under deregulation are getting 
awfully thin 
deregulation should not mean and cannot mean that airlines can 
create monopoly situations and therefore do anything they darned 
well please says sen danforth the missouri republican who is a 
ranking minority members of the senate commerce committee 
the airlines deny they are doing anything but working with the 
cards they have drawn under deregulation and they suggest the 
fares are far from unreasonable 
it is difficult to understand that if the airlines are 
overcharging the public why then are there not impressive profits 
being realized says robert cozzi vice president for revenue 
management at trans world airlines 
last year the airlines had operating profits of 246 billion 
but largely because of high interest costs related to the purchase 
of hundreds of new aircraft their net profits were only 601 
million a scant profit margin of 11 percent

of 30 industrial stocks down 2258 to 213727 
a year earlier the average fell 508 points and 500 billion of 
stock wealth was wiped out 
the rumor was that the washington post would publish a story 
potentially damaging to the presidential campaign of vice president 
george bush the post denied it but traders who had made profits 
in the markets recent rise were primed to sell and they did 
reporters from brazil france italy japan and new jersey nosed 
around for stories wednesday scholars discussed great panics of 
the past and author tom wolfe posed for pictures near the new york 
stock exchange 
once again in the public eye traders expressed disappointment 
at the slowness of business this year but relief that the crash did 
not permanently fracture the markets 
cbs broadcast its morning show from a balcony over the floor of 
the new york stock exchange outside george tonelli sold bumper 
stickers reading i survived the stock crash of 87 but i used 
to drive a mercedes 
except for a few seconds of boos and cheers at the opening bell 
the nyse operated as usual an army of red and bluejacketed 
workers swarming around clusters of green computer screens 
only tuesday the dow jones average had hit 215985 its 
highest point since the 1987 debacle on wednesday the dow had 
been down about 12 points when the bush rumor struck late in the 
afternoon 
the 1987 crash brought some prominent firms close to collapse as 
credit nearly dried up and those memories came flooding back on 
the anniversary 
we went through hell people were perspiring wideeyed 
we had to show signs of confidence when we werent sure what was 
going to happen we were concerned that guys wouldnt have 
strokes or heart attacks recalled peter dapuzzo otooles boss 
at shearson lehman hutton 
people still could not agree what to call what happened on oct 
19 1987 crash market break or as david ruder the 
chairman of the securities and exchange commission prefers a 
compressed large downward move in stock prices 
scholars compared the 1987 crash to the dutch tulip mania of 
163437 and the south sea bubble of 1720 not to mention us stock 
market crashes of 1873 1884 1893 1907 and 1929 
these arent singular phenomena they do recur and they share 
common characteristics said eugene white of rutgers university 
who was attending the symposium at new york universitys salomon 
brothers center 
after the new deal reforms everyone thought the markets could 
be crashproof obviously thats not the case

one year after the october crash the stock market 
remains a dangerous place for small investors seeking quick 
profits says the president of the american stock exchange 
for an individual to dart in and out of the market in 
competition with institutional investors is like me trying to 
take on ivan lendl in tennis said amex president kenneth r 
leibling 
still leibling noted wednesday stocks historically have been a 
better longterm investment than bank accounts bonds or money 
market funds 
while individual investors shouldnt play the market 
leibling said the stock market remains a superior means of 
investment if an individual is prepared to invest based on the 
fundamentals and particularly on a longterm basis 
leibling 39 in boston for an executive symposium sponsored by 
general electric co said during a news conference that he thought 
the chances of another crash were slight mainly because the us 
economy is strong and the market appears to be quite reasonably 
valued by historic standards and in relation to corporate profits 
but leibling stressed there is no guarantee it wont happen 
again despite newly approved circuit breakers that will halt 
trading temporarily if stock prices take a sudden plunge 
there is a school of thought that says that as the market 
moves toward the circuit breaker investors may rush to get out 
knowing that the markets going to close and it may even 
exacerbate the trend he said 
there is no experience with this in the markets and i dont 
think there is any guarantee that this will be productive he 
added 
the circuit breaker plan was approved tuesday as a oneyear 
experiment by the securities and exchange commission and the 
commodity futures trading commission 
if the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks drops 250 
points in a single day trading on all major us exchanges will 
automatically be halted for one hour 
if there is an additional 150 point plunge for a total of 400 
points in a single day a second circuit breaker will impose a 
twohour halt 
leibling said he does not foresee any major rise or fall in 
stock prices in the near future 
he predicted that if republican vice president george bush wins 
the presidential election there will be a continuity that could 
have a positive effect on the markets 
if democrat michael dukakis wins on the other hand there 
will be concern about changes but the markets response is 
uncertain 
traditionally its perceived on wall street that republican 
adminsitrations will be better for the market whether they really 
are or not is another matter but many times perceptions dictate 
reality when it comes to the market he said

a disneycontrolled company seeking to 
acquire polaroid corp is considering a plan to dismantle the 
instant camera pioneer if its hostile takeover succeeds court 
testimony has revealed 
shamrock holdings inc president stanley p gold testified 
wednesday on the first day of a critical legal battle with polaroid 
that no decision has been made on the proposal from wertheim 
schroeder shamrocks investment adviser 
gold said the investment bank recommended that shamrock sell off 
polaroids manufacturing businesses cut back on research and 
development reduce the administrative staff and settle pending 
antitrust litigation with eastman kodak co 
previously shamrock had said only that it would reverse 
polaroids decision to enter the 35mm film business settle the 
kodak suit and sell off certain polaroid assets shamrock advisers 
identified those assets as real estate valued at roughly 200 
million 
polaroid fell 75 cents a share to close at 3850 in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading wednesday 
gold was the only witness in the first day of the chancery court 
trial which is scheduled to take five days before vice chancellor 
caroline berger opening arguments were be given later in the trial 
shamrock a burbank califbased television and radio concern 
controlled by roy e disney filed suit in july against polaroid 
shamrock is seeking unspecified damages and asking the court to 
permanently enjoin or rescind polaroids employee stock ownership 
plan that would all but prevent shamrock from acquiring polaroid 
the plan places 14 percent of polaroid stock in employees 
hands under delaware takeover law a hostile bidder must acquire 
more than 85 percent of a targets outstanding shares for control 
polaroid is incorporated in delaware 
the 10millionshare 300 million employee stock plan was 
announced july 12 the same day polaroid canceled a july 13 meeting 
with shamrock and a week before shamrock made its first 40ashare 
bid for polaroid shamrock claims stock plan was designed to thwart 
a takeover 
shamrock was rebuffed in its unsolicited bid before making a 
hostile offer of 42 a share last month that put a value of 26 
billion on the company that introduced instant snapshots in 1948 
polaroid said the offer was too low and advised stockholders to 
reject it 
gold said that if the july 13 meeting had been held he would 
not have told polaroid he discussed takeover financing with several 
banks he also did not intend to discuss wertheim schroeders 
proposals gold said 
there was no decision made on those things and no i wasnt 
going to tell polaroid about them we hadnt made any decisions 
on wertheim schroeders ideas gold said 
he said the meeting was to determine whether or not we could 
have continued dialogue 
gold said that under an agreement with polaroid shamrock was 
not to make any proposals or offers which would require 
disclosure during the meeting 
he acknowledged that selling polaroids assets or settling the 
kodak case would not have required public disclosure gold also 
testified that he had furnished information about the proposals to 
several banks including wells fargo and the bank of nova scotia 
but i did not ask them to finance the entire acquisition 
gold said 
a january trial is scheduled to determine damages in polaroids 
successful patent infringement lawsuit against kodak polaroid is 
seeking 57 billion 
gold said he told the banks that shamrock was exploring a 
takeover of polaroid shamrock wanted to know if the banks would be 
interested in financing the venture if shamrock decided to proceed 
gold said

some negative comments by nbc sportscaster 
bob costas proved positive for the los angeles dodgers in their 43 
victory over the oakland athletics in wednesday nights game 4 of 
the world series 
right before the game began in the clubhouse the guys heard 
them say during the pregame show that this may be the worst team 
ever put on on the field to play in the fall classic dodgers 
manager tom lasorda said then they started screaming well show 
them well show them and a few of them started saying kill 
costas or something like that 
instead the dodgers took out their anger on the athletics 
prompting oakland manager tony la russa to question whether more 
than the dodgers were working against his american league champions 
im a little aggravated right now because i heard this comment 
that one of the broadcasters said on the air that the dodgers were 
the worst hitting club in the majors and that they used that in 
their meeting la russa said its no big deal but id like to 
know how they knew about that and how they used it in the meeting 
i know they were out there working not watching tv

lamar hunt has agreed to pay 17 million to perus 
stateowned mineral company to settle his part of a jury award 
against him and two of his brothers a published report said 
an attorney representing minpeco sa told the dallas morning news 
a hearing has been set today in new york so the proposed agreement 
can be reviewed by a federal judge thomas gorman representing 
minpeco said wednesday court approval is required before the 
agreement can become final 
a 1346 million verdict was rendered in august against hunt 
his brothers nelson bunker hunt and william herbert hunt and three 
other defendants for conspiring to corner the world silver market 
nine years ago 
tom whitaker a spokesman for the hunt brothers could not be 
reached by telephone by the associated press today 
negotiations have been ongoing for quite some time and it 
would be premature to comment further at this time whitaker told 
the news 
minpeco alleged the hunts sons of the late oil billionaire hl 
hunt conspired to corner the silver market in late 1979 and early 
1980 a federal jury in new york agreed with the company and 
awarded it the 1346 million 
gorman said the agreement with lamar hunt was reached after 
several weeks of negotiations in washington and new york he said 
plans called for hunt to pay the settlement by check today 
bunker and herbert hunt filed for personal bankruptcy in dallas 
late last month the chapter 11 filings which will protect the 
hunts assets from creditors while they reorganize their finances 
so far have protected them from paying the minpeco judgment 
a motion will be filed in bankruptcy court friday asking the 
court to unfreeze the hunts assets so minpeco can pursue 
collection efforts against them gorman said 
bunker hunt at the time of the bankruptcy filing said the 
thought of even a dime going to the government of peru is 
repugnant

when it comes to allimportant pocketbook 
issues george bush and michael dukakis seem to be describing 
different countries 
bushs america is one whose citizens enjoy unprecedented 
prosperity with 178 million new jobs created over the past six 
years 
good jobs at good wages the republican says swiping 
dukakis own tag line 
dukakis however describes a far different america where wages 
are stagnating and the rich have prospered at the expense of 
everyone else 
the rich have gotten richer the poor have gotten poorer and 
those in the middle and that means most of us are getting 
squeezed the democratic nominee insists 
the basic argument is over whether highpaying factory jobs are 
being replaced by lowpaying jobs in the service sector the 
united states is becoming a nation of hamburger flippers critics 
of president reagans economic recovery contend 
the issue emerged in a 1986 study done for congress by liberal 
economists barry bluestone and bennett harrison they argued that 
america may be on the verge of losing its middle class 
the two professors reached the startling conclusion that nearly 
threefifths of the jobs created during the reagan years paid less 
than 7000 by contrast such lowwage jobs represented just 
onefifth of new jobs during the prereagan 196379 period the 
authors said 
new lowerpaid service jobs just wont support a family for 
every new job in silicon valley or wall street with high pay and 
perks there are many more jobs in the shopping mall that dont 
pay much more than minimum wage bluestone and bennett write in a 
new book the great uturn 
a study in september by the democraticcontrolled senate budget 
committee reached a similar conclusion 
the dominant trend in american job creation during the 1980s 
has been for lowpaying jobs to replace those which provided a 
middleclass standard of living the report said between the 
peak of the business cycle in 1979 and the latest year of the 
current expansion only 38 percent of the increase in employment 
was in middlewage jobs 
republicans counter that many studies cited by the democrats 
slant their results by counting not only fulltime jobs but also 
parttime employment thus lowering the wage averages 
when parttime jobs are excluded the statistics show the bulk 
of job growth has been in the middle say the republicans to 
bolster this view they point to a recent study by two bureau of 
labor statistics economists 
the bls study concluded that the middle defined as earnings 
between 20000 and 60000 is indeed shrinking but that virtually 
all of the families leaving it have moved up not down 
the republicans brag that by almost all measures the reagan 
record looks better than the jimmy carter years when rapid 
inflation eroded earnings the bush campaign says median family 
incomes after adjusting for inflation have risen 10 percent 
during the reagan years after falling 7 percent from 1977 to 1981 
maybe so the dukakis camp says but this growth has been 
supported by a dramatic increase in the number of working wives as 
cashstrapped families struggle to maintain their standard of 
living 
all across america we see two parents working harder and 
harder to buy what one income could buy before the massachusetts 
governor says 
and even with more family members working the median family 
income last year of 30853 got americans back essentially to where 
they were in 1973 after posting rapid gains through the 1950s and 
1960s family incomes have been essentially flat for the past 15 
years 
economists cite several factors for this development 
first the country absorbed large numbers of new workers 
entering the labor force in the 1970s as the baby boom generation 
reached maturity young inexperienced workers were a drag on 
productivity and competed with each other for jobs holding down 
wages 
from 1949 to 1973 nonfarm productivity the amount of goods 
and services turned out in an hour rose 25 percent a year since 
rising productivity provides the room for wages to grow without 
fueling inflation median family incomes roughly doubled during 
this period 
by contrast productivity growth from 1974 through 1980 averaged 
a mediocre 04 percent a year 
in addition salaries in the late 1970s were jolted by 
doubledigit inflation caused by oilprice increases then in the 
mid1980s workers in american industries lost ground to stiff 
foreign competition as the soaring value of the dollar opened the 
country to a flood of imports and priced american products out of 
overseas markets 
many economists see signs that these unfavorable trends are 
being reversed they predict better wage gains in the 1990s 
regardless of who wins the white house 
for one thing productivity in the 1980s has been rising 14 
percent a year 
and the labor department estimates that for the rest of this 
century the labor force will grow at less than half the pace of the 
peak years of the 1970s when baby boomers flooded the job market 
this will mean a return to the labor scarcity which helped boost 
wages in the 1950s 
the drop in oil prices has helped hold inflation down and a 
decline in the value of the dollar since 1985 has helped revive 
us manufacturers 
labor market conditions are changing on a longterm basis 
says william cox an congressional research service economist we 
will see faster increases in real wages because labor is becoming 
scarce 
but rosy predictions for the future havent tempered the debate 
over the past eight years 
the democrats note that despite the longest peacetime economic 
recovery on record the number of persons living in poverty 
remained frozen last year at 135 percent of the population 
compared to a poverty rate of 117 percent in the carter year of 
1979 
arguing the rich have gotten richer they point to census bureau 
statistics showing that the share of total income going to the 
richest fifth of american families has increased to 437 percent in 
1987 compared to 416 percent in 1980 the share of income going 
to the poorest fifth has fallen to 46 percent in 1987 compared to 
51 percent in 1980 
with four years of economic growth since 1984 and unemployment 
hovering near 14year lows republicans say the pocketbook issues 
voters care about jobs and low inflation are going to help the 
gop 
this is really an argument over the question are you better 
off now than you were eight years ago the answer is very clear 
that the average worker is indeed better off said marvin 
kosters an economist with the conservative american enterprise 
institute 
bluestone responds that bush should be running away with the 
election if the republicans are right about the economy but even 
he sees a problem if the democratic analysis is correct those 
who have been hurt the most tend to vote the least

grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade reflecting disappointment in 
the slow pace of export sales despite a spurt of business on 
wednesday 
the agriculture departments rejection this morning of chinas 
bid for 400000 metric tons of subsidized us wheat disappointed 
traders and set the negative tone for early trading analysts said 
a number of smaller grain sales to foreign buyers were rumored 
this morning but analysts said traders were getting fed up with 
rumors 
most disappointing has been unsubstantiated talk of soviet 
purchases of us grains and soybeans said steve freed a grain 
analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
were being jacked around by rumors of russians buying soybean 
meal russians buying corn and i think everybodys getting rumored 
out he said 
analysts said the grain markets probably will remain in the 
doldrums until some really significant export business develops 
something like a new longterm grain agreement with the soviet 
union 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 2 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 425 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to cent higher with december at 290 a bushel oats 
were cent lower to 1 cent higher with december at 258 a 
bushel soybeans were 3 cents lower to 1 cent higher with november 
at 805 a bushel 
cattle futures were mostly higher while pork futures were mixed 
in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange

american express co on thursday reported a 13 
percent drop in its thirdquarter earnings despite record results 
in the divisions that run its credit card and financial services 
businesses 
the company attributed the decline to continued pinched profits 
at its bank and brokerage firm shearsonlehman hutton holdings 
inc and to the fact that it restated yearago earnings to reflect 
deferred tax benefits 
american express said it netted 2821 million or 66 cents a 
share in the three months ended sept 30 vs revised earnings of 
3241 million or 74 cents a share in the comparable period last 
year 
revenue during the period jumped 36 percent to 571 billion 
from 419 billion 
for the first nine months of the year american express profit 
totaled 8286 million or 194 a share on revenue of 1667 
billion that was 30 percent higher than restated earnings of 
6374 million or 144 a share and 1294 billion in revenue in 
1987 
american express said it revised the 1987 results to include 76 
million of taxdeferred benefits due to accounting changes in the 
quarter and 198 million in the ninemonth period 
the dominant story for american express is the consistent 
outstanding performance of travel related services and ids 
financial services which again posted record quarterly earnings 
chairman james d robinson iii said in a statement 
at the same time we remain confident that shearson lehman 
hutton and american express bank are wellpositioned to rebound as 
conditions in their markets improve 
at the travel related services division which runs the credit 
card and travelers checks business quarterly earnings climbed 18 
percent to a record 221 million from 188 million revenue totaled 
19 billion up 24 percent from last year 
the company said its creditcard charge volume reached a 
thirdquarter record 22 billion up 16 percent from 1987 
travelers checks sales also rose 
ids financial services had a 17 percent jump in quarterly 
earnings to a record 40 million from 34 million american express 
said the company said sales of securities annuity and investment 
certificates led the increase but sales of mutual funds and life 
insurance continued to fall 
american express banks earnings fell to 43 million in the 
third quarter compared with a 71 million profit last year mainly 
reflecting the fact that last years profit was restated due to the 
accounting changes the company said earnings also suffered from 
its ongoing program to reduce its exposure to troubled third world 
loans 
american express had reported wednesday that shearson lehmans 
thirdquarter profit dropped 85 percent to 82 million from 54 
million last year it cited sluggish business following last years 
stock market crash higher shortterm interest rates and lagging 
expenses from the purchase of ef hutton group inc a year ago

time inc has tentatively agreed to buy a 50 
percent interest in the privately held media concern whittle 
communications lp the companies announced today 
the agreement in principle calls for time the magazine giant 
to make an initial payment of 185 million and potential additional 
payments that depend on whittles growth through 1993 the 
companies said in a statement 
they said new yorkbased time also would have options to 
increase its ownership 
completion of the deal is subject to negotiation of definitive 
agreements and any required approvals the statement said 
whittle based in knoxville tenn has grown rapidly in recent 
years by concentrating on developing media vehicles such as 
magazines and sponsored posters that are aimed at reaching targeted 
audiences such as people at school and or in doctors offices 
a matchup between whittle and time would be somewhat ironic 
since whittle took great delight in recent months in tweaking the 
nose of the magazine publishing establishment as it launched a new 
magazine special reports 
special reports is a package of six magazines that are designed 
specifically for doctors waiting rooms the magazines appear 
quarterly and each is focused on areas such as family health 
sports and personalities 
but whittle angered many in the magazine business when it went 
after advertisers by telling them that the doctors who took the 
magazines into their waiting rooms would stock no more than two 
other magazines 
that provision along with the right to be the only advertiser 
in the magazines in specific product categories was designed to 
help the sponsors cut through the commercial clutter and have their 
messages stand out 
whittle chairman chris whittle announced last month as the first 
editions were being distributed to more than 16500 doctors 
offices that advertising space was sold out for two years he said 
advertisers had committed to spend 80 million and claimed it was 
one of the most successful magazine launches ever 
time is involved in publishing 23 magazines either by itself or 
through partnerships or joint ventures 
it is in a joint venture with dale lang for instance that 
publishes the magazines mccalls working woman working mother and 
baby 
in addition to special reports whittle offers about 40 other 
media properties that advertisers can use to reach consumers 
it puts up sponsored wallboards that it calls information 
centers in places such as high schools or hospitals publishes 
newsletters and offers sampling programs whittle has said he is 
interested in getting into book publishing and television 
the privatelyheld company employs 900 people recorded revenues 
of 105 million in the year that ended in june and expects revenues 
of 150 million for the year that ends in june 1989 
time which also has interests in book publishing and cable 
television earned 231 million or 4 a share on revenue of 33 
billion in the nine months ended sept 30

rjr nabisco inc announced today that top 
managers are considering offering to buy the consumerproducts 
giant for almost 17 billion a deal that would be the largest 
corporate acquisition ever 
the announcement of a possible 75ashare offer for the firm 
that manufactures oreo cookies and winston cigarettes underscored 
the soaring interest in food companies and wellknown brand names 
it came just three days after philip morris cos inc offered to 
buy processed foods manufacturer kraft inc for 11 billion and two 
days after pillsbury co rejected a 523 billion bid from the 
british firm grand metropolitan plc 
wall street apparently expected a higher offer for rjr nabisco 
the companys stock surged higher after the news broke climbing 
1975 a share to 7562 in new york stock exchange trading more 
than 56 million shares had been traded by early afternoon making 
it the most active stock on the big board 
rjr nabisco said president f ross johnson and edward a 
horrigan jr chief executive of the companys tobacco business 
had notified nabisco that they intend to seek to develop with a 
financial partner a proposal to acquire rjr nabisco in a leveraged 
buyout merger transaction 
shearson lehman hutton inc later confirmed it was the financial 
partner and was providing equity financing and advice to the 
management group 
any proposal if made would be reviewed by a special 
committee composed of outside directors which has been established 
by the board rjr nabisco said in a statement 
the group said they estimated they would offer 75 in cash for 
each of the companys approximately 225 million common shares 
outstanding 
in a leveraged buyout the buyer borrows the money to buy the 
company then pay off the debt either through company revenue or 
selling off parts of the operation 
if such a deal were completed it would be the biggest leveraged 
buyout of an american corporation by far the biggest lbo was the 
61 billion buyout of beatrice cos by an investment group led by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co in 1986 
it also would surpass the biggest corporate acquisition the 
134 billion purchase of gulf corp by chevron corp in 1984 
one wall street analyst pavlos alexandrakis of argus research 
corp said a 75ashare bid would be low 
valuing nabisco as a food company and discounting the tobacco 
operation i arrive at a value somewhere between 85 and 90 he 
said 
rjr nabisco was formed when the tobacco company rj reynolds 
industries inc bought nabisco brands inc the food and consumer 
products giant for 49 billion in 1985 
the companys products are some of the bestknown in the 
country and also include ritz crackers camel and salem 
cigarettes del monte vegetables and milkbone dog biscuits 
it is currently testmarketing a smokeless cigarette premier 
rjr nabisco had 1987 profits of 118 billion on sales of 1577 
billion food products accounted for 597 percent of the companys 
revenue while tobacco products brought in 403 percent of its 
sales 
earlier this year the company announced a reorganization of its 
food business separating its biscuit and grocery foods divisions 
into two freestanding operating companies rjr nabisco said the 
move would make it more responsive to changes in the marketplace 
in the past few years the company has sold off divisions that 
did not fit with its longrange plans including kentucky fried 
chicken 
philip morris which like rjr nabisco has tobacco and food 
businesses offered to buy kraft for 90 a share or a total of 11 
billion kraft said it was studying the offer and expected to make 
a recommendation to its shareholders by oct 31 
wall street analysts said it would be difficult for kraft to 
turn down the philip morris bid 
pillsbury said grand metropolitans 60ashare offer was 
inadequate and that it was exploring options in response to the 
bid

while politics and economics are entwined 
inextricably they are hardly supportive of each other 
they speak different languages they communicate differently 
political practitioners often take great liberties with the 
facts and so confuse voters but economists create equal confusion 
by concentrating on esoteric data that mean nothing to anyone 
they cannot live without each other but they live poorly 
together 
economic thinkers complain that practical politicians distort 
sound economic ideas political thinkers say economists dont 
understand the real world 
the relationship is sometimes even destructive 
politicians often are misled by faulty economic advice 
president gerald ford for instance launched a campaign to fight 
inflation when inflation was waning and recession was becoming the 
big problem 
and it is also true that economists may be damaged by 
politicians the former it is often said lose their objectivity 
on the day they accept a political appointment some cannot return 
to their old academic jobs 
americans are now getting a wretched dose of this fractious 
relationship as the two presidential candidates expel figures and 
facts that cannot be understood are out of context or cannot 
be verified 
as a consequence it is nearly impossible to determine the 
economic state of the united states from the political platforms or 
performances 
here are some of the broader gauges and a middleoftheroad 
assessment 
the gross national product broadest indicator of economic 
strength or weakness rose from 424 trillion in 1986 to 45 
trillion in 1987 and will reach a projected 486 trillion in 1988 
assessment steady moderate growth anything stronger might 
mean inflation weaker growth might be equally unacceptable with a 
pervasive threat of recession 
the federal deficit averaged about 144 billion in the fiscal 
year ended sept 30 a sizeable improvement from deficits of 213 
billion in 1986 and 163 billion in 1987 
assessment they are still horrendously high moreover it is 
still uncertain that the underlying problems have been resolved or 
that the trend to improvement will continue 
the trade deficit is running at a rate of less than 100 
billion its lowest since the winter of 1985 
assessment it too remains extremely high with no certainty 
that the improvement will continue american exports particularly 
of manufactured goods have been improving but imports surged 
recently 
inflation using the gross national product as a base has been 
rising from 27 percent in 1986 to 33 percent in 1987 and a bit 
more than that in 1988 
assessment rising inflation is always a threat and many 
economists fear it is a major one in 1989 but earlier worries 
about inflation have been overdone 
moreover the strongest inflation is in the consumer rather than 
producing sectors manufacturing competition now firmly on a 
global scale is keeping those price increases relatively low 
employment has been rising steadily from 1096 million in 1986 
to 1124 million in 1987 to perhaps 115 million in 1988 
unemployment has been dropping from 7 percent in 1986 to 62 
percent in 1987 to about 55 percent this year 
assessment strong figures but potentially an economic threat 
fears exist that the falling jobless rate eventually will put 
upward pressure on prices 
so far however there is little evidence that any such process 
has begun wages in fact have been unusually steady discounted 
for inflation income has grown but so has production so far it 
isnt an inflation scenario 
the consensus of forecasters seems to be that prospects for 
recession in 1989 are slim at least in the first half of the year 
assessment such forecasts are good for six months less so for 
a year and perhaps meangingless beyond that no good economist 
these days will ever make a forecast without citing the possibility 
of recession within a couple of years 
the reason for this is simply that the economic expansion has 
gone on for six years well beyond expectations and therefore may 
be vulnerable some time soon again strong statistical evidence of 
recession hasnt shown up yet

the state supreme court today rebuffed 
attorney general john van de kamps challenge to the 101 billion 
buyout of getty oil co by texaco in 1984 ruling that california 
antitrust law cannot be used against mergers 
van de kamp had argued that the merger then the second largest 
in us history would drive up gasoline prices in california by 
tying up gettys abundant oil supplies and san joaquin valley 
pipeline a major source for lowpriced independent oil firms 
rejected by state courts in attempts to block the merger in 
1984 van de kamp sought at least to require court orders making 
the former getty supplies available to independents after 1989 
when a federal trade commission order expires 
it was the first time a california attorney general had ever 
tried to use state antitrust law against mergers 
but the court ruled 43 that californias 1907 antitrust law 
the cartwright act which prohibits any combination of capital 
that might affect prices did not apply to mergers 
the opinion by chief justice malcolm lucas said the term 
combination of capital was intended to apply only to business 
dealings between two companies that maintained separate identities 
and not to a purchase of one company by another 
the california law was modeled after antitrust statutes in 
michigan and texas that had been interpreted by courts in 1899 and 
1904 not to apply to mergers lucas said he said the california 
legislature presumably aware of those rulings had amended the law 
26 times since 1907 and had never added antimerger language 
the ruling does not appear to affect van de kamps separate 
challenge to the merger of lucky and alpha beta supermarkets a 
suit that relies on federal law van de kamp is one of several 
state attorneys general who have tried to activate state antitrust 
enforcement in light of the reagan administrations reluctance to 
challenge mergers 
in an 89page dissent justice stanley mosk said california 
antitrust law could be used against mergers even those allowed by 
the federal government 
the reagan administration has all but ceased enforcing the 
federal antitrust laws as they apply to mergers mosk said 
citing a study that said the justice department had contested only 
26 out of over 10000 merger applications between 1981 and 1986 
vigorous enforcement of state antitrust laws is plainly 
necessary 
as state attorney general from 1959 to 1964 mosk established an 
antitrust division in his office and was the first to enforce state 
antitrust laws extensively 
the texacogetty merger was approved by the ftc with conditions 
requiring texaco to make oil available to independent firms through 
1989 the federal agency assumed that the independents would be 
wellsupplied after that with offshore oil 
but van de kamp said in his suit that the protections were 
inadequate arguing that offshore oil supplies were uncertain and 
were generally controlled by major refiners that would not supply 
independent companies 
he contended that neither federal antitrust law nor the ftc 
order was intended to prohibit states from using their own 
antitrust laws to attack anticompetitive effects of a merger in a 
state such as california where half to twothirds of gettys 
assets were located 
the majority in todays ruling consisting of lucas and justices 
david eagleson edward panelli and john arguelles concluded that 
california law does not authorize a state challenge to a merger and 
did not discuss whether federal approval of the merger would 
prohibit any state intervention 
mosk joined in dissent by justices allen broussard and marcus 
kaufman said combination of capital was a broad term that 
applied to mergers as well as anticompetitive agreements between 
independent companies 
that interpretation is consistent with the main goal of 
antitrust law consumer protection and was accepted by a state 
appeals court as early as 1915 leaving the legislature with no 
need to amend the law mosk said 
mosk also said the ftc order approving the merger did not 
prohibit a state from taking additional steps that are consistent 
with the goals of promoting competition and protecting consumers 
he said the remedies sought by van de kamp such as separate 
management by texaco of the former getty property and post1989 
orders guaranteeing oil supplies to independents did not conflict 
with the ftc decision

soybean futures prices collapsed thursday on the 
chicago board of trade and closed at their lowest levels since late 
july on a combination of bearish fundamental and technical factors 
most grain futures also closed lower 
soybeans opened mostly lower in sympathy with the wheat market 
which was pressured by disappointment over the agriculture 
departments rejection of chinas bid for 400000 metric tons of 
us wheat 
but soybean selling accelerated steadily fueled first by news 
of heavy beneficial rains in a major soybeangrowing area of brazil 
and later by bearish technical signals as the price for november 
delivery of soybeans broke key support levels at 8 and 788 a 
bushel 
from there it was katie bar the door said joel karlin 
research analyst with research department inc in chicago 
the november contract closed at 784 a bushel the lowest 
soybean price on the board of trade since july 26 
rumors late in the session that the soviet union had purchased 
200000 metric tons of soybean meal from argentina added to the 
selling pressure analysts said 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 423 a bushel corn was 4 
cents lower to cent higher with december at 286 a bushel oats 
were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with december at 254 a bushel 
soybeans were 10 cents to 22 cents lower with november at 784 a

percent earnings increase

francisco companys quarterly profit to growth in net interest 
income reduced operating expenses and low net credit losses

company also had higher net interest income as well as venture 
capital profits but they largely were offset by higher noninterest 
expenses

or 97 cents per share in the three months ended sept 30 compared 
to 54 million or 25 cents per share last year for the nine 
months net income totaled 461 million or 240 per share vs a 
1 billion loss last year when the company increased its loanloss 
reserves to cover shaky third world debt

reflected a 300 million increase in its third world loanloss

zenith electronics corp said thursday it 
returned to profitability in the third quarter and the companys 
chairman predicted the beleaguered firm would show a yearend 
pretax profit for the first time since 1984 
for the threemonth period ended oct 1 zeniths aftertax 
profit totaled 3 million or 11 cents a share compared with a net 
loss of 251 million or 99 cents a share in the yearago period 
it marked the companys first quarterly profit since the fourth 
quarter of 1987 and came as a relief to zenith officials who are 
battling a takeover bid by dissident shareholders 
thirdquarter sales climbed 15 percent to 682 million from 592 
million 
we are delighted that we have returned to the black albeit a 
small black jerry k pearlman zeniths chairman and president 
told a news conference following the release of the thirdquarter 
results 
the results included a gain of 26 million from the sale of 
property including unused factory space warehouses and vacant 
land pearlman said 
for the first nine months zenith reported a loss of 87 
million or 34 cents a share compared with a loss of 238 
million or 99 cents a share in the same 1987 period revenue for 
the ninemonth period were 185 billion compared with 168 
billion in 1987 
pearlman said costcutting measures had enabled zenith the 
only company still manufacturing televisions in the united states 
to lower prices on its televisions videocassette recorders and 
other consumer electronics to levels competitive with imports 
he said certain zenith televisions and less expensive vcrs were 
in such high demand that the company had fallen behind in filling 
orders 
while others in the industry have announced their intentions to 
raise tv prices weve already implemented selective tv and vcr 
price increases that if they hold should help fourthquarter 
profitability pearlman said 
zenith is battling its largest shareholder new yorkbased 
brookhurst partners lp for control of the company last week 
brookhurst launched a consent solicitation which is similar to a 
proxy vote seeking shareholder approval for its plan to gain 
control of zeniths board of directors and sell the company 
pearlman said the cost of fighting brookhurst had disrupted 
zeniths own efforts to improve the performance of its consumer 
electronics division through some kind of arrangement with other 
companies 
because of the consent solicitation pearlman also tempered his 
rosy forecasts for fourth quarter and yearend results with a 
warning required by the securities and exchange commission that 
the predictions were based on his best understanding of the 
situation and might not come true in case of an unexpected setback 
brookhursts consent solicitation ends on dec 4 
zeniths thirdquarter sales of computer systems and components 
increased 17 percent to 392 million while sales of consumer 
electronics the division that is the source of zeniths financial 
problems advanced 13 percent to 290 million

commerce secretary c william verity 
said thursday the us trade deficit is a cancer on this 
society and urged the united states to attack its 57 billion 
deficit with japan by exporting more 
but he told business leaders from japan and the governors of 
seven southeastern states that changes in the japanese distribution 
system are also needed to help in the effort 
verity spoke to the joint meetings of the southeast united 
statesjapan association and its japanese counterpart the 
japansoutheast united states association the groups work to 
foster better business ties between japan and the southeast 
speaking with reporters later verity said if were going to 
reduce the trade imbalance we have to increase exports to japan 
im convinced we can ease that trade imbalance in the next three to 
four years 
verity called the deficit a cancer on this society and 
warned american producers will not be able to survive as long as 
they only depend on the us market 
asked about democrat michael dukakis prediction that he will 
eliminate the trade deficit in four years verity said the only way 
that could be done is by putting up trade barriers or by a 
recession 
verity said the american people dont want either and are 
willing to see a gradual cut in the trade deficit as exports grow 
during his speech verity noted progress has been made in easing 
the trade imbalance with recent agreements that allow american 
companies more access to japanese construction projects and the new 
omnibus trade bill 
he said the measure should not cause any problem for trade 
between the two nations 
it will be administered in a very enlightened way and japan 
has nothing to fear from that trade bill he said 
to ease the trade deficit he said steps need to be taken to 
change the old japanese product distribution system a system 
which for imports often double or triples the price of the 
product before it gets to the consumer 
verity a resident of beaufort sc said a recent trade 
mission to japan showed that there are markets there for top 
quality american goods 
he said while the united states welcomes japanese investment 
which creates jobs the united states must export more 
meanwhile the southeast continues to be a fertile ground for 
japanese investment in this nation 
as of august japanese investment in the sevenstate region of 
alabama florida georgia north carolina south carolina 
tennessee and virginia totaled 52 billion 
there are 478 japaneseowned countries in the region which have 
created a total of 8085 jobs

the pilots union at trans world airlines inc on 
thursday withdrew its legal petition for an immediate injunction 
blocking chairman carl icahns plan to take the airline private 
the pilots retained their lawsuit against icahns privatization 
scheme however 
the pilots withdrawal of the petition which came at a 
preliminary hearing before new york state supreme court judge 
michael j dontzin was in return for a guarantee that icahn gave 
at the hearing the financier promised that if the pilots lawsuit 
against his plan is decided in their favor he would reinvest in 
the airline around 470 million that he originally planned to take 
out of it 
a trial on the pilots lawsuit has been scheduled for the first 
week of december 
in addition the union representing twa flight attendants has 
asked the department of transportation to block the privatization 
and freeze the airlines assets while it investigates icahns 
fitness to continue managing twa 
the twa pilots union joined the flight attendants petition 
about two weeks ago 
until our concerns are resolved we have to press forward with 
all the avenues we can said kent scott vice chairman of the twa 
pilots union in st louis 
the consumer federation of america has filed a similar petition 
joan wages a spokeswoman in new york for the twa flight 
attendants union said the groups petition to the dot will remain 
active following icahns guarantee and the pilots move 
were very pleased about that ms wages said referring to 
icahns commitment 
the twa chairman who now owns around 77 percent of twas 305 
million common shares outstanding won approval from shareholders 
in early september for his privatization plan 
the airline said thursday it expects the transaction to be 
completed on oct 24 
under the plan icahn and the financial entities controlled by 
him would own about 90 percent of twas stock while the remaining 
shares would be held by an employee stock ownership plan 
airline industry analysts estimate the bid puts a value of 
around 40 a share or 3048 million on the twa shares that icahn 
does not already own 
icahn recently broke off efforts to acquire ailing eastern 
airlines a subsidiary of texas air corp after failing to 
structure a deal that would satisfy the carriers unions

the decline occurred despite a rise in ninemonth revenue to 
13 billion from 12 billion 
times mirror based in los angeles said the 14 percent rise in 
its thirdquarter profit was due mainly to the sale of timber lands 
and the times mirror press 
the company which publishes the los angeles times newsday and 
the baltimore sun said it netted 809 million or 62 cents a 
share up from 706 million or 55 cents a share a year earlier 
thirdquarter revenue rose 48 percent to 8148 million from 
7775 million 
the sale of the timber lands and times mirror press boosted 
revenues that were declining because of lost advertising dollars 
the company said 
strong revenues from the companys professional publishing 
businesses and cable television operations also helped offset 
declines in newspaper publishing and broadcast tv times mirror

food and tobacco giant rjr nabisco inc said 
thursday some of its top executives were considering taking the 
company private in a leveraged buyout which at nearly 17 
billion would be the largest corporate acquisition in history 
the company known for products that include camel and winston 
cigarettes oreo cookies and ritz crackers also announced a 109 
percent increase in its thirdquarter income 
the morning announcement of the possible 75ashare offer 
which came in the midst of takeover activity involving other big 
food companies sent rjr nabiscos stock price soaring but it 
also left investment analysts puzzled about the purpose and price 
of the proposal 
rjr nabisco said president f ross johnson and edward a 
horrigan jr chief executive of the companys tobacco business 
had notified the firm they intend to seek to develop with a 
financial partner a proposal to acquire rjr nabisco in a leveraged 
buyout merger transaction 
the company said the group was considering offering about 75 in 
cash for each of the companys approximately 225 million common 
shares outstanding making the proposal worth about 1688 billion 
the company said late thursday the offer will be reviewed by a 
special committee of outside directors led by chairman charles e 
hugel the committee has retained investment bankers dillon read amp 
co inc and lazard freres amp co inc to advise it 
shearson lehman hutton inc said it was advising the management 
group and would provide equity and financing for the deal 
analysts said the proposal was too low and investors apparently 
agreed rjr nabisco stock surged 2137 a share to 7725 on the 
new york stock exchange where it was the most actively traded 
issue 
valuing nabisco as a food company and discounting the tobacco 
operation i arrive at a value somewhere between 85 and 90 a 
share said pavlos alexandrakis an analyst with argus research 
corp in new york 
im telling our clients to hold on to the stocks i think 
something else is going to happen he said 
lawrence adelman an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
said the deal was an indication of how undervalued rjr nabiscos 
stock was having been driven lower by worries over recent tobacco 
liability lawsuits 
but adelman said investors currently are paying more attention 
to companies ability to generate cash rather than provide 
earnings and that makes companies with undervalued stocks 
especially attractive 
he said rjr nabiscos stock should trade at between 90 and 100 
a share and said johnson the company president is trying to 
steal the company at 75 a share 
thursdays announcement moved standard amp poors corp the 
credit rating service to place rjr nabisco on its creditwatch 
list because such a deal would severely weaken the firms balance 
sheet 
if the deal were completed it would be the biggest leveraged 
buyout of an american corporation by far the largest lbo was the 
61 billion buyout of beatrice cos by an investment group led by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co in 1986 
in a leveraged buyout the buyer borrows the money to buy the 
company then pays off the debt either through company revenue or 
selling off parts of the operation 
it also would surpass the biggest corporate acquisition the 
134 billion purchase of gulf corp by chevron corp in 1984 
analysts speculated the management group was motivated by 
concern that the company could become the target of another suitor 
the food industry has been awash with takeover bids of late on 
monday philip morris cos inc offered to buy processed foods 
manufacturer kraft inc for 11 billion and tuesday pillsbury co 
rejected a 523 billion bid from the british firm grand 
metropolitan plc 
rjr nabisco was formed when the tobacco company rj reynolds 
industries inc bought nabisco brands inc the food and consumer 
products giant for 49 billion in 1985 
johnson came to the conglomerate from nabisco and last year 
shifted the companys headquarters from winstonsalem nc to 
atlanta in a move seen as an attempt to distance the company from 
its tobacco beginnings 
the companys products are some of the bestknown in the 
country and also include salem cigarettes lorna doone and 
mallomar cookies chuckles and junior mints candy del monte 
vegetables and milkbone dog biscuits 
it is currently testmarketing a smokeless cigarette premier 
in the quarter ended sept 30 rjr nabisco said it earned 355 
million or 155 per share on sales of 416 billion compared to 
320 million or 124 per share on sales of 384 billion in the 
same quarter last year 
income from tobacco operations was 497 million in the quarter 
on sales of 178 billion while food income accounted for 276 
million on 238 billion in sales 
for the first nine months of the year the company said it 
earned 982 million or 414 a share up 17 percent from 839 
million or 324 a share in the same period a year earlier sales 
for the first three quarters rose to 122 billion from 113 
billion 
in 1987 rjr nabisco had profits of 118 billion on sales of 
1577 billion that level of sales would make rjr nabisco the 
third largest privately held company in the country according to 
forbes magazine behind cargill a commodity trading company and 
safeway stores inc the grocery chain 
earlier this year the company announced a reorganization of its 
food business separating its biscuit and grocery foods divisions 
into two freestanding operating companies rjr nabisco said the 
move would make it more responsive to changes in the marketplace 
in the past few years the company has sold off divisions 
including kentucky fried chicken that did not fit with its 
longrange plans

usx corp has not received any realistic offers 
for its idled baytown plant since the steel and oil giant agreed to 
wait six months before negotiating a sale to iraq the companys 
chairman said wednesday 
wed love to sell the mill at a full price said david m 
roderick usx chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
but i dont know what will happen 
usx stirred up controversy this summer after confirming it was 
negotiating a deal to dismantle the plant and sell its equipment to 
iraq which wanted it to build pipes for irrigation and oil 
production 
opposition to the proposed iraq sale has been led by us rep 
jack fields rtexas whose district includes baytown fields 
claims the sale would cause a loss of us jobs and steelmaking 
capacity 
roderick told members of the houston club wednesday a letter of 
intent had been worked out to sell the equipment but iraq never 
followed through with the money 
a couple of weeks ago at the request of us rep jack brooks 
dtexas roderick said he agreed to wait six months before 
entering any agreement with iraq and to consider offers from 
domestic buyers 
roderick said brooks told him that also would give congress time 
to consider whether to pass sanctions against iraq for its alleged 
poison gas attacks on kurdish villages in the northern part of the 
country during its war with iran 
that bill which includes an amendment that could require usx to 
obtain presidential approval before it sells any equipment to iraq 
is pending in the senate 
since that time prospective buyers have looked at the plant but 
no realistic offers have been made roderick said 
were not giving it away he added 
roderick would not confirm reports the proposed sale of the 
plants equipment to iraq was for 100 million but he did say any 
sale to a domestic buyer required more money because it also would 
involve land 
weve had some people who have looked at it and im sure will 
look at it again weve had an offer on it before which we have 
said has been unacceptable to us and whether somebody will make us 
another offer we cant tell he said 
a realistic offer he said is one that meets my price all 
cash 
roderick denied claims that usx does not want to sell the plant 
to a us company because it fears further competition

american telephone amp telegraph co reported 
thursday its thirdquarter earnings rose 162 percent on the 
strength of cost cutting and strong sales growth 
bell atlantic corp one of the regional operating companies 
spun off in the breakup of the bell system nearly five years ago 
said its profit rose 6 percent 
atampt said its net income for the quarter ended sept 30 was 587 
million or 55 cents per share up from 505 million or 47 cents 
per share in the same period a year ago revenue rose 32 percent 
to 875 billion from 847 billion 
atampt chairman robert e allen attributed the results to 
doubledigit growth in product sales and an increase in 
longdistance revenues 
product sales for the quarter rose 124 percent and sales of 
services increased by 22 percent rental revenues which account 
for less than 10 percent of total revenues declined 
staff redeployment to sales positions and a hiring halt also 
helped bolster the latest results atampt said the hiring halt 
announced in july reduced the work force by 4000 to 311000 as of 
sept 30 
for the first nine months of the year earnings were up 82 
percent to 167 billion or 156 per share compared with 155 
billion or 142 per share in 1987 revenue increased 34 percent 
to 2585 billion from 2499 billion 
atampt noted its plan announced earlier to lower interstate 
longdistance prices by 697 million on dec 1 it also said it was 
stepping up its shift to a digital telephone network which could 
result in faster depreciation of old analog equipment and related 
facilities 
that process could affect future earnings since the equipment 
and plant have book value of 4 billion to 5 billion but atampt 
said it could not estimate the impact until further study was 
completed later this year 
bell atlantic said its net profit totaled 341 million or 172 
a share in the quarter compared with earnings of 3218 million 
or 162 a share a year earlier revenue increased to 261 
billion from 259 billion 
for the nine months earnings increased 6 percent to 101 
billion or 512 a share compared with 9554 million or 480 a 
share in 1987 revenue was unchanged at 77 billion 
bell atlantic which is based in philadelphia attributed its 
results to increased sales efficiency and growth in the regional 
economy the company serves six eastern states and the district of 
columbia 
the company said its increased business was attributed to lower 
rates for local and toll services and reduced charges for access to 
longdistance companies

kraft inc target of an 11 billion 
takeover bid fired off a terse letter to the chairman of philip 
morris cos thursday rejecting a request for negotiations 
the letter disclosed that kraft chairman john m richman crossed 
paths with philip morris chairman hamish maxwell a few days before 
the business world was stunned by mondays cash bid 
you did not see fit to discuss your takeover attempt when we 
were together at the grocery manufacturers of america meeting last 
wednesday and thursday richman wrote 
nor did you see fit to tell me that you were planning on 
filing a bizarre and baseless lawsuit against me and our board of 
directors monday he said 
you must have been planning your takeover bid for a long time 
we intend to take our time and study the situation very carefully 
we have a fiduciary duty to our shareholders and an obligation to 
our employees customers suppliers and communities to do so 
new yorkbased philip morris 90ashare offer would give it 
control of a company that has a 25 percent stake of the us market 
for natural cheese and 60 percent of the processed cheese market 
maxwell said thursday that philip morris had 64 banks lined up 
to finance the deal 
our cash offer is a generous one he said 
buying kraft would make philip morris the king of supermarket 
aisles with products ranging from miller lite beer and jello to 
such nonkraft brands as miracle whip sealtest and breyers ice 
cream celestial seasonings tea and lenders bagels 
philip morris whose main businesses are brewing tobacco and 
food has filed a lawsuit in us district court in chicago 
challenging krafts first line of defense a poison pill that 
kicks in when an unwanted suitor acquires 20 percent of kraft stock 
in that event kraft would double the number of shares making a 
buyout expensive 
analysts however believe poison pill challenges are standard 
procedure and they doubt a battle for kraft would turn on a court 
case 
in an unrelated matter kraft said it signed a letter to acquire 
mueller food service corp based in menomonee falls wis terms of 
the deal were not disclosed but mueller had sales of 60 million 
in its 1987 fiscal year

sen william proxmire frustrated by his 
unsuccessful fight to pass legislation restructuring the nations 
banking system on thursday called for regulators to act without 
waiting for congress 
congress has failed to do the job the wisconsin democrat 
said there is not a scrap of real evidence that congress will 
act in the future the time has come for the federal reserve board 
to act 
the statement by proxmire who is chairman of the senate banking 
committee brought him in direct conflict with house speaker jim 
wright dtexas and house banking committee chairman fernand j st 
germain dri wright last week warned federal reserve board 
chairman alan greenspan that changes in the banking system are 
rightfully a legislative concern and st germain threatened to 
use the next bank bill to reverse any regulatory changes between 
now and then 
in march the senate overwhelmingly passed legislation 
permitting banks to underwrite securities forbidden turf since 
1933 when congress enacted the glasssteagall act separating 
banking from the securities business as part of the wave of 
depressionera reforms 
proxmire has argued that technological developments since then 
have allowed securities firms to poach on banks traditional 
business and have put banks at a competitive disadvantage 
as a tribute to the banking chairman the senate named its bill 
after proxmire who is retiring after 31 years in congress 
however the legislation ran aground in the house last week 
after st germain and rep john dingell dmich chairman of the 
house energy and commerce committee failed to settle a 
jurisdictional feud over which committee would have the greater say 
over the bill 
proxmire had hoped to circumvent the house tangle by having the 
senate pass the bill again in pieces and send it back to the 
house but when his package came to the senate floor on wednesday 
sen alfonse damato dny a supporter of the securities 
industry and one of only two senators opposing the original bill 
blocked it 
st germain promised action on the bank bill before the snow 
melts next year but proxmire said that is not going to happen 
this year and it almost certainly wont happen next year or for 
many years to come 
citing a supreme court decision in june that upheld the feds 
power to permit bank underwriting of securities proxmire said 
the fed should move and move promptly in the future

texas businessman lamar hunt paid 17 million to 
perus stateowned mineral company thursday to settle his part of a 
jury finding that he and two of his brothers plotted to corner the 
world silver market 
the settlement was approved by us district judge morris e 
lasker who presided over the nearly sevenmonth civil trial in 
manhattan of hunt and his brothers nelson bunker hunt and william 
herbert hunt 
the trial ended with the jury finding that the brothers sons of 
the late oil billionaire hl hunt owed 132 million in damages to 
minpeco sa the peruvian minerals concern 
the settlement involved only lamar hunt 56 who is owner of the 
kansas city chiefs of the national football league 
his attorney paul curran told lasker that lamar hunt was 
settling the matter because he wanted to put an end to the very 
heavy legal and emotional costs of this litigation 
hunts office in kansas city mo issued a statement saying the 
17 million was a small fraction of the liabilities possible 
under the judgment interest and ongoing costs inherent in 
continuing the legal action 
curran also maintained that the settlement did not alter lamar 
hunts contention that he had done nothing wrong 
hunts statement said in spite of the fact that the claims 
against me were totally unwarranted because of the uncertainties 
of litigation and the substantial cost associated with further 
proceedings i made the business decision to put the litigation 
behind me so that i can spend my time pursuing positive business 
interests 
a lawyer representing some 17000 investors who are suing the 
hunts and others in two large classaction suits complained to 
lasker about certain aspects of the settlement 
the lawyer herbert deutsch noted that under the settlement 
the minpeco verdict against lamar hunt could not be used in the 
class action lawsuits and the allegations would have to be proven 
all over again in effect making 6 months of trial a nullity 
but lasker said he was pleased to approve the settlement 
i always believe settlement is better than disposition by 
other means he said 
under the settlements terms lamar hunt paid 17 million to 
minpeco and the outcome of the jurys finding against him was 
dismissed by lasker 
after the 17 million check had been turned over mark cymrot 
minpecos attorney said we view this as the first installment 
payment by the hunts 
he said minpeco was pursuing bunker and herbert hunt in 
bankruptcy court 
those two brothers filed for personal bankruptcy in dallas late 
last month the chapter 11 filings which will protect the hunts 
assets from creditors while they reorganize their finances so far 
have protected them from paying the 13245 million jury award 
last august a federal court civil jury found the three hunts 
were part of an unsuccessful scheme nine years ago to corner the 
world silver market 
the jury found in favor of minpeco which sued the hunts 
claiming it lost more than 100 million after the silver market 
collapsed in march 1980 
minpecos lawyers said they would file papers at bankruptcy 
court in dallas on friday seeking to unfreeze the hunts assets so 
minpeco could pursue collection efforts against them 
we believe that our clients claims cannot be discharged by 
the bankruptcy action said one of minpecos lawyers thomas o

the great atlantic amp pacific tea co inc 
sweetened its offer thursday for delchamps inc a mobilebased 
grocery chain to 32 a share from 30 just days after both 
companies took the takeover battle to federal court 
the only comment we have is that our directors will meet in 
the near future to review and evaluate their offer and we will 
release our findings at that time said delchamps spokesman joel 
swanson 
swanson said he did not know if the tender offer worth 224 
million had an expiration date 
the previous 30 a share offer worth 210 million was to 
expire nov 4 aampp tried to buy delchamps for 27 a share last 
october and for 24 a share in 1986 
each grocery store chain is suing the other in us district 
court in mobile as aampp seeks to reestablish itself on the gulf 
coast and delchamps tries to retain its regional domain 
delchamps filed a lawsuit monday accusing aampp of failing to 
disclose potential violations of antitrust laws in its takeover 
proposal and devising a plan to financially cripple delchamps even 
if it fails to buy the company 
aampp filed a counter lawsuit wednesday against delchamps seeking 
a court order that would prevent the mobilebased grocery chain 
from blocking any threat to its control 
the suit filed in us district court in mobile accuses 
delchamps of taking repeated steps to thwart serious 
consideration of its proposed acquisition by aampp a maryland 
corporation headquartered in new jersey 
aampp already owns 45 percent of delchamps 7 million shares of 
stock swanson said 
aampp accuses delchamps in its lawsuit of misleading its 
shareholders and the investment community 
unless delchamps is prevented from taking further actions to 
block any threat to its control the suit claims the mobile 
company may take other actions to block shareholders from fairly 
considering aampps offer 
in a letter mailed to shareholders monday delchamps chairman 
and president af delchamps jr said the delchamps board 
determined that aampps offer is inadequate and it was in the 
stockholders best interest for the company to remain independent 
delchamps accused aampp of starting a fight to pick off the 
company at a cheap price and proceed with its plan to achieve 
dominance in the gulf coast retail stores market or at least to 
cause internal dissension and uncertainty thereby weakening 
delchamps as a competitor 
delchamps stock has been trading at slightly more than 27 a 
share since aampp began making the latest takeover attempt 
delchamps which operates 102 stores had sales of about 700 
million last year 
aampp which has 1170 stores in the united states and canada had 
sales of 96 billion in 1987

the state supreme court ruled thursday that 
attorney general john van de kamp could not use california 
antitrust law to challenge the federally approved 101 billion 
buyout of getty oil co by texaco the second largest merger in 
us history 
the court ruled 43 that californias 1907 antitrust law does 
not apply to mergers 
van de kamp who had contended the 1984 merger would eventually 
lead to higher gasoline prices in the state by drying up oil 
supplies to cutrate independent refiners said the setback would 
not end his efforts to strengthen state antitrust enforcement 
i believe that the reagan administrations abdication of 
antitrust enforcement made it important to use california law to 
rein in mergers that threaten our states economy van de kamp 
told reporters after the ruling 
he said he would ask the legislature to broaden state law to 
expressly cover mergers and would challenge other mergers under 
federal antitrust law such as his suit against the merger of the 
lucky and alpha beta supermarket chains a federal judge in los 
angeles has ordered the two markets to continue operating 
separately a ruling that is being appealed 
federal law allows challenges to mergers but has some drawbacks 
including a lack of authority under current interpretations to 
require a merged company to sell off some of its holdings van de 
kamp said at issue in the luckyalpha beta appeal is whether 
federal law allows the attorney general to challenge a merger on 
behalf of the people of the state 
texaco lawyer laurence popofsky praised thursdays decision and 
said suits like van de kamps raise the question of whether it is 
appropriate to have 50 state attorney generals secondguessing 
federal authorities on mergers in interstate commerce 
the texacogetty case was the first attempt by a california 
attorney general to use state antitrust law against a merger and 
is an example of efforts by van de kamp and his counterparts in 
other states to fill the gap left by the reagan administrations 
relaxation of federal antitrust enforcement 
van de kamp is also leading an eightstate lawsuit in federal 
court claiming a conspiracy by insurance companies to cut back on 
coverage to public agencies and drive up rates 
in a dissent to thursdays ruling justice stanley mosk who as 
state attorney general from 1959 to 1964 was the first to enforce 
californias antitrust laws extensively said that in light of 
federal policy vigorous enforcement of state antitrust laws is 
plainly necessary 
the reagan administration has all but ceased enforcing the 
federal antitrust laws as they apply to mergers mosk said 
citing a study that said the justice department had contested only 
26 out of over 10000 merger applications between 1981 and 1986 
the majority opinion by chief justice malcolm lucas did not 
discuss whether a state could or should have its own policy on 
mergers ruling only that californias 81yearold cartwright act 
did not apply 
the texacogetty merger was second in size only to chevrons 
132 billion acquisition of gulf more than half of gettys 
property consisted of california crude oil it also owned a 
632mile san joaquin valley pipeline the only one in the state 
available to independent refiners 
the federal trade commission allowed the texaco buyout in june 
1984 requiring only that texaco continue sales of former getty oil 
to independent refiners in california through april 1989 after 
that the ftc assumed new supplies of offshore oil would be 
available to the independents 
after state courts refused to block the merger van de kamp 
maintained his suit asking at least for additional protections for 
the independents such as extensions of their oil purchase 
contracts beyond 1989 and guaranteed access to the pipeline he 
said the offshore supplies were uncertain and would be controlled 
by major refiners who would not sell to independents 
sacramento superior court judge benjamin diaz and a state 
appeals court dismissed the suit saying ftc approval of the 
merger after consideration of the issues raised by van de kamp 
precluded a state lawsuit the supreme court majority reached the 
same result by different reasoning 
lucas said mergers are not covered by the language of the 
cartwright act which prohibits any combination of capital that 
might affect prices 
the chief justice said the california law was modeled after 
antitrust statutes in michigan and texas that had been interpreted 
by courts in 1899 and 1904 to apply only to business dealings 
between two companies that maintained separate identities and not 
to a purchase of one company by another 
mosk in a dissent joined by justices marcu kaufman and allen 
broussard said the language of the california law on 
combinations of capital clearly was broad enough to cover 
mergers

eastern airlines flight attendants wont join 
other unions at eastern in trying to block the 365 million sale of 
the northeast shuttle to developer donald trump an attorney said 
in court thursday 
union attorney arthur luby said the transport workers union was 
attempting to negotiate a contract with trump for the 300 flight 
attendants who work on the threecity shuttle the only profitable 
operation at miamibased eastern 
because of the very very difficult working conditions the 
union couldnt in good conscience go and do something that forces 
them to continue to work for eastern when they might have a chance 
to do something to improve their lot luby told us district 
judge barrington d parker at a hearing on the proposed deal 
two other unions at eastern the international association of 
machinists and the air line pilots association have announced 
plans to seek a preliminary injunction to block the cash sale 
the machinists and pilots contend that the deal is part of an 
attempt by easterns parent texas air corp to undermine the 
strength of organized labor texas air says it needs to sell the 
shuttle to get needed cash in order to save eastern from financial 
failure 
the unions have sought to use the mandatory bargaining 
provisions of the railway labor act to stop eastern from laying off 
employees and cutting operations of the ailing carrier 
parker whose order barring eastern from laying off more than 
3000 employees was overturned last month by a federal appeals 
court gave the two unions until nov 21 to request a preliminary 
injunction 
although he suggested that the unions might be baying at the 
moon in light of the appeals court ruling on the layoffs parker 
said he considered the shuttle deal a separate issue and that he is 
prepared to hear arguments on it 
the shuttle sale is scheduled to be completed by dec 15 parker 
indicated he would hold a hearing in the first two weeks of 
december a schedule that sets the stage for another eleventhhour 
court battle between eastern and the unions

offer from an investment group and boosted the value of the 
companys own restructuring plan 
cardinal acquisition corp headed by brothers steven m and 
mitchell p rales of washington dc had increased its hostile 
offer from 70 a share to 74 on monday the tender offer was 
extended until 11 pm oct 31 
theres probably more to come laurence c day a newhard 
cook analyst said of the bid by the raleses theyve indicated 
that theyve always indicated that all along 
intercos financial advisers wasserstein perella amp co 
recommended rejection of cardinals latest offer labeling it 
inadequate 
separately cardinal said in a release that a federal appeals 
court lifted an injunction against the tender offer the ruling by 
the us court of appeals for the third circuit in philadelphia 
allows cardinal to purchase interco shares 
interco for which cardinal originally bid 64 in july rose 62 
cents to 7112 a share in trading on the new york stock exchange 
thursday 
the stock wouldnt be where it is if it werent for the 
takeover offer first boston industry analyst margaret gilliam 
said in new york city if the offer is increased i think it will 
be by only small increments from here on out 
interco also announced that as a part of a restructuring and 
recapitalization plan outlined last month it has declared an 
additional special dividend totaling 3080 per share in cash and 
securities

this point to really see what the total value of the interco 
package would be

irans oil minister gholamreza aqazadeh 
said thursday iran would not accept production parity with iraq a 
goal sought by the majority of opec oil ministers who met in the 
spanish capital to discuss how to stem excess output by cartel 
members 
following the 90minute session at the algerian embassy of the 
price and longterm strategy committees of the organization of 
petroleumexporting countries spokesman james audu said the 
organizations secretary general subroto would hold a news 
conference friday morning prior to beginning a second meeting 
after the meeting broke up iraqs oil minister issam 
abdulraheem alchalabi said it was too early for him to comment on 
his countrys position on a production sharing agreement 
indonesias oil minister ginandjar kartasasmita told reporters 
there were some miles to go before a production agreement could 
be reached but added that all 13 opec members were committeed to 
finding a solution to current discord 
current opec production is estimated at around 20 million to 21 
million barrels a day far above the cartels official ceiling of 
1506 million barrels a day 
saudi arabia kuwait and the united arab emirates have proposed 
174 million barrels a day including iraqs share as a more 
realistic ceiling 
iraq now outside the quota system has demanded a quota equal 
to that of iran at 2369 million barrels a day 
analysts report that iraq has been pumping at least 26 million 
barrels of crude a day an amount that could rise to 37 million 
barrels in mid1989 with the completion of a a new pipeline through 
saudi arabia to the red sea 
iran has been pumping 25 million barrels a day the analysts 
say 
oil ministers from saudi arabia venezuela and nigeria all said 
thursday they would only accept a new production pact if it 
included iraq 
but aqazadeh who is meeting with his iraqi counterpart 
alchalabi for the first time in an opec setting since an august 
ceasefire ended the eightyear gulf war said iran would not 
accept an agreement that gave iraq production parity he added he 
had no alternative proposals to solve the longstanding problem 
both iran and iraq want to pump and sell as much oil as possible 
to increase revenue to rebuild their warbattered nations 
venezuelan oil minister julio cesar gil said thursday if opec 
nations dont comply with their production quotas under any new 
agreement the cartel would simply find itself facing the same oil 
glut that has been forcing prices down in the past months 
an excess of oil on international markets has sent prices 
tumbling to below 12 a barrel in recent weeks far below the opec 
target of 18 a barrel 
the opec price committee includes oil ministers from algeria 
saudi arabia nigeria indonesia and venezuela 
ministers from iraq iran kuwait saudi arabia and venezuela 
sit on the longterm strategy committee 
the remaining opec members are ecuador gabon libya qatar and 
the united arab emirates 
the price committee met sept 2526 in madrid without resolving 
the production problem all 13 opec members are to meet in vienna 
in november

the united auto workers union and 
caterpillar inc have reached a contract accord on all issues 
except those to be addressed by the union at the local level chief 
uaw negotiator bill casstevens said late thursday 
casstevens said the union will strike however unless 
caterpillar meets with uaw locals and settles their issues by 11 
pm friday 
the issues that remain that separate us are issues that we say 
are local in nature said casstevens secretarytreasurer of the 
uaw international the company disagrees with us 
casstevens said the locals would be authorized to take 
whatever action they deemed necessary including a strike if the 
deadline was not met 
a spokesman for caterpillar was not immediately available for 
comment 
casstevens confirmed that one of the main issues still 
separating the two sides was contract provisions concerning special 
job classifications which restrict workers from transferring 
between jobs within the company 
we are saying we have an understanding on the central items 
that we could recommend to the membership the items that separate 
us are items that we say are local in nature and have to be 
resolved on the local table casstevens said 
he said he hoped the company would resume talks on the local 
level 
were sending them back to the local table casstevens said 
we hope theyll talk you cant resolve it without doing that 
the local unions that reportedly have not reached local 
agreements with the company include east peoria aurora and 
decatur ill 
jerry brown bargaining chairman of local 974 of peoria said 
the local was prepared to strike he said it had given the company 
a proposal tuesday and was waiting for a response 
brown said the union would not to grant an extension on its 
local talks he said the union had considered the economic 
consequences of staging a walkout but added that the union might 
not have a choice 
we dont take a strike lightly and we didnt come down here to 
bargain for a strike but were not going to roll over and play 
dead either he said 
local members consider the job classification issue to be 
important because it went against the basic idea of a senority 
system and would allow some workers to be laid off before workers 
with less senority brown said 
he didnt rule out the possibility of a settlement before the 
deadline and again urged the membership to continue reporting for 
work until instructed otherwise

the house approved and sent to the presidents 
desk thursday legislation calling for 10year prison sentences and 
10 million fines for major government procurement fraud 
procurement fraud costs our country hundreds of millions of 
dollars a year rep william j hughes dnj said as the bill 
passed on a voice vote 
the measure which establishes a new crime of major fraud 
applies throughout the government but is designed to respond to 
recent disclosures of widespread cheating among defense contractors 
in military procurement 
its an insult to the taxpayers and to the many honest people 
who do business with the government that the crooked contractors 
often avoid prosecution and their punishment is rarely commensurate 
with the crime hughes said 
the house already had passed the measure and merely agreed to 
amendments added by the senate before sending it on to the 
president for his signature approval came with no controversy 
under the bill the maximum sentence for major fraud would be 
set at 10 years in prison 
fines under the measure would be similar to current ones for 
fraud against the government they vary depending on the amount of 
the loss in especially flagrant cases however courts would have 
the option of imposing penalties of up to 10 million under the 
bill 
a statute of limitations of seven years would be established 
under the measure in contrast to the normal one of five years 
socalled whistleblower protections would be provided to those who 
draw attention to procurement fraud 
among other things the senate amendments would authorize 8 
million over four years for the hiring of additional prosecutors to 
work on procurement fraud they also deleted a house feature that 
would have provided 250000 rewards for information leading to 
conviction

the federal aviation administration after 
finding a significant number of takeoff alarm systems not 
working properly on thursday ordered the warning devices tested on 
nearly 1800 boeing 727 and boeing 737 jetliners 
the action prompted in part by two fatal airline crashes 
requires the tests to be conducted within 200 flight hours and 
repeated every 200 hours to make certain that pilots are warned if 
their planes are not properly configured to take off 
faa spokesman john leyden said the inspections which are likely 
to take about three hours are not expected to disrupt the 
airlines normal operating schedules since they likely will be 
conducted during routine maintenance 
the takeoff alarms on the two model boeing planes two of the 
most widely used jet aircraft in commercial operation sound a 
horn if the crew has forgotten to set or set improperly a variety 
of control and operational devices in the cockpit 
the faa said a onetime check last month of alarms on nearly 
1186 boeing 727s revealed that the alarms either were improperly 
working or failed altogether on 35 aircraft twer and southwest airlines 
are among the major users of 
boeing 737s

a computer virus has been found in programs 
at software manufacturer aldus corp for the second time in eight 
months but officials said thursday the infection has not spread to 
programs for sale to the public 
the company said despite precautions taken after a virus was 
discovered in its freehand drawing program last march a new virus 
has turned up in an updated version of freehand 
an entire computer network within aldus headquarters has been 
infected the company said 
we dont know where it came from said jane dauber an aldus 
spokeswoman that is the nature of the virus you cant really 
track it 
viruses are small computer programs created by programmers as 
jokes or acts of vandalism which secretly attach themselves to 
other programs the virus can then spread from computer to computer 
when operators share infected programs 
at their most benign viruses merely flash a message on a 
computer screen at their worst they can destroy information 
stored in computer memories 
last month a former fort worth texas programmer was convicted 
of planting a virus in his employers computer system two days 
after the employee was fired the virus activated erasing 168000 
company records 
aldus officials said their new virus dubbed nvir has 
remained dormant so far just a tiny program that attaches itself 
to other programs 
we dont know why we dont know what invokes this virus 
said dauber with some of them you have to launch the program a 
certain number of times for the virus to activate 
aldus said does not know where the virus originated although 
the company said the virus apparently has infected at least one 
east coast universitys computers the name of the university was 
not immediately available 
you just cant always stop these things from coming in the 
door said laury bryant a company spokeswoman but what we 
have done is to set up systems which elminate them before they are 
actually in full version shrinkwrap software and stop them from 
going out the door 
aldus says it uses rigorous testing procedures to check for 
viruses in products before they are shipped to retailers still 
the virus was found in a version of freehand software sent to 
specific users to be tested before the program is offered for sale 
one of those users discovered the nvir virus and notified aldus 
two days later the software company realized the virus was in 
its own inhouse network of computer syustems it is not known how 
far the virus has spread 
aldus is a leading manufacturer of programs for desktop 
publishing in which publications are written assembled and 
edited on computers freehand written for apple macintosh 
computers allows computer operators to draw graphics 
in march in what was apparently the first instance of a virus 
attaching itself to a commercial software program a virus called 
the march 2 peace message was found in some freehand programs 
at that time ms bryant said the message did not harm any 
computers and only flashed a brief message on computer screens the 
virus died out of computers on march 2 
the infection forced aldus to recall or rework thousands of 
packages of the new software
