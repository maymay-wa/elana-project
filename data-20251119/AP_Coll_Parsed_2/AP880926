lehrer peter jennings a question for the vice president 
jennings mr vice president im struck by your discussion of 
women and the sanctity of life and it leads me to recall your own 
phrase that you are haunted by the lives which children in our 
inner cities live 
certainly the evidence is compelling theres an explosion of 
singleparent families and by any measure these singleparent 
families many with unwanted children are the source of poverty 
school dropouts crime which many people in the inner city simply 
feel is out of control 
if it haunts you so why over the eight years of the reaganbush 
administration have so many programs designed to help the inner 
cities been eliminated or cut 
bush one of the reasons and i first would like to know which 
programs youre talking about and then we could talk on the merits 
of the programs but you see my fundamental philosophy is give 
local and state government as much control as possible 
that might be the explanation if you tell me the program i do 
strongly support the wic program i think it is good 
i think part of the answer to the haunting of these children 
that are out there and suffering lies in extension of medicaid to 
challenge the states and maybe maybe were going to have to 
enforce more on the states in terms of medicaid taking care of 
these 
but peter so much of it is gets into a whole other phase of 
things the neighborhood the kind of environment people are 
growing up in 
and that leads me to the programs im talking about in terms of 
education i think part of it is the crimeinfested neighborhoods 
and thats why im a strong believer in trying to control crimes in 
the neighborhood why i was so pleased to be endorsed by the 
policemen on the beat the boston police department the other 
day i think they understand my commitment to helping them in the 
neighborhoods 
and so its a combination of these things but do not erode out 
of the system the thousand points of light the people that are out 
there trying to help these kids the programs like cities and 
schools the work that barbara bush is doing so people can learn to 
read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of 
poverty 
im for head start moving that up and ive already made a 
proposal and yes itll cost some money but i favor that so 
these are the combination of things i want and the fact that i 
dont think the federal government can endorse a 35 billion 
program does not mean i have less compassion than the person who 
endorses such a program 
q governor 
dukakis well i must have been living through a different eight 
years from the one that the vice presidents been living through 
because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed 
programs for children for nutrition for the kinds of things that 
can help these youngsters to live better lives 
its cut federal aid to education it has cut pell grants and 
loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all 
over this country 
and that too is a major difference between the vice president 
and me let me just give you one other example 
we have a great many people hundreds of thousands of people 
living on public assistance in this country the 50 governors of 
this nation have proposed to the congress that we help those 
families to get off of welfare help those youngsters help their 
mothers to become independent and selfsufficient 
its taken months and months and months to get mr bush and the 
administration to support that legislation and theyre still 
resisting 
now thats the way you help people being haunted a 
thousand points of light i dont know what that means 
i know what strong political leadership is i know whats 
happened over the course of the past eight years these programs 
have been cut and slashed and butchered and theyve hurt kids all 
over this country

jennings governor the crisis is no less a crisis for you if 
you were elected president where would you get the money to devote 
to the inner cities which is clearly needed and can you be 
specific about the programs not only youd reinstate but the more 
imaginative ones that youd begin 
dukakis well i said a few minutes ago peter that you could 
improve the lives of families and youngsters and save money at the 
same time welfare reform is one way to do it 
if we invest in job training in child care for those 
youngsters in some extended health benefits so that that mother 
and her kids dont lose their health benefits when she goes to 
work we can help literally hundreds of thousands if not 
millions of families to get off of welfare to become independent 
and selfsufficient to be taxpaying citizens and to improve their 
lives the quality of lives their futures and the futures of 
those children thats just one example of how you can save money 
and improve the quality of life at the same time 
in my own state for example we now have that universal health 
care system which the vice president opposes i think very 
unwisely one of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family 
and for those children is the threat that they may lose their 
health insurance think about that father down there in houston who 
has to tell his youngster that he cant play little league ball 
that he cant go out on that ball field because hes afraid hes 
going to get hurt 
and yet mr bush says well i dont think we ought to 
expect businesses to provide health insurance for their 
employees when responsible employers a majority of employers in 
this country do and are paying more for their insurance to 
reimburse hospitals for free care on account of people that are not 
employed that are not insured that have to go to that hospital 
so these are the ways that you help families you help 
youngsters to live better lives and more decent lives and were 
ready to go to work at the state and local level all of us i know 
the private sector is people are all over the country but it 
takes presidential leadership it takes a commitment to being 
involved and to leading and thats the kind of presidency i want 
to lead

tender age at the first childrens bank which has opened at famed 
toy store fao schwarz

parents to its opening sunday will offer savings and deposit 
accounts sell certificates of deposit and hold lectures and 
seminars on banking and money according to a news release

godfrey president and chief operating officer of the first womens

lehrer mr vice president 
bush what troubles me is that when i talk of the voluntary 
sector and a thousand points of light and a thousand different 
ways to help on these problems the man has just said he doesnt 
understand what im talking about and this is the problem i have 
with the bigspending liberals they think the only way to do it is 
for the federal government to do it all 
the fact happens to be that education spending is up by the 
federal government it is up it is not down 
the federal but heres the point he misses the federal 
government spends 7 percent of the total money on education and 
the rest of the state governments and local governments and the 
thousand points of light and im talking about private 
schools and private church schools and things of this nature 
are putting up 93 percent 
but the federal spending for education is up and i want to be 
the education president because i want to see us do better 
were putting more money per child into education and we are 
not performing as we should 
weve gotten away from the values and the fundamentals and i 
would like to urge the school superintendents and the others around 
the country to stand up now and keep us moving forward on a path 
toward real excellence and we can do it but its not going to be 
dictated by some federal bureaucracy in washington dc 
lehrer all right lets move now to some questions on foreign 
and national security policy john mashek will ask the first 
question of the governor 
mashek governor the vice president continually refers to your 
lack of experience weakness naivete on foreign policy and 
national security matters he says you are prepared to eliminate 
weapons systems that will result in the unilateral disarmament of 
this country is that true 
dukakis of course not of course thats a charge thats always 
made against any governor who runs for the presidency i think it 
was one of the things that mr bush said about mr reagan back in 
1980 remember that george 
and yet some of our finest presidents some of our strongest 
international leaders were governors franklin roosevelt woodrow 
wilson theodore roosevelt 
its not the amount of time youve spent in washington its not 
the length of your resume 
its your strength its your values its the quality of the 
people you pick its your understanding of the forces of change 
that are sweeping the world and whether or not youre in a 
position to provide leadership to make those forces of change work 
for us and not against us

president reagan promised to outline his view 
of what lies ahead for the world as he went before the united 
nations today for his seventh appearance and his last before 
leaving office 
asked as he returned from a weekend at camp david md on 
sunday whether he was looking forward to his annual visit for the 
opening of the general assembly in new york the president answered 
with a single word yes 
an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said over 
the weekend that reagan would deal in his speech with the thorny 
issue of chemical weapons which the united states and many other 
western nations manufacture 
the presidents national security adviser lt gen colin l 
powell predicted last week that the president also would press 
efforts to stem the proliferation of such weapons in individual 
talks with world leaders 
reagan has addressed the opening session of the general assembly 
each year since 1983 he also spoke at a special un session on 
disarmament in 1982 
in his weekly radio speech saturday the president said he would 
talk today about his administrations record of successes for our 
philosophy of peace through strength 
the great question now is what next he added where does 
the world go in the next eight years and the next 80 years what 
are the steps we might take toward a safer better freer world 
and ill have some thoughts of my own on monday 
one thing is certain he said if were to continue to 
advance world peace and human freedom america must remain strong 
we must turn a deaf ear to those bornagain patriots who talk about 
strength while serving up the same old menu of weakness 
the president didnt say whom he was talking about but the 
words were similar to those he has used to describe the campaign of 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
after his speech the president planned to meet with un 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar with senior advisers at 
the us mission to the united nations with egyptian foreign 
minister esmat abdelmeguid and israeli foreign minister shimon 
peres with president robert mugabe of zimbabwe with sheik sabah 
alahmed foreign minister of kuwait and with members of the 
persian gulf cooperation council 
powell told reporters the united states is committed to a 
comprehensive worldwide ban on chemical weapons and he expected 
reagan to press the issue in his talks 
both iran and iraq used chemical weapons in their eightyear 
persian gulf war in addition the united states has accused iraq 
of using poison gas against its kurdish minority 
it will be reagans first meeting with perez de cuellar since 
the white houses announcement on sept 13 that the president was 
releasing 188 million the united states had withheld from the 
organization to show displeasure with un budgetary and hiring 
practices 
powell said the united nations had responded to us suggestions 
by making changes in its budget procedures and the size of its 
staff and that the president wanted to recognize this as well as 
the fact that the organization has started to play a more 
important role around the world in helping to deal with regional 
conflicts

when spencer fullerton baird sent a team of 
scientists to russian alaska in 1865 he expected them to return to 
the smithsonian institution with samples of birds animals and 
eskimo artifacts 
they brought back all that as well as evidence of mineral 
wealth that helped persuade a reluctant congress two years later to 
spend 72 million to buy alaska from the russian czar sewards 
folly it was called after william henry seward who was then 
secretary of state 
many of the samples collected in those and later expeditions 
including some native american hunting cloaks of astounding beauty 
have gone on display at a joint ussoviet exhibit that also 
features samples collected by 18th century russian pioneers but 
never before shown the exhibit is at the smithsonians museum of 
natural history 
this is a story that no one country can tell said william 
fitzhugh curator of the show which is the fruit of a decade of 
planning and cooperation between american and soviet 
anthropologists 
the exhibit crossroads of continents cultures of siberia and 
alaska also highlights recent scientific findings about the 
migration of people across the bering strait 11000 years to 12000 
years ago and the development of native american culture in the far 
northwest 
and now 121 years after alaska was sold for a song russian 
scholars flocked to the smithsonian last week for a series of 
seminars on the links between ethnic groups in far eastern siberia 
and the eskimo aleut athapaskan eyak and tlingit peoples of 
alaska and northwestern canada 
so we learn that the smithsonian played a leading role in 
convincing congress in the 19th century to buy alaska said 
aleksandr potemkin cultural attache at the soviet embassy in 
washington 
it is the same smithsonian institution that is playing a 
leading role in bringing the neighbors together again he said 
the exhibition part of increased cultural cooperation between 
the superpowers breaks new ground in several respects 
it provides western scholars with their first look at examples 
of eskimo and tlingit art collected for the czars by explorers like 
vitus bering and by scientists and russian traders who settled as 
far south as san francisco many of the objects have been stored 
out of public sight in the museum of anthropology and ethnography 
the oldest museum in the soviet union founded in what is now 
leningrad by peter the great in 1714 
in another first after the exhibition tours the united states 
with stops in seattle new york indianapolis and anchorage it 
will go to ottawa canada and then to moscow leningrad and two 
soviet cities yet to be chosen 
the rich collection of clothes hunting devices and other 
utensils on display testify to the links between the native 
cultures of siberia and alaska and also the differences 
many of the siberian peoples said fitzhugh learned to raise 
herds of reindeer that form of life involves a more complex social 
structure than that of the alaska peoples who remained largely 
huntergatherers 
the hunters had a spiritual relation with the animals that 
were their prey said fitzhugh and when they hunted they wore 
their best clothes including one elaborate cloak sewn of gut and 
decorated with cormorant feathers fitzhughs favorite object in 
the exhibit

the metropolitan operas 105th season may be 
opening with something of a musical whimper but it promises to end 
with a bang 
the gold curtain will rise tonight on a production of verdis 
il trovatore that when it premiered last season provoked some 
of the most scathing critical catcalls in recent memory 
when the season ends in may it will be with a musical event of 
historic proportions three performances of wagners fouropera 
ring cycle not seen in its entirety at the met for a generation 
in between are a number of promising evenings starting with 
the second night of the season when handels giulio cesare will 
be presented at the met for the first time kathleen battle and 
tatyana troyanos will star along with jeffrey gall the first 
countertenor ever to sing at the met 
the handel masterpiece will be conducted by trevor pinnock the 
british early music specialist who not only has never conducted at 
the met before but has never conducted any opera before he will be 
leading an orchestra of about 30 players unusually small for the 
met pit 
by contrast there is little new or unusual about il 
trovatore met artistic director james levine will conduct an 
allstar cast that includes luciano pavarotti eva marton and 
sherrill milnes but whether they can overcome the dreary staging 
remains to be seen 
normally it takes a new opera production years to decline to 
the point of terminal weariness and ineptitude but the 
metropolitan operas trovatore reached that sad state in one 
evening new york times chief music critic donal henahan wrote 
after the premiere last fall 
of fabrizio melanos production henahan said the idea that 
anyone actually directed the solo singers or the chorus strained 
belief ezio frigerios sets he wrote consisted mostly of six 
groups of marbleized pillars that moved about for reasons known 
perhaps only to the designer 
despite this and other pans most upcoming performances of 
trovatore have been sold out for weeks that includes opening 
night when tickets cost up to 1000 a price that entitles the 
holder to attend a postopera party total gross revenues from the 
evening will come to 629000 
gradually were making opening night into the gala social 
event it was 25 years ago explained met spokeswoman johanna 
fiedler if you approach it that way then it makes sense to do 
something like verdi that is popular with the kind of audience that 
goes to galas 
a key ingredient of success for such a gala seems to be the 
presence of either pavarotti or the worlds other leading operatic 
tenor placido domingo one or the other has starred in five out of 
the last six opening nights and domingo will be on hand when the 
met puts on another gala in december a new production of verdis 
aida 
the three ring cycles that will climax the season represent the 
fulfillment of a longtime dream for levine restoring to the 
repertory for the first time since the early 1970s one of the 
crowning works of opera the production by otto schenk has sets and 
projections by guenther schneidersiemssen that combine an 
oldfashioned literalism with modern technology the cast led by 
hildegarde behrens as bruennhilde is about the best available in 
todays impoverished world of wagnerian singing

with something as simple as a greeting 
card truesillia ruth shank hopes to help bridge the gap between 
the worlds of the sighted and the blind 
it seems so unfair that a blind person should miss out on the 
simple little pleasures of life said mrs shank sitting in the 
living room of her modest home that doubles as the office for her 
7monthold card company sucurre greetings sucurre is an old 
french word meaning to assist 
can you imagine being 30 40 or 50 years old and having to 
wait for someone to read a stack of christmas cards to you or not 
being able to go into a store and pick out an anniversary card for 
your wife or a birthday card for your child she asked 
the inspiration for sucurre greetings which mrs shank owns 
with her husband came while she was working on an advertising 
project with a blind businessman 
he was doing things i couldnt do even with my sight she 
said it just didnt seem right that he needed someone to go to a 
store with him just to pick out a card 
because of the limited market braille greeting cards have not 
been manufactured by established card companies said adam ash 
publisher of the gift reporter a trade publication for the gift 
industry some rehabilitation agencies have been known to sell some 
braille cards at christmas and others translate greeting cards to 
braille when requested 
at best what youve been able to get up until now is a card 
for a sighted person thats been brailled these cards are designed 
specifically for a visually impaired person but are still 
appealing to a sighted person as well said paul ponchillia a 
professor in the department of blind rehabilitation at western 
michigan university 
ponchillia who is blind helped the shanks design the cards 
the shanks also coowners of a yearold advertising and 
printing company hope the pastel colors and simple but elegant 
designs embossed on the front of the cards will appeal to a wide 
audience underneath the design is a description of the object in 
braille inside braille appears under the message typically a 
short phrase with slightly raised letters 
one lavender card has an embossed bird in flight on the cover 
inside the message is my hearts all aflutter 
in addition to her basic line of 25 cards mrs shank said she 
also has a line of christmas cards 
we want the person to get the full impact of the card a card 
that everyone can enjoy said mrs shank a bubbly 32yearold 
mother of three 
she does the embossing by hand her husband michael art 
director at a television station does much of the designing and 
printing most of the brailling is done by blind volunteers 
distribution of the cards is mostly limited to local card shops 
but mrs shank says she fills mail orders and is trying to line up 
distributors for the cards in other parts of the country the cards 
sell for 2 and 250 locally 
if the cards catch on the shanks would like to provide jobs for 
blind rehabilitation and training groups 
and it looks as if the cards may be catching on marshall field 
has expressed interest in buying the line for their chain of 
department stores as well as an alphabet book mrs shank designed 
for use by both sighted and blind children 
before getting involved in this i never really knew a blind 
person and i dont think i ever remember seeing a book thats shown 
me what brailles like she said 
we planned the book to get rid of the gap between sighted and 
blind children we want a sighted child to know what braille feels 
like and a blind child to be able to feel the letters that were 
seeing maybe that way we can get rid of some of the prejudice 
prejudice is a subject mrs shank knows well 
because im black some people might ask why im not doing 
something for a black cause well blindness knows no color when 
people stop being prejudiced against blind people or handicapped 
people maybe theyll stop being prejudiced about black people

as emperor hirohito lies in his sickbed a lack of 
information and conflicting reports on his health are provoking 
frustration and concern 
the imperial household agencys stubborn reluctance to release 
detailed information about the monarch is drawing increasingly 
strong criticism 
i am getting the strong impression that the emperors real 
condition may be much worse than whats been reported said naoki 
inose author of several books on the imperial family only a 
handful of doctors nurses and servants actually get to see the 
emperor other than those in the imperial family 
the imperial household agency which handles all matters 
concerning the monarchy has been releasing only the emperors 
temperature blood pressure and pulse three to four times a day 
along with a brief comment about his condition 
what we are interested in is how the emperor is really doing 
not those medical numbers said a middleaged man who came to the 
palace sunday to sign his name in a registry of wellwishers his 
condition is everyones interest 
a reporter for a nationally circulated newspaper said the 
imperial household agency had its own standards about the news 
which apparently differ considerably from todays ordinary 
standard he spoke on condition of anonymity 
the asahi shimbun japans second largest circulation newspaper 
said saturday that the emperor apparently has cancer it quoted 
pathologists who examined tissue taken from the emperors pancreas 
when he underwent intestinal bypass surgery last september as 
saying cancer cells were found in the tissue 
the article said pathologists at tokyo university believe the 
emperor has either pancreatic or duodenum cancer and that palace 
officials decided he should not be told about it instead the 
article said they announced the illness as merely an inflammation 
of the pancreas 
shouichi fujimori director general of the imperial household 
agency telephoned the publisher of the asahi shimbun expressed 
regret and asked the newspaper to exercise selfrestraint 
at this point where the emperors consciousness is still clear 
and he is struggling with his illness publishing the article was 
deemed totally inappropriate said kenji maeda an imperial 
household agency spokesman taking into account the emperors 
feeling the decision to publish such an article apparently lacks 
consideration 
but he refused to confirm or deny the report saying only 
matters regarding the fact of the article and publishing such an 
article are on different dimensions 
deputy managing editor hisao kuwashima said the paper printed 
the article after its editors decided the emperor would not be able 
to read a newspaper again 
everyone is frustrated about the lack of information about his 
condition said kuwashima his conditions have been clearly 
showing signs of pancreatic cancer since a long time ago after he 
was listed in critical condition we decided we must run this 
article he said the decision also was based on the fact that 
hirohito is a public figure 
in japan the decision whether to tell patients they have cancer 
is left to doctors and relatives 
when hirohitos temperature soared saturday afternoon some news 
services and television stations quoted unidentified government 
sources as saying the emperor was in critical condition was hooked 
to a respirator and was receiving heart massages 
maeda hastily denied those reports and angrily said which can 
you trust speculation by unknown soruces or us 
the emperor has no political power but serves as a symbol of 
japan 
secrecy is an important part of the imperial family said 
inose if an imperial family gave away all secrets and everything 
became open they would not be able to maintain the implicit 
authority they have now 
for the people surrounding the imperial family whats good 
for the emperor always comes before whats good for people and 
thats been taken for granted for centuries inose said

the olympic stadiums where athletes 
from 160 nations are competing overlook another battlefield where 
us troops were locked in ferocious combat 38 years ago today 
it is the anniversary of the sept 26 1950 capture of seoul by 
us and south korean forces from communist north korean troops 
three months after the beginning of the korean war 
about 4 million soldiers and civilians were killed or wounded in 
the war seoul and almost every other city on the korean peninsula 
was badly damaged in the bitter ideological clash 
starting in seoul i finally found out there is no glory in 
war its cruel miserable dirty and nothing worth bragging 
about said former us marine jack wright in an interview 
seoul has been rebuilt and is now a sprawling modern metropolis 
of 10 million people the citys skyscrapers and broad avenues are 
a monument to south koreas astonishing growth since the war 
but the scene was very different in 1950 when the united states 
and 15 other nations intervened under united nations command to 
help south korea after it was invaded on june 25 by north korea 
south koreas illequipped and poorly trained army was knocked 
back and seoul captured within a few days of the invasion 
us forces that rushed into korea were pushed back with the 
south korean army until they held the southwestern tip of the 
peninsula around the port of pusan bloody battles raged through 
august 1950 as the north koreans attempted to break through the 
pusan perimeter 
the war took a dramatic turn sept 15 1950 when gen douglas 
macarthur outflanked the north koreans with an amphibious assault 
at inchon next to seoul and far behind communist lines 
macarthurs gamble paid off and within days us and some south 
korean forces reached the south bank of the han river including 
the area around where the olympic park is now 
north korea rushed 10000 reinforcements into seoul and the 
northern bank of the han was bristling with tanks and artillery 
that could fire straight into any assault across the river 
the us commanders on the spot wanted to advance slowly and 
outflank the north koreans but macarthurs headquarters in tokyo 
ordered seoul retaken by sept 25 exactly three months after the 
communist invasion 
american ground commanders were forced to attack across the han 
in the face of deadly north korean gunfire according to historical 
accounts all of the bridges had been destroyed and the us troops 
went across in barges and boats 
joseph saluzzi another us marine who took part in the attack 
saw dead bodies for the first time when he arrived on the banks of 
the han 
we were assembled near an area covered with litters of dead 
marines i was afraid to look but eventually forced myself to 
only hours before those marines had been joking and telling sea 
stories he said in an interview 
i saw myself covered by one of those blankets and remember 
thinking when it comes let it be quick and without pain 
much of the city was burned and destroyed by massive artillery 
and air attacks before the assault entire streets were demolished 
by cannon fire and fires swept unchecked across the ancient capital 
once the troops got across the han they found the north koreans 
ready to fight for every house and street units battled their way 
across seoul dislodging communist troops who would not surrender 
it seemed that every building in seoul housed an enemy sniper 
we cleaned out doorways and rooftops we went from street to 
street house to house said former marine sergeant lee bergee 
the us commanders in seoul were furious when american military 
headquarters announced the city was retaken sept 25 according to 
historical accounts because the main attack did not begin until 
early sept 26 and there was scattered fighting until sept 28 
macarthur and south korean president syngman rhee arrived sept 
28 for a ceremony at the national capitol to mark the return of the 
city to the south korean government rhee said to the us 
commander we love you as the savior of our race 
seoul would fall again in january 1951 after china intervened in 
the war in november and pushed back the un forces and later be 
recaptured by the un forces and held until the war finally ended 
in stalemate in 1953

dukakis well if this is christmas i hope its christmas when 
you make that decision 
bush these are the these are the these are the my answer 
is do not make these unilateral cuts and everybody now realizes 
that peace through strength works and so this is where i have a 
big difference 
of course were going to have to make some determination on 
this and were going to have to make it on conventional forces 
but now weve got a very good concept called competitive 
strategies we will do what we do best 
its a strategy that weve been working on for a couple of 
years it is going to take us to a much better advantage in 
conventional forces but look let me sum it up i want to be the 
president that gets conventional forces in balance i want to be 
the one to banish chemical and biological weapons from the face of 
the earth but you have to have a little bit of experience to know 
where to start and i think ive had that 
lehrer governor 
dukakis well first let me say with respect to the freeze 
that back in the spring of 1982 mr bush was a lot more 
sympathetic to the freeze than he seems to be today as a matter of 
fact he said it was not and should not be a subject of partisan 
demagoguery because it was too important to the united states or 
for the world 
i didnt hear john exactly where he was going to cut and what 
he was going to do but i know this we have serious financial 
problems in this country weve piled up over 1 trillion in debt 
and the next president of the united states is going to have to 
make some choices 
mr bush wants to spend billions on star wars he apparently 
wants to spend billions on the mx on railroad cars a weapons 
system we dont need and cant afford i thought the administration 
was opposed to the midgetman i thought the administration was at 
the negotiating table in geneva suggesting that we ban mobile 
missile systems entirely 
but those are the choices the next president of the united 
states is going to have to make i am for the stealth i am for the 
d5 i am for going ahead with the advanced cruise missile but i 
dont think we need these other systems i dont think we need them 
to remain strong weve got to move ahead with the strategic arms 
negotiation process with the comprehensive testban treaty and 
lehrer governor 
dukakis with negotiations leading to conventional force 
reduction in europe with deeper cuts on the soviet side and 
senator bentsen and i will pursue that policy 
lehrer anne groer a question for the vice president 
groer well mr vice president you said you met with secretary 
general gorbachev you have met with mr shevardnadze but for the 
last 40 years americans have been taught to regard the soviet 
union as the enemy yet president reagan has signed two arms 
control treaties and hes promised to share star wars technology 
with the very country he once called the evil empire 
so perhaps you could tell us this evening should we be doing a 
lot to help the economics and the social development of a country 
that we have so long regarded as an adversary 
bush what i think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika 
and glasnost welcome them but keep our eyes open be cautious 
because the soviet change is not fully established yet 
yes i think its fine to do business with them but i dont 
want to see us exporting our highlysensitive national security 
oriented technology to the soviet union 
i dont want to see us making unilateral cuts in our strategic 
systems while we are negotiating with them and so im encouraged 
by what i see when i talk to mr what i hear when i talk to mr 
gorbachev and mr shevardnadze but can they pull it off 
and when they have deals that are good for us as china started 
to do the changes in china since barbara and i lived there is 
absolutely amazing in terms of incentive and partnerships and 
things of this nature 
and now the soviet union seems to be walking down that same 
path we should encourage that we ought to say this is good but 
where i differ with my opponent is i am not going to make 
unilateral cuts in our strategic defense systems or support some 
freeze when they have superiority

corruption charges are tarnishing the 
image of president corazon aquinos government even though no one 
has produced evidence she is sanctioning practices that led to the 
downfall of her predecessor ferdinand marcos 
for months manila newspapers have been replete with allegations 
of official corruption they include disappearing food stocks 
rakeoffs from staterun companies bribery in the customs bureau 
and shakedowns by crooked policemen 
last week retired maj gen cesar tapia who was appointed 
security chief at manila airport to clean up corruption there quit 
in disgust saying he was powerless to root out institutionalized 
graft 
mrs aquinos personal integrity remains unquestioned but 
critics allege some of her relatives used their connections to 
enhance their wealth in questionable business deals 
in august ramon diaz quit as chairman of the presidential 
commission on good government citing interference by relatives of 
powers that be in efforts to retrieve the billions of dollars 
marcos and his associates allegedly embezzled during his 20year 
administration 
marcos fled to hawaii in february 1986 after he was ousted in 
civilianmilitary uprising that placed mrs aquino in power 
few of the recent allegations against mrs aquino have been 
proven and so far no senior official has gone to jail many of the 
charges have been leveled by selfserving opposition politicians 
seeking to find an issue with which to embarrass the president 
last week opposition sen juan ponce enrile admitted he was 
wrong in claiming mrs aquinos brotherinlaw paul aquino had 
secretly assumed the chairmanship of security bank which was taken 
over by the government because of its links to marcos 
nonetheless political commentators believe the sheer volume of 
the charges has sullied the reputation of an administration which 
came to power promising to clean up government after rampant 
corruption under marcos 
at best the charges point to widespread inefficiency 
incompetence and mismanagement in the bureaucracy in some cases 
government investigators acknowledged widespread irregularities in 
state agencies but found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing 
mrs aquino has vowed to stamp out corruption but demands proof 
before she will crack down on alleged offenders she has said 
frequently that most of the allegations have been raised by her 
enemies to undermine her personally 
but some analysts believe strong measures are necessary because 
of public sensitivity after years of blatant statesanctioned 
corruption under marcos 
the president must start giving her people some big fish to 
fry said the progovernment philippine daily inquirer 
otherwise they will set their hooks elsewhere and the blood 
will spatter not just the walls of bureaucray but on the 
foundations of our new democracy as well 
some analysts believe filipinos are quick to accept corruption 
allegations regardless of proof because many see examples of 
petty graft every day 
these include policemen who shake down motorists for bribes to 
ignore traffic violations to bureaucrats who accept tips to 
speed processing of licenses and other official documents 
vast timberlands are being systematically denuded of trees by 
illegal logging operations it is widely assumed such operations 
continue under the protection of corrupt military officers 
impatience with highlevel corruption has also been heightened 
because millions of filipinos must struggle daily simply to earn 
enough to feed clothe and shelter themselves and their families 
coupled with that is the continuing failure of the government to 
improve the economic livelihood of millions especially those who 
live in the impoverished countryside 
there is a strong perception here that mrs aquino is 
personally honest said most rev leonardo legaspi archbishop of 
naga city located about 190 miles southeast of manila but 
people do not see goodness translated into something that is 
effective

rising out of the azure waters like the 
caribbean god of wind hurricane gilbert smashed idyllic resorts 
and industrial cities during an eightday rampage across the 
caribbean and mexico 
gilbert grew into a hurricane with winds of 74 mph on sept 10 
100 miles southwest of puerto rico sending the first waves of 
torrential rain and panic to impoverished towns in haiti and the 
dominican republic 
by the time gilbert lost its hurricane status over northeastern 
mexico it had killed more than 300 people left hundreds of 
thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars damage to the 
caribbean central america mexico and the united states 
gilberts trail of destruction across nine nations occurred 
despite the technological advances of modernday weather 
forecasting airplanes flew into the eye of the hurricane several 
times daily and meteorologists with computers predicted the storms 
next target 
it was one of the top 10 as far as intensity size and 
destructive potential said bob sheets director of the national 
hurricane center in coral gables fla 
after leaving more than eight dead in the dominican republic 
gilbert punished jamaicas capital kingston and the resort of 
montego bay then pushed northwestward past the cayman islands and 
cuba 
jamaica which needs tourism for much of its hard currency 
sustained 8 billion in damage and at least 30 people died 
kingston lost much of its drinking water electricity and many 
services a halfmillion people nearly onefourth the island 
population were left homeless 
luckiest perhaps was the lowlying threeisland british colony 
called the caymans which suffered remarkably little damage 
all 23000 people of the islands got on their knees and said 
thank you journalist carol winker said 
gilbert moved into the yucatan channel between cuba and mexico 
gathering strength over warm waters to become a category 5 storm or 
great hurricane with winds of up to 160 mph 
the caribbean indians called their god of wind huracan and the 
winds of gilbert were terrifyingly strong up to 218 mph at one 
point as it neared mexico 
rain spread more than 400 miles from north to south gilberts 
tail dumped up to 10 inches of rain in portions of central america 
leaving more than 15 dead in honduras 
next struck was cancun a 110hotel mexican island resort off 
the yucatan that was built in the 1970s after computer studies 
showed it would be rarely hit by hurricanes 
said tourist wendy kidd of montreal the wind came in the 
bedroom one way and went out the other and took everything with 
it 
in one cancun hotel where 450 were packed into a banquet room 
refugees had to hold up a wall against the strong winds there was 
no water toilets in some cases one to a shelter could not be 
flushed 
we do not know what it is to be dirty sharing bathrooms 
that dont work we are not used to it mrs kidd said of the 
american and canadian tourists caught by the storm some people 
handle it graciously and some dont 
gilbert uprooted palms indian laurels and other trees and 
snapped antenna support cables in the nearby resorts of cozumel and 
isla mujeres electrical poles fell breaking power lines thatched 
huts and wooden structures collapsed 
after the storm a 118foot cuban fishing boat was found tossed 
up beside a beach hotel dramatic proof of gilberts strength 
gilbert caused more than 300 million in damage to the tourist 
industry of cancun and cozumel in nearby merida it destroyed 
nearly all the corn and fruit crops at least 24 died in the area 
gilbert next moved into the gulf of mexico threatening oil 
drilling installations and populated areas from veracruz to 
florida before moving over land in the state of tamaulipas 100 
miles south of brownsville texas 
ocean waters more than three feet deep pushed several miles 
inland over the barren flats at least 11 villagers drowned along 
the coast 
but the worst lay ahead about 160 miles northwest was monterrey 
and its 28 million people 
gilbert collided with the 14000foothigh mountains around 
monterrey creating killing torrents with a load of rain that swept 
away passenger buses traveling along the normally dry bed of the 
santa catarina river 
more than 200 died sept 17 in monterrey alone the biggest 
single toll from the storm 
in recent years the state government had used the riverbed as a 
thoroughfare for electricity towers and for miles of fields for 
baseball and soccer 
the water was kind of running through said witness cosme 
garibay then all of a sudden it came bam all at once i have 
never seen anything like it in my life 
two americans also died from gilbertspawned tornadoes in texas 
but the dying rains did some good filling dams near the texas 
border and bringing an abrupt end to a long summer drought

the emergence of rival christian and 
moslem governments threatens to plunge lebanon once again into a 
civil war fueled by outside powers that long have used the country 
as a proxy battlefield 
the crisis could formalize the de facto partition of lebanon 
into sectarian cantons carved out during the 13year civil war 
which killed about 150000 people 
syria the major power broker in lebanon backs the moslem 
government and the shiite moslem amal militia israel and iraq 
support the rightwing christians libya funds the druse militia 
which sent volunteers to fight alongside col moammar gadhafis 
army in chad 
iran arms and bankrolls the shiite fundamentalists saudi arabia 
helps the sunni moslems but fundamentalist sunnis also look to 
iran for support 
the christians and moslems each are split by internal rivalries 
the maronite catholics the dominant christian sect are 
patronized by the united states and france the greek orthodox 
traditionally more leftist are prosyrian 
the failure of lebanons parliament to elect a successor to 
president amin gemayel a maronite catholic when his sixyear term 
expired thursday spawned competing christian and moslem governments 
gemayel appointed army commander gen michel aoun as prime 
minister syria backs sunni moslem prime minister salim hoss who 
took office in june 1987 
at best gemayel was little more than a figurehead he had no 
control of moslemheld areas and even in the shrunken christian 
enclave the real power was the lebanese forces the christians 
main militia 
the 42000man army is fractured with some units backing 
gemayel or allied with the lebanese forces shiite and druse moslem 
brigades have either sat on the sidelines or actively backed moslem 
militias 
the ceasefire in the iraniraq war and the 9monthold 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip also have significantly affected the region 
particularly important is the intensification of the long feud 
between iraq and syria which backed iran in the eightyear persian 
gulf war syria and iraq are ruled by rival wings of the baath arab 
socialist party 
syria has been weakened by irans apparent military collapse 
and iraq has stepped up its propaganda campaign against damascus 
syria also fears it could be eclipsed as a key player in the 
arabisraeli dispute by the support the palestine liberation 
organization has gained from the uprising 
syrian president hafez assad looked to lebanon to provide him 
with a success by restoring stability to the divided country 
through the election of one of its allies as president 
the syrians with 40000 troops in north and east lebanon and 
beiruts moslem sector consider their tiny western neighbor vital 
to their security 
the ceasefire freed the iraqis to take revenge on damascus for 
siding with iran by confronting the syrians ambitions in lebanon 
and stirring trouble for them in their own backyard 
iraq influential in lebanon until the syrians moved in in 1976 
seeking to quell the civil war has provided weapons and ammunition 
to the rightwing lebanese christian forces opposed to syria 
arab diplomats said baghdad which long has had links with the 
lebanese forces recently shipped 50 armored personnel carriers to 
the christian militia 
it was the lebanese forces fierce opposition to syrianbacked 
candidates in the presidential election that foiled damascus 
efforts to secure political reforms that would give lebanons 
moslem majority an equal share of constitutional power with the 
longdominant christians 
iraqs claim that it defeated iran justified to some extent by 
its military victories pushed syria to seek to impose greater 
control over lebanon and prevent any iraqi intervention 
the iraqis also support yasser arafats palestine liberation 
organization which is feuding with assad 
the syrians also have to contend with iranianbacked shiite 
moslem fundamentalists who seek to create the worlds second 
islamic republic in lebanon 
syrias shiite ally the amal militia sought to crush the 
proiranian hezbollah or party of god this year when hezbollah 
aided by iranian revolutionary guards came out on top the syrians 
intervened to corral hezbollah in its stronghold in south beiruts 
slums 
the fundamentalists quiet for the moment remain a threat to 
syrias efforts to control lebanon

in the tense capital of yugoslavias 
backward region of kosovo the majority albanians and minority 
slavs are divided from the cradle to the grave 
it starts in kindergarten where parents say albanian and slav 
children trade racial slurs 
it ends with the death notices on trees lining main streets 
black borders for slavs green for albanians 
in good times there was some fraternization even 
intermarriage among the albanians who make up 90 percent of 
kosovos 2 million people and the 200000 slavs but the closeness 
is increasingly rare since ethnic riots in 1981 left at least nine 
dead and 200 injured 
in the past months the tension has increased in this region the 
slavs see as their historic homeland 
the albanians most of whom are moslems want to win a greater 
voice in governing kosovo now administered by the republic of 
serbia the slavs are pushing to absorb the autonomous province 
into serbia 
for the mostly christian slavs made up of serbs and 
montenegrins the albanian demand is impossible they argue that a 
separate republic would oust them from kosovo 
kosovo was settled by serbs in the 7th century and was the heart 
of serbias medieval empire the turks conquered it in 1389 and 
ruled until the balkan war of 1913 when it was partitioned between 
serbia and what is now the republic of montenegro in yugoslavia 
albanians believed to be descended from the ancient illyrians 
have been in the region since ancient times 
slavs say the albanians would precipitate the breakup of this 
communist balkan country by seceding and uniting with albania the 
neighboring communist country 
thousands of serbs and montenegrins have left kosovo because of 
arson and other attacks they blame on the albanians who are rarely 
given a chance to publicly respond to what appear to be grossly 
distorted accounts 
the animosity exacerbated by emotional slav rallies protesting 
alleged albanian attacks is now so high that many residents 
believe a military crackdown will come within months or even 
weeks police equipped with armored personnel carriers have been 
sent to the province by the federal government in belgrade 
the slavs say kosovos albanians who have the highest birthrate 
in europe are making a conscious effort to outbreed them they 
claim the albanians are chasing them out of kosovo by attacking 
their women and children and offering irresistibly high amounts of 
money for their properties 
you could buy in new york for what they pay here said a 
western resident of pristina who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he cited prices of 222000 for a house in the hilly city 
the slavs have found a champion for their cause in slobodan 
milosevic the leader of serbias communist party who advocates 
more direct serbian control over kosovo and the autonomous province 
of vojvodina near the hungarian border both areas control their 
own judiciary police and other insitutions 
the position of the serbian communist party has thrown 
yugoslavia into its most explosive political crisis of the postwar 
era 
milosevics views have drawn hundreds of emotional crowds to 
rallies where they vent their frustrations with yugoslavias 
economic crisis by chanting for arms and vowing to keep kosovo 
slavic 
we are shaking the country said miroslav solevic a 
pristina serb who heads a committee to organize the rallies 
but leaders of yugoslavias other republics say milosevics 
emotional tactics could lead to civil war 
the rallies have a negative effect on the situation in 
kosovo said albanian hashim rexhepi a member of kosovos 
communist leadership 
its very bad for us now said student nazim rexhepi an 
ethnic albanian with no known family ties to the politician 
nobody asks us anything if we even organized a similar rally to 
those held by the serbs we would all be proclaimed albanian 
separatists and sentenced 
the ethnic crisis has been worsened by kosovos economic 
backwardness 
seventy percent of the population is under 30 and 135000 
people are jobless listless bored young men gather by the 
hundreds on pristinas refusestrewn streets 
those with jobs earn as little as 75 a month less than half 
the national average a middleclass family of four is lucky to 
live in a onebedroom apartment in a building with broken light 
bulbs and windows and an entrance that reeks of garbage 
money from the richer republics has produced some incongruously 
luxurious buildings such as the university library 
were the only country in the world that has borrowed money to 
finance its own destruction said a serbian journalist in kosovo 
who spoke on condition of anonymity he was referring to 
yugoslavias 21 billion debt and child support paid to albanians 
for each of their many children 
in the village of prekale armed serbian vigilantes protect 
children from harassment by albanian villagers and police patrol 
the area every six hours 
the ordinary people its not their fault its all the big 
heads that do this says serb villager slobodan maksimovic 
the villagers are ready to flee if ethnic violence erupts but 
serbian nationalists anxious to stem emigration from kosovo have 
persuaded many people to stay 
i had to come back from working in switzerland to protect my 
family said maksimovic i have to go with my kids every day to 
school wait until they finish and then come back with them we 
feel as if we are in a zoo encircled by albanians and guarded by 
police

prisoners briefly seized control of a 
highsecurity section of the idaho state penitentiary on sunday 
and guards later found an inmate dead in his cell authorities said 
the 3hour rampage began when two unarmed guards ran into 
resistance trying to confiscate homemade liquor from inmates said 
tim mcneese executive assistant to state department of corrections 
director al murphy 
the prisoners broke glass and burned mattresses and papers 
before surrendering 
the death was being investigated as an apparent homicide said 
mcneese he said the victims name was being withheld pending 
notification of relatives he refused to release details of how the 
man was killed 
after swat teams entered the building and inmates ended their 
disturbance without force officers found the body during an 
inspection mcneese said at a news conference 
it appears there was significant damage said mcneese it 
was mainly glass damage there isnt that much in there to 
burn he said 
someone broke through a cinderblock cell wall to get at the 
inmate he said he said there was no immediate information whether 
the disturbance was staged to aid the slaying 
the cellblock involved normally has a population of 120 mcneese 
said he had no immediate indication how many inmates took part in 
the disturbance and destruction but many remained in their cells

im not going to do that because i think the jury is still out 
on the soviet experiment and the interesting place one of the 
things that fascinates me about this perestroika and glasnost is 
whats going to happen in eastern europe you see the turmoil in 
poland today and i think we have enormous opportunity for trade 
i dont want to go back to the carter grain embargo on the 
soviets we are once again reliable suppliers and i would never use 
food as a political tool like our predecessors did but this is an 
exciting time but all im suggesting is lets not be naive in 
dealing with the soviets and make a lot of unilateral cuts hoping 
against hope that they will match our bid look at the inf treaty 
and if we havent learned from the negotiating history on that 
well never learn the freeze people were wrong the reagan 
administration was right excuse me 
lehrer governor dukakis 
dukakis that was a very different george bush who was talking 
much more sympathetically about the freeze in the spring of 1982 
than he is today and you were right then george when you said that 
it was no time for partisan demagoguery nobody is suggesting that 
we unilaterally disarm or somehow reduce our strength of course 
not 
what were talking about is a combination of a strong and 
effective and credible nuclear deterrent strong wellequipped 
welltrained wellmaintained conventional forces and at the same 
time a willingness to move forward steadily thoughtfully 
cautiously 
we have serious differences with the soviet union we have very 
fundamental differences about human rights democracy and in our 
basic system our basic view of human beings and of what life is 
all about 
but there are opportunities there now senator bentsen and i 
have a plan for the 1990s and beyond mr bush and mr quayle do 
not 
and we want to pursue that plan in a way which will bring down 
the level of nuclear armament will build a more stable and more 
peaceful world and we can do so while making choices here at home 
lets not forget that our national security and our economic 
security go hand in hand we cannot be strong militarily when were 
teetertottering on top of a mountain of debt which has been 
created in the past eight years thats why we need a democratic 
administration in washington in 1989 
lehrer anne groer a question for the governor 
groer yes governor dukakis speaking of seeming changes of 
position you have gone from calling the strategic defense 
initiative or star wars a fantasy and a fraud to saying 
recently you would continue sdi research and might even deploy the 
system if congress supported such a move why the change of heart 
dukakis no theres been no change of heart ive said from the 
beginning that we ought to continue research into the strategic 
system at about the level it was at in 1983 thats about a billion 
dollars a year 
but i dont know of any reputable scientists who believe that 
this system at least as originally conceived could possibly work 
this notion of some kind of an astrodome over ourselves that could 
protect us from enemy attack makes real sense and as a matter of 
fact the system that the administrations now talking about is 
very different from the one that was originally proposed in 1983 
so i am for continued research 
but i also want strong conventional forces now the other day 
mr bush said well if we continued with star wars wed have to 
cut some place he hasnt told us where we know where theyre 
cutting we know where youre cutting right now youre cutting 
into the fiber and muscle of our conventional forces youre 
cutting back on maintenance and equipment 
there was an air force general not too long ago in europe who 
said that pretty soon wed have airplanes without engines tank 
commanders who cant drive their tanks more than threequarters of 
a mile because they dont have enough fuel coast guard cutters 
tied up at the dock this summer not patrolling theyre supposed 
to be our first line of defense against drugs and the war against 
drugs because they dont have enough fuel

portauprince haiti ap the rebellion in the rank and file 
of the 7000man army has dramatically reformed the high command 
replacing corrupt and repressive remnants of the duvalier 
dictatorship with competent professionals 
there is a democratic revolution going on in the army no 
decision is made without the enlisted men said serge gilles 
coleader of the patriotic unity bloc a coalition of three 
democratic political parties 
the army purge began sept 17 when enlisted men and their 
sergeants ousted lt gen henri namphy the head of government 
they replaced him with lt gen prosper avril who as a brigadier 
general had been the armys top administrative officer 
the soldiers sacked dozens of commanders at units across the 
country avril endorsed their action and said 29 superior officers 
were retired 
the sergeants who engineered the coup share daily 
decisionmaking with avril but they have promised to respect the 
chain of command under their newly appointed leaders mostly 
younger junior officers 
we are thankful to these nationbuilders louis roy 
cowriter of the 1987 constitution said of the soldiers avril 
must not forget that they are watching him and will punish any 
deviation 
soldiers speaking on radio stations identify themselves with 
haitis oppressed poor and speak of human rights democracy free 
elections and reestablishing the constitution abolished by namphy 
the army is the people and the people are the army was the 
rebellions slogan 
an important motive of the mutiny was the desire to improve 
living and working conditions most soldiers earn less than 200 a 
month and live with their families in the citys wretched slums 
now they are demanding higher pay subsidized housing and medical 
and pension benefits 
corrupt officers such as col gregoir figaro police chief of 
the capital portauprince have been replaced by young 
professional officers such as the new police commander lt col 
georges valcin who was trained in a french police academy 
a survivor of the upheaval is col jeanclaude paul commander 
of the feared 700man dessalines barracks the only major unit in 
which soldiers did not mutiny 
a western diplomat said privately that paul who was indicted in 
miami on charges of drugrunning is popular because he is not 
arrogant treats his troops well and spreads money around to his 
men 
the soldiers said they chose avril as president because he is 
honest and treats them with respect 
during the 29year family dynasty founded by francois papa 
doc duvalier and inherited by his son jeanclaude the army was 
shunted aside stripped of its traditional power and humiliated by 
the arrogant tonton macoutes the duvalier private militia 
when jeanclaude duvalier was ousted and fled to france on feb 
7 1986 the macoutes were officially disbanded the repressive 
army high command of duvalier appointees remained largely intact 
taking over the macoutes lucrative contraband and drugsmuggling 
activities and siphoning off public funds 
francois duvalier a quiet country doctor the army expected to 
manipulate rose to power in 1957 in militaryrigged elections 
instead he used the tonton macoutes to terrorize the population 
into submission and loosen the armys grip on power 
in the early 1960s duvalier closed the military academy and 
exiled retired or shot scores of army officers considered a threat 
to his power 
professional officers either opted to collaborate with the 
dictator or were forced into submission a lowranking illiterate 
macoute wielded more power than an army officer 
when jeanclaude duvalier took over as presidentforlife upon 
his fathers death in 1971 he reopened the military academy the 
graduates soon discovered they had no chance of promotion in an 
officer corps clogged by duvalierists who remained in power even 
after the dictators departure 
if an army is a disciplined group of men in arms there is no 
haitian army a major said in an interview shortly before 
namphys ouster what we have are more or less discordant centers 
of authority infiltrated by criminal elements he said 
rankandfile soldiers already envious of officers salaries of 
up to 3500 a month for a general were provoked into rebellion 
when thugs many of them former macoutes attacked worshipers at a 
sunday morning mass in a roman catholic church on june 11 killing 
13 and wounding 77 
presidential guard sgt joseph heubreux the 27yearold leader 
of the coup said the enlisted men were disgusted by the massacre 
and other acts of violence under namphy and felt humiliated when 
the outraged public accused them of siding with the killers 
heubreux speaking in full battle gear on national television 
the night of the coup said the soldiers goal was to raise the 
prestige of the haitian people degraded by so many acts which have 
revolted our conscience

only one vote and possibly a few federal 
judgeships are stopping senate democrats from shutting off a 
republican filibuster and passing the first increase in the 335 
hourly minimum wage since 1981 
but having lost two cloture votes last week in trying to break 
the logjam democratic leaders were unwilling to schedule a third 
attempt until after sunday nights debate between presidential 
candidates george bush and michael dukakis 
republican leaders following a white housedirected legislative 
strategy are insisting on paring down by about half the 120 
increase in the minimum wage that democrats would like to implement 
over a threeyear period 
the republicans also want to couple the increase to a new 
90day 85 percent subminimum wage for newly hired workers as long 
as no one would fall below the current 335 floor 
the minimum wage bill is one of several facing an impatient 
congress eager to adjourn to hit the fall campaign trail 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva has warned 
senators to be prepared for saturday sessions if the 100th congress 
is to end by oct 16 a date two weeks beyond the original target 
date for finishing business 
behind the scenes gop leaders are holding the minimum wage bill 
hostage while trying to win a commitment from democratic leaders to 
act before congress adjourns on an unspecified number of the 29 
federal judicial nominations that president reagan has sent to 
capitol hill 
recalling that 17 of president carters judicial nominations 
disappeared in the interim between the november election in 1980 
and reagans taking office the following january republicans are 
determined that the same will not happen to them should dukakis win 
senate gop whip alan simpson of wyoming made it clear that any 
deal for allowing democrats to move the minimum wage bill and 
possibly act on other social and environmental legislation does not 
have to involve all 29 of reagans nominees to the bench 
a shake of the hand will do it we do not need to have it in 
writing that these certain judges will be approved simpson 
said that is really the issue before us and it really does not 
have anything to do with the minimum wage 
sen edward m kennedy dmass the primary sponsor of the 
minimum wage increase expressed confidence in picking up the 60th 
vote needed to end the filibuster regardless of whether a deal is 
struck on the judicial nominations 
last friday eight republicans five more than on thursday 
joined 48 democrats in a 5635 vote seeking to break the 
filibuster i believe were on the edge of having a successful 
resolution kennedy said 
gop leaders however were confident that no more members in 
their party would break ranks and suggested that a few might even 
switch back 
democratic sens lloyd bentsen of texas bill bradley of new 
jersey and lawton chiles of florida all were absent during fridays 
vote kennedy believes all three will support him 
assuming none of the republicans switch that means he has to 
get one vote from among democratic sens david boren of oklahoma 
richard shelby of alabama and james exon of nebraska 
minority leader bob dole rkan said some senators on his side 
of the aisle were confused on fridays vote by monday 
theyll realize whats at stake he said 
proposals to overhaul the welfare system and to grant parents 
unpaid leave from work to care for newborn or sick children still 
are the subject of latesession maneuvering 
several appropriations bills including one 300 billion measure 
for the defense department that reagan has vetoed once already 
have been approved in one form or another but differences remain 
between house and senate versions 
also still pending is the biggest environmental bill of the last 
two years a revision of the clean air act with tighter 
prohibitions on urban air pollution and acid rain 
closeddoor negotiations over the clean air legislation have 
been taking place for several weeks on both sides of the capitol 
but lawmakers remain divided on whether congress can agree on the 
complicated package in the remaining three weeks 
slated for house action this week is a bill authorizing 20 new 
water projects around the country by the army corps of engineers 
even if the legislation is approved the projects also require 
the passage of separate appropriations bills before construction on 
them can begin so far this year congress has declined to approve 
funds for any new projects because of the budget deficit

you have to make choices 
were not making those choices and to spend billions and 
billions of dollars as mr bush apparently wants to although he 
himself has been all over the lot on this issue lately on star 
wars in my judgment makes no sense at all 
we need a strong credible effective nuclear deterrent we have 
13000 strategic nuclear warheads right now 
on land on sea and in the air enough to blow up the soviet 
union 40 times over they have about 12000 
so weve got to move forward with those negotiations get the 
level of strategic weapons down but to continue to commit billions 
to this system makes no sense at all and i think mr bush has been 
reconsidering his position over the course of the past few weeks 
at least thats what i read maybe hell tell us where he stands 
on it tonight 
q mr vice president 
bush im not reconsidering my position 
two questions how do you deter nuclear attack without 
modernizing our nuclear forces when the soviets are modernizing 
and how come you spend willing to spend a dime on something 
that you consider a fantasy and a fraud 
those are two hyporhetorical questions he is the man on 
conventional forces that wants to eliminate two carrier 
battlegroups 
the armed forces the conventional forces of the united states 
have never been more ready 
every single one of the joint chiefs will testify to the fact 
that readiness is at an historic high 
and secondly in terms of the cutting of the coast guard it 
was the congress the democraticcontrolled congress so please 
help us with that who cut 70 million from the coast guard out of 
the interdiction effort on narcotics 
hes got to get this thing more clear why do you spend a 
billion dollars on something you think is a fantasy and a fraud 
i will fully research it go forward as fast as we can weve 
sent up the levels of funding and when it is deployable i will 
deploy it thats my position on sdi and its never waivered a bit 
lehrer peter jennings a question for governor dukakis 
jennings well governor and vice president bush you both 
talked tonight about hard choices let me try to give you one 
somewhere in the middle east tonight nine americans are being held 
hostage if you are commander in chief and americans are held 
hostage what will be more important to you their individual 
fate their individual fate or the commitment that the united 
states government must never negotiate with terrorists and if any 
americans are held hostage and you become president to what 
lengths would you go to rescue them 
dukakis peter its one of the most agonizing decisions a 
president has to make 
these are american citizens we care deeply about them their 
families care deeply about them want them back and understandably 
so and we want to do everything we can to bring them back 
but if theres one thing we also understand it is that you 
cannot make concessions to terrorists ever ever because if you 
do its an open invitation to other terrorists to take hostages 
and to blackmail us and thats the tragedy of the irancontra 
scandal

in lines theyve been polishing all campaign 
long george bush and michael dukakis traded familiar accusations 
in a leadoff debate with no clear winner a standoff that may well 
benefit the democratic challenger 
the confrontation at wake forest university put dukakis on an 
even platform with the betterknown republican nominee two men 
displaying their presidential wares absent a telling blow from one 
debater or the other that usually works to the advantage of the 
outsider in this case the massachusetts governor 
but a breakthrough on the issues will have to await their next 
confrontation three weeks away 
in 90 minutes of sunday night campaign debate bush and dukakis 
summarized what they have been saying to voters every day for 
months 
there were no surprises no secret weapons neither man landed a 
major punch the campus chapel converted to a television 
auditorium for the night was just another campaign stop with a 
vastly larger audience 
based on the presidential campaign debates that have gone 
before the forum itself is likely to be more of a plus for the 
dukakis campaign than for bush less for what they did in debate 
than for where they started 
it usually has worked that way for the challenger for kennedy 
versus nixon carter versus ford reagan versus carter even in 
their first debate for democrat walter mondale against president 
reagan reagan heavily favored for reelection reversed that when 
they met a second time 
the vice president is an administration incumbent with an 
administration record to defend he did so at one point by saying 
he would take all the blame for the irancontra affair and for any 
mistakes in dealing with panama if he could have only half the 
credit for the things president reagan has accomplished in the 
cause of world peace 
because the washington outsider is the likely beneficiary the 
bush campaign wanted fewer debates than dukakis sought and wanted 
them early in the fall not close to the nov 8 election they got 
their way the final bushdukakis debate will be in los angeles on 
oct 13 or 14 
there were no major gaffes in the opening debate nothing to 
compare with gerald r fords 1976 insistence that the soviet union 
does not dominate eastern europe 
bush did misspeak in a discussion of weapons systems but sought 
to deflect the slipup with a joke on himself dukakis shunned the 
scholarly defensive stance that once gave him problems and 
concentrated on offense 
for all that and despite the questions posed by debate 
panelists about specific issues the basic fare for each candidate 
was his attack on the other one thats been a constant complaint 
about the presidential campaign fare of 1988 and the first debate 
did little to change it 
each candidate questioned the others judgment 
the course of the forum was signaled when dukakis was asked to 
name three specific federal programs he would cut in order to 
reduce the budget deficit he mentioned one sort of ive 
suggested there are certain weapons systems which we dont need and 
cant afford he said then he talked about economic growth 
lower interest rates and better tax enforcement 
then he went on offense saying that bushs budget claims would 
turn him into the joe isuzu of american politics 
is now the time to unleash our oneliners bush replied 
that answer was about as clear as boston harbor 
but bushs budget formulation was hardly less murky he talked 
about his flexible freeze on spending blamed the democratic 
congress for current problems claimed a cut in the capital gains 
tax will generate more revenues instead of less and promised i 
will not raise taxes 
he said dukakis had raised taxes five times and didnt even 
have a defense budget to worry about in massachusetts 
when bush got weapons systems confused in one answer he joked 
that it was like his problem getting dates correct as when he 
misdated pearl harbor day 
wouldnt it be nice to be perfect to be the ice man so you 
never make a mistake 
later he made another one in defending sen dan quayle his 
vice presidential nominee bush said there are three men on the 
ticket who are knowledgeable in defense he corrected that to say 
three men in the campaign he obviously meant to include sen lloyd 
bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee and to exclude 
dukakis it didnt work 
did i sense a desire that maybe lloyd bentsen ought to be your 
running mate dukakis shot back

when farmers sell out the odds favor their 
land being bought by other farmers in the neighborhood but an 
agriculture department analyst says the outcome also depends on the 
region of the country 
according to a usda survey a total of 7150 transactions 
involving about 23 million acres were reported between sept 1 
1987 and feb 1 1988 
overall there was no dramatic shift in the use or ownership of 
us farmland says roger hexem of the departments economic 
research service around 2 percent to 4 percent of all agricultural 
land changes hands each year and the majority of buyers are farm 
operators 
the 1988 survey showed that 64 percent of the farmland was 
bought by farmers who already owned and operated land as farm 
units that compared with 60 percent in the 1987 survey and 65 
percent in 1986 
hexem reporting in the october issue of farmline magazine said 
25 percent of the land was bought by nonfarmers 10 percent by 
tenants and 1 percent by retired farmers 
the proportion of acres bought for nonagricultural uses 
varies among regions the report said nonfarm activity is 
often highest in the northeast appalachia and southeast where 
nonfarm buyers and nonagricultural uses figure more prominently 
on average sales in these regions involve considerably smaller 
land parcels nationally farmland sales averaged 317 acres 
according to this years survey while in the northeast the average 
was 141 acres appalachia 115 and southeast 194 
also the report said the share of land bought by farm owners 
and operators varied by region compared with the 64 percent 
national average in the pacific region for example about 80 
percent of the land sales went to other farmers while in the 
northeast only 41 percent was bought by farmers 
producers have been relatively less active in the northeast 
and southeast markets for most of the 1980s the report said 
for example the amount of acreage reportedly bought by 
owneroperators in the northeast fell from 59 percent in 1983 to 41 
percent in 1988 
in the southeast it dropped from 71 percent in 1983 to 42 
percent at the same time acreage bought by nonfarmers in the 
southeast rose from 23 percent in 1983 to 55 percent this year 
hexem said part of this trend results from greater demand for 
land along the east coast from nonagricultural sources urban 
sprawl around such cities as new york boston pittsburgh 
philadelphia baltimore washington dc atlanta and miami has 
been a major factor 
the demand includes more land for homes shopping centers 
office complexes industrial centers roads and airports hexem 
said additional demand comes from second homes retirement homes 
and recreational uses 
even so hexem said most of the land that has changed hands is 
expected to continue in agricultural production for the foreseeable 
future 
according to the survey about 91 percent of the recently sold 
farmland nationwide will probably remain in agriculture for the 
next five years an additional 1 percent is expected to go into 
forestry and about 8 percent into other uses including housing 
recreation and commercial and industrial sites 
land most likely to stay in farming five year after being sold 
is in the lake states corn belt northern plains mountain and 
pacific regions hexem said one reason is that farming 
predominates in these areas with less competition from other land 
uses 
another development has been an increase in the acres per parcel 
of land sold and a decrease in the average price per acre of the 
reported sales in 1988 sales averaged 317 acres nationwide up 
from 236 acres in 1987 prices dropped to 566 per acre from 607 
in 1987 
hexem said some of this can be attributed to several large 
tracts of land likely rangeland sold at relatively low prices in 
the mountain and southern plains regions while accounting for only 
13 percent of the land transactions the two regions were 
responsible for 45 percent of the acreage that changed hands he 
said 
the survey showed that buyers have been acquiring land with less 
credit many using cash instead in 1988 the report said 70 
percent of the sales were financed down from 73 percent last year 
and 90 percent in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
hexem said the 70 percent is comparable to financing levels of 
the early 1960s 
creditfinanced sales remained most popular in the northeast 
lake states and mountain regions while cash sales increased in the 
corn belt appalachia and the southeast

as a matter of fact mr bush was the chairman of a task force 
on international terrorism which issued a report shortly before 
that decision was made and said and rightly so that we never 
ever can make concessions to terrorists and hostage takers 
and yet after sitting through meeting after meeting he 
endorsed that decision endorsed the sale of arms to the ayatollah 
in exchange for hostages one of the most tragic one of the most 
mistaken foreign policy decisions weve ever made in this country 
and i dare say encouraged others to take hostages as we now know 
so there can be no concessions under any circumstances because 
if we do its an open invitation to others to do that same 
weve got to be tough on international terrorism weve got to 
treat it as international crime weve got to attack it at all 
points 
weve got to use undercover operations we have to be prepared 
to use military force against terrorist base camps we have to work 
closely with our allies to make sure that theyre working with us 
and we with them 
and we can give no quarter when it comes to breaking the back of 
international terrorism 
yes we should make every effort to try help those hostages come 
home but it can never be because we make concessions that was a 
tragic mistake that we made mistake that mr bush made and 
others made and it should never ever be made again 
q mr vice president 
bush i wrote the antiterrorist report for this government it 
is the best antiterrorist report written 
yes we shouldnt trade arms for hostages but we made vast 
improvements in our antiterrorism 
now its fine to say that sometimes you have to hit base camps 
but when the president saw the statesponsored fingerprints of 
moammar gadhafi on the loss of american life he hit libya 
and my opponent was unwilling to support that action and since 
that action 
dukakis thats not true thats not true 
bush terrorist action against united states citizens have 
gone down 
and i have long ago said i supported the president on this other 
matter and ive said mistakes were made clearly nobodys going 
to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade 
arms for hostages 
that is a very serious charge against the president and that 
has been thoroughly looked into but the point is sometimes the 
action has to be taken by the federal government 
and when we took action it had a favorable response 
lehrer a question for the vice president peter 
jennings it seems perhaps a good subject mr vice president 
on which to make the point that youve campaigned vigorously as 
part of a leadership team but so far you wont tell the american 
people in considerable measure what advice you gave the president 
on issues including the sale of arms to iran 
and what should have been done about the hostages to the best 
of my knowledge theres no constitutional requirement which 
prevents you from doing so 
jimmy carter urged his vice president walter mondale to tell 
the american people would you now ask president reagan for 
permission to tell the american people what advice you did give 
him and if you dont how do we judge your judgment in the oval 
office in the last eight years 
bush you judge by the whole record you judge by the entire 
record are we closer to peace are we doing better in 
antiterrorism should we have listened to my opponent who wanted 
to send the un into the persian gulf or in spite of the 
mistakes of the past are we doing better there 
how is our credibility with the gcc countries on the western 
side of the gulf is iran talking to iraq about peace 
you judge on the record are the soviets coming out of 
afghanistan how does it look in a program he called phony or some 
one of these marvelous boston adjectives up there about angola 
now we have a chance now several bostonians dont like it 
but the rest of the country will understand now we have a 
chance now we have a chance now we have a chance and so i 
think that id leave it right there and say that you judge on the 
whole record

thomas jefferson high school for science 
and technology has yet to graduate its first class but already more 
than a sixth of its 340 seniors have been named national merit 
scholarship semifinalists 
and a 16yearold junior led a fourstudent team to victory over 
1500 schools in a rigorous nationwide competition for a 1 million 
supercomputer last month 
in other respects the kids in the school in annandale a suburb 
of washington dc are normal teenagers they go out for 
football plaster their classroom walls with posters and art 
produce a school newspaper audition for the drama club play 
but their academic record is something else the seniors 
performance in the merit scholarship competition placed the high 
school fifth among the 19000 schools that participated 
isnt it fabulous says fairfax county school superintendent 
robert spillane this is the first full year of a fouryear 
school and it has already made its mark 
a passion for learning among the student body and unusual 
cooperation make thomas jefferson a trendsetter among high schools 
in this era of burgeoning technology 
what characterizes the environment in this building is 
extraordinary intellectual stimulation a sense of enjoyment of 
learning and a commitment to excellence said mary harley kruter 
admissions and staff development director its really 
phenomenal 
the school won the supercomputer thanks to a project by manish 
tuteja 16 called complex plane analysis of the newton raphson 
method on high order polynomials the project focused on a method 
for deriving formulas in calculus involving work being done in 
relatively new study of chaos according to principal geoffrey 
jones 
the work he did was quite significant and likely will lead to 
publication jones said 
jefferson opened in fall 1985 in an area thats growing faster 
than any in the country in the hightech field sixteenhundred 
teenagers are bused in daily from all over northern virginia 
only one in three eighthgrade students who hope to attend 
jefferson meet its rigorous standards for admission aspirants must 
take a standardized test and write an essay school officials also 
take into account their previous school experiences including 
grades activities and ability and interest in science and 
mathematics 
students pursue parallel programs in science and technology the 
science curriculum follows the standard college preparatory course 
with classes in earth science biology calculus and the other 
usual requirements 
the technology portion focuses on learning by doing in the real 
world 
we have a strong tie with business and industry that leads us 
to a different model of education focusing on the technology as 
its being used and developed in the field jones said the 
ideal program for us is to have student and faculty who are 
actually working with people in the industry on the same 
technologies and learning the science and math as part of the 
experience 
corporations have donated computer labs and other equipment to 
the young school and professionals visit regularly to teach and 
work with students 
we actually send students out to work in the field said 
jones pointing out the example of honeywell where students work 
parttime and during the summer 
other companies that support jefferson include atlantic 
research virginia power atampt sony hazelton laboratories bdm 
martin marietta hewlitt packard computer sciences corp ibm 
dynalectron and trw 
the hightech focus at the school is balanced by a strong 
humanities program and a sports program 
jones plays down the merit scholarship aspect of his schools 
success saying the standardized tests are not a good measure of 
school success his challenge is finding innovative ways to 
measure how well jefferson fulfills its mandate as one of the first 
schools in the nation to focus intensively on science and 
technology 
one of our real challenges or goals is to develop a model for 
scientific and technological education and to see if that model is 
different from what has traditionally happened in the schools

and let me say this all he can talk about he goes around 
ranting about noriega 
now ive told you what the intelligence briefing he received 
said about that 
he can talk about irancontra and also ill make a deal with 
you i will take all the blame for those two incidents if you give 
me half the credit for all of the good things that have happened in 
world peace since ronald reagan and i took over from the carter 
administration 
i still i still have a i still have a couple of minutes left 
and there is a different principle here on 
lehrer sorry sorry mr vice president 
bush its only on yellow out here wait a minute 
lehrer im sorry im wrong go ahead my apologies 
bush jim 
lehrer you said nobodys perfect 
bush i said i wasnt perfect but i thought you were where 
was i 
lehrer my apology 
dukakis the 25th of december mr vice president 
bush i agree i agree where was i 
lehrer governor 
dukakis he can have another 10 seconds if he wants to 
lehrer yes sir go ahead 
bush go ahead 
lehrer all right all right governor you have a minute to 
respond 
dukakis well the matter of judgment is very important and i 
think its important to understand what happened here 
a report on international terrorism chaired by the vice 
president was released and made some very specific recommendations 
about how to deal with terrorism they were ignored 
the vice president ignored them it says mistakes were made 
very serious mistakes in judgment were made 
he says well lets concede that the administration has been 
doing business with noriega whos made him a part of our foreign 
policy and has been funneling aid to the contras through convicted 
drug dealers 
i think those are very very serious questions of judgment 
which those of you who are watching us here tonight have a right to 
judge and review 
were not going to make those kinds of mistakes you cannot make 
concessions to terrorists if you do you invite the taking of more 
hostages thats a basic principle it was ignored in that case 
and it was a very very serious mistake in judgment 
lehrer go to a question from john mashek it goes to the vice 
president 
mashek mr vice president democrats and even some 
republicans are still expressing reservations about the 
qualifications and credentials of sen dan quayle of indiana your 
chosen running mate to be a heartbeat away from the presidency 
what do you see in him that others do not 
bush i see a young man that was elected to the senate twice to 
the house of representatives twice 
i see a man who is young and im putting my confidence in a 
whole generation of people that are in their thirties and in their 
forties 
i see a man that took the leadership in the job training 
partnership act and that retrains people in this highly 
competitive changing society were in so if a person loses his job 
he is retrained for a benefit for a work that will be productive 
and he wont have to go on one of these many programs that the 
liberals keep talking about 
i see a young man who is knowledgeable in defense and there are 
three people on our ticket that are knowledgable in the whole in 
the race knowledgable in defense and dan quayle is one of them 
and i am one of them and i believe that he will be outstanding 
and he took a tremendous pounding and everybody now knows that he 
took a very unfair pounding 
and id like each person to say did i jump to conclusions 
running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal and hes 
kept his head up and he will do very very well and he has my full 
confidence and hell have the confidence of people that are in 
their thirties and forties and more 
so judge the man on his record not on a lot of rumors and 
innuendo and trying to fool around with his name 
my opponent says j danforth quayle do you know who j 
danforth was he was a man that gave his life in world war ii so 
ridiculing a persons name is a little beneath this process and 
hell do very well when we get into the debate 
dukakis well when it comes to ridicule george you win a gold 
medal i think we can agree on that 
bush just the facts 
dukakis but did i sense a desire that maybe lloyd bentsen ought 
to be your running mate when you said that the three people on your 
ticket laughter 
bush no i think the debate ought to be 
dukakis i think the american people have a right to judge us on 
this question on how we picked a running mate a person who is a 
heartbeat away from the presidency i picked lloyd bentsen a 
distinguished strong mature a leader in the senate somebody 
whose qualifications nobody has questioned 
mr bush picked dan quayle i doubt very much that dan quayle 
was the best qualified person for that job and as a matter of 
fact i think for most people the notion of president quayle is 
a very very troubling notion tonight

christopher burroughs was 14 when he was 
told his mother was a tibetan saint who lived 300 years ago but it 
wasnt much of a surprise to him 
she was always giving advice and teaching people he says of 
his mother catharine who was enthroned saturday as the western 
worlds first adult reincarnate lama now 16 christopher 
eventually plans to continue the path of buddha known as dharma 
and become a monk 
there is certainly an adjustment when you find out that mom is 
not just mom says her husband michael burroughs director of 
the buddhist prayer center in poolesville a suburb of washington 
dc but there was no question that she always was 
extraordinary 
catharine burroughs a 38yearold mother of three had been a 
meditation teacher in maryland when penor rinpoche a living 
buddha who runs a buddhist monastery in india visited her 
classes in 1985 and told her that her instinctive knowledge was 
tibetan buddhism and that her wisdom was that of a tibetan saint 
ahkon lhamo who helped found a monastery the mid1600s 
he returned to the center saturday which he named the seat of 
his teachings in america to perform the ceremony 
i was teaching buddhism before i ever read a book on it 
mrs burroughs said while sipping tea after the ceremony 
the reincarnate lamas teachers with an obligation to help rid 
the world of suffering are venerated by tibetan buddhists because 
they are believed to return to this world voluntarily to enlighten 
others 
usually such lamas are recognized as children to be the 
reincarnation of their predecessor who recently died 
in india there are reincarnate lamas who have walked up to 
their parents and said i am not joebob i am soandso take me 
to my monastery mrs burroughs said 
she was born in brooklyn to a roman catholic italian father and 
jewish mother she attended high school and community college in 
miami and moved to maryland in 1982 to establish a place for 
meditation 
the buddhist center formally established in 1983 as kunsang 
odsal palyul changchub cheoling is a temple of buddhist teaching 
and prayer devoted to the cessation of suffering 
its members are some 70 professionals in the 
baltimorewashington area who take shifts maintaining a 24hour 
prayer vigil and fund the center through private donations

winstonsalem nc ap vice president george bush drew a 
deep groan from the presidential debate audience in questioning 
michael dukakis use of phony or some one of these marvelous 
boston adjectives to describe the reagan administrations foreign 
policy 
with a long oooh the audience appeared to have 
interpreted bushs remark during the presidential debate sunday 
night as a regional slur appealing to a belief among many voters 
that dukakis home town is a cradle for liberal politicians and 
ideas 
several bostonians dont like it bush said in response to 
the utterances from the audience but the rest of the country

lehrer all right john will now ask a question of the governor 
it will be the last question and then the vice president will have 
a rebuttal john 
mashek well governor you did select lloyd bentsen of texas 
dukakis i did indeed 
mashek and you have a lot of disagreement with him on 
fundamental issues including the reagan tax cuts aid to the 
rebels in nicaragua the death penalty gun control whos right 
dukakis well john im a man whos been a chief executive for 
10 years ive picked a lot of people ive picked cabinets ive 
named judges i know that the people you pick make an enormous 
difference in your ability to govern 
and i set high standards i try to meet them and i insist that 
people who work for me meet them and if they dont they dont 
stick around very long 
but i didnt pick lloyd bentsen because he was a clone of mike 
dukakis i picked him because he was somebody who would be a strong 
vice president somebody who would be an active vice president 
somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with a crazy 
idea that we ought to trade arms to the ayatollah for hostages and 
say mr president thats wrong we shouldnt do that thats 
the kind of vice president i want 
he himself has said and rightly so that he will be a strong 
vice president but when the president makes a decision that will 
be his decision and i am very very proud of that choice and i 
didnt pick him because he agreed with me on everything 
you know sam rayburn once said that if two people agree on 
everything then only one person is doing the thinking 
the fact is that ive picked somebody who not only will be a 
great vice president but if god forbid something happens to the 
president could step into that office and do so with distinction 
and with strength and with leadership 
i doubt very much i doubt very much that mr bushs selection 
for the vice presidency of the united states meets that test 
lehrer mr vice president 
bush we obviously have a difference i believe it does meet the 
test well have an opportunity to see the two of them in action in 
a friendly forum wonderful friendly fashion like this 
i had hoped that thisd id hoped this had been a little 
friendlier an evening 
id wanted to hitchhike a ride home in his tank with him but i 
think now were weve got the lines too carefully drawn here 
but you talk about judgment i mean what kind of judgment i 
mean jumping all over the president on his decision on one area of 
the foreign policy 
what kind of judgment sense has your chief education adviser 
now in jail in massachusetts i mean i dont think this is a fair 
argument but nevertheless i support my nominee for vice 
president and hell do an outstanding job 
lehrer gentlemen i was given some bad word a moment ago there 
is time for one more question laughter getting it in my ear 
and anne groer will ask it 
groer to vice president bush 
lehrer to to the governor sorry 
groer oh im so sorry governor dukakis as many us farmers 
face or undergo foreclosure the united states is considering the 
possibility of forgiving a certain percentage of debt owed by latin 
american and third world countries do you favor giving these 
countries a break in their loans and if so how do you explain 
that to the american farmers who are losing their land and 
livelihood 
dukakis well i think we have to go to work on the problem of 
third world debt and weve got to assist those third world 
countries in dealing with this massive debt which they currently 
which they have incurred and which is burdening them and which 
if we dont do something about it and assist them along with other 
nations around the world well destroy their economies destroy 
their future and at the same time well destroy markets that are 
important to our farmers 
but i also believe that we need an agricultural policy which 
doesnt cost us the 15 billion to 20 billion to 25 billion a 
year that its been costing us over the course of the past three or 
four years under this administration 
i think its going to require good solid credit policies and 
thanks to the congress we now have an agricultural credit bill 
which is helping and improving the situation with at least some of 
our farmers i think its going to require a combination of supply 
management and reasonable price supports to make sure that our 
farmers get a decent price

winstonsalem nc ap republican nominee george bush used 
some momentary confusion over weapons systems in the presidential 
debate to poke fun at his tendency to utter bloopers on the 
campaign trail 
its christmas the vice president said during the debate 
with democrat michael dukakis after confusing the midgetman and 
minuteman with the mx missile but correcting himself immediately 
laughter erupted from the audience remembering bushs reference 
earlier this month to the japanese bombing of pearl harbor as 
occurring on sept 7 1941 instead of dec 7 
wouldnt it be nice to be perfect bush quipped in response 
to the laughter he then played to a republican theme that dukakis 
is cold and aloof wouldnt it be nice to be the ice man so you 
never make a mistake 
dukakis got the last laugh by picking up on the same quip when 
bush later objected to moderator jim lehrer cutting off his 
response to a question on the irancontra arms and money scandal 
its only on yellow here wait a minute bush said 
referring to a light at the front of the stage warning that his 
response time for the question was about to expire but had not yet 
lehrer admitted he was wrong apologized saying you said 
nobodys perfect and told bush to go ahead with his answer 
i said i wasnt perfect i thought you were bush told 
lehrer drawing more giggles from the audience where was i 
the 25th of december mr vice president dukakis answered 
i agree bush said ive finished

and i think it also is going to require an administration that 
understands that there are tremendous opportunities out there for 
the development of new uses for agricultural products new uses 
which can help us to clean up our environment at the same time 
biodegradable plastic gasohol which the vice president himself 
has been involved in road deicers made from corn products 
i mean there are enormous opportunities out there to expand 
markets and to build a strong future for our farmers 
but i dont think there is anything mutually exclusive or 
contradictory about building a strong farm economy in this country 
and assisting our family farms and providing a good strong future 
for rural communities and for rural america and at the same time 
working on third world debt 
as a matter of fact mexico itself is one of our biggest 
agricultural customers so in the sense that we can work to help 
mexico we build and expand and deal with its very serious economic 
problems we help our farmers at the same time 
lehrer mr vice president 
bush i oppose supply management and production controls i 
support the farm bill the 85 farm bill and its spending is 
moving in the right direction 
i want to expand our markets abroad and thats why id like to 
call for that first economic summit to be on agriculture 
i will not go back to the way the democrats did it and use food 
as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the farmers in 
this country 
i want to see rural redevelopment and i have been out front in 
favor of alternate sources of energy and one of them is gasohol 
and it comes from using your corn and i think we can do better in 
terms of biodegradables for a lot of products so im optimistic 
about the agricultural economy 
in terms of the third world i support the baker plan i want to 
see market economies spring up all around the world and to the 
degree they do we are succeeding 
and i dont want to see the banks let off the hook i would 
oppose that but i think were on the right track in agriculture 
and i am very very encouraged 
but lets not go back to thats what they call supply 
management and production control that will simply price us 
out of the international market lets try to expand our markets 
abroad 
lehrer all right that really is the end now lets go to 
closing statements they will be two minutes each in duration by 
agreement vice president bush goes first governor dukakis 
second mr vice president 
bush i talked in new orleans about a gentler and kinder nation 
and i have made specific proposals on education and the 
enviroment on ethics on energy and on how we do better in 
battling crime in our country 
but there are two main focal points of this election 
opportunity and peace i want to keep this expansion going yes we 
want change but we are the change i am the change i dont want 
to go back to malaise and misery index and so opportunity keep 
america at work the best poverty program is a job with dignity in 
the private sector 
and in terms of peace we are on the right track weve achieved 
an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never 
possible and i want to build on it i want to see us finalize that 
start agreement and i want to be the one to finally lead the world 
to banishing chemical and biological weapons i want to see 
asymmetrical reductions in conventional forces 
and then it gets down to a question of values weve had a 
chance to spell out our differences on the pledge of allegiance 
here tonight and on tough sentencing of drug kingpins and this 
kind of thing i do favor the death penalty and weve got a wide 
array of differences on those

but in the final analysis in the final analysis the person 
goes into that voting booth theyre going to say who has the 
values i believe in who has the experience that we trust who has 
the integrity and the stability to get the job done my fellow 
americans i am that man and i ask for your support thank you very 
much 
lehrer governor governor dukakis 
dukakis this has been an extraordinary 18 months for kitty and 
me and for our family 
weve had an opportunity to campaign all over this country to 
meet with so many of you in communities states and regions to get 
to know you 
im more optimistic today than i was when i began about this 
nation providing we have the kind of leadership in washington that 
can work with you that can build partnerships that can build jobs 
in every part of this country not certain parts of this country 
you know my friends my parents came to this country as 
immigrants like millions and millions of americans before them and 
since seeking opportunity seeking the american dream 
they made sure their sons understood that this was the greatest 
country in the world that those of us especially who were the 
sons and daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to 
give something back to the country that had opened up its arms to 
our parents and given so much to them 
i believe in the american dream i am a product of it and i 
want to help that dream come true for every single citizen in this 
land with a good job and good wages with good schools in every 
part of this country and every community in this country with 
decent and affordable housing that our people can buy and own and 
live in so that we end the shame of homelessness in america with 
decent and affordable health care for all working families 
yes its a tough problem as mr bush says but its not an 
insolvable problem its one that we will solve and must solve 
with a clean and wholesome environment and with a strong america 
thats strong militarily and economically as we must be an 
america that provides strong international leadership because 
were true to our values we have an opportunity working together 
to build that future to build a better america to build the best 
america because the best america doesnt hide we compete 
the best america doesnt waste we invest the best america 
doesnt leave some of its citizens behind we leave we bring 
everybody along and the best america is not behind us the best 
america is yet to come 
thank you very much for listening

winstonsalem nc ap here are excerpts of the debate 
sunday night between presidential candidates george bush and 
michael dukakis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
question what is there about these times that drives or draws 
so many americans to use drugs 
bush i think weve seen a deterioration of values i think for 
a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have 
condemned 
dukakis its important that our leaders demonstrate those 
values from the top here we are with a government thats been 
dealing with a drugrunning panamanian dictator weve been dealing 
with him hes been dealing drugs to our kids and governors 
like me and others have been trying to deal with the 
consequences 
bush seven administrations were dealing with mr noriega it 
was the reaganbush administration that brought this man to 
justice 
question would you identify for us three specific 
programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down 
dukakis there are certain weapons systems which we dont 
need and we cant afford secondly weve got to invest in 
economic growth in this country in every part of this country 
thirdly we have to bring interest rates down and finally 
weve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of 
dollars in taxes owed 
the thing i dont understand about mr bushs approach to this 
is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit 
down given what he says he wants to do 
if he keeps this up hes going to be the joe isuzu of american 
politics 
bush that answer was about as clear as boston harbor 
when you cut capital gains you put people to work now 
massachusetts doesnt have an enormous defense budget but 
nevertheless the governor raised taxes five different times 
question today 37 million americans including many 
working families with aging parents and young children cannot 
afford any health insurance but earn too much to qualify for 
medicaid what will you do to provide protection for them and how 
will you pay for it 
bush one thing i will not do is sock every business in the 
country and thus throw some people out of work what i will 
do is permit people to buy into medicaid 
dukakis its no answer to those 37 million people most of 
them members of working families who dont have a dime of health 
insurance and dont know how to pay the bills if the kids get sick 
at night 
question what is so wrong with the governor being a member 
of an organization the aclu which has come to the defense of 
among other people col oliver north 
bush i dont agree with a lot of the most of the positions 
of the aclu he has every right to exercise his passion as what 
he said a strong progressive liberal 
they raised the same thing with me on the pledge of allegiance 
you see id have found a way to sign that bill im not 
questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment on 
these matters 
dukakis of course the vice president is questioning my 
patriotism and i resent it i resent it 
question what commitment are you willing to make tonight to 
the homeless 
bush the government has a role it is to fully fund the 
mckinney act there are certain army bases that the act calls for 
that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when its 
rough 
dukakis mr bush wants to spend billions and trillions on 
star wars do we spend money on that weapon system in the 
billions and trillions or is providing some decent and affordable 
housing for families of this country 
question if abortions were to become illegal again do you 
think that the women who defy the law and the doctors who 
performed them should go to jail 
bush i havent sorted out the penalties but i do know i do 
know that i oppose abortion and i favor adoption 
dukakis well i think what the vice president is saying is that 
hes prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making this decision 
 
question if it haunts you so why over the eight years of 
the reaganbush administration have so many programs to help the 
inner cities been eliminated or cut 
bush i think part of it is the crimeinfested 
neighborhoods and thats why im a strong believer in trying to 
control crimes in the neighborhood why i was so pleased to be 
endorsed by the policemen on the beat the boston police 
department 
dukakis well i must have been living through a different eight 
years from the one that the vice presidents been living through 
because this administration has cut and slashed and cut and slashed 
programs for children for nutrition for the kinds of things that 
can help these youngsters to live better lives 
question where would you get the money to devote to the 
inner cities 
dukakis if we invest in job training in child care for 
those youngsters in some extended health benefits so that that 
mother and her kids dont lose their health benefits when she goes 
to work 
bush were putting more money per child into education and 
we are not performing as we should 
question governor the vice president continually refers to 
your lack of experience weakness naivete on foreign policy and 
national security matters 
dukakis thats a charge thats always made against any 
governor who runs for the presidency i think it was one of the 
things that mr bush said about mr reagan back in 1980 
the vice president has a long resume but it didnt stop him 
from endorsing the sale of arms to the ayatollah his 
experience didnt prevent him from being involved in the 
relationship between this government and mr noriega and the 
drugtrafficking in panama he went to the philippines in the early 
80s and commended ferdinand marcos for his commitment to 
democracy and he continues to support a failed policy in central 
america 
bush ive met mr gorbachev i met mr shevardnadze 
these people are tough but please do not go back to the days 
when the military was as weak as they could be when the morale was 
down and we when we were the laughing stock around the world

question are you prepared to tell the voters one system 
that youd be willing to cut or even eliminate that wouldnt 
endanger national security 
bush what i am not going to do when we are negotiating with 
the soviet union im not going to give away a couple of aces 
in that very tough card game we are going to make some changes 
and some tough choices before we go to deployment on the midgetman 
missile or on the on the minuteman whatever it is were going 
to have to the mx mx 
dukakis mr bush wants to spend billions on star wars he 
apparently wants to spend billions on the mx on railroad cars i 
thought the administration was opposed to the midgetman i thought 
the administration was at the negotiating table in geneva 
suggesting that we ban mobile missile systems entirely i am 
for the stealth i am for the d5 i am for going ahead with the 
advanced cruise missile 
question should we be doing a lot to help the economics and 
the social development of a country that we have so long regarded 
as an adversary 
bush what i think we ought to do is take a look at perestroika 
and glasnost welcome them but keep our eyes open be cautious 
because the soviet change is not fully established yet 
dukakis 
what were talking about is a combination of a strong and 
effective and credible nuclear deterrent and at the same time 
a willingness to move forward steadily thoughtfully cautiously 
 
question you have gone from calling the strategic defense 
initiative or star wars a fantasy and a fraud to saying 
recently you would continue sdi research and might even deploy the 
system if congress supported such a move 
dukakis ive said from the beginning that we ought to 
continue research into the strategic system at about the level it 
was at in 1983 but i dont know of any reputable scientists 
who believe that this system at least as originally conceived 
could possibly work 
bush how do you deter nuclear attack without modernizing 
our nuclear forces when the soviets are modernizing 
question if any americans are held hostage and you become 
president to what lengths would you go to rescue them 
dukakis you cannot make concessions to terrorists ever 
ever because if you do its an open invitation to other 
terrorists to take hostages and to blackmail us bush 
endorsed that decision endorsed the sale of arms to the ayatollah 
in exchange for hostages 
bush ive said mistakes were made clearly nobodys going 
to think the president started out thinking he was going to trade 
arms for hostages 
question so far you wont tell the american people in 
considerable measure what advice you gave the president on issues 
and if you dont how do we judge your judgment in the oval 
office in the last eight years 
bush you judge by the whole record are we closer to peace 
are we doing better in antiterrorism should we have listened to 
my opponent who wanted to send the un into the persian gulf is 
iran talking to iraq about peace are the soviets coming out of 
afghanistan 
dukakis i think those are very very serious questions of 
judgment were not going to make those kinds of mistakes 
question democrats and even some republicans are still 
expressing reservations about the qualifications and credentials of 
senator dan quayle of indiana 
bush i see a man who is young and im putting my confidence 
in a whole generation of people that are in their thirties and in 
their forties i see a young man who is knowledgeable in 
defense 
so judge the man on his record not on a lot of rumors and 
innuendo and trying to fool around with his name 
dukakis i picked lloyd bentsen a distinguished strong 
mature a leader in the senate somebody whose qualifications 
nobody has questioned mr bush picked dan quayle i doubt very 
much that dan quayle was the best qualified person for that job 
question you have a lot of disagreement with bentsen on 
fundamental issues whos right 
dukakis i didnt pick lloyd bentsen because he was a clone 
of mike dukakis i picked him because he was somebody who would be 
a strong vice president somebody who would be an active vice 
president somebody who would come to me if somebody came up with 
a crazy idea that we ought to trade arms to the ayatollah for 
hostages and say mr president thats wrong we shouldnt do 
that 
bush but you talk about judgment i mean what kind of 
judgment i mean jumping all over the president on his decision on 
one area of the foreign policy what kind of judgment sense has 
your chief education adviser now in jail in massachusetts 
question do you favor giving latin american and third world 
countries a break in their loans and if so how do you explain 
that to the american farmers 
dukakis if we dont do something about it and assist them 
along with other nations around the world well destroy their 
economies destroy their future and at the same time well 
destroy markets that are important to our farmers but i also 
believe that we need an agricultural policy which doesnt cost us 
the 15 billion to 20 billion to 25 billion a year 
bush i want to expand our markets abroad and thats why 
id like to call for that first economic summit to be on 
agriculture i will not go back to the way the democrats did it 
and use food as a political weapon and throw a grain embargo on the 
farmers in this country 
closing statements 
bush there are two main focal points of this election 
opportunity and peace yes we want change but we are the 
change i am the change i dont want to go back to malaise and 
misery index 
and in terms of peace we are on the right track weve achieved 
an arms control agreement that our critics thought was never 
possible and i want to build on it 
in the final analysis the person goes into that voting booth 
theyre going to say who has the values i believe in who has the 
experience that we trust who has the integrity and the stability 
to get the job done my fellow americans i am that man 
dukakis my parents came to this country as immigrants 
they made sure their sons understood this is the greatest country 
in the world that those of us especially who were the sons and 
daughters of immigrants had a special responsibility to give 
something back to the country that had opened up its arms to our 
parents and given so much to them 
we have an opportunity working together to build that future 
to build a better america to build a best america because a best 
america doesnt hide we compete 
the best america doesnt waste we invest the best america 
doesnt leave some of its citizens behind we leave we bring 
everybody along and the best america is not behind us the best 
america is yet to come

the episcopal church is attempting to include everyone in the 
mainstream of gods justice grace brotherhood and sisterhood

i have already stated publicly that i would not be able to 
be in communion with a woman so elected and consecrated said the

winstonsalem nc ap the debate was over and gridlock 
reigned in the press room it wasnt reporters trying to reach 
george bush and michael dukakis it was the stampede of political 
heavyweights shamelessly promoting their candidates performance 
while making the other guys seem abysmal 
senators and governors competed for reporters attention and 
televisions cameras to claim that dukakis came across as 
presidential humane and compassionate and bush as plastic and 
fuzzy or vice versa 
in political parlance it is known as the spin patrol and a glut 
of spin was spun by politicians brought in for just that purpose 
the democrats had the likes of sens ted kennedy and bill bradley 
and the republicans had sen alan simpson former sen john tower 
and new hampshire gov john sununu 
the wake forest university cafeteria turned into a press room 
was packed with postdebate spinners who needed no prompting to 
stand amenably surrounded by cameras and tape recorders and 
reporters with notebooks other spinners made the rounds of the 
television shows 
kennedy volunteered that his home state governor dukakis had 
scored a clear win he was presidential he was compelling he 
was convincing said kennedy 
the democratic line on bush was typified by dukakis adviser tom 
donilon who coordinated the democrats debate preparation i 
dont think he was very presidential tonight he wasnt in command 
and control he was wandering 
simpson of wyoming said bush showed he was a real human 
being while dukakis looked absolutely programmed as well as 
plastic 
and sununu came up with this instant analysis i thought the 
vice president looked very relaxed i think michael dukakis looked 
very clerkish 
while each side claimed their candidate had won many were 
willing to say that the winning and losing was not pronounced and 
some even ventured to acknowledge that the other candidate scored a 
point or two 
i dont think either candidate made any mistakes owned up 
sununu 
several democrats seized on bushs stumbles such as when he 
referred to the midgetman missile or the minuteman whatever it 
is 
no rebutted the bush spinners little mistatements showed bush 
was human not a man who looks like a machine in simpsons 
description of dukakis 
appearances were important to the spinners because each side had 
wanted to project their man as a caring humane candidate as well 
as one who grasped the issues 
predictably each side expressed satisfaction on that score 
media consultant frank greer who had coached dukakis on being 
more personable said his candidate did everything that he needed 
to do and more 
richard darman who played the part of dukakis in bushs debate 
practice sessions on the other hand said bush scored a perfect 
10 while dukakis came across as dour stern didactic 
dukakis was boring said bush campaign manager lee atwater 
george bush was on the defensive said sen john kerry 
dmass 
several republicans including gop party chairman frank 
fahrenkopf stressed that more than winning or losing the debate 
helped crystallize the differences between the two candidates and 
in the mind of the bush ssupporters cement dukakis as a liberal 
they both did fine they both reinforced their positions 
said atwater who then could not resist adding the spin all the 
swing voters that watched this would come down on the side of the 
vice president

a soviet journalist who defected to britain in 
1966 is now reunited with his son who had tried in vain for more 
than 20 years to gain permission to emigrate 
today is the first day in my life that i have been really 
happy said anatoli shustov 43 standing arminarm with his 
father leonid finkelstein at londons heathrow airport after a 
flight from moscow on sunday 
i have plans to improve my english and start a new life he 
told reporters through an interpreter 
finkelstein a 64yearold journalist last saw his son in 
december 1965 shortly before he sought political asylum during a 
visit to britain with a group of writers 
he said his protracted campaign to bring his son to britain came 
to nothing until the intervention of the british government last 
year when foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe presented to soviet 
authorities a list of some 20 soviets seeking to emigrate to 
britain most to be reunited with family members 
prime minister margaret thatcher discussed the plight of those 
people with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev when he stopped in 
britain dec 7 on his way to a washington summit with president 
reagan the foreign office says many have since emigrated but has 
declied to give a figure 
finkelstein has worked for the british broadcasting corps 
russian service since 1980 shustov an industrial chemist said he 
listened to his fathers weekly broadcasts in the soviet union 
because he had applied to emigrate shustov said he was barred 
from working as a chemist and forced to take jobs as parkinglot 
attendant and shopkeeper such work where there would be no risk 
of getting any classified information 
maybe now i will work as an industrial chemist again he 
said 
finkelstein said he was still a little at sea over meeting 
his son again 
i cant yet form an opinion but the omens are good he said 
i have good signs which i havent had for years in my life good 
dreams good happenings and good tidings altogether i think it 
will be alright 
finkelstein said he was committed to a labor camp in moscow 
between 1947 and 1953 for using the wrong words and his son 
used to visit him there 
i remember him sitting on my knee and saying to me dad 
lets go home

a growing economic boycott by the 
international community could force change in burma where an angry 
populace and economic crisis are challenging the resolve of the new 
military government 
but some analysts following the recent chaotic events in the 
southeast asian nation are skeptical that outside pressure can sway 
the top leadership given its 26 years of isolationism and 
disregard of earlier calls for reform 
theres very little leverage if the outside world holds up 
its hands in horror they burmese leaders are still going to do 
what they think is necessary one bangkokbased diplomat said 
japan which accounts for about 80 percent of foreign loans and 
grants to burma has just stopped sending assistance west germany 
the no 2 donor froze its aid sept 5 and washington announced 
last week that it was suspending all but humanitarian help 
these countries along with australia china britain the soviet 
union sweden the european economic community and others have 
expressed concern over the violence in recent days 
western diplomats estimate that since last fall several 
thousand demonstrators have been killed on orders from a military 
elite that seized power in 1962 and led one of asias most 
resourcerich countries into economic ruin and isolation 
gen saw maung seized power a week ago in a military coup that 
overthrew civilian president maung maung diplomats say saw maung 
is a close associate of ne win who led the 1962 coup and ruled 
with an iron fist until he resigned in july after massive street 
protests 
the recent political turmoil has crippled an economy that was 
already on a rapid downward spiral factories have halted 
production transport has been paralyzed and foreign currency 
reserves are virtually at zero while the foreign debt has climbed 
to more than 4 billion 
theyre in such bad shape that if the japanese and others just 
say absolutely no more until there is some kind of democracy 
there would be changes american economic consultant robert 
nathan said in an interview 
but nathan who has spent several years in burma said any 
economic boycott would have to be accompanied by continued popular 
and probably bloody resistance headed by a unified oppositon 
coalition 
he said sanctions by the japanese would have the greatest 
economic impact on burma sanctions by the united states which 
gives a relatively modest 14 million could have a significant 
moral psychological impact he said 
another expert on burma david steinberg of the united states 
said a carrot and stick approach could induce change while 
halting all aid at present the major donors should at the same 
formulate a comprehensive assistance program to be implemented when 
a pluralistic system emerges in burma he said 
in the past burma has been impervious to criticism by 
international human rights groups such as amnesty international 
and even to advice on economic policy from such major aid donors as 
the world bank 
advocating strict neutrality burma pulled out of the 
nonaligned movement in 1979 and since has taken other steps to 
minimize outside influence it risked offending its biggest donor 
by closing down the rangoon offices of japanese companies in 1986 
burma has been in the backwaters for 26 years and ne win is 
benefiting from this said swedish burma expert bertil lintner 
he said neither the soviet union the united states nor giant 
neighbors china and india have had real leverage with burmese 
leaders and that all major powers have avoided interference for 
fear of provoking the others 
despite critical humanitarian needs including basic medical 
supplies at hospitals overflowing with wounded victims 
international emergency aid has to date been minimal 
this is very much an affair of the burmese people but i 
hope the international community would be bit stronger about its 
protests a key opposition leader aung san suu kyi said in an 
interview published in hong kongs south china morning post 
in the past key donors including the world bank and asian 
development bank have provided as much as 500 milion a year in 
assistance to prop up the faltering economy 
west germay last year promised 36 million while japan offered 
2441 million in 1986 172 million last year and only 275 
million to date in 1988 the world bank by mandate cannot halt 
assistance for political reasons but can refrain from starting new 
projects neither it nor the asian development bank has issued a 
statement on the current situtation in burma

in 90 minutes george bush and michael dukakis 
gave the american people a clearcut choice on issues likely to 
land on the desk of the next occupant of the oval office from 
housing the homeless to dealing with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
their debate sunday night brought out in sharp relief their 
differences on the strategic defense initiative on taxes on 
universal health insurance the death penalty abortion and other 
issues 
between the jibes and jabs both bush and dukakis managed to 
spell out many of the stands they have built their campaigns around 
they fudged on some big questions like how they would deal with 
the federal deficit or fulfill campaign promises without adding to 
the red ink 
when confronted with what one reporter called the nations no 1 
domestic problem drug abuse bush suggested the answer is to 
instill values in these young people while dukakis implied all 
would be well if the white house just hadnt dealt with a 
drugrunning panamanian dictator 
here is a look at how other key issues played out in the debate 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dukakis accused bush of wanting to spend billions and 
trillions on star wars he said he knew of no reputable scientist 
who believes this kind of an astrodome over ourselves could 
work but dukakis said he would continue basic star wars research 
at its 1983 level of 1 billion a year about a quarter of the 
current budget 
bush demanded to know why he would spend a dime on something 
that you consider a fantasy and a fraud bush vowed i will 
fully research it go forward as fast as we can weve sent up the 
levels of funding and when it is deployable i will deploy it 
thats my position on sdi and its never waivered a bit 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bush said his flexible freeze would help bring the deficit 
down he also called for lineitem veto authority and a balanced 
budget amendment to the constitution 
dukakis suggested hed find savings in agriculture subsidies 
scrap certain weapons find ways to bring interest rates down and 
bring in billions and billions by cracking down on tax cheats 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dukakis charged bushs promise to lower the tax on capital gains 
from 28 to 15 percent would cost 40 billion and provide a tax 
break of 30000 more than the average teacher makes for 
people earning 200000 a year 
bush said that when the capital gains tax was cut in the past 
it produced more revenue and investment not less 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dukakis defended his plan to seek legislation requiring most 
businesses to offer workers health insurance that would reach 22 
million of the 37 million americans who now have no health 
insurance i think its time that when you get a job in this 
country it came with health insurance the democrat said 
but bush said that would cost businesses 35 billion one 
thing i will not do is sock every business in the country and 
thus throw some people out of work he said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
asked about the nations up to 3 million homeless bush said he 
would fully fund the mckinney act and seek to galvanize voluntary 
efforts 
dukakis charged the reagan administration created the problem by 
cutting back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable 
housing for families of low and moderate income and when you do 
that you have homeless families 
bush countered that interest rates were 21 percent the last 
time your party controlled the white house 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dukakis said i dont favor abortion i dont think its a 
good thing i dont think most people do the question is who 
makes the decision and i think it has to be the woman in the 
exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs that makes 
that decision 
bush who favors outlawing all abortions except to save the 
mothers life or in cases of rape or incest ducked a question on 
whether he favors jailing women and doctors who defied such a law 
i havent sorted out the penalties he said 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
bush said he supports head start the womens infant and 
children nutrition program and expansion of medicaid to help 
alleviate urban poverty as well as cracking down on crime 
dukakis charged the reaganbush administration has cut and 
slashed and butchered education and nutrition programs for poor 
children and aid for college he accused the administration of 
resisting welfare reforms 
bush said federal spending on education actually has risen in 
the reagan years 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dukakis defended his lack of experience in the foreign arena 
saying that didnt hamper other governors who became president such 
as woodrow wilson and franklin d roosevelt and he charged that 
bushs long resume didnt stop him from endorsing the sale of 
arms to the ayatollah and being involved with panamas manuel 
antonio noriega 
bush offered a deal to dukakis i will take all the blame 
for those two incidents if you give me half the credit for all of 
the good things that have happened in world peace since ronald 
reagan and i took over from the carter administration 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
dukakis denied he favors unilateral disarmament but 
acknowledged he would cut certain weapon system we dont need and 
cant afford bush criticized his rivals opposition to the 
mobile mx and midgetman missiles saying the soviets are tough 
negotiators and im not going to give away a couple of aces in 
that very tough card game 
dukakis said i thought the administration was opposed to the 
midgetman he said the administration has suggested at the geneva 
arms talks that we ban mobile missile systems entirely

about the health of ailing emperor hirohito 
the dollar closed at 13473 yen up 026 yen from its close on 
thursday the last day of trading it opened at 13480 yen and

dealers said the dollars strength followed a reaffirmation 
among monetary authorities from seven major industrialized 
countries meeting in west berlin over the weekend that they would 
continue to coordinate economic policies targeting stable exchange 
rates and containment of inflation 
but they said the market needed fresh incentives to determine 
the direction of the currency they the g7 did not say whether 
the dollar should or shouldnt be traded higher or lower 
complained one dealer at a major commercial bank who spoke 
anonymously 
seiichi kita of daiwa securities said steel issues turned out to 
be a driving force to gear up the index in late morning trading 
as investors began to buy prospective shares ahead of a new 
financial year beginning tuesday 
the nikkei index lost 15963 points or 058 percent in early 
trading following a 3819point loss during saturdays halfday 
session after morning papers reported the emperor was continuing 
to receive blood transfusions but palace officials later denied 
the reports and said hirohito was in stable condition 
kita said however investors were still concerned about the 
87yearold monarch

winstonsalem nc ap demonstrators who wanted to deliver a 
message to the candidates were sealed off on the soccer field but 
that didnt stop wake forest university students from expressing 
themselves some undecideds hung a banner throw em both back 
lets go fishing again 
it could have been homecoming weekend with the big debate 
taking the place of the big game 
there were banners partisan crowds a huge press contingent and 
a festive yet tense atmosphere sunday as george bush and michael 
dukakis matched wits for 90 minutes in the chapel with millions of 
americans looking on through television 
placards dotted the windows of buildings ringing the grassy 
quadrangle at the center of the treelined campus banners hung 
from windowsills with catchy slogans i hate pork rinds vote for 
dukakis and deacons dont dig the duke 
wake forests athletic teams use the nickname demon deacons 
other banners had less partisan messages dont hide in a bush 
or run for the mike come see for yourself who you like 
demonstrators representing a variety of causes hoped for a 
moment in the spotlight but the university soccer field where they 
were shuttled off to was hundreds of yards away from the debate 
site 
wed like to be closer but thats something we cant do 
anything about said marian franklin of the winstonsalem chapter 
of the national organization for women who held a sign touting the 
equal rights amendment 
as the debate time neared a throng of starstruck students 
packed sidewalks near wait chapel watching for the arrival of 
vips network anchors appeared to excite the crowd more than anyone 
if the flashbulb pops and gasps of recognition were any indication 
only two public entrances to the chapel were provided creating 
huge traffic jams as people struggled through security checks 
inside the crowd chatter grew and tension built in anticipation 
of candidates grand entrance 
kitty dukakis wife of the massachusetts governor entered the 
auditorium while democratic national chairman paul kirk and his gop 
counterpart frank fahrenkopf were welcoming the crowd mrs 
dukakis wearing a dark blue dress took her seat in the front row 
after kirk and fahrenkopf stopped talking bushs wife barbara 
entered through another door she wore a blackandwhite print 
dress and a pearl necklace 
bush partisans gave her a standing ovation dukakis supporters 
remained seated and did not clap 
the vice president and the massachusetts governor walked onstage 
simultaneously from opposite sides meeting at the center and 
cordially shaking hands but they wasted no time attacking each 
other 
moderator jim lehrer had urged the feisty crowd not to applaud 
cheer or otherwise disrupt the debate a plea that was ignored as 
the spectators vented their pleasure or disdain 
bushs claim that he was not attacking dukakiss patriotism on 
the pledge of allegiance issue drew scornful laughter from the 
democratic side of the aisle when dukakis said he had been tough 
on criminals it was the bush sides turn to guffaw 
the applause and signs of displeasure became more frequent as 
the debate went on despite a second admonition from lehrer and 
the candidates exchanges got more heated the temperatures inside 
the chapel seemed to rise bush and dukakis frequently sipped water 
and bush mopped his brow with a handkerchief as his rival delivered 
a closing statement 
the combatants again shook hands and smiled after the debates 
conclusion members of the candidates families hurried forward 
bush leaned forward to kiss his wife while dukakis and his wife 
embraced 
they lingered onstage for several moments bush even autographed 
a couple of debate programs then both rushed away to postdebate 
rallies

none of the families of the seven astronauts who 
died in the challenger disaster 32 months ago plan to attend 
discoverys launch thursday and some may not even watch it on 
television a spokeswoman says 
i would hate to see anything happen to it discovery bruce 
jarvis father of challenger astronaut gregory jarvis said in a 
recent interview 
june scobee whose husband dick commanded the illfated 
spacecraft said she too would not go to cape canaveral fla 
for the launch 
some of the families have not even decided whether they will 
watch on tv said lisa turner a spokeswoman for the challenger 
center which was set up in memory of the crew 
mrs scobee said that like any other american citizen she 
is eager for a successful discovery mission to get nasas manned 
spaceflight program back on track 
nasa needs to focus on the launch facility on the crew and 
their families she said in a telephone interview for me to be 
there would just remind everyone of that tragedy and it would be 
difficult for me too 
mrs scobee has not been back to cape canaveral since jan 28 
1986 when the challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch 
mrs scobee said the challenger tragedy changed forever the way 
the natonal aeronautics and space administration goes about its 
business 
i really think theyre launching a new era theres a new 
awareness of how vulnerable we are mrs scobee said 
since the accident the challenger families have avoided 
discussions about their personal grief and have focused their 
efforts on establishing a memorial to their lost loved ones she 
said 
those efforts were rewarded last month with the opening of the 
first challenger center for space science education in houston a 
place where children can learn about space 
the center at houstons museum of natural sciences gives 
students an opportunity to make a simulated spaceflight complete 
with a mission control center and scientific experiments 
it was paid for with a 150000 grant and will serve as a 
prototype for other small facilities associated with schools and 
museums mrs scobee and the other challenger relatives conceived 
the center as a memorial to the crew and their educational mission 
besides scobee and jarvis the challenger astronauts were pilot 
michael smith ellison onizuka judith resnik ronald mcnair and 
christa mcauliffe a concord nh high school teacher who was to 
have conducted the first classroom experiments from space 
the challenger crews families have made many appearances to 
help raise money for the center and for other memorial events 
honoring the astronauts 
three of the widows jane smith lorna onizuka and cheryl 
mcnair still live in the houston area 
mrs scobee lived in the same area until april when she moved 
close to washington dc 
marcia jarvis still lives in hermosa beach calif ms resnik 
was not married but her brother dr charles resnik of baltimore 
has been active in the challenger center efforts 
steven mcauliffe continues to practice law in concord where he 
can be seen around town with his two children mcauliffe avoids 
publicity concerning his wife and his law firm would not comment 
on his plans for the discovery launch

political partisans heaped on the hyperbole in the aftermath of 
the presidential candidates debate but independent observers said 
neither nominee delivered the zinger that could change the face of 
their race 
who won who knows this is a media event this is 
entertainment said jerry calvert political science chairman at 
montana state university both of the men scored well with the 
people who are already supporting them 
politicians promptly backed calvert up republicans declared 
george bush the clear victor of sundays 90minute confrontation at 
wake forest university while democrats unabashedly designated 
michael dukakis the champion 
i believe dukakis not only won the debate but the election 
tonight said sen alan cranston dcalif 
bush really laid him out said sen orrin g hatch 
republican of utah 
professional analysts were more reluctant to pick a winner and 
even some elected officials were equivocal neither guy won 
said republican gov james thompson of illinois and neither guy 
lost 
there was no knockout here said political commentator david 
gergen former communications director for president reagan i 
thought bush picked up points on policy issues i thought dukakis 
was smoother on presentation and reached out effectively to the 
middle class 
on balance gergen said bush appeared to succeed in further 
delineating his ideological differences with dukakis while the 
democrat scored with economically struggling voters i dont 
think this will swing it he said i do think this will make it 
a more competitive race 
many republicans put greater emphasis on the ideological issue 
saying bush succeeded in portraying dukakis as too liberal for most 
voters 
george bush had a mission and he can say mission 
accomplished said sen bob dole rkan who lost the gop 
nomination to bush he documented again and again that mike 
dukakis is a ted kennedy massachusetts liberal and that means 
someone whos out of step with mainstream america 
democrats however took the position that their nominee had 
widened his appeal dukakis won decisively in terms of picking up 
political support he came across as assured confident and clear 
on the facts said rep richard gephardt of missouri who lost 
his partys nomination to dukakis 
bush gephardt said seemed befuddled and confused 
but culpepper clark a university of alabama professor who 
studies speeches scored five topics for bush four for dukakis and 
three a tie if you believe that dukakis had to score some kind 
of knockout or create some kind of major error on the part of the 
vice president it did not occur he said 
some viewers considered style rather than issues psychologist 
joyce brothers rated the candidates on everything from using their 
hands for emphasis advantage dukakis to appearing relaxed a 
score for bush 
dukakis did much better when the camera caught him 
accidentally he is the master of the ironic smile she said 
bush was caught making notes like a professor thats a minus 
but bush is the better master of the pause 
lillian glass a speech consultant who is author of talk to 
win said dukakis came across a lot weaker than bush 
bush looks presidential but he needs to hold his head up 
straighter she said he made impressive recovery when he made 
an error it made a big difference for him to drop his voice the 
wimp factor is finally gone 
there were complaints from some quarters about the coaching 
undergone by both participants both candidates were pretty well 
programmed said sen j bennett johnston jr dla we saw a 
little window into the candidates tonight but not enough 
both gave somewhat canned responses agreed a republican 
louisianan rep jim mccrery 
as a result not all observers were thrilled by the 
performances sen claiborne pell dri called the debate 
pretty mundane and to democrat willie brown speaker of the 
california assembly it was rather boring 
others drew more dramatic evaluations 
sen robert byrd of west virginia the democratic leader in the 
senate tonight we saw a leader emerge and it was michael 
dukakis 
republican sen phil gramm of texas i believe george bush 
did what he had to do to win the election he came across as being 
more of a leader and more of a real person 
sen alfonse damato rny dukakis had to do well and i 
think this will clearly be the opportunity michael dukakis lost 
the vice president has fended him off 
gov mario cuomo of new york governor dukakis clearly 
advanced his campaign dramatically he appeared knowledgeable 
decisive cool presidential he won 
pat robertson the television evangelist who ran against bush 
for the republican nomination for president on the important 
issues of taxation strong defense and law and order george bush 
was a clear winner 
ira glasser president of the american civil liberties union 
of which dukakis is a member bushs criticism of the aclu during 
the debate was a descent into mudslinging of a kind we have not 
seen in my lifetime

heres how bush vs dukakis played in peoria 
george bush scored big for his position on drugs his vice 
presidential experience and desire to return to fundamental 
values 
michael dukakis won points for his criticism of us dealings 
with drugrunning panamanian dictators international 
terrorists and advocacy of programs for americas homeless 
one hundred voters selected at random took part in an 
instantaneous electronic survey of their reactions as they watched 
dukakis and bush debate on television sunday night 
its clear from the audience here that neither candidate hit a 
home run with their remarks said bill adams a professor at 
george washington university who coordinated the opinion survey 
experiment for a washington dc research firm 
the group was assembled at a peoria hotel and hooked to 
computers through an electronic monitoring system that allowed 
minutebyminute monitoring of their opinions 
adams said the peoria area was chosen for the audience survey 
because illinois is a pivotal state in the election 
before the debate the group included 33 people leaning toward 
bush 41 leaning toward dukakis and 26 undecided 
after the debate 36 said they were leaning toward bush 45 were 
leaning toward dukakis and 19 were undecided 
the debate reaffirmed mary hermans impressions of bush 
hes more personable and i think he has a better sense of 
values said ms herman 69 of east peoria i dont care for 
mr dukakis ideas hes too liberal 
to me quite honestly he seems to be more for the average 
person said patty impinto 43 of peoria referring to dukakis 
she said the debate changed her preference from bush to dukakis 
both candidates made gains said christopher wheeler who 
developed the electronic system used to gauge the audience 
response each man pulled a segment of the undecided voters into 
their corners nobody lost any ground 
women generally responded more strongly to dukakis 
it demonstrated vividly the gender gap adams said the 
men in our audience were resonating to bush more dramatically the 
women were responding much more positively to dukakis it was 
highly significant statistically 
i was also struck by the phenomenal lack of response to the 
dan quayle issue adams said i interpreted that to mean a lot 
of them are withholding judgment until the vice presidential 
debate

portauprince haiti ap taking a tough new stand haitis 
catholic bishops have advocated disarming the ruthless private army 
of the duvalier regime and banning the dictatorships collaborators 
from civil service 
we insist on this justice to break the hellish circle of hate 
and vengeance the 10member bishops council said sunday in its 
first reaction to the weekold soldiers rebellion 
in an unsually strong statement broadcast by radio soleil church 
radio the bishops addressed a solemn appeal to all haitians to 
take seriously this moment which led according to the principles 
of the gospel and the social teachings of the church can lead to a 
veritable liberation 
the bishops said the people wanted a change in the system when 
through massive demonstrations they forced jeanclaude duvalier to 
flee to france in february 1986 ending his familys 29year 
dictatorship 
lt gen henri namphy then became de facto ruler of haiti until 
sept 17 when he was ousted by enlisted men of the presidential 
guard and replaced by lt gen prosper avril a longtime duvalier 
collaborator 
much of the recent violence in haiti targeting civilian 
opponents of namphys authoritarian rule was carried out by thugs 
who at one time belonged to the tonton macoutes the dreaded 
private militia of the duvalier regime 
the rebels have ousted military commanders who tolerated the 
violence and there have been reprisal killings of people associated 
with the macoutes 
in their statement the bishops called for a policy of 
elimination of macoutism and a plan for the salvage of the nation 
this policy entails the general disarming of macoutes and the 
exclusion from the civil service of all those who in one way or 
another actively contributed to the consolidation and perpetuation 
of the dictatorial system during the last 30 years the bishops 
said 
it was not immediately clear whether the bishops were including 
avril in their refernce to duvalier collaborators avril was a 
financial adviser and close friend of duvalier and also served 
under the dictators father francois papa doc duvalier 
the bishops called for the creation of an impartial judiciary 
and urged unspecified international organizations to increase 
assistance to this impoverished caribbean nation 
the united states france and canada cut off aid after thugs 
attacked and killed at least 34 voters in thwarting november 1987 
balloting that would have been haitis first free elections in 30 
years 
the church has always exerted a strong influence over the 
haitian populace which is 90 percent roman catholic and was a 
crucial supporter of the demonstrations that led to the end of 
duvalier rule 
laennec hurbon a sociologist and author of books on haitian 
culture called the bishops statement a break with the past 
policies of the church 
hurbon who is affiliated with the national science research 
center in paris said the bishops recognized that national 
reconciliation is not possible unlces macoutism is eradicated 
some 3000 roman catholics meanwhile spilled out of the 
auditorium of the st gerard church on sunday for a service to 
mourn victims of a sept 11 massacre at the nearby st jean bosco 
church and to celebrate the military uprising 
the rev antonio sele referred in a sermon to the rankandfile 
troops who led the coup as our soldiers and denounced the 
slaughter that left 13 people dead and more than 70 wounded at st 
jean boscos 
after the mass about 1500 people including 150 survivors of 
the massacre marched more than seven miles to a suburban church 
school where they were greeted by the rev jeanbertrand aristide 
pastor of st jean boscos 
it was aristides first public appearance since escaping the 
massacre 
god is with us we dont lose courage the cleaning up has 
just begun he said in a barely audible voice as the throng 
erupted in cheers two women shouted hes alive hes alive 
aristide a frequent target of assassination by the macoutes 
was an outspoken critic of the namphy government

more than 100 million africans or one in four do 
not get enough food to fuel an active working life and the 
situation is getting worse a new world bank report says 
in the 1980s both the proportion and the total number of 
africans with deficient diets have climbed and will continue to 
rise unless special action is taken the study says 
edward v k jaycox the banks vice president for africa 
released the report sunday he told a news conference that 
production of food grains on the continent has been declining for 
two decades 
the study says 1037 million africans are among the food 
insecure those who do not get the minimum of 2200 calories a 
day that people need to be able to work 
it lists communist ethiopia buffeted by wars and drought as 
having the largest number 147 million or nearly half its 
population ethiopia is followed by nigeria with 137 million and 
zaire with 12 million both countries have close ties to the united 
states 
chad somalia zambia and mozambique have higher percentages of 
food insecure but their population is smaller egypt is the best 
off among the 36 countries listed with only 4 percent of its 
population about 17 million in the category 
in some places food may be scarce but more often people just do 
not have the money to buy it said jaycox 
ethiopia is the poorest country on the world banks list with 
average income estimated at 120 a year less than 35 cents a day 
the report calls for action so that within five years half to 
twothirds of the countries south of the sahara will have carried 
out programs to cover a majority of the regions most needy 
but jaycox said it would be futile to propose anything so 
specific as abolishing hunger by the year x 
he said billions of dollars have been spent on aid for africa 
but the programs have not worked well he said many solutions do 
not need new aid money 
one of those is for african governments to pay higher prices to 
african farmers he said he said the bank had completed 
negotiations with ethiopia that will give farmers more incentives 
and reduce state confiscation of crops which he said started 
before the present government took power 
but food security does not mean that every african country 
should grow all its own food he said 
if a farmer in the ivory coast makes 8 a day growing cotton 
which nobody can eat theres no point in his growing maize at 2 a 
day he said 
jaycox said some african governments pay their own farmers too 
little which discourages them from producing the governments then 
buy food from abroad and subsidize its sale in the towns 
he said these policies are worse than the policies of wealthier 
countries in america and europe where governments sell their 
surplus food cheap to benefit their own farmers at the expense of 
the taxpayer 
jaycox said the african policies encourage people to shift to 
rice and wheat which are uneconomical to grow in africa away from 
the sorghum and maize that their farmers traditionally have raised

the political skeletons were out of the closet 
long before halloween here in the congressional race between 
republican rep pat swindall and democratic nominee ben jones 
the congressman with hidden tape recorders running discussed 
financing his milliondollar home with laundered drug money 
and jones who appeared on the television series the dukes of 
hazzard admits to wild drunken behavior and a conviction for 
assaulting his wife 
swindall asked for forgiveness jones for understanding neither 
has much for the other 
he beat his wife swindall 47 said at one point 
elaborating at a debate that it was your second of four wives 
being called dishonest by you is like being called ugly by a 
possum said jones 46 of swindalls charge that he changed his 
story about his criminal record 
ill have to say its the most bitter personal attacks ive 
seen in georgia politics in 35 or 40 years said the secretary of 
the georgia senate hamilton mcwhorter 
atlanta pollster claibourne darden called it a contest between 
two dirty candidates 
jones blundered by failing to let swindall simply be haunted by 
the house issue darden said instead jones reacted angrily when 
swindall grabbed headlines the night jones won the democratic 
primary by demanding to see jones arrest record jones suggested 
both take a drug test 
there have been no drug tests but the ensuing argument gave 
swindall a chance to swear he had never used drugs and forced jones 
to admit he smoked marijuana in the 1970s 
mcwhorter said he thinks jones still holds the edge although 
swindall should benefit from being on the ballot with vice 
president george bush in the republicanleaning district made up 
mostly of east atlanta suburbs 
swindall and jones first squared off in 1986 with swindall 
winning election to his second twoyear term but jones 47 percent 
showing was a surprise for a candidate who began the race with less 
name recognition than cooter the character he played on television 
jones said at the outset that he was an alcoholic who was 
frequently in trouble until he kicked the bottle in 1977 
in the current race he said the trouble included an incident in 
which he shoved his wife in a bar jones said he was convicted of a 
misdemeanor assault charge but originally forgot the outcome 
he made swindalls house an issue in the first race suggesting 
swindall was getting a sweetheart deal from a politically 
conservative contractor 
but the price of the house grew to 12 million and swindall 
last year turned to charles lechasney for help in financing it 
when lechasney was indicted for money laundering swindall 
acknowledged he once accepted a 150000 check from lechasney he 
said he returned it uncashed because he became suspicious 
the matter became the campaigns commanding issue when 
recordings of swindalls conversations with lechasney and a shady 
financier who turned out to be an undercover internal revenue 
service agent were leaked in june 
i can only draw the conclusion that certainly there are drugs 
involved and i can understand if you want to walk away the agent 
told swindall in a taperecorded meeting sept 13 1987 
id say this first and foremost it becomes charles 
problem swindall answered what i have to say is i borrowed 
money from lechasneys company he added 
and frankly i dont think its incumbent upon me to go out and 
find out where xyz corp gets their money he said in the 
recording 
swindall said he had made an error in judgment and asked for 
forgiveness 
jones said the tapes proved swindalls dishonesty but he now 
says he wants to quit talking about personal issues saying he 
overreacted by suggesting the drug tests and now wants to focus 
on national issues 
i have sinned pat and so have you he said at a debate

in an officially sanctioned event unthinkable 
before the era of glasnost hundreds of people gathered at a moscow 
cemetery to remember more than 100000 people mostly jews 
massacred by the nazis at a ravine near kiev 
and some directed their anger not at the germans but at the 
soviet government for its repression of jews 
babi yar was a prelude to the spiritual genocide of the jewish 
people of our country yuri sokol a world war ii veteran told 
at least 500 people huddled sunday on a road outside the gates of 
moscows vostryakov cemetery 
a few years ago police would have broken up such a 
demonstration as an antisoviet outpouring of nationalism but in a 
product of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
or openness only a few policemen were on hand and did not 
interfere 
standing alongside jewish activists atop a makeshift speakers 
platform on a truck were a prominent jewish soviet army general 
the head of the soviet antizionist committee and members of 
parliament 
the rally which lasted 1 hours was called by the official 
antizionist committee which includes soviet jews who oppose 
israel and by the unofficial society for friendship and relations 
with israel 
it was the second year that authorities gave permission for a 
babi yar memorial rally in moscow but the first in which a state 
organization was a cosponsor 
in a sign of official sanction the moscow communist party and 
government newspaper evening moscow ran an announcement of the 
ceremony on thursday and the staterun tass news agency carried a 
dispatch after the demonstration 
you must agree that some democracy exists because 10 years ago 
you couldnt have met here william perry of new york told the 
crowd in a mixture of yiddish and english perry is president of 
the international union of industrial service transport and 
health employees 
the rally marked the 47th anniversary of the killing of more 
than 100000 people mainly jews at babi yar in the ukrainian 
capital speakers said that shortly after occupying kiev the nazis 
rounded up and shot to death 35000 jews on sept 2930 1941 
pictures of women and children concentration camp prisoners 
people hanging from gallows and piles of corpses were nailed onto 
the side of the truck a moscow rabbi led the crowd assembled on 
the first night of the jewish holiday sukkot in a hebrew prayer of 
mourning for the massacre victims 
several speakers reminded the crowd that the suffering and 
repression of jews did not end when the nazis were defeated 
after the war members of the jewish antifascist committee 
were shot there was the doctors plot and they wanted to deport 
the jews to siberia said valery sherbaum secretary of the 
friendship society 
dictator josef stalin accused some of the countrys top 
physicians most jewish of being spies and trying to kill kremlin 
leaders he had them arrested in 1953 
sherbaum said repression of jews did not stop after stalin died 
that year 
even under gorbachev jewish cemeteries have been destroyed in 
several soviet cities jews are not permitted to organize classes 
to study hebrew or yiddish and unsanctioned jewish organizations 
are denied meeting places he told the crowd 
yuli kosharovsky a jew refused permission to emigrate said the 
government still publishes antisemitic and antizionist literature 
other speakers charged that the pamyat organization an 
unofficial russian political group that has sprung up under 
glasnost was reviving the antisemitism symbolized by the babi yar 
massacre through its racist ultranationalist views 
for years authorities arrested and harrassed jews agitating for 
preservation of babi yar as a symbol of the holocaust 
after poet yevgeny yevtushenko wrote a poem about the massacre 
deploring the lack of a memorial authorities relented and a 
monument was erected in 1976 on the swampy ravine 
but many jews have remained unsatisfied because the monuments 
plaque does not mention that most victims were jews 
among those at sundays rally sharing that view was a member of 
the first israeli diplomatic delegation to visit the soviet union 
since the kremlin severed ties with the jewish state in 1967 
its very painful that there is not one word mentioning that 
jews were killed there said gershon gorev who attended the 
ceremony with his wife hasia and yaakov kedmi another member of 
the sixmember israeli team that arrived in moscow july 28

as yellowstone national 
park superintendent bob barbee has endured a political emotional 
and ecological firestorm 
because of the summer blaze that ravaged much of the oldest 
national park his oncebright future seems as cloudy as the pall 
of smoke over yellowstone where fires continue to smolder 
a 30year national park service veteran who rose through the 
ranks the 52yearold barbee holds a highly visible prestigious 
post 
in june he played host to park service director william penn 
mott a score of dignitaries and nearly 400 of his peers and 
others as he presided over the first general superintendents 
conference in 12 years 
during the fourday meeting gossip buzzed that if the next 
president looked toward the career ranks for his new director 
barbee had a strong chance of heading the national park service 
but that preceded three months of flames and political flak 
insults and cartoon caricatures 
i have the best job in the world barbee said in an 
interview using his standard line since he became overseer of the 
22 millionacre park in 1983 
but in a season of drought and flames around the west it is 
almost a throwaway line a touch of bravado wedged between a 
defense of park policies and a recitation of climatological 
conditions that surprised his seasoned scientists 
at the center of the controversy is the park services policy of 
allowing naturally caused fires to burn as long as they dont 
threaten life property or historic sites 
by anybodys reckoning these fires are a catastrophe because 
of the impact and the anguish they caused barbee said 
one million acres burned threats to communities power lines 
burning down millions and millions of dollars being spent no 
one would promote something like that for heavens sake 
but the catch22 is that if we say look it theres 
another side to this that statement is confused with a 
celebration of the fire and its impact 
yellowstone park is still all here there will be a changed 
face to yellowstone but not a devastated face not a destroyed 
face thats just folly thats myth what there will be is just a 
different face this event provides a great educational opportunity 
to see what a powerful force like fire can do and how the land 
responds to it 
some of the physical strain of 20hour days no time off in 
months and unceasing criticism of park service policies shows in 
barbees set jaw and grim tone 
he has become the focus for much of the anger and frustration 
stemming from the fires barbee says such a reaction has left him 
dismayed but not necessarily surprised i dont like it 
interior secretary donald p hodel has called the firefighting 
policy a disaster 
wyoming sens alan simpson and malcolm wallop both republicans 
have attacked the letitburn policy with wallop suggesting 
mott should be fired 
sen john melcher dmont has called for congressional 
oversight hearings about the origins of the fires and the way they 
were fought 
no one knows better than barbee that hes become the butt of 
jokes in the communities that ring the park and depend on it for 
economic survival 
did you hear that bob barbee had a fire in his kitchen goes 
one such joke no how did he put it out 
he started a backfire in the living room 
what are the fires in yellowstone park called begins 
another why theyre called barbeeques 
and then there are the newspaper cartoons depicting drooping 
bears with singed fur and a caption identifying them as barbee 
dolls 
barbee has stressed repeatedly that he did not make daytoday 
firefighting decisions but added i clearly because i am 
sitting here am responsible and i accept that 
and he expects the controversy the blazes have ignited to 
continue for months to come 
yellowstone draws fire because it is the mother park it has 
a symbolic aura about it barbee said we who care for it have 
a sort of sacred charge people here take it seriously and they 
dont like being maligned for not taking it seriously

the militarydominated political party 
that has ruled burma for a quarter century gave itself a new name 
today in what one diplomat described as an attempt to change the 
partys tarnished image 
staterun radio rangoon announced that the burma socialist 
program party is now the national unity party 
it did not give an explanation for the change but a western 
diplomat in bangkok thailand described the move as an attempt 
to change their image and make a break with the past 
in recent months millions of people have engaged in street 
demonstrations strikes and other acts of opposition to the party 
and the 26 years of political repression and economic decline 
associated with it 
military commander gen saw maung led a coup sept 19 that 
diplomats say apparently has reestablished effective control over 
the country by the ruling clique soldiers have driven protesters 
from rangoons streets and broken up protest centers in dozens of 
towns nationwide 
the government says security forces have killed more than 250 
civilians mostly people described as looters since the coup 
diplomats believe more have died including many unarmed 
demonstrators who marched the day after the coup 
in the latest incidents reported by radio rangoon security 
forces shot and killed 12 people sunday in looting incidents as 
lawlessness persisted a week after saw maung took over 
the radio said five people also were wounded and 16 arrested in 
five incidents in the capital in which looters were trying to steal 
rice gasoline and corrugated iron sheets 
in the bloodiest incident security forces shot and killed seven 
people who were among a crowd of 100 looters sunday night at the 
stateowned five star shipping line near rangoon river the radio 
said 
it said two others were killed when security forces dispersed a 
mob of 1000 people looting a government rice warehouse and three 
died while looting another government warehouse 
the main antigovernment activity currently is a general strike 
that began aug 8 and has paralyzed the government administration 
authorities have ordered civil servants back to work by oct 3 
saw maung has pledged to hold multiparty elections once peace is 
restored to the impoverished nation but he has set no timetable 
the last such elections were in held in 1960 two years before 
leader ne win seized power in a military coup 
three key opposition leaders aung gyi tin oo and aung san suu 
kyi on saturday formed an umbrella group to unite the millions of 
students buddhist monks government workers and others struggling 
for democracy 
although the opposition has not formally responded to saw 
maungs plan for elections it earlier opposed a snap election 
because said the ruling autocracy could not be trusted to hold fair 
and free balloting 
opposition leaders also said such elections would have been 
unfair because the longstanding ban on political parties other than 
the ruling party was only recently lifted they have urged 
formation of a nonpartisan interim government to conduct the 
elections 
the government earlier this month ordered civil servants and all 
military personnel to resign from the ruling party and repealed the 
law authorizing financial support to the party from the government 
but the party which had 25 million members before the unrest 
and susequent resignations remains a potent force with offices 
throughout this nation of 38 million people 
the party has been the personal fiefdom of 77yearold ne win 
who led burma into isolation during his 26 years of rule and made 
the resourcerich nation one of the worlds poorest countries 
current leader saw maung is believed to have strong links to ne 
win 
government news releases first issued last week said burmas 
official name was changed back to what it was before 1962 from 
the socialist republic of the union of burma to the union of 
burma

millions of red and grey locusts darkened 
the sky over khartoum for 90 minutes this morning some landing on 
cultivated fields along the nile river to devour the crops 
huge swarms of the insects began arriving about 730 am and 
left at about 9 am the sun was completely covered for almost half 
an hour of the 1hour period 
officials had no immediate estimate of the size of the swarm 
which came in from the east and moved in a westerly direction or 
the amount of damage it left behind 
torrential rains caused disastrous flooding in khartoum last 
month and experts said the greening of normally barren desert 
areas created perfect breeding grounds for locusts 
earlier this month agriculture minister elfatih eltigani said 
sudans locust threat had entered a critical stage 
he said that the government had destroyed half of about 60 
potential swarms in the country but that sudan lacked sufficient 
insecticides or equipment to spray all agriclutural lands facing an 
invasion 
swarms are known to be mainly in eastern and western sudan 
khartoum lies at the center of the country 
officials fear that locusts could leave behind more devastation 
than last months flooding which caused damage estimated at 330 
million or more

vandals defaced a museum honoring the rev 
junipero serra with such spraypainted slogans as genocidal 
maniac for his alleged mistreatment of indians as others 
protested at the 18th century monks grave 
the graffiti marred ceremonies sunday at presidio park honoring 
serra the spanish priest revered as the founder of californias 
missions on the day he was beatified by pope john paul ii in the 
vatican city 
vandals spraypainted slogans including murderous lying scum 
and serra was a baby killer on the doors and sides of the serra 
museum and other walls and memorials in the 40acre park 
in the northern california town of carmel about 20 indians held 
a protest prayer vigil at serras grave sunday 
we want to show were against this because of the brutality 
that occurred when father serra had control of the missions said 
anthony miranda chairman of the costanoan band of local indians 
carrying an abalone shell filled with burning sage a variety of 
feathers and shell ornaments and a dried gourd that was beat to 
mark cadence the indians entered the carmel mission between 
morning masses 
one of about 200 parishioners inside yelled take your pagan 
rites out of the church 
when the prayer was finished the protesters left the church and 
resumed a demonstration at the gates of the mission several were 
weeping 
museum officials here said the graffiti which colored a bronze 
likeness of serra a bronze statue of an indian and a 50foot stone 
cross will cost hundreds of dollars to repair 
its a shame that they chose this method of protesting that 
sort of thing doesnt help anything and certainly is not going to 
change the churchs position said dan pitre spokesman for the 
san diego roman catholic diocese 
about 30 protestors who attended a rally later denied 
involvement in the vandalism police said they had no suspects 
the graffiti including obscenities attacked serra for greed 
racism and antisemitism as well as cruelty to indians 
serras critics say he whipped and enslaved the indians he 
worked to convert stole their lands and exposed them to european 
diseases to which they had no resistance 
he shouldnt be honored said protestor kip king an indian 
descendant serra had the arrogance of any missionary effort of 
coming to a people that already had a religion and trying to impose 
their european religion 
in ceremonies moving serra toward sainthood john paul called 
the franciscan monk a shining example of christian virtue and 
the missionary spirit 
built in 1769 the san diego mission was the first in a series 
of missions along the california coast whose construction was 
organized by serra 
it saddens and angers me eleanor neely education 
coordinator for the serra museum said of the graffiti theres 
no proof whatsoever that serra mistreated anyone 
a group of nine historians that investigated the issue for the 
catholic church last year reported that indians were abused in the 
missions but found no evidence to support charges against serra 
himself

an 18th century monk who founded 
californias first missions and a priest executed by a firing squad 
in mexico in 1927 moved a step closer to sainthood when they were 
beatified by pope john paul ii 
the monk beatified sunday the rev junipero serra founded nine 
missions in what is now california but critics say he whipped and 
enslaved the very native americans he worked to convert 
in california demonstrations were held against the franciscans 
beatification including a protest by his graveside in carmel and 
the defacing of a museum in san diego 
serra was one of six people the pope beatified during a 
threehour mass in st peters square in the roman catholic 
church beatification is one step from possible sainthood 
some indians claim serra stole their lands destroyed their 
culture forced their ancestors to work in fields or on 
construction projects and exposed them to european diseases against 
which they had no resistance 
but john paul speaking in english said serra was a shining 
example of christian virtue and the missionary spirit 
his great goal was to bring the gospel to the native peoples 
of america so that they too might be consecrated in the truth 
the pope said it was a field of missionary endeavor that 
required patience perseverance and humility as well as vision and 
courage 
in carmel on sunday about 20 indians entered the chapel at the 
carmel mission between masses and standing in a semicircle around 
serras grave prayed aloud for the souls of the 2364 indians 
buried at the mission 
we want to show were against this because of the brutality 
that occurred when father serra had control of the missions said 
anthony miranda chairman of the costanoan band of local indians 
in san diego early sunday vandals defaced a museum honoring 
serra marring ceremonies marking his day of beatification they 
spraypainted such slogans as genocidal maniac and serra was 
a baby killer on the doors and sides of the museum 
among those taking part in the mass in vatican city celebrated 
before more than 20000 people were 5yearold aids sufferer 
brendan orourke of san francisco and sister ann clare johnson a 
30yearold nun from mission san jose calif who has incurable 
cancer 
both have prayed that serras intercession will save their lives 
also beatified sunday was the rev miguel agustin pro a jesuit 
priest shot by a mexican firing squad 61 years ago the only martyr 
among the six beatified he was killed at the height of the 
conflict between the catholic church in mexico and the 
anticlerical revolutionary government 
although he denied it pro was accused of taking part in a plot 
to kill mexican strongman gen alvaro obregon he was executed 
without trial on orders of president plutarco elias calles 
the pope praised pro for organizing secret masses and communion 
services in private homes during the years of persecution in 
mexico 
pros beatification was seen as a condemnation of the regime 
that executed him one that still governs mexico 
the mexican government made no official comment about the 
beatification a a leftist magazine proceso called it a slap in 
the face of the revolution 
photographs show pro kneeling in prayer then standing before a 
government firing squad clutching a rosary and a crucifix and 
finally collapsing just before he died he shouted christ the 
king lives 
some believe pro was killed because of his clandestine work 
among labor unions and other working class groups in mexico 
critics contend he was more of a political activist than a priest 
in mexico on sunday church bells rang in chihuahua to 
commemorate the beatification and mexicans packed mexico citys 
basilica of guadalupe the countrys most sacred shrine for a 
special mass 
others beatified sunday were cardinal giuseppe benedetto dusmet 
a 19th century italian archbishop who devoted his life to the poor 
the rev francesco faa di bruno a 19th century italian priest who 
founded an order of nuns the rev frederic janssoone bollengier a 
french missionary in the holy land and canada who died in 1916 and

life to god

the pay of some highly specialized surgeons will 
drop sharply while internists and others on medicines front lines 
will earn more under a proposed new physician fee structure drawn 
up for congress its author says 
the results of the 2year project called the resourcebased 
relative value scale are to be published this week in the new 
england journal of medicine and released by the federal health care 
financing administration 
its chief architect economist william c hsiao of the harvard 
school of public health said the plan is intended to correct 
distorted and inequitable fees that pay doctors too little for 
examining patients and too much for specific procedures and 
operations 
hsiaos project attempts to determine the amount of work 
involved in everything doctors do from checkups to brain surgery 
so they can be paid what their services are worth 
if accepted by congress which requested it the plan will be 
used to set the pay for doctors who treat elderly medicare 
patients it may also be adopted by staterun medicaid programs and 
private insurance companies 
in general some of the primarycare specialties will rise 
and a few of the highly specialized surgical specialties may see a 
sharp drop in fees for their services hsiao said in an 
interview but the impact will not be uniform some specialties 
will not be affected very much 
hsiao said that if adopted by government health agencies and 
insurance companies his 2000page plan could have a profound 
effect on the nations health care system among other things it 
could 
improve care by encouraging doctors to spend more time with 
their patients 
lower medical costs by discouraging expensive tests procedures 
and operations 
increase the number of doctors willing to specialize in family 
practice and other kinds of primary care 
lower the income of some surgical specialists while raising the 
pay of physicians who provide general care to patients 
this is going to be a very important piece of work that we 
hope will rationalize the manner in which physicians are paid 
said dr james todd senior deputy executive vice president of the 
american medical association 
not all doctors would make the same pay under the system 
because some have more demanding jobs than others 
an orthopedic surgeon under this fee system will be 
justifiably making more than pediatricians hsiao said they 
will receive different levels of compensation according to their 
level of work 
hsiao declined to reveal specifics of his report until it is 
formally published but outlined some of the major conclusions and 
described the effect he believes it could have on medicine 
traditionally doctors have been paid relatively little for 
seeing patients in their offices monitoring them and writing 
prescriptions however they are often highly paid for diagnostic 
tests and such procedures as installing pacemakers 
hsiaos plan would narrow this gap he believes that without a 
strong financial incentive doctors will do fewer questionable 
procedures 
there could be a change in the quality of patient care he 
said physicians will be willing to spend more time with patients 
and treat them as a whole person

the international monetary fund said today that 
more forceful action is needed to help heavily indebted third world 
countries 
many countries continue to face severe financing and 
adjustment difficulties which have become more severe due to the 
recent increase in interest rates said a statement issued by 
finance ministers from 22 countries at the annual meeting of the 
international monetary fund and the world bank 
more forceful actions are needed in the context of the current 
cooperative casebycase approach to resolve these difficulties 
the statement said 
poor countries have been pressing for more help from 
industrialized nations and bankers to ease their staggering debt 
burdens 
the panel urged debtor countries to continue making changes in 
their economic policies to spur growth it also urged banks to 
provide adequate refinancing and not only rescheduling of 
amortization payments 
banks have been reluctant to lend the debtor nations more money 
and have instead agreed in some cases to stretch out payment terms 
the panel came out strongly against shifting to governments the 
risks taken by commercial bankers in third world lending 
because of doubt about the ability of debtors to repay banks 
holding the debt have to take sharp losses when they resell 
the world bank deals with the longterm development of third 
world countries the fund was set up to handle shorterterm 
problems 
on sunday brazils finance minister mailson ferreira da nobrega 
told other finance chiefs that industrialized nations should launch 
a direct attack on the economic troubles of developing 
countries 
it is clear that growth in industrial countries does not 
trickle down to developing countries economies da nobrega said 
the debt of developing countries is one of the key topics at the 
meeting which began last week and will run through thursday some 
12000 financial officials bankers and journalists planned to 
attend 
officials of the seven key industrialized nations have already 
given final approval to a plan to help the worlds poorest 
countries mostly in subsaharan africa 
but latin americas large debtors would like more help with 
their problems brazil owes 121 billion in foreign loans making 
it the developing worlds no 1 debtor mexico follows with about 
104 billion in debts 
the united states and other major industrialized nations have 
said the money problems of the middleincome debtors such as 
brazil and mexico should be handled on a casebycase basis a 
strategy fashioned in recent years 
on sunday nigel lawson britains chancellor of the exchequer 
and west german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg both urged the 
united states to trim its federal budget deficit 
the absorption by the united states government for a further 
long period of a sizable share of the worlds net savings would 
not be in anyones interest said lawson 
the us delegation to the conference did not release remarks of 
treasury secretary nicholas brady in the private meetings 
but nonus sources who spoke on condition of anonymity quoted 
brady as assuring his financial counterparts that the united states 
placed the highest priority on efforts to reduce redink 
spending

emperor hirohito continued to bleed internally and 
his temperature rose today a week after his condition suddenly 
deteriorated but officials said the 87yearold monarchs health 
was stable 
kenji maeda spokesman for the imperial household agency said 
doctors gave the worlds longestreigning monarch 43 pints of 
blood in a transfusion to compensate for that lost from his 
intestinal hemorrhage 
he said the frail emperor was fully conscious today and had 
discharged slight traces of blood through his bowels during the 
night 
since he vomited blood one week ago the emperor has through 
transfusions received a total of 596 pints 
maeda said hirohito briefly watched television today and 
conversed with crown prince akihito and crown princess michiko when 
they visited on thursday all the emperors imperial duties were 
transferred to akihito 54 who is heir to the throne 
i have not seen him today myself but my impression is that 
his condition is consistent and stable maeda said but we have 
to remain alert 
but he said hirohitos temperature had risen to 100 at 
midafternoon up from 981 in the morning and well above his normal 
reading of about 959 
the nationally circulated asahi shimbun today quoted medical 
experts as saying cancer was the likely cause of hirohitos 
continuous discharge of blood 
palace officials have refused to confirm or deny press reports 
that the emperor has cancer and instead have urged the japanese 
media to refrain from speculation cancer is rarely acknowledged 
publicly in japan 
government spokesman keizo obuchi said hirohito was well enough 
sunday to watch on television as sumo wrestling champion 
chiyonofuji won his 25th title in the autumn grand sumo tournament 
a perfect victory isnt it the emperor was quoted as 
saying 
chiyonofuji along with other top wrestlers called on the 
palace today to sign his name to a register wishing the emperor 
speedy recovery 
the tokyo stock exchanges main index gyrated today with varied 
reports of the emperors condition after early reports the emperor 
had received transfusions during the night the index fell almost 
160 points it regained its losses after the palace said hirohito 
was in stable condition but ended the day down 56 points or 022 
percent 
seiichi kita of daiwa securities said the market fluctuations 
indicated investors were still concerned about hirohitos health 
a crowd of almost 800 people began gathering at the imperial 
palace after dawn under threatening skies as the nations vigil 
entered a second week 
as of sunday more than 300000 had signed registries at the 
palace and at 11 other locations around the country wishing for the 
emperors recovery according to palace reports 
the emperor who ascended the throne in december 1926 has been 
under 24hour medical supervision since vomiting blood a week ago 
his condition took a turn for the worse saturday when his fever 
soared to 1026 by sunday night however shoichi fujimori grand 
steward of the imperial household agency told reporters the crisis 
was over 
last year on sept 22 hirohito underwent a bypass operation 
after an inflamed pancreas put pressure on the duodenum 
on saturday the asahi shimbun reported the emperor was 
suffering from pancreatic cancer and the respected kyodo news 
agency quoting a biopsy report said pathologists found evidence 
of cancer in tissue taken from the region between the pancreas and 
duodenum in last years operation 
under the constitution the emperor has no real power but signs 
documents and government appointments already approved by the 
government

workers bart wanted twothirds of the money to go toward

to be used for three years to finance medical insurance for retired 
employees the union agreed that members also would pay 15 per 
month toward the retirees benefit 
were happy theyre happy said bart spokesman mike healy

and back each weekday had spent much of the weekend trying to find 
alternative ways to get to their jobs at least one was set to go

a minister who shot and killed a church 
handyman before beheading him and leaving the mans body in a 
burning church has been sentenced to death by electrocution 
the rev john david terry 44 was convicted thursday of 
firstdegree murder and arson in the slaying of james c matheny 
32 whose headless body was found in terrys burning church on june 
16 1987 
the jury returned the death sentence against terry on sunday 
after 13 hours of debate and a brief church service 
defense attorney lionel barrett said i normally dont put 
that much stock in appeals but i think weve got some genuine 
legal issues in this case 
terrys strongest ground for appeal is challenging whether the 
murder was committed in conjunction with a larceny which the jury 
listed as one of two aggravating circumstances justifing the 
imposition of the death penalty barrett said 
terry admitted misappropriating more than 30000 in church 
funds but barrett argued that it did not amount to larceny under 
the terms of tennessees felony murder statute 
terry also admitted he killed matheny dressed the body in his 
own clothes and set the emmanuel church of christ oneness 
pentecostal on fire in a scheme to fake his own death prosecutors 
said terry wanted to start a new life and leave insurance proceeds 
to his family 
terry cut off mathenys head part of an arm and patches of skin 
marked with tattoos and threw the body parts into lake barkley near 
dover tenn 
prosecutors said terry bought an additional 150000 in life 
insurance in april 1987 and gathered false identification papers in 
the name of a boy who drowned in 1951 
circuit judge walter kurtz set terrys execution for april 3

an inmate who was identified in court papers 
as a police informant was killed in his cell while other prisoners 
went on a rampage authorities said 
the 3hour uprising sunday began when inmates refused to let 
two unarmed guards confiscate their homemade liquor twenty minutes 
after authorities quelled the rampage they discovered the body of 
richard holmes 
the lawyer for holmes who faced a charge of aiding and abetting 
the murder of a drug informant said authorities are to blame for 
holmes death because they made public his cooperation and one 
prosecutor involved in the case said his identity was made public 
by mistake 
im absolutely convinced he was killed because the 
prosecutors contrary to the promise they made went public with 
the fact that richard holmes helped them said attorney rolf 
kehne 
idaho state penitentiary officials declined to speculate whether 
the rampage was staged as a diversion to cover up the killing 
guards left the area of the uprising about 315 pm for 
reinforcements inmates broke glass and burned mattresses and 
papers 
when swat teams from several law enforcement agencies reentered 
the building about 645 pm inmates left voluntarily and no force 
was needed officials said 
tim mcneese executive assistant to state department of 
corrections director al murphy refused to release details on how 
holmes died but he said holmes killer got into the cell through a 
hole knocked in the cinderblock wall 
in august holmes 35 led police to the partially buried 
remains of a drug informant denise williams 28 of nampa but his

cooperated with authorities kehne said 
just friday kehne said holmes told him that he considered

clippings detailing how he led police to ms williams body in 
hopes of making a deal had been shoved into his cell the lawyer 
said

discover that the sensitive information had been placed in the 
court file accessible to reporters and other members of the public 
he blamed the action on owyhee county prosecutor lawrence 
wasden both prosecutors were involved in the case 
i was upset when i found out about it harris added but 
thats one of the problems you get when you have different agencies 
involved

a poll conducted in five key states shows vice 
president george bush with an edge over democrat michael dukakis 
but the lead was within the margin of error and the results could 
be regarded as a dead heat 
the poll of 1521 voters published in weekend editions of the 
chicago tribune put the vice president ahead in florida and texas 
with dukakis leading in illinois and new york california the 
state with the most electoral votes was a virtual tie 
no presidential candidate in the 20th century has won without 
taking three of the five states polled and many voters in those 
states were looking to sundays nationally televised debate to help 
them choose between the candidates 
overall bush led dukakis 46 percent to 43 percent in the 
midseptember survey by pollster peter hart of washington but the 
poll had a 35 percent margin of error 
bush led in florida by a comfortable 54 to 37 percent margin 
and in texas by 50 to 40 percent in california the vice president 
was ahead 46 to 43 percent making the state a virtual tie because 
of the polls 6 percent sampling error for the individual state 
statistics 
dukakis led in new york 48 to 40 percent and in illinois 47 
to 40 percent 
nearly threequarters of those surveyed said they were likely to 
watch the debate and 42 percent said they would definitely 
tune in the newspaper reported 
onefourth said the 90minute debate would be very important 
in helping them decide which candidate to vote for and 18 percent 
said the joint appearance would be fairly important

scientists have taken a major step toward curing 
a disease that causes blindness saving the eyesight of 
experimental rats by transplanting retinal cells in their eyes 
according to a published report 
two groups of scientists have succeeded in performing the 
transplants and preventing a type of blindness in the rats the new 
york times reported sunday the researchers said the procedure 
would have to be repeated on monkeys and other animals before it 
could be tried on human beings the times reported 
according to the retinitis pigmentosa foundation in baltimore 
degenerative diseases of the retina occur in 400000 living 
americans macular degeneration one of these diseases is the 
leading cause of blindness in this country in people over the age 
of 60 
sometimes doctors can slow the loss of vision in patients with 
these diseases but they have no way of preventing it 
before the scientists findings could be applied to humans the 
problem of tissue rejection will have to be overcome the newspaper 
reported the rats came from a special inbred strain whose immune 
system accepts other tissue without attacking it 
the experiments involved rats with an inherited defect in 
pigmented epithelial cells which darken the pupil and allow light 
to pass through these cells cover and nourish photoreceptor cells 
which convert light to electrical signals that are interpreted by 
the brain the pigmented epithelial cells also ingest excess 
photoreceptor cells 
in the diseased rats the pigmented epithelial cells die which 
eventually leads to the death of the photoreceptor cells 
to cure the disease before the photoreceptor cells died the 
scientists cut slits in the back of the animals eyes and injected 
tiny drops of fluid containing healthy cells into the area where 
the pigmented cells normally grow 
the research was conducted by two groups working independently 
james e turner and linxi li of wake forest university in 
winstonsalem nc and peter gouras and his colleagues at 
columbiapresbyterian medical center in new york 
turner has operated on more than 200 rats the times said in 
every case the transplanted cells survived and prevented the 
photoreceptor cells from dying 
gouras said he and his colleagues hoped to try the retinal cell 
transplants on monkeys next turner said he would try them on 
rabbits and monkeys and would try implanting greater numbers of 
cells in rats

nasa set the countdown clock ticking 
today for returning americans to space on thursday aboard the 
shuttle discovery 
the launch countdown is now in progress test director terry 
willingham announced promptly at 8 am edt as he signaled the 
traditional call to stations that call assembled more than 100 
controllers at their consoles 
early work included loading discoverys computer software 
servicing the main engines and other propulsion systems and 
removing work platforms from around the base of the spaceplane 
were looking forward to doing the shot and doing it right and 
launching on time frank merlino another test director told a 
news conference shortly after the countdown began for the first 
us manned space mission since challenger exploded over the 
atlantic killing the crew of seven 32 months ago 
thursdays forecast was for scattered and broken clouds a wind 
of 1015 knots from the southeast temperatures of 85 degrees and 
widely scattered showers 
given the constraints nasa has things look very very good 
said senior master sgt mike beeman an air force weather spokesman 
the countdown had been set to begin at midnight but was 
postponed when launch pad workers fell behind in preparations 
sunday 
nasa said that did not affect the goal of launching discovery at 
959 am thursday 
were still on the timeline for launch on the 29th and thats 
the plan launch director bob sieck said sunday 
the national aeronautics and space administration had built 39 
unprogrammed hours of contingency time into the countdown as 
insurance for lastminute problems 
sieck said it was decided sunday to allot eight hours of that 
time to complete the work of replacing panels and removing work 
platforms from around discoverys engine compartment 
we dont want those people to have to do that under the gun 
with the clock counting he said so we said take all the 
time it takes and well delay the call to stations to accommodate 
that 
closing out the aft end of the spaceplane had been held up when 
low voltage readings were detected in an electrical circuit that 
ignites the explosive charges used to separate the shuttle from its 
fuel tank in flight engineers eventually determined the fault was 
in a ground circuit which does not affect the flight 
discoverys five astronauts planned to fly here late this 
afternoon from their training base at the johnson space center in 
houston 
once here they will receive daily briefings on launch 
preparations review their flight plan and undergo medical 
examinations 
commander rick hauck a navy captain and pilot dick covey an 
air force colonel planned to practice landings at a runway here in 
a jet outfitted to handle like the shuttle 
the three mission specialists in the crew are george nelson 
mike lounge and dave hilmers a marine lieutenant colonel 
all have flown on earlier shuttle flights 
during four days in orbit they are to release a 100 million 
communications satellite from discoverys cargo bay conduct 11 
science and technology experiments and check out modifications made 
to the shuttle since the challenger accident 
because there are so many changes were treating it like a 
test flight of a new vehicle hauck said in a recent interview 
the rogers commission that investigated the challenger accident 
said the direct cause was a leak at a joint between two segments of 
one of challengers two solidfuel booster rockets 
engineers redesigned the booster and made improvements to the 
orbiter the main engines and the external fuel tank in all 56 
major changes and more than 400 lesser ones were made the program 
to redesign all three shuttles has cost about 24 billion to date 
the commission report said cold weather 36 degrees at launch 
contributed to the challenger accident by stiffening orings in the 
joint preventing them from sealing gaps properly 
some engineers had argued with lowerlevel managers against 
launching in the cold but their concerns never were relayed to top 
managers who made the launch decision 
nasa has changed procedures to make certain concerns of any 
agency or contractor employee are relayed to top management 
and a mission management team made up of 21 key nasa and 
contractor managers and engineers has been established to monitor 
the final two days of the countdown 
the team is headed by astronaut bob crippen who has made four 
shuttle flights with the help of team members he will assemble 
all information in the final minutes of the count and will have 
sole authority to signal the decision to launch

winstonsalem nc ap michael dukakis and george bush had 
one of their more feisty debate exchanges when discussing running 
mates with bush declaring he had full confidence in dan quayle 
while dukakis scoffed at the prospect of president quayle 
the debate over running mates came late in the 90minute clash 
sunday night between democrat dukakis and republican bush bush had 
not mentioned quayle at all before he was asked to explain his 
choice dukakis twice before briefly had mentioned bentsen when 
discussing his views on foreign policy 
bush in defending quayle praised the indiana senators defense 
credentials and noted his leadership role in winning passage of a 
job training measure i believe he will be outstanding said 
bush who then said the media had subjected quayle to 
outrageous and brutal scrutiny of his academic and military 
records 
he has my full confidence bush said 
but the vice president also created an opening for dukakis when 
in an effort to paint the massachusetts governor as naive on 
foreign policy and defense said there were three people on the 
republican ticket who were wellversed in those areas bush 
obviously meant to say three people among the four candidates but 
dukakis seized the opportunity 
did i sense a desire that maybe lloyd bentsen ought to be your 
running mate whe you said that the three people on your ticket 
dukakis said to laughter from the audience at wake forest 
university 
quayle interviewed outside his suburban mclean va home 
sunday night said he was undisturbed by the questions that dukakis 
raised about his qualifications 
when the american people come to know dan quayle they will 
feel more comfortable quayle said theyve been told a lot of 
inaccuracies a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless 
quayle said bush had telephoned him after the debate and was 
very upbeat for a very good reason he said bush was clearly 
victorious because he was able to depict michael dukakis as out 
of the mainstream 
dukakis who includes the quayle selection in his attack on 
bushs judgment used most of his rebuttal time after bush defended 
quayle on that track and to praise the experience and maturity of 
bentsen 
but he also delivered a biting criticism of quayle a second 
term senator who was little known nationally before bush tapped him 
for the vice presidential spot in august 
i doubt very much that dan quayle was the best qualified 
person for that job dukakis said and as a matter of fact i 
think for most people the notion of president quayle is a very 
very troubling notion 
bush did not criticize bentsen but did attack dukakis for making 
fun in his campaign appearances of quayles given name j 
danforth quayle 
do you know who j danforth was bush asked of his rival 
he was a man that gave his life in world war ii so ridiculing a 
persons name is a little beneath this process

premier turgut ozal said today he would 
remain in office and continue to serve with vigor and 
enthusiasm even though turkish voters rejected a referendum 
sponsored by his government 
opposition parties turned sundays proposed constitutional 
amendment which called for moving municipal elections from march 
1989 to november of this year into a vote of confidence on ozal 
and his freemarket economic policies the premier said earlier he 
would resign depending upon the outcome 
with 86 percent of the votes counted the state television 
reported early today that 65 percent of the 265 million eligible 
voters opposed the amendment and 35 percent were in favor of it 
but ozal said in a televised statement today that he would 
remain premier until the next general elections in 1992 
he said he was satisfied with the result of the vote since the 
number of yes votes were about the same as the 36 percent his 
motherland party won in general elections 10 months ago the result 
gave the party a 290seat majority in the 450member parliament 
but opposition leaders erdal inonu of the social democrat 
populist party and former premier suleyman demirel who heads the 
centrist true path party said todays result was a defeat for the 
61yearold premier 
he has not received the support he was seeking said inonu 
this government has been rejected by the people tomorrow 
there will be new political conditions in turkey said demirel 
during the prereferendum campaign the opposition emphasized 
the countrys 78 percent inflation the rising foreign debt which 
doubled in the past five years to 42 billion and low wages 
ozal responded that under his tenure turkey has enjoyed high 
economic growth which has averaged an annual 75 percent in the 
past two years and is projected at 72 percent for 1988 he said 
the economic boom has brought turkey new housing roads dams and 
communications systems 
the premier called on voters to avoid returning to the turbulent 
decade that ended in a 1980 military takeover which was 
accompanied by an economic crisis and political violence 
ozal who launched turkeys economic recovery program as deputy 
premier under the military government became premier when his 
party won in the 1983 elections that restored civilian rule

the government today for the 
first time publicly identified whites only neighborhoods that 
could be opened legally to people of all races 
tens of thousands of nonwhites already live illegally in 
districts of johannesburg cape town durban and port elizabeth 
which constitutional planning minister chris heunis cited as areas 
likely to be integrated 
in a session of parliament today heunis reintroduced three 
bills under the group areas act which segregates all neighborhoods 
by race and sharply increases the penalties for violations of the 
act 
the bills viewed as an attempt to appease conservative white 
voters before the nationwide municipal elections on oct 26 were 
first introduced last month but were withdrawn after 
antiapartheid groups and black leaders condemned it 
the new legislation however also proposes to legalize a 
limited number of multiracial neighborhoods that have developed in 
recent years as whites moved out of urban neighborhoods the 
measure has been denounced by the conservative party which is 
expected to makes gains in the elections at the expense of 
president pw bothas national party 
the group areas bills created a political furor in parliament 
last month when the white chamber approved them but the 
mixedrace and asian chambers boycotted parliamentary discussions 
in protest the government withdrew the bills but decided to 
reintroduce them after the two chambers agreed to end their boycott 
when the colored mixedrace and indian communities tell me 
that the group areas act has hurt them i say in all earnestness 
i hear you heunis said today at a joint session of the three 
chambers 
but heunis said the government remained committed to protecting 
group rights a phrase for policies which allow whitesonly 
schools hospitals and residential areas 
the mixedrace and asian chambers are expected to reject all 
three bills including the proposal to allow multiracial 
neighborhoods leaders of the chambers say the group areas act 
should be repealed rather than amended 
however the national party which controls parliaments white 
chamber has the power to enact the legislation even if the 
proposed bills are rejected by the other two chambers 
under south africas policy of apartheid the nations 26 
million blacks are not represented in parliament and has not vote 
in national affairs which are controlled by the 5 million whites 
among the areas mentioned by heunis as candidates for 
multiracial status were johannesburgs hillbrow and joubert park 
neighborhoods and cape towns district six from which tens of 
thousands of mixedrace people were evicted in 1966 after it was 
designated for whites only 
a surplus of housing in white urban neighborhoods is accompanied 
by a severe shortage of housing in nonwhite areas and thousands 
of asians blacks and people of mixed race have been moving into 
districts vacated by whites 
the group areas act has been the most hotly contested issue in 
the municipal elections 
the antiapartheid progressive federal party is the only major 
white party that opposes the group areas act the most hotly 
contested issue in the municipal elections last week a national 
party member of johannesburgs city council said he would lobby for 
multiracial areas in wards that vote for the progressive federal 
party but would seek to keep other white neighborhoods segregated

the brothers to life in prison after they were convicted of 
masterminding the killing of judge rocco chinnici who had been

a candidate for the states highest criminal court 
is publicizing his campaign with a contest that asks entrants about 
the race and promises a free trip to sea world to the winner 
judge tom rickhoff of san antonio who says his bid for the 
texas court of criminal appeals has received little attention 
placed a fullpage ad in the september issue of texas monthly 
magazine with pictures of himself a penguin and a dolphin under 
the headline a real political contest 
the ad includes a contest entry form that invites texans to 
answer four trueorfalse questions about rickhoffs race against 
incumbent judge charles miller 
the winner to be selected in a drawing oct 18 gets a 
fourday threenight vacation in san antonio complete with passes 
to see sea world of texas tickets to a san antonio spurs 
basketball game and a tour of the alamo 
and there are prizes for the runnersup 10 pounds of texmex 
frozen shrimp three pairs of jogging shoes and an assortment of 
candy 
its innovative said rickhoff who is currently a 
republican state district judge in san antonio 
this is embarrassing miller said 
randy erben assistant secretary of state said his office has 
studied rickhoffs contest and concluded it does not violate state 
election law 
miller said the idea shows poor judgment 
it creates a circus atmosphere in a race that ought to be 
dealt with seriously he said 
rickhoff said he decided to conduct the contest after finding 
that people not only didnt recognize his name but had never heard 
of the court of criminal appeals the court of last resort for 
criminal cases in texas 
he said he wants to dramatize the fact that there is a citizen 
wall of apathy around the race he added that hes received only 
about two dozen entries 
the contest entry blank also has a box that can be checked for 
donations but the ad specifies that entrants need not contribute 
to enter the contest

a un relief agency protested today to the 
israeli army about the sharp rise in the number of palestinian 
casualties since july in the occupied territories 
meanwhile a 19yearold arab protester died after he was shot 
in the mouth and at least 34 others were wounded today as violence 
swept the west bank and gaza strip hospital officials said 
the clashes came as palestinians staged a general strike in the 
territories to protest the jailing of thousands of arab activists 
by israel militants hoisted white sheets sprayed with red 
swastikas and scrawled antiisraeli grafitti on walls 
the un relief and works agency which aids palestinian 
refugees said the number of palestinians shot by army gunfire in 
the gaza strip jumped from 19 in july to 130 so far this month the 
count did not include todays casualty toll figures for the west 
bank still are being compiled 
there is a clear trend of a growing use of live ammunition 
that cannot be justified said a senior un official our 
concern is very real this is not just a kneejerk reaction to a 
bad day 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity linked the 
increase in casualties to the introduction in august of plastic 
bullets that penetrate the body like live ammunition but generally 
are not fatal unless fired from less than 20 yards 
the introduction of plastic bullets lowered the threshold for 
opening fire while troops are allowed to use live ammunition only 
in lifethreatening situations they can now fire plastic bullets 
to disperse stonethrowers 
in violent clashes in the arab village of jabal mukaber 
straddling jerusalems city limits riot police fatally shot 
19yearold jamal mattar in the mouth during a stonethrowing 
protest officials at jerusalems mukassed hospital said 
an israeli photographer said about 20 stonethrowers faced off 
with riot police with the two groups standing on opposing hills 
police fired tear gas and then live ammunition the photographer 
said 
mattars death brought to 272 the number of palestinians killed 
since the uprising began dec 8 six israelis have died during the 
same period 
widespread clashes spread throughout the west bank and gaza 
strip and 34 palestinians were wounded including 26 in the gaza 
strip and eight in the west bank hospital officials said 
among the wounded was an 11yearold deaf boy from gaza city who 
was in serious condition with a bullet wound in the chest the 
officials said 
the army confirmed three wounded and said it was checking the 
other casualty reports 
on sunday jewish settlers tried to mark a festival celebrating 
the jews biblical wanderings by settling a patch of land in the 
west bank but israeli troops thwarted the attempt 
the settlers were marking the beginning of the weeklong 
celebration of sukkot the feast of tabernacles which marks the 
israelites wanderings in the desert after their exodus from egypt 
jews traditionally build makeshift huts on sukkot to symbolize life 
in the wilderness 
moshe neuman a spokesman for the settlers group said 12 
families and 20 single people pitched tents northwest of the arab 
town of jericho about 15 miles northeast of jerusalem 
they went to the site in the morning and set up there with 
tents equipment and everything needed neuman said he said the 
families had been promised more than a year ago that a settlement 
would be approved 
the families were evacuated peacefully neuman said 
defense minister yitzhak rabin had warned that attempts by 
settlers to set up new colonies during sukkot would be resisted by 
the government 
about 120 jewish settlements have been established in the west 
bank and gaza strip since israel occupied the lands in the 1967 
middle east war the independent jerusalem center for public 
affairs says about 72000 people live in the settlements 
surrounded by 15 million palestinians

federal authorities suspect a suburban chicago 
electronics company of illegally exporting computer equipment that 
may have been resold to the soviet union 
no charges have been filed against libra electronics inc of 
willowbrook but documents filed in us district court indicate 
the company and owner rajeev sharma of westmont are under 
investigation by the us attorneys office and the us department 
of commerce 
investigators said warehouses in australia where computer parts 
were shipped by libra for assembly into personal computers turned 
out to be vacant 
us attorney anton valukas declined to comment on the 
investigation sharma had an unpublished number at his westmont 
home and could not be reached for comment 
vijay gulani manager of libra confirmed that a search of 
company offices had been conducted but said this is ridiculous 
somebody made up a story 
the commerce department bars exports of sophisticated computer 
equipment to sovietbloc nations because they could be used for 
military purposes for the past seven years the us customs 
service has conducted an ongoing investigation called operation 
exodus to stem illegal shipments of electronic equipment to the 
eastern bloc 
federal agents armed with search warrants raided libras 
offices and sharmas home in late july a court affidavit said 
the investigation began after federal authorities were contacted 
by officials of motorola inc an electronics company 
according to records obtained by the government sharma 
purchased 338000 worth of computer products including highspeed 
memory devices from motorola suppliers in the chicagoarea 
alan smith motorolas distribution marketing manager for 
australia reported to motorola officials in the united states that 
he suspected libra might be violating us export regulations by 
sending parts to india and possibly to the soviet union the 
affidavit said 
smith said libras sydney representative sud kakwani told him 
in may that libra was reexporting the components to another 
manufacturing site in india according to the affidavit 
smith said kakwani told him that his libra colleagues in india 
were building a strong relationship with the russian market 
the affidavit said 
after becoming suspicious smith and another motorola official 
decided to visit three addresses listed by libra as the sites of 
their assembly facilities in australia but found two partly empty 
warehouses and an apartment according to court documents

president reagan decided today to end us 
convoys of americanflagged ships in the persian gulf but will keep 
us forces in the gulf to aid threatened ships the white house 
announced 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that 
reagan acted after reviewing the current ceasefire which 
has been in effect since aug 20 and consulting with allies and 
friends in the region 
there have been no attacks on gulf shipping since the ceasefire 
began 
fitzwater said the president made the decision in washington 
before leaving for new york where he was to discuss the change 
with heads of state from the region 
reagan after a farewell speech to the un general assembly 
had meetings set with sheik jamir ahmed sabah the ruling emir of 
kuwait and with leaders of the gulf cooperation council which is 
headed by saudi arabia 
the presidents meeting with the sheik is the first since sabah 
came to power in 1976 
the convoy operation begun 14 months ago involved a precise 
navy formation used to protect against potential iranian attacks 
kuwaiti tankers reregistered under the us flag 
the modification entails a change from a tight escort 
procedure to an accompany regime fitzwater said on air force 
one as reagan flew to new york 
in an accompany regime us forces will be positioned such 
that they can take appropriate action if americanflagged ships are 
directly threatened 
there have been no attacks on gulf shipping since the ceasefire 
went into effect 
the spokesman said that even with the change the united states 
intends to maintain in the gulf the forces required to protect 
usflagged shipping and support our national objectives these 
changes in no way alter our commitment to freedom of navigation in 
the gulf 
the spokesman said the move is the first step in the change of 
our presence we will continue to review our presence in the gulf 
and will make changes as the threat diminishes for now he said 
the navy will not reduce its presence in the gulf 
the united states has 26 ships in its joint task force middle 
east including 17 in the persian gulf as of sept 16 the navy 
had conducted 85 convoy operations since the escorts began 
when asked whether the move could lead to normalization of 
relations with iran fitzwater said weve always said were 
willing to talk to authorized iranian officials 
but he said that there have been no requests from iran for a 
meeting and that there has been no news regarding the american 
hostages held in lebanon 
the spokesman said it will take a few days before the changes in 
gulf escorting take place and there are no plans to make a formal 
announcement at that time

southern governors by and large got a bum 
rap during the civil rights struggle and their behindthescenes 
efforts to resolve social problems were largely ignored atlanta 
mayor andrew young said today 
in a keynote speech to the southern governors associations 
annual conference the former aide to civil rights leader martin 
luther king jr said news accounts of the period focused on the 
embarrassing public activities of some governors rather than on 
the work they were doing privately 
in the difficult dark days of the south when it was 
extremely unpopular politically to be for justice there were 
southern governors who took the risk and found ways to deal 
with the problems without losing their political credibility 
young said 
he attributed much of the change in the south today to the quiet 
work of those governors 
young drew a standing ovation from the governors and an audience 
of several hundred registered for the conference 
summarizing progress in the south young said that 25 years 
later were working together in a way most of us as children would 
never have believed possible 
he added however we have only just begun to achieve the 
potential of this region 
the governors are among 11 chief executives from southern states 
participating in the 54th annual meeting of the sga the meeting 
began today and runs through tuesday

said there was no knockout punch by either party 
unger who gave bush a 2524 edge on his scorecard said on 
the very narrow argumentative technical sense on the flow sheet 
i think that vice president bush was the winner but my suspicion 
is that michael dukakis will emerge as the political victor from 
the debate 
dukakis had more blanks to fill in from the standpoint of the 
voters he emerged as a credible alternative to bush unger 
said 
melissa maxcy wade director of forensics at emory university 
said that in 12 years of judging presidential debates its the 
first time ive ever heard the candidates laughed at by the 
audience bush was laughed at twice by the audience at wake forest 
university on irancontra and the abortion question and dukakis 
was laughed at on crime 
wade who scored it 2522 for dukakis said dukakis was much 
more organized bush has a tendency to ramble and be a little out 
of it but she praised bush for deflecting his potential 
bloopers with humor

forensic league in ripon wis picked dukakis 2321 he called 
bush choppy and fumbling 
william southworth director of forensics and professor of 
speech at the university of redlands rated bush a 2726 winner 
bushs position that you must negotiate with the soviets out of 
strength was never answered he said 
frank sferra director of forensics at jk mullen high school 
in denver gave dukakis a 2321 edge while ld naegelin speech

winstonsalem nc ap george bush and michael dukakis 
resumed campaign hostilities from a distance today as the early 
soundings rated sunday nights nationally televised debate as close 
as their race for the white house 
i really think it went well i really think it went great 
the vice president told reporters as he departed the debate city 
for a campaign appearance in jackson tenn with running mate dan 
quayle 
dukakis flew to cleveland and said the 90minute debate had 
provided the best moments of this whole campaign in remarks 
prepared for a rally the democrat heralded the opportunity to move 
beyond the slogans and labels the photo opportunities and the 
flagwaving and get down to the real issues 
dukakis left it to his campaign manager to claim victory our 
own polls showed us winning the debate decisively said susan 
estrich 
bush went into the debate holding a narrow lead over his rival 
in most surveys with six weeks remaining until the election 
the debate was marked by numerous biting comments as dukakis and 
bush clashed over the deficit defense issues and dealing with the 
soviet union in their 90 minutes on stage at wake forest university 
newsweek said a poll taken immediately after the debate found 
that 42 percent of the voters who watched the debate said dukakis 
did a better job while 41 percent said bush outperformed his rival 
an abc poll taken sunday night found that 44 percent rated 
dukakis the winner 36 percent gave the edge to bush and 20 percent 
said it was a tie 
those polled had been contacted by the network prior to the 
debate and at that time 48 percent supported dukakis 46 percent 
backed bush and 6 percent were undecided brennan said 
in the survey taken just following the debate 52 percent said 
they supported dukakis 45 percent supported bush and 3 percent 
were undecided given the margin or error that shift is 
statistically meaningless said network polling analyst john 
brennan 
bush campaign chairman james a baker iii told reporters that 
bush would oppose criminal prosecution of women who receive 
abortions even though the vice president said during the debate 
that he hadnt sorted out of the penalties bush opposes 
abortion in most cases 
said baker 
he would not wish to see a woman labeled as a criminal 
notwithstanding his views on the righttolife women should be 
seen as an additional victim 
the pollsters began weighing in as the two candidates returned 
to their task for the final six weeks of the campaign the two men 
will debate again in los angeles oct 13 or 14 and vice 
presidential candidates dan quayle and lloyd bentsen sqaure off in 
omaha on oct 5 
it was a good night democrat dukakis said after the 
90minute encounter sunday at wake forest university bush his 
republican rival gave the thumbsup sign and told cheering 
supporters the debate had given him a chance to spell out some of 
the differences 
dukakis running mate sen lloyd bentsen and bush campaign 
chairman baker agreed that neither candidate suffered any 
selfinflicted wounds in the debate and both probably gained 
stature 
i dont think either side won but i think mike dukakis came 
very close to winning and george bush came close to losing 
bentsen told the associated press 
baker said the vice president won the debate on style and 
substance and that dukakis failed on both counts 
we think this debate reaffirmed the contrasts between the 
positions of these two candidates that has projected george bush 
into that lead baker said 
in the first of two facetoface meetings there was very little 
warmth between the candidates other than the traditional handshakes 
at the beginning and end bush said he had hoped for a little 
friendlier an evening 
dukakis accused him of questioning his patriotism bush painted 
his opponent as a farout liberal 
in terms of issues the debate broke no new ground but it gave 
the candidates locked in a close race a chance to press their 
cases against their opponents before their largest audience ever 
in the tens of millions 
trying to capitalize on their debate performances the two 
candidates headed separate ways today with bush campaigning in the 
south while dukakis moved north 
right from the start in their first debate dukakis took an 
aggressive stand accusing the reaganbush administration of doing 
business with a drugrunning panamanian dictator 
in reply bush said there was no hard evidence that 
panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega was involved in drugs 
until we indicted him 
bush attacked dukakis for his membership in the american civil 
liberties union and for vetoing a bill that would have required 
public school teachers to lead students in reciting the pledge of 
allegiance bush said dukakis judgment was at issue adding i 
hope people dont think that im questioning his patriotism 
given a chance to respond dukakis coldly declared of course 
the vice president is questioning my patriotism and i resent 
it i resent it 
noting that he was the son of immigrants dukakis said im in 
public service because i love this country i believe in it and 
nobodys going to question my patriotism as the vice president has 
now repeatedly 
bush fired tart words at dukakis after a question about quayle 
and his qualifications to step into the presidency if necessary 
judge the man on his record not on a lot of rumors and 
innuendo and trying to fool around with his name bush said 
noting that dukakis frequently refers to his running mate by his 
full name of j danforth quayle bush said that ridiculing a 
persons name is a little beneath this process 
dukakis shot back i doubt very much that dan quayle was the 
best qualified person for that job and as a matter of fact i 
think for most people the notion of president quayle is a very 
very troubling notion tonight 
the two candidates traded a series of oneliners beginning when 
dukakis claimed bush was the joe isuzu of american politics 
referring to television commercials in which the salesman makes 
implausible claims for isuzu cars 
bush retorted that answer was about as clear as boston 
harbor referring to the pollution in dukakis hometown 
while bush depicted dukakis as a liberal democrat out of the 
mainstream the democratic nominee challenged the vice 
presidents judgment particularly on the irancontra scandal 
dukakis said that bush the chairman of a task force on 
terrorism endorsed the sale of arms to the ayatollah in exchange 
for hostages one of the most tragic one of the most mistaken 
foreign policy decisions weve ever made in this country and i 
dare say encourages others to take hostages 
in reply bush said yes we shouldnt trade arms for 
hostages but we have made vast improvements in our 
antiterrorism going on the attack bush said dukakis opposed 
the us military strike against libya a claim that dukakis 
protested was not true 
an associated press panel of six veteran debate judges gave 
dukakis a narrow edge over bush three judges thought dukakis won 
and three picked bush but the democrat got the most points 
overall dukakis got top marks for presentation and organization 
while bush bested his opponent in refutation and reasoning

two indian activists went to court today 
for their trial on charges of taking hostages at a newspaper in 
what they say was an effort to spotlight local corruption but one 
was without his regular lawyer 
defense lawyers have said they will argue that eddie hatcher and 
timothy jacobs acted out of necessity when up to 20 people were 
taken hostage at the robesonian on feb 1 
us district judge terrence boyle today denied a request for a 
continuance in the trial even though hatchers attorney william 
kunstler was not present because he is involved in another trial 
in new york hatcher had said repeatedly he would not participate 
in the trial without kunstler 
i will not be there kunstler famed for his defense of 
leftist causes said last week eddie will not have a lawyer he 
will i think stand up and tell that jury at every opportunity 
that he is there without a lawyer 
when he granted a third delay in the case aug 1 boyle warned 
hatcher that he did not intend to continue the case again and said 
another lawyer should be prepared to begin the trial if kunstler 
was not present 
but lawyer barry nakell asked the judge today to delay the trial 
until oct 18 when kunstler should be through with the other case 
hatcher has said he does not want nakell as his attorney at the 
trial though nakell has represented him in some other hearings 
the judge turned down nakells request 
the defendants are charged with hostagetaking and manufacturing 
illegal weapons 
hatcher 31 and jacobs 20 have never denied that they took 
over the offices of the robesonian in lumberton but say they did 
so to draw attention to their allegations of discrimination against 
minorities and drug trafficking by local law enforcement agencies 
they say they were driven to commit an act of desperation 
because their knowledge of the drug trafficking had put their lives 
in danger 
we have a necessity defense in this case which involves 
showing that neither timothy or eddie had any legal alternatives to 
what they did and that they were in fear of their lives on feb 
1 bob warren jacobs attorney said last week 
the 10hour siege at the newspaper ended after gov jim martin 
agreed to form a state task force to investigate their charges 
but hatcher and jacobs who say they are tuscarora indians met 
only once with the task force which issued a preliminary report 
saying it had found little evidence to back up their charges 
hatcher jacobs and their supporters said the task force did not 
do a thorough investigation and that potential witnesses would not 
testify without federal and state immunity 
the defendants lawyers have conducted their own investigation 
and say they have potential witnesses who could back up the charges 
of official wrongdoing 
hatcher disappeared aug 31 after a federal appeals court 
revoked his bond jacobs surrendered to marshals the same day 
hatcher was arrested at raleighdurham airport one week ago when he 
stepped off a plane with a kunstler associate

hurricane helenes winds a threat only to ships in 
the central atlantic ocean dropped to 95 mph today as the storm 
continued to move north into colder strengthsapping waters 
forecasters said 
its going to gradually weaken from here on in said jim 
gross a hurricane specialist at the national hurricane center 
weve estimated it to become a minimal hurricane within the next 
72 hours and weaken even further after that 
at one time last week helene had winds of 140 mph as it kept a 
westward course across warm tropical waters but it then veered 
northward 
at noon edt today the storms center was near latitude 253 
north and longitude 497 west or about 1400 miles southwest of 
the westernmost azores helene was headed north at 15 mph away from 
all land areas for the next few days according to a center 
advisory 
hurricanes are composed of strong winds revolving around warm 
cores of low pressure fueled in part by the tropical waters that 
spawn them cold water weakens the storms 
helenes northerly course should eventually cause it to die out 
unlike its predecessor gilbert which turned its deadly winds west 
and grew into a category 5 hurricane the strongest possible 
gilbert killed more than 300 people left hundreds of thousands 
homeless and caused billions of dollars damage to the caribbean 
central america mexico and the united states 
both storms came out of africa as disturbed weather systems this 
month the busiest time of the sixmonth atlantic hurricane season 
that begins june 1 
helene is the eighth named storm of the 1988 atlantic hurricane 
season and the fourth with winds exceeding 74 mph earning it 
classification as a hurricane 
two other hurricanes florence and debby caused only minor 
damage in mexico and along the us gulf coast

democrat michael dukakis said today the first 
presidential debate provided the the best moments of the whole 
campaign and his aides declared him the decisive winner over 
republican rival george bush 
the american people finally had the chance to look beyond the 
slogans and labels the photo opportunities and the flagwaving 
and get down to the real issues dukakis said in remarks prepared 
for a rally here his first stop after leaving the debate site 
winstonsalem nc 
we heard a lot of talk last night from mr bush about the 
mainstream but its clear that hes willing to leave american 
families high and dry dukakis said 
what happened last night was long overdue those 90 minutes 
were the best moments of this whole campaign he said 
susan estrich dukakis campaign manager said the dukakis 
campaigns polls showed us winning the debate decisively 
estrich at a briefing in north carolina before dukakis departed 
on a campaign swing to ohio and new jersey said dukakis succeeded 
in dominating the debate virtually from beginning to end 
speaking to the issues of concern to voters sitting around their 
kitchen tables 
as for bush she said the vice president failed to dominate 
the debate at all 
paul brountas dukakis campaign chairman said the democratic 
nominee kept george bush on defense all night long he took the 
issues he discussed the issues he was putting in the innovative 
proposals that the working americans are worried about their 
concerns and anxieties and i thought that bush was shaky all night 
long 
with the first debate behind him dukakis was heading out to 
campaign in key industrial states that are likely to determine the 
outcome of the election 
on his schedule today were stops in cleveland and jersey city 
nj 
by the end of the week the democratic nominee also will 
campaign in illinois pennsylvania new york texas and california 
on sunday night dukakis went from the debate on the campus of 
wake forest university to a rally a few miles away in the 
winstonsalem convention center where he told supporters the 
message tonight that we were able to convey was that the 
democratic party and the democratic ticket are prepared to provide 
leadership on the real challenges that face this country and the 
real concerns of americans all over this country 
this is going to be a tough competitive stretch drive he 
said of the final six weeks of the presidential campaign 
dukakis and bush will debate again in los angeles on oct 13 or 
oct 14 the exact date hinging on the baseball playoff schedule 
their running mates democrat lloyd bentsen and republican dan 
quayle will debate in omaha neb on oct 5 
the massachusetts governor delivered his strongest response to 
date when bush raised what has become known as the pledge of 
allegiance issue bush has scored heavily by attacking dukakis for 
vetoing legislation that would have required recitation of the 
pledge in massachusetts public schools 
bush raised it again during the debate and said he was not 
questioning his opponents patriotism 
of course the vice president is questioning my patriotism 
dukakis responded i dont think theres any question about that 
and i resent it i resent it 
bush delivered an impassioned defense of his choice of quayle 
for the republican ticket 
im putting my faith in a whole generation of young people who 
are in their thirties and in their forties the vice president 
said 
judge the man on his record not on a lot of rumors and 
innuendo he said chiding dukakis for referring to the indiana 
senator as j danforth quayle 
do you know who j danforth was bush said he was a man 
that gave his life in world war ii so ridiculing a persons name 
is a little beneath this process 
dukakis didnt give an inch he said that for most people the 
notion of president quayle is a very very troubling notion 
tonight 
dukakis also was asked to respond to the perception that he is 
passionless technocratic the smartest clerk in the world 
i care deeply about people he responded all people 
working people working families people all over this country who 
in some cases are living from paycheck to paycheck 
he recalled his 1978 defeat in the democratic gubernatorial 
primary when he was running for a second term 
defeat is sometimes an important lesson he said i think 
im a much better governor today i think im a much better person 
a much better listener i think ill be a much better president for 
having gone through that experience

billy carter whose escapades as president 
carters beerguzzling good ol boy brother alternately amused and 
dismayed americans struggled courageously with the cancer that 
killed him his family says 
carter died at home of pancreatic cancer the same disease that 
killed his father and an older sister on sunday morning at the age 
of 51 
a few blocks away in this southwestern georgia hamlet a flag 
flew at halfstaff across the street from the gas station where 
carter often downed beers while entertaining reporters with his 
irreverent wit 
he had a heart of gold said becky gentry who operated the 
station for six months when carter moved away he made you feel 
good just being around him you never saw a frown on his face 
carter died quietly and peacefully in his sleep with his 
family at his bedside said a statement issued by the carter 
presidential center in atlanta on behalf of the former president 
and his family 
he had struggled courageously with his illness never losing 
his sense of humor and always more concerned about those who loved 
him than about himself the family said 
plains mayor lynton earl godwin iii recalled carter today as a 
good person he was a friend and the people who were his personal 
friends will really miss him 
police chief jim smyth said he expected a large crowd for the 
funeral and called in officers from the georgia state patrol and 
nearby americus to assist his threemember department in traffic 
control 
billy carter a selfproclaimed beerdrinking good ol boy was 
forced to redefine himself when big brother jimmy rocketed into the 
white house in 1977 
within a few years billy carter put his name on a brand of beer 
that flopped got in hot water with remarks denounced as racist or 
antisemitic accepted money from libya and was forced to sell some 
properties to pay a debt to the internal revenue service 
but underneath the mask of court jester was a perceptive man an 
avid reader a fighter who refused to go down quietly under the 
pressures of alcoholism or cancer 
he was born william alton carter iii on march 29 1937 the 
youngest of four children 
he grew up in archery a child with a stutter and a poor 
student billy was 13 when the family moved the three miles to 
plains and 16 when his father died 
he ran the family peanut business until jimmy a navy officer 13 
years his senior returned home to take over billy chafing under 
his brothers reign quickly married his high school sweetheart 
sybil and joined the marines 
he later took over the peanut business turning it into a 5 
million operation as his brother got involved in politics billy 
carter also made a stab at politics running unsuccessfully for 
mayor of plains in 1976 
his quick often profane wit made him a hit on the personal 
appearance circuit 
he once said he didnt like sleeping in the white house because 
he got lost i couldnt find the bathroom and id had 20 beers 
before i went to bed 
jimmy carter stood gamely by his brother refusing to muzzle 
him joking about billy carters contributions to the beer industry 
and assuring reporters his brother was a competent capable man 
but the brothers were forced to put some distance between 
themselves in 1979 after billy carter visited libya and served as 
host for a return visit by libyan officials he also disclosed he 
had accepted 220000 from the libyans 
in 1979 a federal grand jury investigated whether loans to the 
family peanut warehouse were diverted to the presidential campaign 
allegations billy carter denied he spent seven weeks in an alcohol 
rehabilitation program that year 
in 1981 to help pay a 105000 debt to the irs he sold his 
plains home and the gas station he moved to alabama worked as a 
mobile home salesman and returned to plains in 1986 
in september 1987 doctors told him he had inoperable cancer of 
the pancreas 
carter refused to knuckle under saying hed get a voodoo doctor 
if necessary he tried a variety of experimental treatments and 
lived longer than his doctors expected 
a graveside funeral service was set for this afternoon at 
lebanon cemetery where carters mother lillian carter and his 
father james earl carter are buried 
in addition to his wife and brother carter is survived by six 
children ages 11 to 31 and sister gloria carter spann

deformed and disfigured people came from around 
mexico to a san diego hospital lured by promises of better 
function and selfesteem and returned across the border with new 
faces ears or improved hands 
and it didnt cost them a cent thanks to churches a hospital 
a san diego charity and dozens of medical workers who donated a 
20hour day to conduct backtoback operations 
only those who have seen the medical needs of the poor south of 
the border could understand said nurse pat robinson who 
participated in the reconstructive surgical marathon saturday at 
mercy hospital 
i have never seen so many children with so many deformities 
that havent been taken care of said ms robinson whos been in 
the field for 30 years 
her patients included a 6yearold girl with a club hand a 
17yearold girl with a peg of tissue instead of an ear and a 
10monthold baby with a cleft lip dividing her face up to her 
eyes other patients had club feet and one needed a hip replacement 
she recalled an operation in which doctors repaired a 
40yearold womans cleft lip under local anesthesic 
after we finished with her surgery we helped her hold a 
mirror up she started crying said ms robinson 50 the 
change was so noticeable she felt so good about how she looked 
the doctor gave her his card and she clutched it to her heart 
we all started crying she was so overcome by gratitude 
for the girl without an ear doctors took a piece of rib and 
shaped it to form the external part of the hearing organ that 
one took about 2 hours ms robinson said 
about 20 surgeons 12 anesthesiologists and more than 100 
nurses support staff and volunteers participated in the lengthy 
session said laura avallone the hospitals spokeswoman 
about 30 patients came from as far south as the mexican state of 
oaxaca south of mexico city for saturdays operations ms 
robinson said 
local churches provided housing the night before the surgeries 
which would have cost upwards of 500000 officials said drug 
companies donated all required pharmaceutical materials the 
hospital donated rooms and equipment 
all but four were returned to mexico on sunday with whatever 
medical instructions and drugs they needed ms avallone said some 
were taken to a tijuana hospital for observation but most went 
home those who remained hospitalized at mercy were in good 
condition she said 
it was the second such surgical marathon for mexican patients at 
mercy hospital organized with coad a san diegobased 
international charitable organization in february about 35 
patients underwent reconstructive operations 
coad helper in spanish was founded 15 years ago by john m 
martin of san diego a former san jose construction mogul who 
discovered the need for such medical help during a fishing trip in 
mexico 
he says he has since taken surgical teams to mexico and central 
america to operate on thousands of people 
for surgery in san diego martin travels around mexico to locate 
patients with scars or birth defects takes care of paperwork 
including visas and provides bus transportation 
you could say i have a christian commitment but that is not 
the real reason i do it because i like to do it martin told 
the tribune of san diego last week 
though weary from saturdays long hours ms robinson said she 
looked forward to the next coad event for mexican patients 
tentatively scheduled for february 1989 
i feel i have something to give and they need it so badly 
she said it changes their lives they can be more like a normal 
person and feel better about themselves

the debate between us presidential candidates 
george bush and michael dukakis was broadcast live in some west 
european countries for those sufficiently addicted to us politics 
to stay up long after midnight 
the british broadcasting corp televised the entire debate live 
as did austrian television and italys staterun rai network the 
austrians aired it in english while rai provided simultaneous 
translation into italian 
in west germany the us armed forces network broadcast it live 
on radio and television 
the debate was held too late for europes morning newspapers to 
comment but two afternoon dailies were lukewarm 
overall mr bush came out better than many people had 
expected but the debate will not have altered the growing 
impression abroad as well as among many americans that for the 
most powerful job in the world the choice is between two 
mediocrities said londons conservative evening standard 
this may be a harsh judgment but if there are impressive 
personalities behind the public faces of the two candidates then 
it is high time they escaped from the suffocating embrace of their 
marketing men and revealed the humanity behind the hype it said 
in paris the leftleaning le monde said there was no evident 
winner no revelation on the character of the candidates and 
absolutely nothing new as to their intentions 
in his broadcast italian tv correspondent antonello marescalchi 
said the result of the bushdukakis match is still uncertain 
dukakis was probably better than bush but there was no knockout 
he added the vice president and the governor said nothing 
new every issue had already been discussed during the conventions 
in atlanta and new orleans and during the electoral campaign

communist party leaders convened a meeting monday 
that was expected to call for a slowdown in marketoriented reforms 
that are fueling inflation and economic turmoil in china 
the official xinhua news agency said 162 members of the 
175member central committee and several hundred other leading 
party members gathered at the great hall of the people for the 
fiveday meeting 
the agency said general secretary zhao ziyang delivered a speech 
outlining chinas troubled economic reforms over the next two years 
zhao it said dealt with improving the economic environment 
and rectifying the economic order catchwords for a more cautious 
stance emphasizing stability rather than new initiatives in the 
countrys drive to reduce central planning and tie production to 
freemarket forces 
zhao discussed ways to promote reform in a planned way and 
under unified leadership an apparent reference to reported 
differences within the party on how to cope with current economic 
problems 
the 20 percent inflation spurred by rising consumer demand 
profiteering and government moves to end some price subsidies has 
become a major source of complaint among urban residents 
corruption is rampant industrial output is increasing at double 
the rate the economy can sustain and local governments have 
ignored orders from beijing to cut back on unauthorized spending 
fears of further price increases have led to panic buying and 
runs on banks in august with retail sales almost 40 percent higher 
than in the same month in 1987 
chinese leaders insist they will not turn their backs on reforms 
that have significantly improved the lives of millions of chinese 
over the past decade but they have admitted the reforms have hit a 
shoal of doubt and confusion 
the government has tried to calm consumers and cool off the 
economy by promising there will be no more price increases this 
year and by tightening money supplies and linking interest rates 
to the inflation rate 
vice premier yao yilin who oversees economic policy told 
visiting soviet officials on friday that china will not lift 
controls on the prices of grain and other staples but the policy 
of freezing low prices has discouraged farmers from growing grain 
crops 
at the party meeting zhao also discussed strengthening party 
leadership in order to bring the partys political advantage into 
full play the xinhua report said the 47 millionmember party is 
trying to improve an image tarnished by corruption within its ranks 
and to restore its prestige among a population disenchanted with 
ideology and political infighting 
the central committee session may give some indication if zhao 
the most ambitious of chinas top reformers has been politically 
damaged as a result of the nations economic problems 
there has been widespread speculation that premier li peng the 
more cautious head of chinas government has eclipsed zhao as the 
nations top economic planner amid government concerns that a fast 
pace of reform could cause economic and social chaos 
western diplomats however say there is no indication that 
zhao although he may have lost some prestige is in serious 
political trouble

us and vietnamese officials began 
searching northern vietnamese villages monday for people who may 
have seen plane crashes in which american soldiers were lost more 
than 15 years ago an official said 
two joint teams including us military experts drove to the 
areas near the capital of hanoi to try to resolve the fates of 
seven airmen downed during the vietnam war said maj thomas j 
boyd spokesman for the us pacific command 
he said the teams headed out in jeeps the americans flew in from 
honolulu the previous day along with metal detectors and other 
equipment including forensic instruments in case human remains were 
found during the 10day search 
this is the first joint activity that involves tracking down 
of missing in action mia cases he said the teams are 
investigating loss incidents that occurred and trying to interview 
individuals who may possess information surrounding the incidents 
he said the two sides may later excavate any warplane crash 
sites that are found during the investigation 
previously the only significant joint field activity was in 
late 1985 when us soldiers and vietnamese state workers dug up 
the wreckage of a us b52 bomber just outside hanoi but found no 
remains 
boyd said the teams will try to gather evidence such as the 
soldiers personnel effects and local government reports of the 
incidents 
he said the teams will search an area in bac thai and vinh phu 
provinces 40 miles northwest of hanoi and in lang son and ha bac 
provinces 30 miles to the northeast of the capital they may later 
investigate a third area southeast of hanoi he said 
boyd said the us side brought in eight motorcycles for the 
vietnamese to scout villages before the joint teams arrive 
the seven cases are among 70 discrepancy cases the united 
states has asked vietnam to resolve urgently claiming there is 
evidence the men survived and came under vietnamese control 
washington says it has no evidence they remain alive 15 years 
after us forces withdrew from vietnam 
we hope to accomplish many more joint investigation operations 
in vietnam during this initial 90day period of joint activity and 
continue beyond that time until this issue is resolved as fully as 
possible said a statement from the us team leader lt col 
joe harvey we are prepared to provide four teams if vietnam 
agrees 
harvey earlier called the project a significant breakthrough 
and said joint investigations could resolve all 70 cases 
a total of 2393 americans listed as mia in the war 1757 in 
vietnam 547 in laos 83 in cambodia and six in china 
the war which cost 58000 american lives ended when communist 
north vietnam defeated usbacked south vietnam in april 1975

the unemployment insurance system has enough 
reserves to last only five months in a severe recession and would 
have to borrow billions of dollars from the federal government to 
keep paying benefits congressional watchdogs said monday 
because states had to borrow 118 billion to keep paying 
benefits during the 198182 recession most have tightened 
eligibility requirements so much that only one of every four 
jobless workers in october of last year received unemployment 
checks the general accounting office said in a report 
the average proportion of unemployed receiving benefits during 
the 1980s has fallen by about 30 percent since the 1950s the gao 
said in 1952 nearly 55 percent of unemployed civilian workers 
were receiving benefits by 1986 only 32 percent received 
benefits 
although demographic changes in the workforce explain part of 
the decline the report said the reagan administrations emphasis 
on states repaying the 118 billion they borrowed in 198182 has 
caused at least 44 of them to tighten eligibility requirements 
as of 1986 the gao said state unemployment insurance trusts 
still owed the us treasury a total of 48 billion the combined 
statefederal system still had reserves of about 194 billion last 
year enough to last about five months in a severe recessions the 
watchdogs said 
but they added recent recessions have tended to last at least 
12 months and the labor department recommends that each state 
carry sufficient reserves to pay benefits for 18 months 
while 39 states had adequate reserves in 1969 no more than two 
states have had sufficient funds in any year since 1976 to deal 
with a recession without borrowing from the federal treasury the 
report said 
the statefederal system was created as part of the new deal to 
help cushion the blow of the depression on laid off workers the 
program is designed to be selfsufficient with the federal 
government assumes the cost of administration while states pay the 
actual benefits with funds raised through a payroll tax on 
employers 
because states have been trimming benefits and tightening 
eligibility the gao questioned the systems ability to stabilize 
the economy and mitigate the effects of income loss suffered by the 
unemployed in the next recession 
the report suggested that unless congress somehow eases the 
burden the country may see greater tax increases and larger 
benefit reductions in the regions that have experienced the least 
favorable economic conditions

here is the text of remarks by 
president reagan to the 43rd general asssembly monday 
mr president mr secretarygeneral distinguished delegates 
half a world away far from this place of peace the firing the 
killing the bloodshed in two merciless conflicts have for the 
first time in recent memory diminished after adding terrible new 
names to the roll call of human horror names such as halabja 
maidan shahr and spin buldak there is today hope of peace in the 
persian gulf and afghanistan 
so too in the highlands and coastal cities of southern africa 
places of civil war places of occupation by foreign troops 
talk of peace is heard peace for the tortured nation of angola 
six thousand five hundred miles further east in the southeast 
asian country of cambodia there is hope now of a settlement hope 
now of the removal of vietnams occupying forces and finally in 
this hemisphere where only 12 years ago onethird of the people of 
latin america lived under democratic rule some 90 percent do so 
today and especially in central america nations such as el 
salvador once thratened by the anarchy of the death squad and the 
specter of totalitarian rule now know the hope of selfgovernment 
and the prospect of eocnomic growth 
and another change mr secretarygeneral a change that if it 
endures may go down as one of the signal accomplishments of our 
history a change that is cause for shaking of the head in wonder 
is also upon us a change going to the source of postwar 
tensions and to the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the 
twin threats of our time totalitarianism and thermonuclear world 
war 
for the first time the differences between east and west 
fundamental differences over important moral questions dealing with 
the worth of the individual and whether governments shall control 
people or people control governments for the first time these 
differences ahve shown signs of easing easing to the point where 
there are not just troop withdrawals from places like afghanistan 
but also talk in the east of reform and greater freedom of press 
of assembly and of religion yes fundamental differences remain 
but should talk of reform become more than that should it become 
reality there is the prospect of not only a new era in 
sovietamerican relations but a new age of world peace for such 
reform can bring peace history teaches and my country has always 
believed that where the rights of the individual and the people are 
enshrined war is a distant prospect for it is not people who make 
war governments do that 
i stand at this podium then in a moment of hope hope not just 
for the peoples of the united states or the soviet union but for 
all the peoples of the world and hope too for the dream of peace 
among nations the dream that began the united nations 
precisely because of these changes today the united nations 
has the opportunity to live and breathe and work as never before 
already you mr secretarygeneral through your persistence 
patience and unyielding will have shown in working toward peace 
in afghanistan and the persian gulf how valuable the united 
nations can be we salute you for those accomplishments 
and in geneva at this very hour there are numerous negotiations 
underway multilateral negotiations at the conference on 
disarmament as well as bilateral negotiations on a range of issues 
between the soviets and ourselves and these negotiations some of 
them under un auspices involve a broad arms control agenda 
strategic offensive weapons strategic defense and space nuclear 
testing and chemical warfare whose urgency we have witnessed 
anew in recent days 
and mr secretarygeneral the negotiators are busy and over 
the past few years they have been engaged in more than an academic 
exercise there is movement the logjam is broken only recently 
when the united states and the soviet union signed the inf 
agreement an entire class of us and soviet nuclear missiles was 
eliminated for the first time in history progress continues on 
negotiations to reduce in massive number strategic weapons with 
effective verification and talks will begin soon on conventional 
reductions in europe 
much of the reason for all of this goes back i believe to 
geneva itself to the small chateau along the lake where i and the 
general secretary of the soviet union had the first of several 
fireside chats exchanges characterized by frankness but 
friendliness too i said at the first meeting in geneva that this 
was a unique encounter between two people who had the power to 
start world war iii or to begin a new age of peace among nations 
and i also said peace conferences arms negotiations proposals for 
treaties could make sense only if they were part of a wider context 
a context that sought to explore and resolve the deeper 
underlying differences between us i said to mr gorbachev then as 
i have said to you before nations do not mistrust each other 
because they are armed they are armed because they mistrust each 
other 
in that place by that peaceful lake in neutral switzerland mr 
grobachev and i did begin a new relationship based not just on 
engagement over the single issue of arms control but on a broader 
agenda about our deeper differences an agenda of human rights 
regional conflicts and bilateral exchanges between our peoples 
even on the arms control issue itself we agree to go beyond the 
past to seek not just treaties that permit building weapons to 
higher levels but revolutionary agreements that actually reduced 
and even eliminated a whole class of nuclear weapons 
what was begun that morning in geneva has shown results in the 
inf treaty in my recent visit to moscow in my opportunity to meet 
there with soviet citizens and dissidents and speak of human 
rights and to speak too in the lenin hills of moscow to the 
young people of the soviet union about the wonder and splendor of 
human freedom the results of that morning in geneva are seen in 
peace conferences now under way around the world on regional 
conflicts and in the work of the un here in new york as well as 
in geneva 
but mr secretarygeneral history teaches caution indeed that 
very building in geneva where important negotiations have taken 
place the geneva accords on afghanistan the iraniraq 
negotiations for example we see it today as stonelike testimony 
to a failed dream of peace in another time the palais des nations 
was the headquarters of the league of nations an institution that 
was to symbolize an end to all war and yet that institution and 
its noble purpose ended with the second world war ended because 
the chance for peace was not seized in the 1930s by the nations of 
the world ended because humanity did not find the courage to 
isolate the aggressors to reject schemes of government that serve 
the state not the people

police on tuesday will question two 
us olympic swimmers who are accused of stealing a marble lions 
head from a seoul hotel angry south koreans are demanding the pair 
be sent to prison 
police officials were quoted by seoul newspapers as saying the 
men doug gjertsen and troy dalbey will not receive any special 
consideration when they are questioned about the theft saturday of 
the 830 ornament 
the decision on whether to prosecute the americans will be made 
by the prosecutors office after police submit a report 
gjertsen and dalbey who each won two gold medals could be 
sentenced to 110 years in prison if convicted on charges of 
aggravated theft 
us olympic officials said the incident was a foolish prank and 
kicked the pair off the american team 
police and seoul newspapers said monday they have been flooded 
with calls from irate people demanding the two americans receive 
prison sentences 
newpapapers which referred to the incident under the headline 
ugly americans said many readers were calling to complain and 
the publications backed the calls for tough treatment 
the newspapers continued to bristle with denunciations of us 
press coverage of the olympics and south korea commentators 
charged the us media was trying to blacken the nations image 
the influential chosun ilbo said in an editorial the theft 
case involving the us swimmers clearly shows the overbearing 
attitude of americans 
newspapers compared the swimmers to a brawl on thursday when 
south korean boxing officials attacked a referee after a bulgarian 
boxer was named the winner over local favorite byun jongil 
byun and some officials were suspended for the incident 
the us media should know that such incidents have greatly 
hurt the pride of the korean people who have worked hard to prepare 
for the olympic games for the past seven years and as a result it 
is proliferating antiamerican sentiments said newspaper 
commentator chung tongwoo 
the korean media and some government politicians have played up 
the arrest of the swimmers in an apparent attempt to divert 
attention from the boxing incident 
the media and many people have denounced nbc for its coverage of 
the incident claiming the american network played it up to 
embarrass south korea 
newspapers have complained that the us media failed to focus 
on the incident involving the swimmers in the same way that it 
dwelt on the boxing incident 
how is nbc which reported the momentary violent act in the 
boxing in such a manner going to explain the theft case involving 
athletes from its own country joongang ilbo said 
the boxing incident was extensively covered by television around 
the world but nbc is the only foreign network seen in south korea 
where it is shown on a us military network 
the united states is south koreas main ally but there has been 
some tension between the two nations over trade and political 
issues 
some south koreans claim americans want to dominate them but 
many observers say korean resentment reflects growing pains as it 
emerges from years of dependence on washington

sales of existing singlefamily homes 
increased a modest 11 percent in august to the secondhighest 
level of the year as buyers tried to close purchases before 
interest rates rose further a real estate trade group said monday 
the national association of realtors said sales of existing 
homes rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 367 million 
units last month following a sharp 50 percent decline in july 
except for the 382 million rate in june the august pace was the 
fastest in 15 months 
john savacool an economist with the wefa group a bala cynwyd 
pa forecasting firm said buyers completing sales in august 
probably began looking for homes in may and june 
that was just after rates started rising he said the 
increase was a mild panic response to rising rates 
fixedrate mortgages dipped below 10 percent in february and 
march and have since risen to about 105 percent as the federal 
reserve board fought inflation through higher interest rates many 
economists expect rates to top 11 percent by early next year 
basically what were seeing here is the movement of 
households into the market now to avoid what they perceive to be 
deteriorating conditions this has persisted through the summer 
said john a tuccillo chief economist of the real estate 
association 
he predicted sales will decline the rest of the year bringing 
them for all of 1988 to 345 million units a 21 percent decline 
from 1987 
savacool said strongerthanexpected resales so far this year 
are a reflection of a robust economy in general 
weve gone a nice long time with a good strong housing market 
weve had a few declines but were still looking at a pretty 
strong market he said 
after hitting a low of 199 million units in the recession year 
of 1982 resales climbed to a record high of 356 million units in 
1986 savacool said sales likely would decline next year as 
interest rates rise in the first half but then recover in 1990 
all of the strength in august came in the south where sales 
rose 44 percent to an annual rate of 142 million units 
rebounding from a 42 percent decline in july 
in the northeast sales fell 29 percent to a 670000unit rate 
following a 68 percent decline in july 
sales were unchanged in the midwest and west at 910000 units 
and 650000 units respectively 
analysts have attributed the softening of sales in the northeast 
to high prices and to the effects of the october stock market crash 
on employment in financial service industries 
sales in the midwest they say are beginning to pick up a 
reflection of the strong manufacturing economy 
the median price of a home rose from july to august by 600 to 
91300 up 55 percent from a year ago when the median sales price 
for an existing home was 86500 
the northeast remained the costliest region of the country with 
a median sales price of 144800 last month up 67 percent from a 
year ago it was followed by a median price of 122000 in the 
west up 60 percent from a year ago 84300 in the south up 43 
percent and 70500 in the midwest up 60 percent

we are here today mr secretarygeneral determined that no 
such fate shall befall the united nations we are determined that 
the un should succeed and serve the cause of peace for humankind 
so mr secretarygeneral we realize that even in this time of 
hope the chance of failure is real but this knowledge does not 
discourage us it spurs us on for the stakes are high do we 
falter and fail now and bring down upon ourselves the just anger of 
future generations or do we continue the work of the founders of 
this institution and see to it that at last freedom is enshrined 
and humanity knows war no longer and that this place this floor 
shall be truly the worlds last battlefield 
we are determined it shall be so so we turn now to the agenda 
of peace let us begin by addressing a concern that was much on my 
mind when i met with mr gorbachev in the kremlin as well as on the 
minds of soviet citizens i met in moscow it is also an issue that 
i know is of immediate importance to the delegates of this assembly 
who this fall commemorate the 40th anniversary of the universal 
declaration of human rights 
that declaration says plainly what those who seek peace can 
forget only at the greatest peril that peace rests on one 
foundation observing the inalienable rights of all members of 
the human family in a century where human rights have been 
denied by totalitarian governments on a scale never before seen in 
history with so many millions deliberately starved or eliminated 
as a matter of state policy a history it has been said of 
blood stupidity and barbed wire few can wonder why peace has 
proved so elusive 
let us understand if we would have peace we must acknowledge 
the elementary rights of our fellow human beings in our own land 
and in other lands if we would have peace the trampling of the 
human spirit must cease human rights is not for some some of the 
time human rights as the universal declaration of this assembly 
adopted in 1948 proclaims is for all people and all nations 
and for all time 
this regard for human rights as the foundation of peace is at 
the heart of the un those who starve in ethiopia those who die 
among the kurds those who face racial injustice in south africa 
those who still cannot write or speak freely in the soviet union 
those who cannot worship in the ukraine those who struggle for 
life and freedom on boats in the south china sea those who cannot 
publish or assemble in managua all of this is more than just an 
agenda item on your calendar it must be a first concern an issue 
above others for when human rights concerns are not paramount at 
the united nations when the universal declaration of human rights 
is not honored in these halls and meeting rooms then the very 
credibility of this organization is at stake the very purpose of 
its existence in question 
that is why when human rights progress is made the united 
nations grows stronger and the united states is glad of it 
following a twoyear effort led by the united states for example 
the un human rights commission took a major step toward ending 
the double standards and cynicism that had characterized too much 
of its past for years cuba a blatant violator of its citizens 
human rights has escaped un censure or even scrutiny this year 
cuba has responded to pressure generated by the human rights 
commission by accepting an investigation into its human rights 
abuses fidel castro has already begun to free some political 
prisoners improve prison conditions and tolerate the existence of 
a small independent national human rights group 
more must be done the united nations must be relentless and 
unyielding in seeking change in cuba and elsewhere and we must 
also see to it that the universal declaration itself should not be 
debased with episodes like the zionism is racism resolution 
respect for human rights is the first and fundamental mission of 
this body the most elementary obligation of its members indeed 
wherever one turns in the world today there is new awareness a 
growing passion for human rights the people of the world grow 
united new groups new coalitions form coalitions that monitor 
government that work against discrimination that fight religious 
or political repression unlawful imprisonment torture or 
execution as those i spoke to at spaso house said to me last june 
such movements make a difference 
turning now to regional conflicts we feel again the uplift of 
hope in the gulf war between iran and iraq one of the bloodiest 
conflicts since world war ii we have a ceasefire the resolution 
and the firmness of the allied nations in keeping the persian gulf 
open to international shipping not only upheld the rule of law it 
helped prevent further spread of the conflict and laid the basis 
for peace so too the security councils decisive resolution in 
july a year ago has become the blueprint for a peaceful gulf let 
this war a war in which there has been no victor or vanquished 
only victims let this war end now let both iran and iraq 
cooperate with the secretarygeneral and the security council in 
implementing resolution 598 let peace come 
moving on to a second region when i first addressed the un 
general assembly in 1983 world attention was focused on the brutal 
invasion and illegal occupation of afghanistan after nearly nine 
long years of war the courage and determination of the afghan 
people and the afghan freedom fighters have held sway today an 
end to the occupation is in sight on april 14 the ussr signed 
the geneva accords which were negotiated under un auspices by 
pakistan and the kabul regime we encourage the soviet union to 
complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date so that 
the afghan people can freely determine their future without further 
outside interference 
in southern africa too years of patient diplomacy and support 
for those in angola who seek selfdetermination are having their 
effect we look forward to an accord between the governments of 
angola cuba and south africa that will bring about a complete 
withdrawal of all foreign troops primarily cuban from angola 
we look forward as well to full implementation of un security 
council resolution 435 and our longstanding goal of independence 
for namibia we continue to support a growing consensus among 
african leaders who also believe there can be no reconciliation 
within angola 
mr secretarygeneral there are new hopes for cambodia a 
nation whose freedom and independence we seek just as avidly as we 
sought the freedom and independence of afghanistan we urge the 
rapid removal of all vietnamese troops and a settlement that will 
prevent the return of the khmer rouge to power permitting instead 
the establishment of a genuinely representative government a 
government that will at last respect fully the rights of the 
people of cambodia and end the hideous suffering they have so 
bravely and needlessly borne 
in other critical areas we applaud the secretarygenerals 
efforts to structure a referendum on the western sahara and in the 
mediterranean direct talks between the greek and turkish cypriot 
communities hold much promise for accord in that divided island 
nation finally we look to a peaceful solution to the arabisraeli 
conflict so too the unnatural division of europe remains a 
critical obstacle to sovietamerican relations

archbishop marcel lefebvres 
traditionalist movement ordained seven new priests the first since 
it formally split with the roman catholic church in june a member 
of the movement said monday 
the ordination sunday was performed by one of the new bishops 
bernard tissier de mallerais with lefebvre in attendance said a 
member of the st pius x fraternity identifying himself as brother

six of the new priests are french and one is italian he said 
lefebvre whose movement campaigns against reforms which he says 
are spreading the cancer of liberalism in the church on june 
30 consecrated four bishops without papal approval 
the vatican condemned the consecrations as as act of schism a 
formal break with the holy see it announced that lefebvre and the 
four bishops were automatically excommunicated or ejected from the 
church for refusing to submit to papal authority 
it was the first schism since 1870 when old catholics split 
with the vatican over the dogma of papal infallibility 
lefebvre 82 said he consecrated the bishops to ordain priests 
in his movement after he died 
he set up his first seminary in 1970 in the swiss alps 
rejecting several changes of the second vatican council in 196265 
lebebvre named it after pope pius x who condemned the modernist 
le sillon movement in 1910 
in 1976 pope paul vi suspended him from his priestly functions 
after lefebvre continued to celebrate mass in latin rather than in 
the vernacular 
lefebvre ignored the sanction he has since ordained more than 
220 traditionalist priests and seminaries of his movement operate 
worldwide

lt gov bob jordan has launched an 
offensive depicting republican gov jim martins administration as 
riddled with ethical shortcomings as polls show martin pulling 
ahead in his reelection bid 
martin in turn has questioned jordans respect for the rev 
martin luther king jr and criticized the democratic challenger for 
telling blacks he could not support their views publicly for fear 
of alienating the white redneck vote 
martin a former congressman who rode president reagans 
coattails to victory in 1984 is the second gop governor elected 
this century in north carolina and would be the first reelected in 
state history 
jordan is a 55yearold lumber mill executive 
in north carolina the governor and lieutenant governor run 
separately there have been disagreements between martin and jordan 
throughout their term on issues from highway funding to veto power 
for the governor 
but their longest battle was over the budget which in north 
carolina must be balanced jordan accused martin of being 
irresponsible in turning in an unbalanced budget martin responded 
that he had no way of knowing when he submitted his budget that 
changes in tax collections would make it unbalanced 
both are moderates with strong business ties who emphasize 
education highway expansion economic growth and environmental 
protection they expect to spend 5 million each a state record 
for a twocandidate gubernatorial race 
some insiders said the average voter probably cannot see much 
difference between the two 
a charlotte observer poll sept 1114 gave martin 51 percent 
support to jordans 43 percent among 802 voters surveyed the 
margin of error was plus or minus 35 percentage points the 
papers poll in may saw the race as a dead heat 
a survey for the news and observer of raleigh gave martin an 
even bigger lead of 806 likely voters interviewed sept 1113 47 
percent favored martin 364 percent jordan and 166 percent were 
undecided the margin of error was 35 points 
in midseptember jordan went on the attack accusing martin of 
cynical manipulation of government for political purposes 
during his tenure martin weakened the state financial disclosure 
rule and stacked environmental protection commissions with 
developers who had conflicts of interest jordan charged 
he accused martin of giving jobs to spouses of top aides buying 
a leading democrats support with a 329aday role as an adviser 
and making one department a taxpaid campaign headquarters and 
another a graveyard for defeated republican candidates 
part of leadership is who you surround youself with whether 
or not you protect the public trust jordan said jim martin is 
a nice fellow but that doesnt mean he is a good governor 
martin called the attacks a smear 
he jordan is a decent enough guy that he will be ashamed of 
himself for trying to impugn my ethics martin said 
merle black political science professor at the university of 
north carolina at chapel hill said jordan was being more 
aggressive because his positive approach had been ineffective 
hes got to poke some holes in martins armor black said 
hes got to develop reasons for the voters why martin ought to be 
removed from office 
earlier this month jordan cried foul over a radio commercial 
martin aired on blackoriented stations 
the spot consisted of a conversation in a fictitious barbershop 
it said jordan declined martins offer to be chairman of a 
commission planning activities for the state martin luther king jr 
holiday i wonder what bob jordan has against martin luther 
king it said 
the ad did not mention that jordan supported a 1987 bill 
establishing the holiday while martin opposed it jordan aides 
called the commercial sleazy and a black commission member resigned 
in protest 
earlier this year jordan told a group of black newspaper 
executives he agreed with them on some issues that he could not 
discuss publicly for fear of alienating the white redneck vote 
martin has needled his opponent by telling audiences he wants 
their votes regardless of your race creed or the color of your 
neck 
were not writing off the black vote and were not going to 
let them democrats take it for granted the governor said 
about 20 percent of the states 32 million registered voters 
are black

a former cancer patient says he surprised 
even himself when he took less than a day to ride his bicycle 
across most of the length of kentucky to raise money for the 
american cancer society 
brad swope arrived in this northeastern kentucky city about 430 
am edt monday approximately 400 miles from paducah in western 
kentucky where he began his trek at 7 am edt sunday 
i thought i would take every minute of 24 hours i think 
everybody did swope said 
there was a lot of energy and poignance attached to this 
effort he said i couldnt have done it just to do it i 
needed a mission like the american cancer society 
swope believed he reached his goal of raising 20000 in 
individual and corporate pledges for cancer research 
the money hasnt been tallied said crew chief tim omer 
but were expecting to meet our goal 
swope 38 of louisville experienced no health problems during 
his ride but planned to rest for two to three days omer said 
swope was diagnosed as having malignant melanoma a form of 
skin cancer three years ago doctors removed a growth from his 
back and told him they felt certain they got it all he said in a 
preride interview 
the 5foot8 136pound athlete said he undertook the trip 
because he wanted others to know that people can recover and be 
cured from cancer 
swope said hills and fog that covered much of the state monday 
morning made the last 50 miles of the trip the toughest the 
terrain was a nightmare he said 
swope added that a 12 mph headwind in the western section of the 
state caught him by surprise but in the end did not affect the 
outcome 
cyclists are almost like sailors we always watch the wind 
especially if you weigh 136 pounds and are riding a 19pound 
bike he said but it wasnt the negative factor i thought it 
would be it just became a matter of time and distance 
swopes wife ann is glad its over 
its been a long three months of intense training she 
said now we can go on to other things 
its going to be kind of strange to go home she added 
well probably sit there and say now what to we do

in most of these areas then we see progress and again we are 
glad of it only a few years ago mr secretarygeneral all of 
these and other conflicts were burning dangerously out of control 
indeed the invasion of afghanistan and the apparent failure of 
will among democratic and peaceloving nations to deter such events 
seemed to cause a climate where aggression by nations large and 
small was epidemic a climate the world had not seen since the 
1930s only this time larger war was avoided avoided because the 
free and peaceful nations of the world recovered their strength of 
purpose and will and now the united nations is providing valuable 
assistance in helping this epidemic to recede 
and because we are resolved to keep it so i would be remiss in 
my duty if i did not now take note here of the one exception to 
progress in regional conflicts i refer to the continuing 
deterioration of human rights in nicaragua and the refusal of the 
tiny elite now ruling that nation to honor promises of democracy 
made to their own people and to the international community this 
elite in calling itself revolutionary seeks no real revolution 
the use of the term is subterfuge deception for hiding the oldest 
most corrupt vice of all mans ageold will to power his lust to 
control the lives and steal the freedom of others 
that is why as president i will continue to urge the congress 
and the american public to stand behind those who resist this 
attempt to impose a totalitarian regime on the people of nicaragua 
that the united states will continue to stand with those who are 
threatened by this regimes aggression against its neighbors in 
central america 
today i also call on the soviet union to show in central 
america the same spirit of constructive realism it has shown in 
other regional conflicts to assist in bringing conflict in central 
america to a close by halting the flow of billions of dollars worth 
of arms and ammunition to the sandinista regime a regime whose 
goals of regional domination while ultimately doomed can 
continue to cause great suffering to the people of that area and 
risk to sovietamerican relations unless action is taken now 
moving now to the arms reduction agenda i have mentioned 
already the importance of the inf treaty and the momentum developed 
in the start negotiations the draft start treaty is a lengthy 
document filled with bracketed language designating sections of 
disagreement between the two sides but through this summer in 
geneva those brackets have diminished there is every reason to 
believe this process can continue i can tell this assembly that it 
is highly doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few 
months but i can tell you a year from now is a possibility more 
than a possibility but we have no deadline no agreement is better 
than a bad agreement the united states remains hopeful and we 
acknowledge the spirit of cooperation shown by the soviet union in 
these negotiations we also look for that spirit to be applied to 
our concerns about compliance with existing agreements 
so too our discussions on nuclear testing and defense and 
space have been useful but let me here stress to the general 
assembly that much of the momentum in nuclear arms control 
negotiations is due to technological progress itself especially in 
the potential for spacebased defensive systems i believe that the 
united states determination to research and develop and when 
ready deploy such defensive systems systems targeted to destroy 
missiles not people accounts for a large share of the progress 
made in recent years in geneva with such systems for the first 
time in case of accidental launch or the act of a madman 
somewhere major powers will not be faced with the single option of 
massive retaliation but will instead have the chance of a saner 
choice to shield against an attack instad of avenging it so 
too as defensive systems grow in effectiveness they reduce the 
threat and the value of greater and greater offensive arsenals 
only recently briefings i have received in the oval office 
indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid 
and less costly than we had at first thought today the united 
states reaffirms its commitment to its strategic defense initiative 
and our offer to share the benefits of strategic defenses with 
others 
and yet even as diplomatic and technological progess holds out 
the hope of at last diminishing the awful cloud of nuclear terror 
we have lived under in the postwar era even at this moment 
another ominous terror is loose once again in the world a terror 
we thought the world had put behind a terror that looms at us now 
from the long buried past from ghostly scarring trenches and the 
haunting wan faces of millions dead in one of the most inhumane 
conflicts of all time 
poison gas chemical warfare mr secretarygeneral 
distinguished delegates the terror of it the horror of it we 
condemn it the use of chemical weapons in the iraniraq war 
beyond its tragic human toll jeopardizes the moral and legal 
strictures that have held these weapons in check since world war i 
let this tragedy spark reaffirmation of the geneva signatories to 
that protocol as well as other concerned states to convene a 
conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse 
the serious erosion of this treaty and we urge all nations to 
cooperate in negotiating a verifiable truly global ban on chemical 
weapons at the conference on disarmament in geneva 
it is incumbent upon all civilized nations to ban once and for 
all and on a verifiable and global basis the use of chemical 
and gas warfare 
finally mr secretarygeneral we must redouble our efforts to 
stop further proliferation of nuclear weapons in the world 
likewise proliferation in other hightechnology weapons such as 
ballistic missiles is reaching global proportions exacerbating 
regional rivalries in ways that can have global implications the 
number of potential suppliers is growing at an alarming rate and 
more must be done to halt the spread of these weapons this was a 
matter of discussion last week between secretary shultz and foreign 
minister shevardnadze talks between american and soviet experts 
begin on this today and we hope to see a multilateral effort to 
avoid having areas of tension like the middle east become even more 
deadly battlegrounds than they already are 
but in most of these areas we see not only progress but also 
the potential for an incrasingly vital role for multilateral 
efforts and institutions like the united nations that is why now 
more than ever the united nations must continue to increase its 
effectiveness through budget and program reform the un already 
is enacting sweeping measures affecting personnel reductions 
budgeting by consensus and the establishment of program 
priorities these actions are extremely important the progress on 
reforms has allowed me to release funds withheld under 
congressional restrictions i expect the reform program will 
continue and that further funds will be released in our new fiscal 
year 
and let me say here we congratulate the united nations on the 
work it has done in three areas of special concern first our 
struggle against the scourge of terrorism and statesponsored 
terrorism must continue and we must also end the scourge of 
hostage taking second the work of the world health organization 
in coordinating and advancing research on aids is vital all 
international efforts in this area must be redoubled the aids 
crisis is a grave one we must move as one to meet it 
so too is the drug crisis we are moving now toward a new 
antidrug trafficking convention this important treaty will be 
completed in december i am confident other strong un drug 
control programs will also follow the american people are 
profoundly concerned deeply angered we will not tolerate the drug 
traffickers we mean to make war on them and we believe this is 
one war the united nations can endorse and participate in

the government monday 
identified a group of whites only areas that could become south 
africas first legally integrated neighborhoods 
tens of thousands of nonwhites already live illegally in the 
districts named in parliament by constitutional planning minister 
chris heunis 
heunis listed districts in and near johannesburg cape town 
durban and port elizabeth when he reintroduced a package of 
legislation dealing with the group areas act which segregates all 
neighborhoods by race 
neighborhoods are to become multiracial only where a majority of 
residents approve or where integration has occurred on a de facto 
basis 
the package also includes proposals to tighten enforcement of 
the act in areas that remain segregated 
the entire package is opposed by most antiapartheid 
organizations which say the group areas act should be repealed 
rather than modified 
if we dont destroy it it will destroy us said miley 
richards a mixedrace parliament member in regard to the act 
among the areas mentioned by heunis is cape towns district six 
a formerly multiracial area from which tens of thousands of 
mixedrace people were evicted after it was declared whitesonly in 
1966 
also mentioned was hillbrow an area of highrise apartment 
buildings which is one of johannesburgs liveliest and most 
cosmopolitan neighborhoods 
hillbrow like several of the areas named by heunis has become 
home to many asians blacks and people of mixedrace moving into 
innercity housing vacated by whites who left for the suburbs 
the proposal to allow multiracial neighborhoods has been 
denounced by the extremeright conservative party which is 
expected to makes gains in nationwide municipal elections next 
month at the expense of president pw bothas national party 
antiapartheid groups say the national party is trying to 
appease rightwing voters by proposing tougher enforcement of the 
group areas act including sharply increased penalties for 
violators 
the government also is proposing to crack down on occupants of 
substandard urban housing and illegal squatter camps moves which 
could affect millions of blacks 
heunis said the government remained committed to protecting 
group rights its phrase for policies which allow whitesonly 
schools hospitals and residential areas 
the group areas bills created a furor in parliament when the 
government introduced them last month the white chamber approved 
the measures but the smaller mixedrace and asian chambers refused 
to discuss the bills 
the government withdrew the bills but decided to reintroduce 
them after the other chambers agreed to end their boycott 
the nations 26 million black majority is not represented in 
parliament 
under south africas constitution the national party which 
controls parliaments white chamber has the ability to enact 
bills even if the other two chambers reject them 
the group areas act has been the most bitterly debated issue in 
the municipal election campaign 
last week a national party city councilor in johannesburg said 
he would lobby for multiracial areas in wards that vote for the 
antiapartheid progressive federal party but would seek to keep 
other white neighborhoods segregated 
the councilor danie van zyl was accused monday of gutter 
politics by tony leon the progressive federal leader in 
johannesburg leon said his party favored intergration nationwide 
not just in selected neighborhoods

a controversial plan to reintroduce wolves in 
yellowstone national park may be stalled because of the fires that 
have raced through the area this summer the chief naturalist for 
the area said 
george robinson said the fire turned the park into a sort of 
carnivores smorgasbord burning off the foliage and fallen 
deadwood that hid mice and other rodents as well as elk deer and 
moose 
i dont ever remember having seen so many hawks in the sky 
before he said 
he said there are reports of grizzlies standing over the 
firefelled carcasses of elk and deer the same prey wolves would 
seek if they were in the park had the wolves been reestablished 
prior to the fires the timing would have been perfect he said 
the fires which burned a million acres of timber also may 
stand in the way of the controversial wolf program in which at 
least 10 breeding pairs would be introduced into the park 
my guess is we arent going to have time to do much but assess 
the impact of the fire on the park for quite a while robinson 
said id guess such projects as the wolf reintroduction will be 
pushed onto the back burner 
timber wolves once plentiful in the mountains of yellowstone 
were exterminated by hunters around the turn of the century their 
elimination created a gap in the park ecosystem conservationists 
think 
however sheep and cattle ranchers in wyoming montana and 
idaho the states yellowstone straddles have opposed the 
reintroduction plan fearing the wolves will prey on livestock 
outside the park wyoming sens malcolm wallop and alan simpson and 
rep dick cheney support the ranchers 
l david mech a us fish and wildlife wolf specialist from 
minnesota thinks the ranchers fears are unfounded 
minnesota is more susceptible to livestock predation than 
yellowstone he said in minnesota the ranches are scattered like 
a mosaic throughout the wolves territory 
we have 1200 wolves and 12000 livestock ranches yet only 40 
to 50 complaints of wolves killing livestock he added 
in denver last week for a lecture at the museum of natural 
history mech said he hadnt studied the situation in yellowstone 
but based on the size of the elk herds its obviously a prime 
habitat for wolves

the reagan administration has been trying to 
persuade the afghan rebels not to attack departing soviet troops 
fearing this tactic could prompt moscow to back off its promise to 
be out of afghanistan by feb 15 us officials said monday 
this is among the issues that a newly appointed us envoy to 
the rebels edmund mcwilliams is expected to discuss with 
insurgent leaders operating out of base camps in pakistan the 
officials said 
state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis oakley confirmed 
mcwilliams appointment monday he is a career diplomat who once 
served at the us embassy in afghanistan 
the us officials speaking on condition they not be 
identified said some afghan rebel factions believe that attacks on 
soviet forces will ensure their prompt withdrawal but they said 
the administration holds the opposite view 
we dont want soviets to have any excuse to slow their 
withdrawal or to attack the afghans one official said 
he added that the final decision on this and other operational 
matters is up to the rebels themselves 
we dont control their fighting activities but we do present 
them with our views the official said 
on friday soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
bitterly criticized the pakistani role in supplying the afghan 
rebels even through the soviets are continuing with their 
withdrawal schedule 
he said pakistan is behaving as though it has no obligations 
under the agreement in geneva signed last april under which the 
soviets promised to pull out their troops over a ninemonth period 
he proposed a meeting at the united nations this week involving 
the representatives of the signatory countries the soviet union 
the united states pakistan and afghanistan 
asked about the proposal mrs oakley said monday the 
administration sees no need to have such a meeting 
a us official noted that the united states does not regard the 
afghan government as legitimate and that american participation at 
a meeting with an afghan official could be seen as a reversal of 
that policy 
the united states has maintained for the past five months that 
it will show restraint in arming the afghan rebels only if moscow 
does the same with its ally in kabul 
since moscow has been providing substantial support to the kabul 
government the united states has continued its backing for the 
insurgents the official said

spotting a fundamental shift in society to 
recycling dow chemical corp and domtar inc of montreal said 
monday they will form a new company to recycle plastic bottles 
the asyet unnamed 5050 venture will retrieve from the trash of 
the two countries polyethylene terephthalate pet and highdensity 
polyethylene hdpe plastics which make up about 90 percent of the 
plastics used in bottles for milk soft drinks and a variety of 
other products such as powdered detergents 
domtar a diversified chemical and paper firm based in montreal 
already operates paper and plastics recycling businesses 
don genson business director for solid waste solutions for dow 
said the new company would build a pilot plant and then a 
commercial plant as early as 1990 at a location in the united 
states or canada still to be decided 
domtar will collect the raw material and use the bulk of the 
output in its own industrial packaging and building materials 
products dow will sell some of the material it retrieves the two 
companies said 
dow and domtar declined to estimate their expected investments 
or what the output would be used for or to detail the new 
technology developed by dow that will be used in the plant 
we have about 20 projects being evaluated in the corporation 
right now said warren arseneau domtar new business manager 
the size of the plant has not been decided but the two firms 
believe it will handle about 50 million pounds a year of pet and 
hdpe 
about 900 million pounds of pet is sold each year with 150 
million pounds recycled currently about threequarters of original 
annual production goes into bottles recycled material currently is 
not used for food and drink because of the chance of contamination 
hdpe is one of the most widely used plastics and 782 billion 
pounds is produced every year about 465 million pounds made by 
dow some 21 billion pounds goes into bottles for milk and other 
household goods and another 342 million pounds goes into 
miscellaneous food packaging only about 2 percent is recycled 
one recycler eaglebrook plastics co estimates that four hdpe 
bottles are thrown out for every pet bottle 
were entering the business confident that the waste 
management issue will make a fundamental shift in society and 
recycling systems will become the norm genson said 
domtar will deal with recycling centers in areas with pet bottle 
return laws and waste recovery facilities expected to be 
established by states developing new recylcing programs the 
companies said 
last week the environmental protection agency announced plans 
to exhort persuade push and nudge us residents to recycle 25 
percent of their garbage and trash by 1992 up from 10 percent now 
because of the rapid exhaustion of landfill space in a throwaway 
society 
according to epa 10 states have passed laws requiring recycling 
programs of one kind or another with households separating 
recyclable material from food when they put out their garbage the 
agency estimates that these programs operate in about 600 us 
communities

american clinton suggs said 
monday he figured he had just five minutes to live after arab 
hijackers shot a fellow navy diver and threw him out of a 
commandeered twa jetliner 
i made up my mind that if my turn was next im ready but 
im not going to scream suggs said at the murder and air piracy 
trial of mohammed ali hamadi the lebanese shiite moslem is charged 
in the june 1985 hijacking in which robert stethem 23 was killed 
and 39 americans held hostage for 17 days 
suggs testified that said stethem was alive when the hijackers 
threw the mortally wounded man on the runway at beirut airport in 
1985 
i could hear him moaning suggs said i fixed my mind on 
him i tried to hear everything i could because i was blindfolded 
and couldnt see 
the court indictment states that stethem died of his wounds a 
short time after being thrown from the airplane 
suggs testified that before stetham was thrown from the plane 
hamadi said let the pig suffer when the chief flight attendant 
uli derickson asked the hijackers if she could loosen stethems 
bound hands 
suggs and stethem of waldorf md had been taken to the 
planes first class section after the flight was diverted to 
beirut 
i heard a lot of screaming to the tower in arabic i couldnt 
understand it he testified then i could hear robert stethem 
scream suggs said 
other witnesses including mrs derickson have said that 
stethem never made a sound during beatings he received by the 
hijackers but suggs when asked about that testimony maintained 
i heard him scream 
then i hear a gunshot the door open and a second shot 
said suggs at this point i just listened for bob he was still 
alive and i could hear him moaning 
although he was blindfolded at the time suggs said he knew when 
the door opened because you can feel it with the draft and the 
engines were louder 
john testrake the pilot of flight 847 testified earlier at the 
trial that the engines were running when the hijackers shot stethem 
suggs said that after stethem was shot he heard one of the 
hijackers say in broken english one more in five minutes 
i felt i would be the next to die suggs said 
stethems parents richard and patricia who have been attending 
the trial since it opened july 5 sat quietly listening to the 
testimony 
hamadi also sat impassively during suggs testimony 
later monday another navy diver jeffrey ingalls 27 testified 
he hid his military identification card from the hijackers and that 
he was roughed up a little when they found out about it just 
before he was taken off the plane in beirut 
asked to comment on mondays testimony hamadi said in arabic 
through his interpreter i have nothing to say 
hamadi has acknowledged taking part in the hijacking but denied 
having shot stethem he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison

the communist party central committee 
today recommended that party propaganda chief mieczyslaw rakowski 
become polands next prime minister the official pap news agency 
announced 
the 61yearold rakowski a newspaper editor who became a 
politburo member in december would take over from prime minister 
zbigniew messner messner resigned with all 19 of his ministers 
last week following criticism over the handling of economic 
problems 
the sejm or parliament was to meet tuesday to formally approve 
the central committees choice of rakowski as polands ninth prime 
minister since world war ii 
the pap announcement came after a closeddoor session in which 
the 230member central committee sought a prime minister to cope 
with polands stagnant economy and steer the government during 
delicate negotiations next month with the opposition 
the meeting of the central committee was chaired by party leader 
gen wojciech jaruzelski and was addressed by interior minister 
czeslaw kiszczak and by party secretaries wladyslaw baka and jan 
glowczyk pap said 
others mentioned as possible candidates for prime minister were 
politburo member and economist wladyslaw baka interior minister 
gen czeslaw kiszczak peasant party leader roman malinowski and 
alternate politburo member stanislaw ciosek 
commentators ranging from solidarity leader lech walesa to the 
official party weekly polityka have said the appointment of a new 
government has limited significance because a fundamental change is 
needed in the system of governing 
diplomats and party sources suggest another government could be 
formed in a few months anyway depending on the results of the 
talks scheduled with the opposition for midoctober in that case 
the new prime minister might be a temporary caretaker 
under polands system the party controls the choice of 
government through its majority in parliament the party sets the 
nations priorities and it is up to the government to carry out the 
partys dictates 
jaruzelski first secretary of the polish united workers party 
named his candidate for the prime ministers post saturday to the 
leadership of pron a national patriotic group the polish news 
agency said but there has been no public announcement of his 
choice 
whoever assumes the job of prime minister will have a daunting 
task confidence in the government is low inflation is 60 percent 
annually consumer goods are in short supply and workers are 
restive after recently staging two punishing waves of strikes 
the last strike ended after authorities set aside their 
longstanding opposition to negotiating with solidarity agreeing to 
talks in midoctober to consider legalizing the trade union banned 
since 1982 
last week walesa said personnel changes will not change 
anything but systematic changes will 
the sentiment was echoed by polityka which said last week in a 
frontpage article crisis has affected the whole system of 
exercising power and it is unlikely to be resolved by just new 
faces in government

president reagan in a farewell address to 
the united nations said today it is more than a possibility 
that a treaty curbing intercontinental ballistic missiles can be 
signed with the soviet union within the next year 
in a speech at the opening of the general assembly reagan also 
called for an international conference to stop the use of poison 
gas and other chemical weapons 
the president reviewed what he said has been progress toward 
peace in his administration but added that history teaches us 
caution and that even in this time of hope the chance of 
failure is real 
he called upon iran and iraq to cooperate in implementing the 
un resolution on their persian gulf war saying let this war 
end now let peace come 
in afghanistan he said we encourage the soviet union to 
complete its troop withdrawal at the earliest possible date so that 
the afghan people can freely determine their future without further 
outside interference 
the president condemned the continuing deterioration of human 
rights in nicaragua and the refusal of the tiny elite now ruling 
that nation to honor promises of democracy made to their own people 
and to the international community 
he called on the soviet union to assist in bringing the 
conflict in central america to a close by halting the flow of 
billions of dollars of arms and ammunition to the sandinista 
regime in nicaragua 
and he said he will continue to urge the congress and the 
american public to stand behind those who resist this attempt to 
impose a totalitarian regime on the nicaraguan people 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze sitting with the 
soviet delegation to the general assembly nodded as reagan spoke 
of progress on arms control members of the nicaraguan delegation 
were expressionless as the president charged their countrys 
marxistled government with repressive practices 
turning to negotiations on longrange nuclear weapons the 
president said i can tell this assembly that it is highly 
doubtful such a treaty can be accomplished in a few months but i 
can tell you a year from now is a possibility more than a 
possibility 
then in an emotional passage he said poison gas chemical 
warfare the terror of it the horror of it we condemn it the 
use of chemical weapons in the iraniraq war beyond its tragic 
human toll jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have 
held these weapons in check since world war i 
the president urged nations that signed the geneva protocol 
outlawing such weapons and other concerned countries to convene a 
conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse 
the serious erosion of this treaty 
iraq has admitted using chemical weapons in its eightyear 
persian gulf war with iran but claims iran also employed the banned 
substances tehran has denied the allegation in addition the 
united states has accused iraq of using poison gas against its 
kurdish minority an announcement by iraqs foreign minister last 
week indicated iraq will no longer use chemical weapons against 
foreign or domestic adversaries 
the president also said recent briefings he has received in the 
oval office on his star wars system for spacebased misile defense 
indicate that progress toward such systems may be even more rapid 
and less costly than we had at first thought 
noting that this would be his last address to the united nations 
before he leaves office in january the president said that if 
future generations do say of us that in our time peace came 
closer that we did bring about new seasons of truth and justice 
it will be cause for pride 
it was reagans seventh appearance before the united nations he 
has addressed the opening session of the general assembly each year 
since 1983 and spoke at a special un session on disarmament in 
1982 
before going to the general assembly chamber for his speech 
reagan was greeted by united nations secretary general javier perez 
de cuellar when a reporter asked why there had been such a 
dramatic change in his views of the united nations of which he has 
been sharply critical in the past reagan gestured to perez de 
cuellar and said because of the gentleman present the un has 
changed dramatically 
it was reagans first meeting with perez de cuellar since the 
white houses announcement on sept 13 that the president was 
releasing 188 million the united states had withheld from the 
organization to show displeasure with un budgetary and hiring 
practices 
the presidents national security adviser lt gen colin l 
powell said the united nations had responded to us suggestions 
by making changes in its budget procedures and the size of its 
staff and that the president wanted to recognize this as well as 
the fact that the organization has started to play a more 
important role around the world in helping to deal with regional 
conflicts 
after his speech the president also met with egyptian foreign 
minister esmat abdelmeguid israeli foreign minister shimon peres 
president robert mugabe of zimbabwe sheik sabah alahmed foreign 
minister of kuwait and others 
the white house announced today that reagan had decided to end 
us convoys of americanflagged ships in the persian gulf but will 
keep us forces in the gulf to aid threatened ships 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters reagan 
would discuss the change in meetings with heads of state from the 
region reagan acted after reviewing the current ceasefire 
which has been in effect since aug 20 and consulting with allies 
and friends in the region he said 
there have been no attacks on gulf shipping since the ceasefire 
began 
during his meeting with the egyptian and israeli foreign 
ministers reagan was asked why more progress had not been made 
during his administration toward peace in the middle east i 
think all of us would have liked to have made more progress than we 
didbut its not a complete failure were talking he said

republican george bush declared today his 
debate with michael dukakis went great while running mate sen 
dan quayle proclaimed the vice president a clear victor in the 
nationally televised faceoff 
earlier bush campaign chairman james a baker iii issued a 
clarification on bushs views on abortion saying that the vice 
president would not sanction criminal penalties for women who 
obtain abortions despite the strong views he expressed in his 
debate sunday night 
however bush told reporters here he had no change of mind at 
all on the subject as aides insisted that bush never favored 
criminal penalties for women who get abortions 
quayle who appeared with bush for the first time since labor 
day praised his running mates performance from the way you 
handled the man from massachusetts last night he would have been 
better off to take advice from his friends at the aclu and 
exercised his right to remain silent quayle said referring to 
the american civil liberties union 
bush has criticized dukakis membership in the aclu a group 
that supports civil rights 
after last night for most people the notion of president 
dukakis is a very very troubling notion today quayle said 
playing on dukakis remark during the debate that people found the 
notion of president quayle to be very troubling 
one debate down howd i do bush told a cheering crowd of 
several thousand wellwishers who turned out for the bushquayle 
rally at an outdoor railroad museum here 
earlier as he left winstonsalem nc bush said his debate 
with dukakis went great especially in seeking to portray his 
democratic rival as a farout liberal 
asked where he thought hed hit dukakis the hardest bush 
replied make him be what he is you cant permit him to be 
something different he promised to persist in preventing the 
massachusetts governor from moving to the ideological center 
on abortion baker said bush would favor criminal penalties for 
those performing illegal abortions but would oppose prosecuting 
women who obtain them 
after stressing strong antiabortion views during the debate he 
said bush decided on further reflection that women who obtain 
abortions should be regarded as additional victims rather than 
criminals 
after thinking about it overnight we went in and discussed it 
this morning and concluded it was an issue that should be addressed 
and we addressed it baker told reporters 
bush told a debate questioner that i havent sorted out the 
penalties he would impose under a constitutional amendment he 
seeks to outlaw abortions 
im for the sanctity of life and once that illegality is 
established then we can come to grips with the penalty side and 
of course theres got to be some penalties to enforce the law 
whatever they may be bush said 
dukakis immediately responded that bush was prepared to brand 
a woman a criminal for making that decision its as simple as 
that 
that exchange left the issue an open question that needed to 
be clarified baker said 
he would not wish to see a woman labeled as a criminal 
notwithstandng his views on the right to life baker said 
women would be seen as an additional victim 
baker said it was the first time bush had dealt with the 
question of penalties choice vs right to life and he has 
dealt with it 
he said bush would have criminal penalties apply only to those 
performing abortions if the procedure became illegal 
the vice presidents campaign chief said bush won the debate 
over dukakis by coming across as warm as human and as likable 
while successfully portraying dukakis as a liberal 
president reagan told reporters he also thought bush won the 
debate i think the vice president was ebullient i think he 
was the one who was stating the facts and the truth 
bush expressed satisfaction after the debate and declared i 
am not going to let this man move to the center and get away from 
his past 
i believe that he will be outstanding bush said during the 
debate 
the vice president told a noisy crowd of 400 to 500 supporters 
at a postdebate rally sunday night that the session with his 
democratic opponent was a good chance to highlight the differences 
between them 
tonight we had a little debate over there at wake forest 
he said it is my firm belief that we had an opportunity to spell 
out my dreams and my objectives and i am not going to let this man 
move to the center and get away from his past bush said 
during the debate bush repeatedly sought to characterize 
dukakis as a liberal 
but unlike many of his aides he did not claim a clear victory 
in the debate however bush gave repeated thumbsup signs to his 
audience of supporters who crowded into a barn at a local 
fairgrounds to shout ring cowbells and cheer for their candidate 
while awaiting the public opinion polls bush aides were quick 
to declare laurels for their man 
i think it was a clear win for the vice president baker 
said he did an extraordinarly good job in our opinion

whereabouts 
the last contact with annie laurie hearin was a letter dated 
aug 10 to her husband robert president of mississippi valley gas 
co hearins worth reportedly exceeds 100 million 
we are working just as hard and intensely at the end of two 
months as we did at the end of two weeks said wayne taylor the 
agent in charge of the fbi in mississippi we are just hoping it 
will be resolved quickly 
the fbi said mrs hearin was abducted sometime between 3 pm 
and 430 pm july 26 small spots of blood were found inside and 
outside the front door of the twostory house in jackson 
a crudely phrased typewritten note left behind instructed hearin

wronged 
the people named in the letter are current or former franchisers

early 1980s claiming the franchisers owed money from operating 
loans materials and filmprocessing fees 
on aug 23 fbi officials announced that hearin had followed the 
instructions and that a total of about 1 million was mailed to the 
12 named in the letter or their survivors on aug 16 the day 
after hearin received a handwritten letter from his wife the note

senate democrats said today that republican 
have effectively killed chances of raising the 335 minimum wage 
this year through a fiveday filibuster 
there is no point in our continuing to pound on their door 
said senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva im now 
conceding that the republican filibuster was successful i regret 
that i would have liked to have seen this bill passed by the 100th 
congress 
the bill by sen edward m kennedy dmass would have raised 
the wage floor which has been at its present level since 1981 to 
375 in january 415 in 1990 and 455 in 1991 
kennedy said it would have directly benefited some 15 million 
workers now paid less than 455 an hour 
i think its a pretty good result said republican leader 
bob dole of kansas this bill couldnt pass the house it wasnt 
going to pass the senate unless it was modified 
senate democrats had attempted twice the last time on friday 
to invoke cloture to end the filibuster both attempts failed 
republicans launched delaying tactics after kennedy used a 
parlimentary maneuver to effectively deny a vote on vice president 
george bushs proposal for a subminimum training wage

mieczyslaw f rakowski selected monday to 
become polands new prime minister is known as an advocate of 
reform but a fierce opponent of the banned solidarity trade union 
a man of peasant origins who rose to become one of polands 
leading journalists and then deputy prime minister the 61yearold 
rakowski joined the ruling communist party politburo dec 15 and 
was put in charge of propaganda 
rakowskis appointment to the politburo represented a political 
comeback after being dropped from the government in 1985 
a protege of polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski rakowski 
became unpopular with leaders of solidarity during the 15 months it 
was legal in 198081 he was in charge of the governments 
committee for trade unions and was the authorities chief 
negotiator with solidarity 
he also played a major role in defending the suppression of the 
union after the introduction of martial law on dec 13 1981 
and in august 1983 he went to the lenin shipyard in gdansk to 
attack solidarity and defend the martiallaw crackdown in a steamy 
meeting in which he was jeered and hooted by workers 
the greyhaired rakowski took off his tie and rolled up his 
shirt sleeves for the televised confrontation but failed to win 
over much of the work force which instead cheered solidarity 
chairman lech walesa 
rakowski became deputy prime minister on feb 12 1981 and held 
the post until his ouster in november 1985 afterwards he held a 
largely ceremonial position as deputy speaker of the sejm or 
parliament 
born to a peasant family in the village of kowalewek near 
bydgoszcz in northwest poland on dec 1 1926 rakowski was a 
teenage laborer during the nazi occupation of poland and served in 
the polish army from the time of the liberation until 1949 
he joined the communist party in 1946 and was a party political 
worker in warsaw from 1949 to 1952 he then attended the institute 
of social sciences in the capital until 1957 
rakowski became editorinchief of the party weekly polityka in 
1958 a post he held until 1982 and gave it a reputation as a 
progressive center within the official press and winning him the 
distrust of conservatives within the party 
in a widely circulated memorandum on polands political 
situation written before his appointment to the politburo rakowski 
backed further democratization and economic reform 
but he urged the party to be more defined in its political 
struggle against solidarity saying the party must make clear its 
ideological goals and defend them 
in the nine months since rakowski took over official propaganda 
the state media has become more open in distributing information 
about the opposition but has been aggressive in attacking 
opposition views 
jamming of western radio stations such as radio free europe has 
ceased but the official media has stepped up rebuttals of reports 
heard on the stations

the grateful deads long strange career took a 
new turn when the 23yearold rock band staged a benefit concert 
for preservation of the worlds tropical rain forests 
a boisterous crowd of colorfully clad deadheads the groups 
legion of devoted fans seemed in shock several times during the 
almost sixhour concert saturday night at packed madison square 
garden 
while the band an icon of the psychedelic 1960s has played 
benefits before they called this show the first act in a lifetime 
commitment to the rain forest issue 
some fans were surpised to hear the dead push a cause 
but a real blow was the labored singing of lead guitarist jerry 
garcia whose ragged cracking voice showed the exhaustion of 
ending a threeweek east coast tour with nine shows in 11 nights in 
new york 
overshadowing those anomalies though was the participation of 
other popular musicians 
bruce hornsby and the range kicked off the show with an 
energetic 75minute set hornsby also joined the dead for a jam on 
not fade away 
former rolling stones guitarist mick taylor accompanied the dead 
for two songs trading leads with garcia on west la fadeaway 
and the blues standard little red rooster 
folksinger suzanne vega also performed 
but the real high point came when daryl hall and john oates came 
on stage bouncing like jumping beans in the midst of the 
alwaysplacid garcia and rhythm guitarist bob weir 
the musicians launched into an energetic everytime you go 
away with oates singing the lead and hall providing falsetto 
accompaniments garcia stood to the side laying down lead runs 
during appropriate intervals but generally looking confused 
marvin gayes whats going on written in the early 70s at 
the height of the ecology movement also got an enthusiastic 
response from the audience 
another highlight was bass player phil leshs enthusiastic 
rendition of the dead classic box of rain 
the group also unveiled a banner from the rafters of the garden 
decorated in the tiedyed colors favored by deadheads and bearing 
the number 25 it represented the 25 shows the band has played in 
the garden the most by any rock group 
for the finale hornsby hall and oates and bass player jack 
casady formerly of jefferson airplane and hot tuna joined in 
good lovin and bob dylans knockin on heavens door 
throughout the night performers and video messages reminded 
patrons who paid up to 250 a seat about the cause 
tropical rain forests are lush jungles located near the equator 
primarily in south and central america africa and southeast asia 
according to the national academy of sciences rain forests cover 7 
percent of the globe and contain 5 million to 30 million species of 
plants animals and insects 
environmentalists and scientists contend that deforestation 
through cattle ranching farming timber harvesting and land 
development contributes to the global warming trend known as the 
greenhouse effect it is caused by increased carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere that traps heat similar to glass in a greenhouse 
scientists say that left unchecked it would melt the polar ice 
caps causing ocean levels to rise 
rain forests absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen through 
photosynthesis 
leaflets distributed at the show urged people to write 
politicians foreign leaders and financial institutions in a plea 
to halt projects that destroy rain forests 
proceeds from the show expected to exceed 600000 were to be 
distributed among environmental groups including the rainforest 
action network cultural survival and greenpeace international

army commander gen michel aoun failed 
monday to win arab recognition for his fledgling christian military 
cabinet in a struggle for power with a rival syrianbacked moslem 
government 
none of three arab envoys who attended a meeting at the 
presidential palace called by aoun apparently made any commitment 
to his christian cabinet while other arab envoys boycotted the 
session 
at the same time syria which supports the rival moslem 
government led by salim hoss stepped up its criticism of aouns 
4dayold threeman cabinet 
syrias rejection of aoun has sharpened sectarian tensions in 
lebanon and threatened to formalize the countrys de facto 
partition into christian and moslem areas carved out during the 
13yearold civil war 
president amin gemayel appointed fellow maronite catholic aoun 
prime minister in a sixman interim military cabinet on thursday 
five minutes before gemayels sixyear term ended parliament 
repeatedly failed to elect a successor to gemayel who was barred 
from seeking a second consecutive term 
hoss a sunni moslem who was acting prime minister under 
genayel insisted that his fiveman cabinet all that was left of a 
fractured national government under gemayel was the legitimate 
authority 
three moslem army officers gemayel named to serve in aouns 
government refused to serve but the general insisted his cabinet 
had legally inherited gemayels powers and constituted lebanons 
legitimate government 
gemayels action in naming aoun violated an unwritten convenant 
dating from lebanons independence in 1943 under which the 
president must be a maronite the premier a sunni and the 
parliament speaker a shiite moslem 
the only envoys to respond to aouns call for a meeting monday

four mines have been 
discovered in the northern persian gulf recently and us naval 
officers say shipping will be endangered if rough winter weather 
rips more mines from their moorings 
us navy officers said monday that three of the mines were 
spotted drifting on the surface after breaking loose from their 
seabed anchors 
as winter approaches the waters in the northern gulf get a 
lot rougher and thats when the anchored mines are more likely to 
break away theyre also harder to spot said one officer 
were very concerned that the situation is going to get worse in 
the immediate future 
the warning was issued as this 3600ton missile frigate arrived 
off kuwait escorting what us military sources said could be the 
nexttolast convoy of usflagged kuwaiti tankers to be protected 
by american warships 
the white house announced president reagan has decided to end 
the tight escort of vessels opting instead for 
accompanying them with warships posted along the way to provide 
any assistance needed 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan acted 
after reviewing the ceasefire between iran and iraq which 
began aug 20 and consulting with allies and friends in the 
region 
aboard air force one en route to new york where reagan later 
addressed the un general assembly fitzwater said us ships 
would still take appropriate action if americanflagged ships are 
directly threatened 
administration officials said last week they are considering the 
zone defense plan citing reduced gulf tensions and prospects 
for a us force cutback of at least one ship the united states 
has 26 warships in the region 16 in the gulf 
the military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
a convoy scheduled to leave kuwait on tuesday would likely be the 
last escorted the entire 550mile voyage through the gulf the 
vandegrift was designated as escort for the 81283ton oil products 
carrier surf city 
the navy has been escorting 11 kuwaiti tankers reflagged with 
the stars and stripes since july 1987 to protect them from iranian 
attack 
mondays convoy the 67th this year and the 89th since 
operation earnest will began brought the 294739ton tanker 
townsend up the gulf to kuwait a second tanker the usowned 
overseas valdez dropped off at bahrain 
as they neared kuwait early monday the vandegrift and its 
massive charge sailed through waters where the missile frigate 
taylor a sister ship of the vandegrift spotted a floating mine 
saturday it was destroyed by navy divers 
a kuwaiti cargo vessel reported a similar discovery friday near 
hout island 40 miles northwest of the taylor sighting 
the officers said a us minesweepers sonar located a mine aug 
19 on the seabed in a mine danger area near iranowned farsi 
island where dozens of mines had been cleared earlier 
a day earlier the vandegrift was patrolling near two secret 
us navy barges in the same area when bridge lookouts spotted a 
mine bobbing 100 yards off the port side 
us officers said all the mines were 500pound m08 contact 
devices that iran is known to have sown widely and each was safely 
disposed of 
all were covered with marine growth indicating they had been in 
the water for some time the officers noted 
capt jim miller commodore of the us minesweeping force 
in the gulf estimated two months ago that despite the recovery of 
scores of mines a couple of hundred remain mostly in northern 
waters near iraq and mostly laid by the iranians

its not a sign of the times 
so the illuminated likeness of pioneer topless dancer carol doda 
will be coming down from its perch above the condor club which 
will become a sports bar or comedy club under new ownership 
the topless craze began at the club 24 years ago when doda 
donned a topless bathing suit and climbed atop the clubs piano 
she was featured at the broadway nightspot until two years ago 
broadway once jammed with barkers for numerous skin shows has 
been moving upscale during the past few years in december 1987 
the condor was sold by owner david benson to tex norton who tried 
to switch from topless entertainment to a familyoriented barbary 
coast review but the new show never caught on benson bought the 
club back a few months later and brought back topless 
the club now has been sold to timothy chee david seto and 
shacuan seto 
they want to put something in there that will make money that 
the city will like and that will upgrade the street said a 
spokesman for the partners they havent made up their minds 
whether it will be a nightclub or a sports bar 
the 40foot female form now on the sign will be replaced with a 
mural of sports figures or a picture of entertainers who have 
performed in the area

six to seven dozen wild horses have 
been shot dead in an isolated stretch of central nevada the 
federal bureau of land management confirmed monday 
in addition to the remains of 73 animals found last week blm 
investigators have turned up a dozen more carcasses of wild horses 
along with spent bullets and other evidence said bureau 
spokeswoman maxine shane 
she said the bureau hasnt determined exactly how many horses 
have been killed because a few of the original 73 remains spotted 
by helicopter turned out to be cattle that died of natural causes 
the carcasses and bones are strewn along an area one to two 
miles wide and about eight miles long the blm has said the horses 
apparently were shot over a sixmonth period starting about a year 
ago 
the remote area includes canyons and rolling benchland about 30 
miles north of the tiny central nevada town of austin and about 15 
miles west of the highway linking austin with battle mountain 
the blm was tipped by a person who was questioned about an 
earlier rifle slaughter of 41 horses whose remains were discovered 
30 miles away in august the bureau did not identify the person 
more than 38000 wild horses now run the open range in 10 
western states nevadas herds are the largest with estimates of 
up to 28000 horses roaming the state

economists from major us corporations are 
predicting the economy will slow next year bad news for 
presidential candidates george bush and michael dukakis who are 
both counting on strong growth to help them reduce the federal 
budget deficit 
a panel of 60 economists from the national association of 
business economists are bullish about growth this year predicting 
an expansion of 39 percent as measured by the gross national 
product thats even more optimistic than the administrations 
forecast of 35 percent 
however the median forecast for next year is an anemic 23 
percent substantially less than the administration forecast of 31 
percent 
nearly half of the economists 47 percent said in a survey in 
late august and early september that they expect the country to 
topple into a recession by the end of next year another 42 percent 
believe a recession will occur in 1990 only 11 percent believe the 
sixyearold economic expansion will continue into 1991 or later 
thats slightly more optimistic than a similar survey in may 
when 57 percent said the recession would come in 1989 
for business economists a group often accused of an inability 
to reach agreement on anything the fact that 90 percent expect 
an economic downturn during the next two years is noteworthy 
said jay n woodworth an economist with bankers trust co and 
incoming president of the association which is holding its 30th 
annual meeting in pittsburgh this week 
republicans are looking for strong growth the rest of this year 
to boost bush into the presidency and the economists are 
optimistic hell win they boosted their projection from 29 
percent in may to 39 percent even though the summer drought is 
expected to knock a full percentage point off gnp growth 
fiftythree percent of a larger panel of 300 association members 
believes bush will win while 37 percent think dukakis the 
democrat will be elected a more lopsided majority 62 percent vs 
22 percent believe bushs policies would better maintain stable 
growth and moderate inflation 
however the economists who identified the budget deficit as 
the no 1 economic problem facing the next president were 
pessimistic that either candidate will be able to accomplish much 
on the deficit 
bush who has vowed not to raise taxes and has proposed a tax 
cut for capital gains said on a nationally televised debate sunday 
night that hell whittle the deficit with a flexible freeze 
that will permit the president to cut spending in some programs 
dukakis who says he will turn to a tax increase only as last 
resort said at the debate that he will get tougher with tax 
cheats cut some military programs and encourage growth 
however by a 3to1 margin the 300member economists panel 
predicted no major deficit reduction package would be enacted in 
1989 
a majority 51 percent said there would be no great difference 
between a bush and a dukakis administration in the chances of a 
package being adopted twentyeight percent said they believed 
dukakis would have a better chance versus 20 percent who said 
bush that probably reflects an assumption that dukakis would find 
it easier to work with a democratic congress 
the median deficit projection for next year was 150 billion 
about the same as last years budget gap and the deficit expected 
in fiscal year 1988 
other economic policy priorities listed in order of importance 
after shrinking the budget deficit were completing the free trade 
agreement with canada speeding up productivity growth encouraging 
personal savings and stimulating business investment 
near the bottom of the economists list was curbing hostile 
corporate takeovers discouraging corporate debt accumulation 
increasing antitrust law enforcement reforming securities laws to 
prevent another stock market crash and changing federal law to 
allow banks to enter the securities industries 
in other predictions the 60member panel said 
inflation as measured by the consumer price index will kick up 
from a projected 45 percent this year to 51 percent next year 
the administration is looking for inflation of 39 percent in 1989 
interest rates both short and longterm should rise a full 
percentage point by mid1989 and then start to decline 
the merchandise trade deficit of 170 billion in 1987 will 
shrink to 135 billion this year and 120 billion next year 
sixtytwo percent believe the value of the dollar which has 
rebounded somewhat over the past six months will remain stable 
this year and 55 percent believe it will slip next year

the oct 5 presidential referendum in chile will 
occur in a political climate dominated by fear as the military 
continues a successful strategy of using torture to control people 
a study of the country concludes 
the report sowing fear the uses of torture and psychological 
abuse in chile is based on a fouryear investigation by the 
boston areabased physicians for human rights 
the organization claims that an atmosphere of terror has been 
accelerated in chile by the emergence of paramilitary vigilante 
squads which are responsible for kidnappings rape torture and 
murders 
in the referendum voters will determine whether to elect 
general augusto pinochet to eight more years as president or to 
have an open election in a year pinochet came to power after the 
military overthrew the socialist government of president salvador 
allende in 1973 
lets not be deceived by elections in chile its a country 
gripped by fear said jonathan fine the executive director of 
the 1000member group and one of the physicians who interviewed 
alleged torture victims 
in chile you find a carefully planned program of state terror 
a scientific approach to intimidation designed so the country will 
be paralyzed by fear and wont go against the government fine 
said 
two other human rights reports released early this year said 
chiles human rights situation was improving but some repression 
continued 
amnesty international said in an 18page report that the number 
of disappearances has dropped sharply since 1977 but has not 
stopped completely a united nations report said human rights 
violations including torture continue in chile but the overall 
situation is improving 
more than 700 people have disappeared during pinochets rule 
most of them in a wave of repression following the 1973 coup 
according to international and local human rights groups 
the physicians report said in many instances entire communities 
have been intimidated and terrorized by state security agencies 
the primary targets are usually the poor social and political 
activists and those involved in human rights issues 
the report includes graphically detailed case histories of 
alleged torture victims information gathered during seven trips to 
chile made by the organization from 1984 to 1988 where more than 
100 such people were interviewed 
most of those who said they were tortured were kidnapped and 
subjected to brutal treatment including the use of electric 
current on the the genital area beatings threats sleep 
deprivation and rape and sexual violation 
the most frequently reported psychological torture according to 
the report involves threats to family and friends the forced 
presence of friends and close relatives during torture sessions and 
interrogation while blindfolded and nude 
central nacional de informaciones chiles secret police is 
believed reponsible for the bulk of the terrorism and tortures

wounded 67 in the occupied lands on monday hospital officials 
said and a un agency claimed the army was resorting to gunfire 
too often to quell the unrest 
there is a clear trend of a growing use of live ammunition 
that cannot be justified said a senior official of the un 
relief and works agency our concern is very real this is not 
just a kneejerk reaction to a bad day 
the israeli army rejected the criticism 
the number of palestinians wounded monday was the second highest 
since the dec 8 start of the uprising against israels occupation 
of the west bank and gaza strip as many as 90 palestinians were 
wounded during protests against the april 16 assassination of plo

figures for the west bank were being compiled the un agency 
which aids palestinian refugees filed a complaint with the army 
the official said 
he also blamed the growing casualty toll to the armys 
introduction in august of plastic bullets which penetrate the body 
like live ammunition but generally are not fatal unless fired from 
less than 60 feet 
an army spokesman col raanan gissin rejected the un agency 
complaint and blamed the increase in casualties on more violent 
palestinian protests not more liberal use of gunfire he also said 
plastic bullets served as a deterrent while avoiding fatal injuries 
in clashes in the jabal mukaber district in arab east jerusalem 
riot police fatally shot 19yearold jamal mattar in the mouth 
said officials at the citys mukassed hospital he was the first 
palestinian reported killed in jerusalem during the uprising 
police spokesman rafi levy said the death was under 
investigation initial reports showed police fired only tear gas 
and rubber bullets not live ammunition levy said 
an israeli photographer said he heard several shots and minutes 
later saw six masked palestinians carry mattar to a car one of the 
youths held mattars arm with one hand and flashed a victory sign 
with the other 
about 4000 people attended mattars funeral chanting palestine 
liberation organization slogans and waving outlawed palestinian 
flags police fired dozens of tear gas canisters into the crowd 
witnesses said 
in gaza city troops fatally shot 27yearold jihad zanoun in 
the chest during a stonethrowing protest hospital officials said

bodyguards the joint operations command said the shooting occurred 
in kuliyapitiya 40 miles northeast of colombo 
jayatilleke 64 served as education minister and as minister of 
rehabilitation and reconstruction 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the killing 
military officials who requested anonymity said they suspected 
the peoples liberation front a sinhalese extremist group that has 
vowed to kill anyone who supports a july 1987 accord aimed at 
ending the ethnic dispute that was wracked the islands north and 
east 
members of the front have been accused of trying to assassinate 
president junius r jayewardene in august 1987

education since july 1977 
last year he was appointed minister of rehabilitation and 
reconstruction and assigned to reopen schools and restore civil

million people they claim they have been denied jobs and military 
appointments by the predominantly buddhist sinhalese who make up 
75 percent of the population and control the government 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the most militant group 
briefly accepted the accord but later reneged claiming it failed 
to meet enough demands 
militant sinhalese also claim the accord makes too many 
concessions they have been blamed for 450 killings including 
government and security personnel 
india became involved in the conflict because 60 million tamils 
living in southern india are sympathetic to the rebel cause an 
estimated 47000 indian troops have been stationed on the island 
trying to enforce the accord 
about 8500 people have died in the fighting including at least

yugoslavias official youth union on 
monday blamed the political system of this crisisridden communist 
country for ethnic clashes and warned the conflict could develop 
into a civil war 
a top communist party official resigned to protest the mass 
rallies by serb nationalists against ethnic albanians in the poor 
southern province of kosovo the socialist youth union in a 
statement addressed to the yugoslav people and carried by the state 
tanjug news agency blamed the almost totally inefficient 
political system for a situation which is closer to fratricidal 
war than progressive solution of the problems 
the youth union also called on officials to battle yugoslavias 
economic and social collapse through free elections and a 
openmarket economy 
in addition to increasing ethnic tensions yugoslavia is 
battling a 200 percent annual inflation rate a 21 billion foreign 
debt a 15 percent unemployment rate and increasing labor unrest 
the current situation in the country is characterized by fears 
of violence poverty and hopelessness the statement said 
in kosovo the moslem albanians form 90 percent of the 2 million 
population and are fighting to win a greater voice in governing 
their autonomous province now administered by the republic of 
serbia the christian slavs formed by serbs and montenegrins 
claim they are the victims of albanian arson and street attacks 
are calling on serbia to completely absorb the province 
franc setinc a member of the ruling communist party presidium 
resigned monday over recent rallies by tens of thousands of slavs 
who have chanted demands for arms to fight the albanians 
serbian party boss slobodan milosevic backed the protests and 
demanded tough measures against albanian separatists who are 
demanding their own republic free of the 200000 slav minority 
in a resignation letter sent to tanjug setinc said he is 
concerned by slogans we want arms and the like that call for a 
blaze in kosovo and all of yugoslavia 
we are doing little to stop the insanity that is driving 
us into catastrophe added setinc one of the highest officials 
to resign since the communists came to power after world war ii 
milosevic has denounced setinc and several other communist 
officials at the rallies and his supporters claim nonserbian 
officials have prevented action to stop ethnic strife in kosovo 
i am afraid of people who manipulate with hardships and 
emotions of serbs and montenegrins in kosovo setinc said in an 
apparent reference to milosevic and other serbian leaders 
yugoslavias leaders say the rallies could imperil the fragile 
ethnic balance in this nation that stretches from austria to 
greece or even lead to civil war 
the animosity in kosovo exacerbated by the rallies is now so 
high that many residents believe a military crackdown will come 
within months or even weeks police in armored personnel carriers 
have been sent to the province by the federal government in 
belgrade 
in pristina the capital of kosovo about 2000 slav 
schoolchildren continued to boycott their classes monday to protest 
alleged harassment by ethnic albanian classmates sources said 
the elementary and high school students have not attended 
classes since thursday when they staged a street protest the 
students who belong to serb and montenegrin minorities also 
marched friday 
they apparently were kept at home monday by parents fearing 
possible confrontations with ethnic albanians according to the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the slav students say they will not return to classes until a 
meeting of the communist party central committee in early october 
results in decisive action against the albanians

a oneton leatherback turtle found washed 
up dead on a welsh beach could be the largest of its species ever 
recorded the national museum of wales said monday 
it appears to be a world record said peter morgan keeper 
of zoology at the museum in cardiff south wales 
we had to weigh it on a crane and it scaled 2000 pounds it 
is 8 feet long from its head to the end of its tail and nearly 10 
feet wide measured across the flippers i doubt whether they grow 
much bigger morgan said 
there are earlier reports of leatherbacks approaching this 
size but this seems to be the heaviest recorded he said 
the turtle found thursday on harlech beach in cardigan bay 
northwest wales was driven to cardiff by a nature warden where it 
was put in the museums deep freeze 
morgan said reports of leatherbacks in welsh waters were very 
rare and all were females this one was a male and was thought to 
have come from the caribbean 
they live in the tropics and feed on jellyfish and as we have 
had lots of jellyfish in welsh waters this year it probably was 
pursuing them he said 
morgan said that while most stranded turtles are injured in 
collisions with ships this turtle had not been injured before it 
died at sea from an unknown cause weve done an autopsy and 
tests on its parasites like barnacles should show where it came 
from he said

president reagan departed from a generally 
conciliatory speech monday to deliver a tonguelashing to a handful 
of nations for abusing human rights singling out the soviet union 
and others 
reagan declared that the regard for human rights as the 
foundation of peace is at the heart of the united nations 
those who starve in ethiopia those who die among the kurds 
those who face racial injustice in south africa those who still 
cannot write or speak freely in the soviet union those who cannot 
worship in the ukraine those who struggle for life and freedom on 
boats in the south china sea those who cannot publish or assemble 
in managua all of this is more than just an agenda item on your 
calendar reagan told the delegates from 159 nations 
it must be a first concern an issue above others said 
reagan 
reagans farewell address to the general assembly drew about a 
minute of applause but no standing ovation except among members of 
the us delegation 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze sat stonyfaced 
during reagans criticism he left afterward by a private exit and 
offered no comment to reporters 
reagans south china sea reference was to refugees fleeing 
vietnam and his mention of kurds was prompted by allegations iraq 
has used poison gas to crush a rebellion by its kurdish minority 
of cuba reagan said for years cuba a blatant violator of 
its citizens human rights has escaped united nations censure or 
even scrutiny 
reagan said the united states prompted the un human rights 
commission to examine havanas human rights policies 
fidel castro has already begun to free some political 
prisoners improve prison conditions and tolerate the existence of 
a small independent national human rights group he said 
few foreign officials had comment on reagans attacks but 
nicaraguas deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco said 
reagan singled out his country out of frustration because he 
accepts that his policy is a total failure the policy of 
paying mercenaries this policy of eight years of war 
washington supports the rebels known as contras in the civil 
war against the leftist sandinista government 
clovis maksoud the permanent observer of the league of arab 
states has said previously there is no evidence iraq used chemical 
weapons against the kurds maksoud also has criticized washington 
for allegedly bowing to zionist pressures 
maksoud did question reagans failure to mention the palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
and the political standoff between christians and moslems in 
lebanon 
the united nations itself may have had the keenest interest in 
reagans speech in previous years reagan has lambasted the 
organization for alleged overspending antiwestern bias and a 
bloated bureaucracy 
washington began withholding part of its un dues to spur 
reform and by this fall the united states was more than 530 
million in arrears 
on sept 13 reagan announced he was satisfied with the uns 
reforms and the united states began paying its back dues 
that eliminates the threat of insolvency said a un 
official speaking on condition of anonymity the united nations 
would have run out of funds for its payroll rents and other fixed 
expenses by late october

ozone depletion by chlorofluorocarbon 
compounds could be even worse than previously thought the 
environmental protection agency said monday in urging a stepped up 
attack on cfc use worldwide 
separately the major trade association of producers and users 
of cfcs said for the first time the world should aim at phasing 
out cfcs to the maximum extent feasible 
the depletion that has already occurred calls into question 
our earlier projections of future damage epa administrator lee 
m thomas said in releasing a new assessment of future 
concentrations of chlorine in the atmosphere 
regretfully our new analysis predicts an even worse scenario 
than anticipated 
thomas call for ending all cfc use was a switch from his 
position that there was plenty of time for participants in last 
years treaty to decide what if any further steps were necessary 
that treaty signed by 45 major nations pledges signatories to 
a 50 percent cut in cfc production in 1998 
thomas has been urging the united nations environment program to 
accelerate the scientific review called for by the treaty and an 
informal review will convene in the hague next month 
environmentalists who have been calling for an end to cfc use 
for months hailed epas announcement 
it underlines the seriousness of the emergency we are 
facing said david doniger of the natural resources defense 
council this kind of report will have a lot of impact on major 
producing countries in europe 
were glad to see theyve come around to our way of 
thinking said liz cook of friends of the earth 
the cfc compounds are widely used as refrigeration fluids 
solvents and foam blowing agents and outside the united states as 
aerosol propellants related bromine compounds are used in fire 
extinguishers some of them can last for more than a century 
rising to the stratosphere where they eventually break down to 
liberate chlorine 
a major study of ozone by the national aeronautics and space 
administration in march found ozone depletion of a few percent at 
midlatitudes and attributed it to chlorine 
the nasa panels work prompted some major producers of cfc 
compounds to announce their intention to develop harmless 
substitutes 
the trade group the alliance for a responsible cfc policy said 
its new recommendation grew out of the nasa report 
up to now epa has estimated that it would take an 85 percent 
reduction in one of the major cfc compounds to keep chlorine from 
growing but this estimate did not include lowpotency cfc 
compounds outside the treaty and noncfc sources of chlorine 
notably methyl chloroform the most widely used industrial solvent 
the report focused on chlorine concentrations to avoid the 
uncertainties of trying to predict ozone depletion any increase in 
chlorine and bromine increases the risk of ozone depletion epa 
said 
john hoffman coauthor of the report said you ask the 
atmospheric chemists for a prediction of ozone and they wont 
give you one because their computer models failed to predict the 
ozone depletion that has occurred so far spectacularly so for the 
annual hole over antarctica that sees ozone decline by half 
every september 
currently average chlorine in the stratosphere is about 27 
parts per billion 
this concentration would triple or double by 2075 depending on 
whether methyl chloroform use increases or not even if the entire 
world abides by last years treaty epa found 
an immediate 100 percent reduction in the use of all the most 
powerful compounds and a freeze in methyl chloroform would be 
needed to stabilize chlorine epa said immediate means 1990 
and the actions would have to cover all countries 
the most likely restrictions necessary for stability would 
call for conservative use of lowpotency replacement compounds 
epa said if one pound of these compounds were used for every five 
pounds of major compounds given up the world could increase use of 
the substitute compounds by 4 percent per year 
this would keep chlorine concentration at about 1985 levels in 
2060 and hold the increase by 2100 to less than 1 ppb epa said 
in fact delaying a full phaseout from 1998 to 2008 increases 
the maximum chlorine level by about 07 ppb and delays the decline 
back to 1985 levels by about 70 years epa said

a judge ruled monday that one of two indian 
activists accused of taking hostages in a newspaper office could 
act as his own lawyer after the man refused representation by 
anyone other than william kunstler 
eddie hatcher 31 and timothy jacobs 20 are charged with 
taking hostages and possessing illegal firearms they have never 
denied that they walked into the robesonian newspaper office feb 1 
in lumberton chained the door and held up to 20 people for 10 
hours saying they were trying to expose local corruption 
before jury selection started hatcher insisted he would be 
represented by no one but kunstler and that the trial should be 
delayed until kunstler finished a trial in new york 
but us district judge terrence boyle had warned hatcher when 
he granted a third delay in the case aug 1 that he did not intend 
to continue the case again he said then another lawyer should be 
prepared to begin the trial if kunstler was not present 
boyle denied hatchers renewed request for a delay monday and 
then asked hatcher if he wanted to fire his local attorney barry 
nakell a law professor at the university of north carolina at 
chapel hill if you want him to stay and try this case ill 
force him to stay boyle said 
hatcher replied bill kunstler is my attorney and i feel like 
im being forced to make this decision and my constitutional 
rights are being violated 
nakel withdrew as hatchers attorney and boyle then called 
stephanie moore an associate of kunstler to the front of the 
courtroom and asked hatcher if he would accept her as his trial 
attorney 
but hatcher continued to repeat that kunstler was his attorney 
well hes not here boyle said will you take ms moore 
bill kunstler is my attorney said hatcher 
his answer for the record is no boyle said adding that 
hatcher had chosen to defend himself 
no your honor i have had that decision forced on me against 
my constitutional rights hatcher said 
when boyle told the attorneys to introduce themselves to 28 
prospective jurors hatcher stood up and said your honor i am 
not allowed to have my chosen counsel present so i do not have 
anything to say to the jury 
several prospective jurors said they believed the defendants 
were guilty four said theyd never heard of the case 
in a country which consistently insists that criminal 
defendants are entitled to counsel of their choice it is a 
disgrace for a federal judge sworn to uphold the constitution to 
deny this right to anyone and particularly a native american who 
faces a potential punishment of life in prison kunstler said in 
a statement issued from his new york office 
hatcher and jacobs claim membership in the tuscarora tribe an 
indian faction affiliated with the lumbee tribe in southeastern 
north carolina 
hatcher and jacobs have said they committed the act to draw 
attention to allegations of drug trafficking and corruption in the 
county the 10hour siege at the newspaper ended after gov jim 
martin agreed to form a state task force to investigate their 
corruption charges 
but hatcher and jacobs met only once with the task force which 
issued a preliminary report saying it had found little evidence to 
back up their charges hatcher jacobs and their supporters said 
the task force did not do a thorough investigation and that 
potential witnesses would not testify without federal and state 
immunity 
hatcher disappeared aug 31 after a federal appeals court 
revoked his bond jacobs surrendered to marshals in asheville the 
same day hatcher was arrested at raleighdurham airport one week 
ago when he stepped off a plane with a kunstler associate

prosecutors described homosexual 
violence necrophilia and mutilation monday when opening statements 
began in the trial of a man accused of killing 16 young males 
prosecutor bryan brown portrayed randy kraft a former long 
beach computer programmer as one who prowled the highways of 
orange county picking up young male hitchhikers plying them with 
valium and beer strangling then sodomizing them and sometimes 
dumping their bodies from a moving car 
kraft had a fetish for collecting mementos of victims and 
photographs the prosecutor said describing photos in which 
victims apparently were posed while dead 
if kraft 43 is found guilty in the 16 killings which would 
make him eligible for the death penalty prosecutors plan to 
produce evidence at his sentencing that they say links him to 21 
other slayings in southern california oregon and michigan 
prosecutors say the death total may be as high as 60 
opening statements in the trial expected to last a year began 
five years and four months after kraft was arrested by a highway 
patrol officer who pulled him over for a routine traffic stop and 
discovered a dying marine on the seat next to him 
brown gave the jury gruesome details of the killings which took 
place over 11 years 
the victims were bound with shoelaces and strangled often with 
their own belts brown said one victim was beheaded and at least 
one was sexually mutilated with a knife the prosecutor said 
defense attorney c thomas mcdonald responded to the 
prosecutors twohour speech with 10 minutes of opening statements 
warning jurors against being swayed by vivid descriptions of the 
killings 
these are tactics designed to inflame you mcdonald said 
this is a tactical decision made by the prosecutor he wont be 
able to prove it this case is based on suspicion innuendo and 
prosecutorial rhetoric 
mr kraft killed no one mcdonald said 
defense attorneys lost two rounds in pretrial motions when 
orange county judge donald a mccartin denied a request to move the 
trial to another community and refused to bar some entries from a 
list prosecutors have called a scorecard of krafts alleged 
victims 
kraft has pleaded innocent to 16 counts of firstdegree murder 
for slayings that occurred between december 1972 and may 1983 
when he was arrested police said they found 47 color 
photographs of young men many of them nude and apparently dead 
they also found a notebook with more than 60 notations which 
prosecutors have called a death list for all the murders 
allegedly committed by kraft 
last week mccartin allowed 13 entries on the list to be 
admitted as evidence prosecutors said the entries pertain to 14 
killings in which kraft is charged

the soninlaw of the late soviet president leonid 
i brezhnev testified at his corruption trial monday that he kept a 
160000 bribe because it would have been too awkward to return 
tass reported 
yuri churbanov the first deputy interior minister before 
brezhnev died in 1982 took the witness stand for the first time at 
his trial before a military tribunal the proceedings are in their 
fourth week 
churbanov 51 is being tried with eight others in a case that 
is expected to last another month he is charged with accepting 
hundreds of thousands of rubles in bribes from officials in the 
republic of uzbekistan and could be sentenced to death by firing 
squad 
tass the official soviet news agency said churbanov testified 
that an uzbekistan communist party official named umarov delivered 
a briefcase to his hotel room once telling him it was a present 
from uzbekistan party leader sharaf rashidov 
when if opened it i found 100000 or 130000 rubles tass 
quoted churbanov as saying i wanted to return the money but to 
whom umarov left and i felt awkward approaching rashidov 
i was told that that was a a gift and looked on it as a 
gift tass quoted churbanov as saying 
at the official rate of exchange 100000 rubles is about 
160000 
rashidov who died in 1983 was a close associate of brezhnev 
since rashidovs death several key uzbekistan officials have been 
charged with corruption that occurred during his rule and two have 
been executed 
churbanov married brezhnevs daughter galina and worked in the 
interior ministry under brezhnevs close associate nikolai 
shchelokov 
he pleaded guilty to abusing his office but innocent to 
accepting bribes 
tass said churbanov also testified that interior ministry 
officials misled him into believing it was legal for him to use 
ministry resources to build a cellar for his country house 
naturally when such explanations came from the former first 
deputy minister of internal affairs whose job it was to know the 
law the audience could not help smiling tass said 
churbanovs trial is the centerpiece of a campaign against the 
legacy of brezhnev whose 18year rule now is characterized in the 
soviet union as a time of corruption and stagnation

a lastminute settlement in a 
family feud over the 350 million trust left by auto magnate henry 
ford ii broke down in court monday 
the hearing before palm beach circuit judge vaughn rudnick 
pitted fords widow kathleen duross ford against the late 
automakers son edsel ford ii and other family members as well as 
trustee william donaldson 
mrs ford had complained that donaldson an ally of edsel ford 
was demanding a 1 millionayear salary to administer the trust 
and that he had threatened to cut her income to the minimum level 
of 15 million 
early monday morning 14 attorneys for both sides hammered out a 
compromise that was to remain secret 
robert montgomery one of four attorneys representing mrs ford 
said only that under the settlement donaldson would remain a 
trustee a new lawyer would be appointed as the trusts attorney 
and a financial advisor would be appointed 
but a question over whether a legal guardian should be appointed 
for fords minor grandchildren created a furor and the whole 
settlement collapsed 
ford who died last year took control of ford motor co in 1945 
from his frail and failing grandfather auto pioneer henry ford 
he named mrs ford as sole beneficiary of his trust but 
stipulated that upon her death his six grandchildren would become 
the beneficiaries 
he named three people to manage the trust mrs ford edsel 
ford and family friend martin citrin in april citrin killed 
himself 
fords choice for an alternate trustee was donaldson 57 an 
investment banker former undersecretary of state and founder of 
the yale graduate school of organization and management 
citing his expertise donaldson requested a 1 million yearly 
salary for managing the trust mrs ford said his request amounted 
to extortion and sued to have him removed 
mrs fords income is more than 10 million a year an attorney 
said 
on wednesday a judge will hear a motion to dismiss the 54 
million claim on the estate brought by cristina ford who ford 
divorced in 1980 before he married kathleen duross later that year 
the divorce settlement left her with 100000 in quarterly 
payments for 20 years she contends that since ford died the 
payments stopped and has sued for the full 20year amount

senate democrats gave up monday on trying to 
raise the 335 minimum this year conceding they lacked the 60 
votes needed to break a republicanled filibuster 
there is no point in our continuing to pound on their door 
senate majority leader robert c byrd wva said im now 
conceding that the republican filibuster was successful i regret 
that i would have liked to have seen this bill passed by the 100th 
congress 
byrds announcement meant there would be no vote on the bill 
this year 
the bill by sen edward m kennedy dmass would have raised 
the wage floor which has been stuck at its present level since 
1981 to 375 in january 415 in 1990 and 455 in 1991 
while some 47 million americans are now paid the minimum wage 
or less the bills supporters claimed it would have directly 
benefited 15 million workers now paid less than 455 an hour 
i think its a pretty good result said republican leader 
bob dole of kansas this bill couldnt pass the house it wasnt 
going to pass the senate unless it was modified 
the legislation had been the center of a partisan power struggle 
since it was introduced on the senate floor on sept 15 
republicans immediately tried to amend it to include a 90day 
80 percent subminimum wage that was demanded by the white house and 
advocated by vice president george bush as a condition for raising 
the basic floor 
kennedy balked using parliamentary tactics to effectively 
preclude the socalled training wage no training was required by 
companies that would pay the lower wage from ever getting a 
yeaornay vote republicans then immediately launched their 
filibuster 
democrats tried twice last week to break the filibuster but fell 
seven votes and then four votes short even though they had the 
support of eight republicans on the last attempt friday 
kennedy called the training wage proposal a blatant attempt to 
turn back any consideration for an increase he said it only 
would have encouraged employers to hire new workers at the 
subminimum and then fire them 90 days later to be replaced by a new 
group of workers that could be paid the lower amount 
however sen orrin hatch rutah the leader of the floor 
opposition to the bill said a compromise increase could have been 
worked out if only democrats had been willing to establish some 
form of broad subminimum 
the real reason this is being pulled down is that the senator 
from massachusetts knows we were on the very edge of passing the 
training wage hatch said the fact is that the international 
trade union movement in this country will not accept a training 
wage they consider the minimum wage as their single idea 
republicans had filed a total of 158 amendments and kennedy had 
answered each one with an amendment of his own to enable democrats 
to retain control of the legislation 
byrd and kennedy immediately tried to put the blame for the 
bills demise on vice president and republican presidential 
candidate george bush the vice president had said in the past 
three weeks that he could support a modest increase in the minimum 
wage never specifying how much but only if it was coupled with 
a subminimum floor 
perhaps the word from the vice presidents campaign had not 
gotten through byrd said perhaps it has gotten through 
either way the results are evident some 15 million workers are the 
loser 
the aflcio which has endorsed democrat michael dukakis also 
sought to put the blame on bush 
although vice president bush claimed he favored an increase 
he never specified the terms of his proposal and he never urged 
republicans to end their filibuster said the labor federations 
president lane kirkland 
the us chamber of commerce the most vigorous opponent of the 
increase said the legislations defeat reflects a growing 
understanding that mandated pay hikes and other benefits ultimately 
cause more harm than good 
hundreds of thousands of jobs were saved today by members of 
the senate fighting for progrowth economic policies said bob 
martin director of employee relations policies for the chamber 
todays action will not only keep jobs in america but will keep 
inflation in check and help our competitiveness economically

george bush backpedaled monday from his debate 
suggestion that he might favor criminal penalties for women who 
undergo abortions 
his campaign manager james a baker iii told reporters in 
winstonsalem nc that bush has thought the issue through and 
decided women are additional victims and should not be punished 
for undergoing abortions 
but bush still believes in the possibility of punishment as 
far as the abortionist is concerned baker said 
the head of a prochoice group said bushs remarks had 
horrified many women an antiabortion leader called the issue 
a red herring and said no one envisions jailing women who get 
abortions 
bush who favors a constitutional ban on most abortions was 
asked sunday night if women and doctors who defied a ban on 
abortion should go to jail 
i havent sorted out the penalties bush replied im for 
the sanctity of life and once that illegality is established then 
we can come to grips with the penalty side and of course theres 
got to be some penalties to enforce the law 
bush himself told reporters later monday in jackson tenn 
there was no change in his stance 
he horrified women last night said kate michelman 
executive director of the national abortion rights action league 
if he believes that abortion is murder this business of saying 
women are the second victims is hypocritical 
what he advocates is a policy of forced childbirth for every 
women who gets pregnant she said the result would be that 
women would be forced to seek backalley medically unsafe 
abortions as we did before 1973 women would have to risk their 
lives and be butchered once again 
douglas johnson legislative director for the national right to 
life committee said that neither his group nor others want to send 
women who seek abortions to jail he called that a nonissue a 
red herring 
but we do think the doctors who profit from killing unborn 
children should be punished including loss of their licenses he 
added 
democrat michael dukakis seized upon bushs comment during their 
debate saying hes prepared to brand a woman a criminal for 
making this choice 
dukakis said he does not favor abortion but believes it has 
to be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious 
beliefs that makes that decision as governor of massachusetts 
he has vetoed bills that sought to restrict funding of abortions 
for poor women 
baker in explaining his clarification of bushs position said 
after thinking about it overnight we went in and discussed it 
this morning and concluded it was an issue that should be addressed 
and we addressed it 
frankly he thinks that a woman in a situation like that would 
be more properly considered an additional victim perhaps the 
second victim and that she would need help and love and not 
punishment baker said 
susan estrich dukakis campaign manager said bush has altered 
his stance on abortion four times the nation needs a decisive 
president not someone who will change his mind after an 
overnight meeting with his pollsters estrich said 
she said the constitutional amendment to ban abortion that bush 
now favors after opposing it in 1980 before becoming ronald 
reagans running mate would leave states free to impose 
criminal penalties on women who have abortions 
bush opposes abortions except to save the mothers life or in 
cases of rape or incest he supports government funding of 
abortions only to save the mothers life he favors overturning the 
1973 supreme court decision roe vs wade that struck down state 
laws against abortion and passage of a human life amendment to the 
constitution to protect the unborn 
some 15 million abortions are performed in the united states 
annually compared with 586760 in 1972 when abortion was legal in 
only a few states 
johnson estimates that before abortions were legalized in new 
york and elsewhere in the 1960s some 200000 were performed 
illegally each year 
to michelmans argument that more women would be killed if 
abortions were outlawed again johnson said that would be a 
tragedy but there would still be a tremendous savings in human 
life when one recognizes that at least one human being dies in 
every abortion

a film industry leader said monday a committee 
with binding arbitration power should be formed to resolve future 
labor disputes so hollywood can avoid a rerun of the crippling 
5month writers strike 
its absolutely absurd and doubly shameful that it took five 
and a half months and involved thousands of innocent people to come 
up with a solution that reasonable men should have come up with 
sooner lee rich said 
rich spoke at the opening session of cinetex a trade show and 
film festival for the film industry the former board chairman of 
mgmua communications co announced this summer he was moving to 
warner bros to set up an independent production company 
rich called on the industrys management and unions to establish 
a commission that would arbitrate future labor problems before they 
deteriorate into strikes 
call it help or hollywood enhancement of labor practices 
rich said this commission would be in place to forever ensure 
better handling of the labormanagement situations than have ever 
existed before 
this strike avoidance committee would act as the final arbiter 
in a dispute when two sides agree to disagree rich said its 
ruling would be binding just like the baseball players and club 
owners who take salary disputes to arbitration 
rich said that with an enforceable body in place cooler and 
wiser heads might prevail 
with the potential to have everything to win but also with 
the potential to have everything to lose perhaps management and 
labor will more efficiently and more expediently work toward whats 
fair 
the movie chief who helped build lorimar into a tv programming 
powerhouse in the early 1980s said his idea might not be perfect 
but called it a place to start 
the key is that weve got to do something about this 
problem rich said if not the goose that laid the golden egg 
is going to be gone chopped up and eaten 
under his proposal studios would agree to bring in skilled 
labor relations experts either federal labor negotiators or labor 
lawyers 
just as a jack valenti heads the mpaa motion picture 
association of america and represents our interests perhaps a 
labor statesman representing both the industry and the unions and 
guilds could serve as chairman of this committee rich suggested 
wed bring together representatives from the amptp alliance 
of motion picture and television producers with representatives of 
all the guilds and unions to devise an antistrike commission 
designed to be the arbiter of labormanagement disputes 
he called the strike an embarrassment to the industry and said 
it was time for management and the unions to put collective egos 
aside and make sure that there isnt a next time 
a final arbiter in labor disputes could render verdicts long 
before any other bloodbaths occur rich said

monday from egypts foreign minister that the palestine liberation

arafats organization which all arab governments recognize as the 
sole representative of palestinians 
foreign minister esmat abdel meguid told reagan that some 
elements of the plo would continue to resist 
but the egyptian official assured the president that senior plo 
leaders would like to find a way to come to terms with israels 
right to exist us assistant secretary of state richard w 
murphy said 
reagan met for about half an hour with meguid and israeli 
foreign minister shimon peres secretary of state george p shultz

for years the plo has been rumored to be on the brink of 
accepting israel but arafats organization has never taken the 
step its covenant meanwhile is sworn to the destruction of the 
jewish state 
shultz plans further meetings with meguid and peres while they 
are in new york to attend the special session of the united nations

the arabisraeli conflict simply saying we look to a peaceful 
solution 
reagan also briefly criticized the united nations for its 
adoption of a resolution in 1975 equating zionism the jewish 
aspiration for a national homeland with racism 
unlike other speakers he did not demand israels withdrawal 
from the west bank and gaza which the arabs lost in the 1973 
middle east war or call for a palestinian homeland 
at a picturetaking session with meguid and peres the president 
said he wished he could have made more progress toward peace in the 
middle east

brotherinlaw a recentlyplaced plaque bearing allendes name had 
been removed 
she brought a bouquet of red carnations and left them atop the 
tomb 
about two dozen sympathizers most of them workingclass women 
embraced mrs allende at the hillside cemetery many said they 
regularly tended to the gravesite 
the widow brushing back tears told the women i thank all of 
you for your faithfulness 
faithful to the death several women answered 
on a concrete walkway in front of the tomb supporters had 
written in red paint allende lives on in the people

both political camps waved victory flags 
monday in the wake of the bush vs dukakis matchup but polls 
indicated the debate was a draw in the opinion of many voters 
several analysts said a tie actually worked in favor of one 
runner in this race michael dukakis 
their reasoning was that since the massachusetts governor was 
less experienced and less well known on the national stage than 
george bush he gained credibility simply by holding his own 
against the vice president 
a few polling organizations hit the telephones as soon as the 
debate stage went black seeking voters opinions uncolored by the 
analysis of campaign officials or others 
the gallup organization surveyed 337 voters after the debate for 
newsweek magazine and found 42 percent thought dukakis came out on 
top while 41 percent picked bush as the winner twelve percent 
called it a tie and 5 percent had no opinion the poll had a 6 
point margin of error 
abc news canvassed 639 voters immediately after the debate and 
found 44 percent felt dukakis won the encounter 36 percent picked 
bush and 20 percent called it a tie 
in a cbs newsnew york times poll of 415 debate watchers 42 
percent thought bush won and 39 percent thought dukakis won within 
the margin of error of plus or minues five points and in a los 
angeles times survey 35 percent of 637 viewers polled though 
dukakis won 34 percent bush and 29 percent called it even 
lee miringoff director of the marist college institute for 
public opinion in poughkeepsie ny said overall it was a net 
plus for dukakis in that it leveled the playing field forboth of 
them 
william schneider political analyst with the american 
enterprise institute said close means good for dukakis because 
he started out four to six points behind in most of the polls 
dukakis effectively demolished the bush image of him as some 
sort of dangerous radical leftwinger said schneider bush 
had been painting him in very extreme colors for the last month 
just by appearing safe and steady and reasonable i thought he 
scored a big point 
the bush and dukakis handlers began trumpeting victory the 
moment the debate ended and their supporters were for the most 
part true blue too 
an exception was illinois gov james thompson a republican who 
said neither guy won and neither guy lost 
david gergen editoratlarge of us news amp world report and 
former reagan white house communications director predicted this 
will make it a more competitive race 
gergen said bush made good telling points on traditional 
values and the differences between the two candidates while 
dukakis showed an understanding of the middle class and those 
left behind on health insurance housing age and the like 
an associated press panel of six forensic experts gave dukakis a 
narrow victory on their scorecards 144141 although three judges 
picked dukakis and three called bush the winner 
james j unger director of the national forensics institute at 
american university in washington and chairman of the ap judges 
panel said neither candidate delivered a knockout punch 
the aeis schneider said the debates loom especially large in 
this election year because there is no single issue that has 
galvanized the voters attention he predicted both candidates 
are going to be looking for a knockout blow at the next debate 
that will be held oct 13 or 14 in los angeles their running 
mates republican dan quayle and democrat lloyd bentsen get their 
turn in the debating ring oct 5 in omaha neb

three test projects using plastic magnetic 
strip cards instead of food stamps will be conducted in parts of 
arizona new mexico and minnesota the agriculture department said 
monday 
assistant secretary john w bode said that nearly 30000 food 
stamp households in the three states will use the cards to see if 
the system will be easier for people to use and to help reduce lost 
or stolen coupons 
the projects are scheduled to begin within the next 8 to 12 
months and run for at least three years he said an evaluation 
will be made to see if the electronic system might be used 
nationally 
bode said the 13 million project will operate by running the 
plastic cards through a computer terminal at grocery checkout 
counters the cost of the food will be automatically deducted from 
the familys todal monthly food stamp allotment 
in addition he said some of the food stamp recipients will be 
able to use the same plastic cards for other public benefits such 
as aid for families with dependent children 
the department first tested the use of electronic benefits in 
reading pa in 1984 involving 3400 households it received high 
scores from food stamp recipients stores and banks which are 
involved in issuing and redeeming food stamps coupons 
bode said arizona will get funding to design its projects which 
will be tested in mesa with services to 6500 households 
minnesota will test its system in ramsey county among 13000 
households and new mexico will conduct its test in albuquerque 
among 10150 households 
nationally nearly 19 million people are getting food stamp 
benefits based on family size and adjusted household incomes the 
program costs about 126 billion a year

congressional and administration officials 
were close to agreement monday on a pentagon budget which 
eliminates some of the objections raised by president reagan when 
he vetoed a defense spending measure last month congressional 
sources said 
the agreement was being worked out in a series of closeddoor 
meetings involving defense secretary frank c carlucci and top 
democratic and republican members of the house and senate armed 
services committees said the sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
under terms of the proposed agreement reagans cherished star 
wars antimissile program would receive 41 billion a figure far 
under his 48 billion he requested for the fiscal year starting 
oct 1 the sources said the strategic defense initiative as the 
program is formally known currently receives 39 billion 
but the compromise would drop some restrictions in the sdi 
budget to which reagan had objected in the bill he vetoed aug 3 
the sources said 
reagan wanted 330 million for sdi work which could be used for 
an earlystage deployment system but the democraticcontrolled 
congress had restricted spending on that program to only 85 
million 
the compromise also drops a restriction which had been added by 
congress on testing of depressedtrajectory missiles a type of 
atomictipped weapon being developed by the pentagon 
overall the bill would provide about 300 billion for the 
pentagon the same as the earlier bill but slightly less than the 
current 302 billion 
agreement on the pentagon budget would dramatically enhance the 
prospects that all 13 appropriations bills needed to finance the 
government would be enacted by saturday the first day of the 1989 
federal fiscal year 
the last time work on all 13 spending bills was completed by the 
start of the new fiscal year was in 1948 
house and senate democratic leaders have been pressing to 
complete work on all appropriations bills to avoid reagan and the 
gop painting the democrats as inefficient and incapable of adhering 
to the budget process 
last december the democraticcontrolled congress sent the 
president a 1400page 600 billion catchall spending bill that 
arrived at the white house nearly three months into the new fiscal 
year during his state of the union address in january reagan 
threatened to veto any similar giant spending bills this year and 
scores of lawmakers signed letters pledging to support him 
this years appropriations work was made easier by the budget 
summit agreement reached between reagan and congressional leaders 
in november 
that pact settled many broad spending questions for 1989 but 
disputes over various provisions within several individual bills 
have caused delays lawmakers have said that the dispute over the 
defense bill was the most serious and that its resolution would 
make it likely that all 13 bills would be finished on time 
so far reagan has signed four appropriations bills into law 
and has been sent two others

george bush amid efforts to clarify who 
would be liable for punishment if abortions were outlawed 
campaigned in a democratic region monday with running mate dan 
quayle and was cheered loudly when he asked one debate down 
howd i do 
and the vice president gave what seemed a surprising answer to 
that question when talking later to reporters i thought it was 
kind of about even bush said 
several thousand people turned out at a railroad amusement park 
in this west tennessee community to applaud bush on his debate 
sunday night with democratic presidential rival michael dukakis 
dukakis had his supporters as well a plane flew over the park 
trailing a streamer that read dukakis 1 bush 0 
even before bush left winstonsalem nc the debate site 
campaign chairman james a baker iii said the vice president after 
reflecting overnight decided he would not favor criminal 
prosecution of women who have abortions even if abortions are 
outlawed 
in the debate bush said he had not sorted out the penalties 
that might be imposed under an antiabortion constitutional 
amendment he favors but that theres got to be some penalties to 
enforce the law whatever they may be 
dukakis immediately seized on the answer saying bush was 
prepared to brand a woman a criminal for making that decision 
its as simple as that 
bush made no mention of the potential controversy until asked 
about it by reporters at casey jones village in jackson no 
change of mine at all he insisted 
bushs appearance with quayle was his first since they were 
together on aug 21 from jackson bush campaigned separately at a 
barbecue near atlanta before flying to cincinnati for an overnight 
stay 
at the event near atlanta bush was asked about a news report 
that president reagan had claimed in a conversation with sen rudy 
boschwitz rminn that the debate was a near draw 
hes probably rightbush said even though bushs aides have 
claimed the vice president scored a clear victory bush had not 
made such a claim during his day of camapign appearances in the 
south 
addressing a crowd of hundreds bush said you know you get up 
there in these debates why sometimes things escape you barbara 
his wife i think was a nervous wreck and our daughterinlaw 
margaret bush standing next to her i think they were biting their 
fingernails off he joked but we think it turned out pretty 
well 
i am particularly proud to be standing at the side of my 
running mate in whom i have not only confidence but pride bush 
told the flagwaving audience in jackson 
one debate down howd i do he asked when he got the 
response he wanted bush said all right stay tuned 
referring to quayles debate oct 5 with democratic vice 
presidential nominee lloyd bentsen 
bush said i loved it last night i loved it when dukakis 
raised the problem of housing for americans he said interest rates 
were 21 percent under the last democratic administration and 
america does not want that anymore 
using a football metaphor bush said that when republicans took 
over the white house in 1981 americas economy was in punt 
formation deep in our own end zone 
and now were marching down the field heading toward the goal 
line and the old democratic team that second string that 
puntonfirst down crowd wants to get back into the game he 
said no thank you no thanks lets hold the ball lets keep 
moving forward lets take it into the score 
bushs debate answer on abortion one of the most explosive and 
divisive issues in politics gave dukakis an easy target to 
exploit bushs staff moved quickly to remove it 
we went in and discussed it with bush this morning and 
concluded it was an issue that should be addressed and we addressed 
it baker said 
he said bush would not wish to see a woman labeled as a 
criminal notwithstanding his view in favor of right of life 
frankly he thinks that a woman in a situation like that would 
be more properly considered an additional victim perhaps the 
second victim that she would need help and love and not 
punishment baker said 
he said that some consideration could be given to 
punishment as far as the abortionist is concerned 
at an earlymorning briefing with reporters baker said that 
bush was able to project himself as warm as human and as 
likeable while dukakis failed to come across as likeable and 
less dour and less technocratic 
baker softened bushs debate proposal to permit people to buy 
into medicaid in order for the very poor to have medical 
coverage all i know is he thinks that would be an appropriate 
approach to explore baker said

one of 10 men accused in the alleged 
gang rape of a woman testified monday he was having an affair with 
her and that she insisted on having sex with him outside a shed 
where an illegal cockfight was taking place 
she had been drinking said orlando garza 24 who testified 
that he and the woman had been seeing each other for about two 
months 
his testimony before more than 160 people in the jammed 
courtroom conflicted with the womans allegations the woman told 
police she was abducted and raped the night of march 2627 by as 
many as 23 men at a ranch where the cockfight was taking place and 
in two other locations near this southern texas town about 50 miles 
west of corpus christi 
garza is the first of the 10 men charged in the case to come to 
trial before state district judge ricardo garcia 
garza testified he first saw the woman that night as he was 
driving down a street near her home she flagged down his pickup 
truck got in and they drove somewhere and had sex he said 
the woman told him she wanted to see him later that night but 
he declined because he was going to the cockfight garza said 
then as he and three friends were were driving to the ranch for 
the fight they passed the woman who insisted on getting in garza 
said 
the woman testified earlier she declined to get in the car and 
that they grabbed me and pushed me in the car 
when they got to ranch garza said his three companions got out 
of the car but the woman insisted garza stay 
i wanted to go over there to the shed to see the roosters

men started coming out of the shed 
he said she finally jumped onto the hood of another car and he 
and the three other men left and he went home 
garza said when he left she was not having sex with anybody 
assistant district attorney rodolfo gutierrez on cross

three federal appeals court judges sharply 
questioned a district of columbia lawyer monday about why city 
officials had not taken necessary steps to reduce overcrowding at 
lorton reformatory 
circuit judge max rosenn noted that a lower court had found an 
intransigence on the part of prison officials in complying with a 
1982 consent decree to limit the population of lortons central 
facility to 1125 
there hasnt been a goodfaith effort to comply with the 
consent decree said rosenn a federal appeals judge from 
wilkesbarre pa who was sitting on the case by special 
assignment 
circuit judge abner mikva said dc prison officials were guilty 
of abuse of judicial power in choosing to pay fines imposed by us 
district judge june green for violating the consent decree rather 
than eliminate overcrowding 
the 250perday fines for each of the lorton facilitys 26 
dormitories has been treated as another operating expense by 
prison officials mikva said those fines now total 15 million 
according to a lawyer for the inmates 
ed schwab a city lawyer argued that prison authorities 
couldnt foresee the massive increase in the prison population 
resulting from increased drug prosecutions and convictions over the 
last five years 
how is that a changed circumstance mikva said noting that 
city officials knew the physical capacity of the central facility 
when they agreed to the consent decree to settle the lawsuit by 
prisoners complaining of overcrowded and filthy conditions at the 
prison in lorton va 
there is no basis for anyone to find that the increase in the 
drug conviction rate was unforseeable schwab said 
the city is appealing greens order directing it to comply with 
the consent decree by lowering the population of the central 
facility which has fluctuated between 1400 and 1500 inmates in 
the last two years 
peter nickles who represents the inmates called the districts 
request that the judge modify the consent order a calculated 
attempt to postpone the courts order to enforce the decree 
both mikva and judge douglas ginsburg questioned the citys 
threat to refuse to take new inmates convicted of felonies if it 
were forced to comply with the consent decree 
ginsburg wanted to know the number of inmates serving sentences 
for misdemeanors who could be released to make room for newly 
convicted felons schwab couldnt produce a figure drawing further 
rebuke from the court 
the representation to the court that the system will have to 
be closed that is like saying there is nobody in the system who 
is less dangerous than someone who is about to be convicted 
ginsburg said thats not really credible 
mikva also chastised schwab for depicting a prison department 
at war with the mayor and city council over corrections policy 
if youve got problems with the mayor and the city council you 
have my deepest sympathy but these arent legitimate reasons to 
modify the consent decree mikva said

twentyfour members of the political 
opposition ended a hunger strike monday but vowed to continue their 
nonviolent campaign against the leftist sandinista government 
the hunger strike by members of the nicaraguan democratic 
coordinate began friday after the government barred a planned 
sunday demonstration interior minister tomas borge said the march 
had been called to provoke the authorities 
ramiro gurdian vice president of the coordinate a centerright 
coalition of 16 labor groups and political parties called the 
hunger strike the first in a series of peaceful antigovernment 
actions he told a news conference that other actions could include 
longer fasts or work stoppages 
the strikers said they also were demanding the release of 38 
nicaraguans jailed july 10 after an antigovernment demonstration 
in the southern city of nandaime the government says the detainees 
will be tried 
there is no judicial liberty in nicaragua yelled luis 
andara ubeda a coordinate member 
he said the detained political leaders were being kept in 
inhuman conditions at a prison in granada but their hearts 
are filled with patriotism that nicaragua will return to being a 
republic 
opposition leaders also lashed out at us house speaker jim 
wright dtexas who said the cia backed opposition groups in an 
internal destabilization plan gurdian claimed wright jeopardized 
the nandaime prisoners 
his wrights comments put into danger the lives of the 
opposition and gives the sandinista front more reason for deeper 
repression said erick ramirez president of the centerleft 
social christian party in an interview 
the sandinistas said wrights comments supported what they had 
been saying all along 
the national endowment for democracy a us governmentfunded 
organization provided more than 600000 for civic opposition 
groups in nicaragua those who received the funds have been 
identified as the opposition newspaper la prensa two 
antigovernment labor unions the superior private enterprise 
council the nicaraguan conservative party and the nicaraguan 
democratic coordinate 
ramirez said his group does not receive any us funding 
members of nicaraguas fragmented opposition note they have 
remained in their country to fight against the sandinistas rather 
than leave take up arms and join the usbacked rebels known as 
contras 
ortega and other sandinista leaders recently have referred to 
the opposition groups as unarmed contras 
ramirez also said he signed an agreement with eden pastora on 
sunday in costa rica to join forces in the political opposition 
pastora whose nome de guerre was commander zero is a former 
sandinista guerrilla who switched sides after the sandinistas came 
to power and led the contras in the southern front near costa rica 
pastora who left the contras in 1986 has talked about 
returning from exile in costa rica 
ramirez seeks a broadbased centerleft opposition to fight the 
sandinistas politically 
it cant be with the right or the extreme left not with 
washington and not with moscow its an option away from 
extremes he said 
the sandinistas came to power in a 1979 revolution that deposed 
rightist president anastasio somoza the contras have been fighting 
the government since 1981

members of britains new centrist 
party the social and liberal democrats voted overwhelmingly 
monday to call themselves the democrats for short 
the vote by a show of hands at the partys first annual 
conference in this north england resort upset some members of the 
old liberal party who wanted the short title liberal democrats to 
include their former partys historic name 
the social and liberal democratic party was formed last march 
from a merger of the longestablished liberal party and most of the 
7yearold social democratic party david owen the social 
democratic leader refused to join and is a leading a separate 
faction 
legislator sir russell johnston a former liberal said 
excluding liberal from the short title was extraordinary folly 
for me the world democrat simply has no clear political 
meaning he said 
he said the new short title implied that britains two major 
parties the governing conservatives and opposition labor party 
are not democrats they are added johnston 
the new parties obtained 20 percent of the vote in an electoral 
alliance at the last general election in 1987 
but the acrimonious merger slashed support a harris poll 
published sunday in the liberal observer newspaper showed the 
democrats with eight percent support and owens faction with five 
percent 
the liberal party dates to the 1840s and was one of britains 
two major parties until labor supplanted it in the 1920s

michael dukakis and george bush exchanged postdebate jabs from 
a distance monday the democrat saying his rival would lead 
america nowhere and the vice president charging his opponent with 
trying to obscure a liberal past 
the two candidates renewed campaign hostilities as their aides 
waited for the impact of sunday nights nationally televised debate 
to show up in the close race for the white house the first polls 
rated the 90minute confrontation a tossup and bush himself said 
he thought the debate went kind of about even 
dukakis moved to exploit the debate to his advantage as aides 
rushed two new television commercials into production containing 
snippets of his performance one shows the democrat delivering a 
portion of his closing debate statement saying the best america 
is not behind us the best america is yet to come 
bush joined running mate dan quayle at a campaign rally in 
jackson tenn and said one debate down howd i do the 
crowd cheered and quayle provided the answer declaring bush the 
victor 
but bush said later at a barbecue near atlanta i thought it 
was kind of about even 
bush had been asked about a news report that president reagan 
had claimed in a conversation with sen rudy boschwitz rminn 
that the debate was a near draw 
hes probably right bush said even though bushs aides 
have claimed the vice president scored a clear victory bush has 
not made such a claim during a day of camapign appearances in the 
south 
after last night for most people the notion of president 
dukakis is a very very troubling notion today quayle said in 
jackson that was an attempt to reverse dukakis debatenight 
declaration that the prospect of a president quayle was a troubling 
idea for many people 
despite the outward display of confidence bush and his aides 
sought to deflect any repercussions from the vice presidents 
debate comment that he hadnt decided whether women who obtain 
abortions should face legal penalties 
campaign manager james a baker iii told reporters that after 
giving it more thought overnight bush was opposed to the idea 
bush told reporters he had no change on the subject although 
during the debate he said he hadnt sorted out the subject of 
possible penalties 
dukakis first appearance of the day was in cleveland where he 
said the debate provided the best moments of this whole 
campaign 
in remarks intended to rebut bushs charges of liberalism the 
massachusetts governor said we heard a lot of talk last night 
from mr bush about the mainstream but its clear that hes 
willing to leave american families high and dry 
bush he said offers the easy way he sees no challenges he 
offers no solutions and he will lead american nowhere as president 
of the united states 
addressing a crowd of 3000 dukakis said he had asked bush to 
explain how hed bring down those massive federal deficits without 
raiding the social security trust fund and what did he say not 
one word dukakis said 
just as bushs managers sought to minimize damage of the 
abortion issue dukakis aides tried to deflect controversy about 
the aclu a civilrights organization that counts dukakis among its 
members bush has criticized dukakis for joining the group and 
said during the debate that the aclu favors relaxing child 
pornography laws wants to eliminate the current system for movie 
ratings and opposes the catholic churchs tax exemption dukakis 
spokesman dayton duncan said the governor disagreed with the aclus 
position on each of the issues cited by bush 
last night he suggested that i agreed with every position ever 
taken by the aclu and that is nonsense and i know it he said in 
jersey city nj two months ago i signed one of the toughest 
child pornography laws in the united states ive always supported 
tax exemptions for religious institutions and i certainly dont 
support oliver north who the aclu is defending 
bush and his democratic rival clashed sharply on a variety of 
domestic and foreign issues sunday and public opinion polls said 
the debate was roughly a draw that type of outcome traditionally 
favors the outofpower candidate and one analyst said that was 
exactly what happened 
in essence the debate served to restart the campaign said 
lee miringoff director of the marist college institute for public 
opinion in poughkeepsie ny overall it was a net plus for 
dukakis in that it leveled the playing field for both of them 
newsweek said a poll taken immediately after the debate found 
that 42 percent of the voters who watched on television said 
dukakis did a better job while 41 percent said bush outperformed 
his rival the margin of error is plus or minus 6 percentage points 
an abc poll taken sunday night found that 44 percent rated 
dukakis the winner 36 percent gave the edge to bush and 20 percent 
said it was a tie 
those participating in the survey said in advance of the debate 
that they supported dukakis by a margin of 48 percent to 46 
percent with 6 percent undecided said network polling analyst 
john brennan 
in the survey taken immediately after the debate 52 percent 
said they supported dukakis 45 percent supported bush and 3 
percent were undecided given the 45point margin or error 
brennan said the shift in sentiment was statistically meaningless 
in a cbs newsnew york times poll of 415 debate watchers 42 
percent thought bush won and 39 percent thought dukakis won within 
the margin of error of plus or minues five points and in a los 
angeles times survey 35 percent of 637 viewers polled though 
dukakis won 34 percent bush and 29 percent called it even

investigations began monday at a 
police academy into whether strenuous exercise contributed to the 
hospitalization of 16 cadets for exhaustion and dehydration 
including one who needs a liver transplant 
several stricken cadets refused to be interviewed monday without 
clearance from gary egan director of the edward j connelly 
criminal justice training center in agawam he was taking part in 
the internal investigation and unavailable 
but one former trainee said the training routine was severe 
ive been through basic training in the army and it was twice 
as bad as that said mike purcell of northampton who quit the 
academy after one day the doctors told me that if i had gone 
back for a second day i could have suffered permanent kidney 
damage 
timothy shepard 25 a pittsfield police trainee who collapsed 
while running on the track sept 19 the first day of classes was 
flown to presbyterian hospital in pittsburgh and on monday for a 
liver transplant 
the operation which began monday evening was expected to take 
up to 12 hours said pittsfield mayor anne everest wojtkowski who 
kept in contact with the shepard family in pittsburgh 
a springfield hospital spokesman said shepard also suffered 
kidney problems and that several of the other hospitalized cadets 
underwent kidney dialysis treatment six remained hospitalized 
monday 
after shepard collapsed instructors allowed the recruits to 
drink two small cups of water purcell said before that they 
had lined us up at the bubbler twice during the day and only let us 
take one cup of water each he said 
dr george grady chief state epidemiologist said his 
examination last week found its very clear the exercise was 
stressful although he said further investigation may show other 
contributing causes 
jeff grossman a spokesman for the state executive office of 
public safety said investigators from the criminal justice 
training council which runs the academy and state police whose 
troopers are instructors at the academy interviewed the class of 
47 men and women monday they planned to present findings tuesday 
several local officials including wojkowski and north adams 
mayor john barrett iii asked the state attorney generals office 
to review the training program 
wojkowski met monday with egan and state police capt thomas 
white and said afterward i was completely dissatisfied with 
their responses i suspect that the incidents are not isolated 
shepard 25 was the only cadet hospitalized the first day of 
classes but two more were hospitalized the next day and an 
additional two the third day of classes authorities said academy 
officials urged cadets wednesday night to seek medical 
examinations and 21 exhibited some of the symptoms ranging from 
fatigue and nausea to kidney failure 
shepard was in tiptop shape and had worked out for over 
six months at least running and everything to prepare for the 
academy said his brother thomas jr 
he really wanted to be a policeman the brother said hed 
been trying to be one for a couple of years 
grossman said shepards condition may have resulted in part from 
a selfinduced severe diet but thomas shepard said his 
brother spent the days before reporting to the academy with his 
family and ate normally 
he definitely was not fasting thats total lies he 
definitely was eating fine the brother said 
purcell said recruits were required to exercise vigorously and 
were kept moving with pushups and laps if they failed to respond 
quickly to orders 
we started at 730 am with a formation with our gear our 
jackets boots and other stuff in a duffel bag weighing 50 to 60 
pounds and we had to walk to classes carrying the duffel bag 
above our heads with one arm he said 
we also moved metal lockers and heavy wood furniture from the 
basement up to either the second or third floor of the building 
he said everybody was pushed to the limit before we even got to 
the physical training part

lt gen henri namphy 
is broke and will have to leave the luxurious suite he has occupied 
since fleeing here after a coup in neighboring haiti unseated him 
sept 17 an official said monday 
deputy foreign minister fabio herrera cabral said namphy was 
forced to leave haiti so quickly only hours after the coup 
carried out by the presidential guard that he did not have time 
to bring money 
namphys bills at the dominican concorde hotel will be paid by 
the dominican government but he will have to leave the hotel by 
weeks end the official said 
in a televised interview herrera said namphy has received some 
economic aid from a group of haitian businessmen residing in the 
dominican republic and from dominican friends 
the deposed general is accompanied in exile by his wife 
gabrielle and daughter melissa 
herrera denied that namphy had made an official petition for 
permanent political asylum in the dominican republic as was 
reported by a foreign ministry source last week 
however he admitted that namphy has made it obvious he wants to 
stay in the dominican republic which shares the caribbean island 
of hispaniola with haiti 
herrera indicated that namphys presence in the dominican 
republic will not affect relations with haiti 
he namphy says that he was never a politician that he was a 
military man that his military career is over now and that he is 
not interested in any political or military position herrera 
said speaking about discussions he had with the former haitian 
leader 
it seems that namphy never thought he would have to leave his 
country and because of the circumstances under which he had to 
do it he was unable to bring any money herrera said 
the deputy foreign minister said namphys friends are searching 
for a modest but secure house for the deposed general and his 
family to move into by the end of this week 
herrera also denied rumors that franck romain the ousted mayor 
of portauprince left the dominican embassy in the haitian 
capital he said romain his wife daughter and a group of about 10 
other persons are still in the embassy waiting for the haitian 
government to grant them safe conduct out of the country 
romain is the reputed leader of thugs known as tonton macoutes 
and is suspected of having ordered the attack at the st jean bosco 
church that left 13 persons dead and 77 wounded the sept 11 
massacre was mentioned by the soldiers who overthrew namphy as one 
of the reasons for carrying out the coup 
namphy remains secluded in his hotel suite refusing to speak 
with reporters 
a waiter who is the only person authorized by security personnel 
to attend to namphys needs in the hotel said namphy spends the day 
in white short pants either reading or looking out the window of 
his suite his wife and daughter also spend most of the time 
reading said the waiter who asked that his name not be used

democrat michael dukakis said monday 
the vice president was wrong in suggesting in the previous nights 
debate that he agreed with controversial positions of the american 
civil liberties union 
thats nonsense and he knows it dukakis said 
dukakis addressed the aclu issue at an evening rally in jersey 
city after ignoring the issue earlier in the day even as aides 
moved to distance him from positions taken by the civil liberties 
organization which he holds a membership in 
in the debate sunday night bush questioned dukakis membership 
in the group and noted positions taken by the aclu including 
opposition to restrictions on child pornography opposition to 
movie ratings and opposition to the tax exemption for the roman 
catholic church 
last night he suggested that i agreed with every position ever 
taken by the aclu and that is nonsense and he knows it dukakis 
said 
two months ago i signed one of the toughest child pornography 
laws in the united states he said ive always suggested tax 
exemptions for religious institutions and i certainly dont 
support oliver north who the aclu is defending 
but aclu president norman dorsen said in new york that bush had 
misstated the organizations positions and dukakis aides earlier 
had noted that the aclu had filed lawsuits against dukakis as 
governor of massachusetts over his plans to use roadblocks to catch 
drunken drivers and a policy that effectively bars homosexuals from 
becoming foster parents 
earlier in cleveland dukakis did not raise the issue although 
ohio sen john glenn told reporters that dukakis has to respond 
on the aclu issue dukakis made his first campaign stop in 
cleveland a reliable democratic stronghold in a major industrial 
state after his first nationally televised confrontation with bush 
in winstonsalem nc on sunday 
before an estimated crowd of 3000 people in clevelands public 
square dukakis belittled bushs debate answers on questions such 
as social security medicare and the federal deficit 
i asked george bush to explain how hed bring down those 
massive federal deficits without raiding the social security trust 
fund dukakis said and what did he say not one word 
on each issue he asked what bushs answer had been and elicited 
the crowds response not one word 
mr bush offers the easy way dukakis said he sees no 
challenges he offers no solutions and he will lead america 
nowhere as president of the united states 
dukakis recalled former president kennedys crucial debate with 
gop vice president richard nixon in 1960 and said kennedy also had 
chosen cleveland for his first postdebate appearance 
and all of you know what happened dukakis said kennedy won 
the debate and the election that year although he lost ohio 
last night we got down to the real issues in this campaign 
dukakis said we heard a lot of talk last night from mr bush 
about the mainstream but its clear from what we heard last night 
that hes willing to leave american families high and dry 
dukakis weeklong campaign swing will take him to several of 
the biggest states he is seeking to win by weeks end he also 
will have visited illinois pennsylvania new york texas and 
california 
campaign manager susan estrich said overnight polls showed 
dukakis was judged as decisive winner of the debate although she 
disclosed no details she said campaign surveys showed a very 
strong increase in the governors favorabilities or people 
responding favorably to dukakis 
dukakis aides released a list of 16 bush statements during the 
debate that they contended were errors or distortions 
they noted bushs debate statement that he wants to be the one 
to banish chemical and biological weapons but said he cast three 
tiebreaking senate votes as vice president to renew production of 
chemical weapons after a 17year moratorium 
the aides said bush praised the surgeon generals effort to 
educate the public about aids but that the reagan administration 
opposed sending aids educational materials to households until 
forced by congress

army boats and helicopters took 
thousands of marooned people to safety in punjab state monday after 
four days of incessant rain flooded northern india and killed 
hundreds of people authorities said 
at least 70 people died in punjab and floodwaters in the 
neighboring states of haryana himachal pradesh and jammu and 
kashmir killed nearly 200 others officials said 
agriculture minister mohammad shafi of jammu and kashmir state 
said at least 34 people were washed away in swirling floodwaters 
there since sunday 
the toll was expected to rise because communications were cut 
off with many villages after rivers overflowed their embankments 
relief officials said at least 200000 people were stranded in 
78 villages across punjab which produces more than half of indias 
wheat and rice punjab gov ss ray said many of those crops were 
destroyed 
officials said 35 power stations in punjab were ordered shut 
because of the danger of electrocution plunging floodhit areas of 
jalandhar ludhiana amritsar kapurthala and hoshiarpur into 
darkness disrupted road and rail links and continued rains 
hampered relief efforts 
the yamuna river was flowing well above danger levels in the 
federal capital of new delhi according to officials at the flood 
control center and villagers living along the river bank were 
being evacuating to higher ground 
a government spokesman told reporters in new delhi on monday

a mexican drug trafficker on monday became 
the second of a trio of defendants to be found guilty in torture 
and slaying of a american undercover drug agent in mexico in 1985 
rene verdugo urquidez described by prosecutors as the chief 
lieutenant of reputed mexican drug czar rafael caro quintero was 
convicted on five counts of conspiracy kidnapping murder and two 
counts of violent acts in support of racketeering the two acts 
were the murders of drug enforcement administration agent enrique 
camarena and his pilot alfredo zavala avelar 
the us district court jury which had earlier convicted a 
codefendant in the case returned its verdict on verdugo 36 in 
its fourth day of deliberations however the panel didnt 
immediately decide on the charges against a third defendant and 
planned to resume deliberation on tuesday 
verdugo an admitted drug trafficker and his attorneys sighed 
in disappointment when judge edward rafeedie read the first guilty 
verdict the lawyers had argued that verdugo was a scapegoat used 
by the us and mexican governments to close an embarrassing and 
internationally sensitive case 
defense attorney michael pancer who had argued passionately for 
verdugos acquittal told reporters its a black day in us 
justice 
they brought in trumpedup evidence in the case lied to the 
jury and got away with it rene is innocent they flatout fooled 
this jury 
prosecutors declined immediate comment 
in the trial prosecutors alleged that caro ordered the killing 
of camarena and zavala in retribution for the agents role in the 
seizure of a multimillion dollar load of marijuana destined for 
sale in the united states 
the chief evidence against verdugo came from government 
informants including drug smugglers who said they heard him 
discuss the camarena killing 
the sole piece of physical evidence against verdugo was a single 
strand of his hair found at the guadalajara estate of caro where 
camarena is believed to have been tortured and killed 
evidence at the trial showed the agent and pilot were tortured 
with redhot metal pipes and beaten so severely that camarenas 
skull was crushed 
one witness who had a plea bargain with the government told of 
seeing verdugo at the villa on the day of the murder and related a 
conversation in which verdugo spoke of a problem that had been 
taken care of 
sentencing for verdugo was set for oct 26 
the third defendant jesus felix gutierrez a former los angeles 
seafood company owner is charged with helping caro escape to costa 
rica after the killings 
the battered bodies of camarena and zavala were found at a 
remote mexican ranch on march 5 1985 
last thursday jurors convicted raul lopez alvarez of the 
murders his sentencing was set for oct 24 
in a related development caro 37 and an associate ernesto 
fonseca carrillo were convicted in mexico thursday on narcotics 
and weapons charges caro was sentenced to 34 years in prison and 
fonseca to 11 years 
the 28yearold lopez a former member of the mexican state 
police in guadalajara was the subject of the trials most dramatic 
evidence prosecutors showed jurors a secretly recorded videotape 
of lopez discussing details of camarenas death with an undercover 
dea agent 
lopez said on the tape that camarenas killing was a mistake 
that occurred when caro got carried away 
the cases against the two other defendants relied heavily on the 
testimony of informants and drug dealers physical evidence against 
all defendants was slim 
attorneys for verdugo and felix said they were victims of 
political corruption in mexico and an untruthful prosecution in los 
angeles 
nine men were indicted in los angeles but only three were tried 
here one defendant subsequently died four including caro and 
fonseca were tried in mexico on narcotics and murder charges 
verdicts have not yet been reached on some of those charges 
including those of murder 
another defendant former mexican federal police commander 
armando pavonreyes was convicted and sentenced in mexico on 
charges of helping caro escape

george bush appeared believable and warm 
and michael dukakis seemed cold calculating and expressionless 
the traits seen in poker players or negotiators a body language 
expert said a day after the two clashed in their first debate 
ive been disappointed throughout the campaign because there 
hasnt been much body language to watch said judy riggenbach a 
communications expert who advises businessmen and others about 
leadership through verbal and nonverbal language 
sunday nights debate provided little more information both men 
restricted by podiums and microphones 
but there was enough to see to form an opinion 
what ive drawn is that bush is more believable and credible 
he is much more animated than dukakis i didnt see any expression 
in dukakis eyes his eyes are very cold they just dont express 
anything 
bushs eyes however were expressive 
they twinkled they sparkled and in addition bush looked at 
his audience and his questioners she said dukakis looked at 
the camera and hardly ever changed his eye focus or the position of 
his head he was almost like a robot 
riggenbach 42 who teaches speech and drama confesses to being 
a registered republican but in between and objective in 
observing political candidates 
dukakis limited his gestures bush was expansive she observed 
dukakis had two gestures one with one fist clenched the 
other with both fists clenched and his arms tightly to his sides 
another gesture was the use of the halfpalm that is if you 
put your palm up then the fingers inward a quarterrotation that 
was his other gesture 
palms down is negative palms up is positive she said 
bush she observed was animated and very fluid

citing the iraniraq ceasefire agreement the 
reagan administration said monday it will end americas 
shipescorting operation in the persian gulf while maintaining a 
presence there 
president reagans decision to terminate the closequarter 
convoying of neutral commercial ships came after us officials 
reviewed how the aug 20 ceasefire was working said white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the move substantially lowers the us profile in the troubled 
waters nearly three months after a us navy aegis cruiser shot 
down an iranian civilian airliner with 290 people on board the 
united states said it regretted the accident and officials have 
been weighing a program to compensate relatives of the victims 
talking to reporters aboard air force one while reagan flew here 
from washington fitzwater said the administration decided to relax 
the persian gulf sealane policing operation only after 
consulting with allies and friends in the region 
on capitol hill meanwhile the house was urged to pass 
legislation imposing economic sanctions against iraq as a 
concrete expression of congressional outrage against the use of 
chemical weapons 
a vote on the resolution which authorizes even sterner future 
sanctions if iraq persists in its alleged poison gas attacks 
against it kurdish minority was postponed until tuesday 
the reagan administration opposes the legislation on grounds 
that it would not bring us closer to the goal of ending iraqs 
use of chemical weapons 
after making a farewell address to the un general assembly 
reagan met with sheik jaber alahmed alsabah the emir of kuwait 
and also had a session set for later monday with leaders of the 
gulf cooperation council which is headed by saudi arabia 
during the meeting with the kuwaiti official reagan was asked 
why the change was being made in the us military operation 
its just a little difference in the way its being done 
thats a navy decision because of the new situation thus 
ceasefire 
the president said he thought the emir would recognize that we 
are not lessening our protection of them at all 
asked if there was any chance of normalization with iran he 
said you know me i always hope were waiting to see what 
develops from this ceasefire 
fitzwater said it would take a few days to revamp the us 
military presence in the region he said there would no formal 
announcement when that takes place 
in effect the united states will replace its closequarter 
escorting of commercial ships with a sort of armslength 
surveillance operation the formation was likened by us officials 
to a zone coverage of shipping rather than a mantoman 
coverage 
the analogy to a kind of coverage used in football means that 
us ships will watch selected areas of the gulf for trouble 
rather than focusing the protective operation on individual vessels 
in his general assembly speech reagan said the world can feel 
the uplift of hope in the gulf war which he called one of 
the bloodiest conflicts since world war ii 
the resolution and the firmness of the allied nations in 
keeping the persian gulf open to international shipping not only 
upheld the rule of law it helped prevent further spread of the 
conflict and laid the basis for peace he said 
during a brief exchange with reporters after a private meeting 
with un secretary general javier perez de cuellar reagan also 
said he hoped the easing of tensions in that part of the world 
could lead to the release of nine americans held hostage by 
proiranian elements in lebanon 
im keeping my fingers crossed on that because i have high 
hopes the president said i have high hopes 
asked if he thought a hostagerelease could be achieved in the 
four months remaining in his administration reagan replied i 
dont know if anything can be done that quickly but we havent let 
up 
reagan also said however that im superstitious about 
calling a nohitter before the game is over 
fitzwater sought to minimize the significance of reagans 
offhand remark what he said was i dont want to talk about 
hostages because it might be bad luck the spokesman said 
saying reagan was alluding to a baseball superstitution that one 
never talks about a pitcher who might throw a nohitter against 
opposing batters 
white house chief of staff kenneth a duberstein asked whether 
something was in the works to advance the cause of the hostages 
said there is nothing new on that 
fitzwater said there is no new morsel of information to 
encourage us officials and said there is no new signal 
indicating a hostage release 
reagan told perez de cuellar that peace between iran and iraq 
was uncertain fitzwater told reporters at an afternoon briefing 
at the waldorf astoria hotel 
in announcing the phasedown of the us ship protection 
operation fitzwater stressed that the us intends to maintain 
in the gulf the forces required to protect usflagged shipping 
and support our national objectives these changes in no way alter 
our commitment to freedom of navigation in the gulf 
the white house said that the modification in the us operation 
entails a change from a tight escort procedure to an accompany 
regime in an accompany regime us forces will be positioned such 
that they can take appropriate action if usflagged ships are 
directly threatened 
there have been no attacks on neutral shipping in the gulf since 
the ceasefire began on aug 20 
the us convoy operation began 14 months ago and involved a 
precise navy formation used to protect against potential iranian 
attacks against kuwaiti tankers reregistered under the us flag 
the united states had 26 ships in its joint task force middle 
east including 17 in the persian gulf as of sept 16 the navy 
had conducted 85 convoy operations since the escorts began

the soviet union praised president 
reagans farewell speech to the un general assembly on monday as 
generally positive and the kind of speech he should have used 
to begin his presidency not end it 
but it also found the speech acerbic at times and 
selfserving 
last year the soviet union was the target of harsh criticism by 
reagan in his general assembly address 
in a telephone interview with the associated press from moscow 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov called reagans speech 
on monday in general positive overall it was good and 
tomorrow tuesday we will listen to the soviet side when foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze speaks 
i wish he reagan had started his presidency with this kind 
of speech not finish it gerasimov said of reagans seventh and 
final address to the general assembly 
reagan lectured the communist world last year from moscow to 
managua on the virtues of democracy and private enterprise and the 
perceived inferiority of their own system he praised the united 
states for what he suggested was a unique harmony with the human 
heart a quality he claimed was lacking in other forms of 
government 
in 1987 reagan condemned the soviet occupation of afghanistan 
this year he welcomed the soviet withdrawal and encouraged an early 
withdrawal last year he condemned soviet dictatatorship this year 
he cited a change going to the source of postwar tensions and to 
the once seemingly impossible dream of ending the twin threats of 
our time totalitarianism and thermonuclear world war 
this year citing the moscow summit reagan said he was able to 
speak to the young people of the soviet union about the wonder 
and splendor of human freedom 
gerasimov commented the presidents upbeat mood his optimism 
about where the world is going are things we completely agree 
with 
we are also very glad to hear from him his appreciation of 
un efforts to maintain international peace and security 
gerasimov said 
it is certainly a change in position which we warmly 
welcome 
gerasimov said it was positive that reagan cited the easing of 
international relations which reagan said began in the geneva 
summit meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
that sounds pretty good to us gerasimov said 
he noted that reagan said the areas of disagreement on a 
50percent cut in strategic nuclear weapons were decreasing and 
that a treaty could be signed within a year 
both sides wanted this in his administration gerasimov 
said but it proved too difficult but we agree that the sooner 
the better within a year is okay with us 
the soviet union also agrees with reagans call for a 
renegotiated global ban on the use of chemical weapons 
gerasimov said reagan made some acerbic remarks and 
selfserving comments about the superiority of democracy over 
soviet socialism and restrictions on human rights in the soviet 
union 
actually he said the world is really changing 
in his speech reagan called on moscow to halt its massive aid 
to the nicaraguan government and gerasimov remarked in central 
america we are pragmatic we are not adding fuel to the conflict 
we say the guatemala agreements must be fulfilled and we are 
ready to not give aid to nicaragua if america stops its own aid to 
the contra rebels gerasimov said 
it seemed a little bit strange he said that the 
president of a big and powerful country raises the danger from 
small nicaragua it does not sound convincing to us 
the government of nicaragua is ready to talk to the contras 
and i think the president exaggerates what really is happening 
there 
the guatemala agreements to which gerasimov referred was the 
signing of a peace plan by five central american presidents on aug 
7 1987 the plan was designed by costa rican president oscar 
arias who won the 1987 nobel peace prize for his efforts 
one major goal of the arias plan was an end to all outside aid 
to the regions insurgencies

his opponent is ridiculing when he refers to his running mate 
as j danforth quayle was an army hero in world war ii 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis has repeatedly 
referred to sen dan quayle rind by his full name of j danforth 
quayle a practice bush condemned as beneath this process 
during sundays debate 
james alexander danforth rose to the rank of captain in the army 
infantry and earned three purple hearts during the war including 
one in the dday invasion of normandy he died in an army hospital 
in england of the third wound said quayle campaign spokesman jeff 
nesbitt 
danforth was a longtime friend of the quayle family and his 
father attended the university of illinois with the senators 
grandfather said james quayle father of the senator 
danforth and james quayle were fraternity brothers at depauw 
university in greencastle where danforth served as president of 
the university chapter of delta kappa epsilon james quayle said 
he was a great guy james quayle said we lost a lot of 
great friends but jimmy was the first one that died what bush 
said was right 
bush was asked during the debate about dan quayles 
qualifications to step into the presidency if needed after 
crediting quayle with 12 years of service in the us senate and 
portraying him as knowledgable on defense and national security 
issues bush accused dukakis of ridiculing a persons name 
my opponent says j danforth quayle bush said do you 
know who j danforth was he was a man that gave his life in world 
war ii so ridiculing a persons name is a little beneath this 
process

worlds most indebted developing nation blamed the industrialized 
nations in part monday for perpetuating their poverty 
foreign minister roberto de abreau sodre of brazil told the 
opening session of the 42nd general assembly that the third world 
economic picture was dimming due to the lack of progress in 
international economic relations 
it is sad to note that we american asian african 
brothers still suffer from the same horrors and the same 
desolation which so badly affected our forebears he said 
adding hunger is endemically spreading throughout the 
continents 
a similar theme sounded monday in west berlin where finance 
ministers of 22 developed or developing countries demanded more 
forceful action to help third world countries repay 12 trillion 
in debts 
brazil with 121 billion in foreign loans has been among the 
strongest third world lobbyists for debt restructuring and 
writeoffs it signed a comprehensive rescheduling agrement last 
week with its western creditors 
it is critical of the us view that strong economic performance 
in developed countries would trickle down to help the third world 
foreign affairs secretary obed y asamoah of ghana appealed to 
creditors to write off some debts and reschedule others he urged 
nations to work together to raise commodity prices to strengthen 
african economies 
in a market place where one group of operators is continually 
selling its wares cheaply and buying those of others dearly 
protection needs be given to the weak and vulnerable operators 
he said ghana had an estimated foreign debt last year of 28 
billion 
officials of the seven key industrialized nations in the 
noncommunist realm the united states west germany japan 
canada france italy and britain have approved a plan to aid the 
worlds poorest nations mostly in subsaharan africa but latin 
american countries also would like more help 
argentinas deputy foreign minister susana ruiz cerutti called 
for a new strategy of global development including debt 
forgiveness argentina has a 56 billion foreign debt 
prime minister gro harlem brundtland of norway said her country 
spends about 11 percent of its gross national product on loans and 
grants to developing countries well above the average 034 percent 
by other developed countries 
she urged other industrialized nations to increase financial 
aid saying development and debt are related third world crises 
the industrialized countries of the north must now demonstrate 
that they see the poverty of the third world as their common 
challenge she said

marilyn quayle says the campaign so far 
hasnt been a picnic because of persistent questions about the 
background of her husband vice presidential nominee dan quayle 
but she said when you have the truth on your side things 
arent near as trying as they would be 
she was in connecticut to attend a 100aperson fundraiser for 
the victory 88 committee which raises money to get out the vote 
and promote republicans in general not for the bushquayle ticket 
we have great faith in the american people and we knew they 
would see the feeding frenzy for exactly what it was she said of 
media questions about her husbands background and service in the

a mock trial began monday of industrialized 
nations accused of using their financial muscle rather than 
military might to dominate developing nations 
the prosecution is made up of a group of international activists 
called the permanent peoples tribunal who opened their fourday 
trial of the world bank and international monetary fund 
the policies and influence of those institutions now holding 
their annual meetings in west berlin is tantamount to war on third 
world nations the activists charged 
the third world war has already started said susan george 
an american sociologist and author who has written extensively on 
connections between third world debt and poverty 
this war is a financial lowintensity conflict its a 
policing action a way of projecting power into the third world 
she said 
george wald who shared the 1967 nobel prize in physiology or 
medicine for his work on the mechanics of vision expressed similar 
views 
the debt has become a major instrument of domination of the 
third world by first world nations the 81yearold scientist 
said 
ms george who lives in paris spoke at the start of the 
proceedings wald a retired harvard professor is one of 15 
jury members 
both the world bank and imf declined requests by the tribunal to 
send someone to speak in their defense 
hellmut hartmann an imf spokesman said at a news conference in 
frankfurt on sept 13 the organizations have their own 
institutional control mechanisms to monitor their operations 
we dont need such a tribunal he said 
american economist robert triffin has agreed to independently 
defend the two organizations during the proceedings 
in a speech that drew loud applause from about 300 people ms 
george charged the united states is using the massive third world 
debt to control developing lands 
the more intelligent people in the pentagon discovered that an 
overt war to control political conditions with bombs and troops 
and a lot of television probably would result in protests at 
home she said 
she said the united states through its banks has a 
stranglehold on some developing countries 
you can get your raw materials on the cheapest possible terms 
and you can get control over the infrastructure of indebted 
countries when debt is swapped for control over productive 
capacity she said 
the adversary is made to pay for his own oppression just as 
occupying powers have always done 
in an interview with the associated press wald said he agrees 
the third world debt is a marvelous instrument of control and 
its advantage is its so large that it can never be paid back 
he said 
wald singled out the imf for what he called harsh conditions 
it attaches to its lending the imf has fashioned financial 
rescue packages for heavily indebted countries that call for 
changes in economic policies to bring about healthier growth 
such programs he argued impose further deprivation upon 
what are already some of the worlds poorest people 
the permanent peoples tribunal is part of the international 
lelio basso foundation a romebased human rights organization 
founded by lelio basso an italian political activist who died in 
1978

testing positive for steroids and the olympic gold medal awarded 
to american carl lewis

tragedy a mistake or a sabotage said johnsons manager larry 
heidebrecht 
up to five days before the race ben was in perfect condition 
something has happened in those days he said 
we do not know what happened and how it happened but 
apparently somebody has sabotaged ben and we will find out who it 
was and how it was done 
the canadian sprinter is automatically suspended from 
international competition for two years

an activist who campaigned against 
organized crime was killed by gunmen monday one day after a judge 
who sentenced two crime bosses to prison was killed authorities 
said 
government officials said the judges slaying is a sign that 
organized crime figures are trying to intimidate authorities 
this is a crime with the clear stamp of the mafia aimed at 
intimidation interior minister antonio gava said monday 
magistrate antonio saetta 66 and his son stefano 35 were 
slain sunday by gunmen who shadowed their car rammed it with their 
vehicle and stopped it on a country road ouside caltanisetta in

police in the western sicilian town called the killing 
mafiastyle but said it was under investigation 
rostagno was a leader of continous fight a leftist 
organization that organized protests during the 1960s and 1970s he

center 
rostagno 46 appeared regularly on a local television program 
campaigning against drug use and organized crime 
saetta had sentenced two powerful crime bosses brothers michele 
and salvatore greco to life in prison 
this assassination is a very serious signal as to how deep and 
difficult to extract are the roots of the evil plant of organized 
crime president francesco cossiga said of the saetta killing 
authorities have linked the slayings of eight magistrates since 
1968 to organized crime 
premier ciriaco de mita said the reaction of political forces 
has to be strong and united

authorities there about the killing

boxes of ammunition 
coursey said wilson then returned to greenwood and went to the 
school 
district 50 superintendent bob watson said he knew of no

occurred and about 21 children in the thirdgrade classroom he 
said 
witnesses said some children ran into the woods when the man

7yearold granddaughter who was sick 
while we were standing there i heard gunshots all of a 
sudden teachers were running children screaming hollering hes

marilyn amick a firstgrade teacher said she and her students 
fled the cafeteria after she saw a man waving a gun around they 
exited through a back door and ran toward the woods 
her class sought shelter in a house across the street from the 
school until she saw other classes assemble outside she said she 
comforted her students by telling them everyone in their class was 
ok 
watson said classes had been canceled for tuesday and that 
children would receive counseling when they returned wednesday 
steve brown greenwood city manager described the towns mood 
as very solemn

types of things in other areas but never thought it would happen in 
greenwood he said 
gov carroll campbell issued a statement of sympathy for the 
slain childs family and other victims and praised teachers for 
acting quickly to protect the students 
there are no words to adequately express the feelings of all 
south carolinians as a result of the tragedy which occurred in 
greenwood today i was shocked and saddened by the brutal and 
senseless act which took the life of a little 8yearold girl and 
wounded 10 others campbell said 
i would like to personally express my appreciation to the 
teachers who i am told acted quickly to protect the children 
their actions possibly saved lives the governor said

an f14 fighter jet assigned to the uss carl 
vinson crashed into the north arabian sea on monday but the two 
navy fliers who ejected after smoke engulfed the cockpit were 
rescued navy officials said 
it was the fifth crash involving the 44 million supersonic jet 
in the past month including one at the civilian gillespie field in 
el cajon calif that killed a navy flier and injured four people 
on the ground 
there have been 99 accidental losses of the aircraft since the 
jets introduction to the navy fleet in 1972 according to navy 
records 
the latest crash occurred while the f14 part of a squadron 
based at san diegos miramar naval air station conducted routine 
flight operations navy spokesman lt cmdr bob pritchard said 
the pilot and radar intercept officer whose names were not 
immediately available reported smoke and fumes in the cockpit 
shortly before bailing out about 10 miles from the carrier 
pritchard said 
a chopper was dispatched from the carl vinson and the two were 
plucked from the water and returned to the ship 
both appear to be in good health with no injuries pritchard 
said the plane sank into the ocean and is not recoverable he said 
the carrier was in the north arabian sea just outside the 
persian gulf as part of the joint middle east task force 
pritchard said the navy is disturbed by the rash of f14 
accidents but has no plans to ground the aircraft because there is 
no common thread linking the crashes 
they are all unrelated and dissimilar he said without a 
trend developing and with no known mechanical defect as a suspect 
theres no reason to ground them while the incident investigations 
continue 
he said that prior to sept 8 the date of the first of the five 
f14 accidents over the past month the aircraft had gone through 
387 accidentfree days 
pritchard said that the investigations on those five f14 
accidents remain open 
you can bet were going to be looking very very hard at all 
aspects of our program he said the bottom line is we want 
zero mishaps everything that can be done to achieve that goal is 
being done

chileans gave overwhelmingly approval to a new 
constitution eight years ago and military leaders called it 
grassroots acceptance of the way they had governed since seizing 
power in 1973 the constitution prescribed a referendum for this 
year on a militarypicked candidate to serve as president until 
1997 that candidate is gen augusto pinochet ruler for the past 
15 years the referendum is set for this week chile is at a 
crossroads 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a geographical stringbean between the 
andes and the sea chile always seemed separate and distinct from 
other countries in south america 
it had the longest tradition of democracy its schools and 
universities forged a highly literate society more than 90 percent 
of its people can read and write it dug a wealth of copper from 
its mountainsides harvested rich crops from its soil and plucked 
fish in abundance from its seas 
in contrast to its neighbors who lurched from one military 
dictator or civilian strongman to another chile lived in 
relatively prosperous stability in the years after achieving 
independence from spain in 1818 
but in 1970 chilean stability began to falter following the 
election to the presidency of salvador allende a selfdeclared 
marxist whose change in direction from the past brought political 
and economic disorder 
on the morning of sept 11 1973 chiles long tradition of 
elected representative government came to an end 
the military declaring the nation on the verge of a communist 
takeover seized power in a bloody coup 
gen augusto pinochet the coup leader became president in a 
military dictatorship he has remained in office for 15 years 
on wednesday oct 5 the 7 million registered voters among 
chiles 12 million people will be asked to decide in a yesno 
referendum whether they want the 72yearold pinochet to stay on as 
their leader for eight more years until 1997 
joy is coming goes an election campaign jingle of 
pinochets opponents confidently predicting his demise in 
wednesdays referendum 
the marxists are coming counters a propinochet television 
advertisement meaning a vote against pinochet would set chile back 
to the allende years of the early 1970s 
chile stands this week on the doorstep of a future blurred by 
two radically distinct ideological visions the deep split between 
pinochets opponents and backers tends to color the countrys 
troubled past and its present as well 
pinochet is the sole candidate in the referendum which has 
spawned reflection and debate on the merits of his administration 
and on the chain of events that led to his seizing power 
allendes leftist policies and the fierce opposition to them set 
off widespread economic and social upheaval including paralyzing 
strikes and street violence shortages of basic goods and an angry 
polarization of society that has left deep scars 
in the aftermath a us congressional investigation found that 
the us central intelligence agency financed efforts to 
destabilize allendes government it also found that the 
international telephone and telegraph corp which had substantial 
investments in chile financed efforts to prevent allende from 
taking office after he was elected allende nationalized itt after 
assuming the presidency and the corporation left chile long before 
pinochets coup in 1973 
historians today debate whether the cias involvement had a real 
impact and pinochet denies any direct foreign involvement in the 
coup or its planning 
upon taking power pinochet declared a mission to purge the 
nation of what he saw as communism and to forge a society he 
envisioned as based on the values of family hard work and love of 
country 
pinochet and his supporters say the coup saved chile even 
though it snapped a decadeslong chain of democratically elected 
governments allende died in the coup his supporters charging he 
was killed by soldiers and the military claiming he committed 
suicide with a weapon given him by cubas fidel castro 
all chileans agree that pinochets 15 years of military rule 
have been marked by profound change they argue heatedly however 
whether it has been for better or for worse 
pinochets supporters talk of a silent revolution in which 
chile has become a modern efficient nation with a stable economic 
base they claim to see an emergence from third world 
underdevelopment 
the country is in its fifth straight year of steady economic 
growth with the gross national product projected to rise 6 percent 
in 1988 the official inflation rate has declined to about 10 
percent a year a fraction of the latin american average the 
foreign debt of 20 million is being paid off on time and is 
actually shrinking 
export earnings have soared and are projected at 68 billion 
this year up 46 percent from 1984 foreign investment is at 
unprecedented levels surpassing 300 million in the first six 
months of 1988 alone oncebloated state industries have been 
streamlined and in dozens of cases auctioned off whole or in part 
to private business 
in his campaign pinochet promises growth and stability 
we cant turn our back on progress he told the nation 
recently maintaining that his defeat in the referendum would bring 
back leftist experiments and the chaos of the allende years 
even his critics give his economic performance at least faint 
praise 
there has been a positive macroeconomic policy in the last 
four years said andres zaldivar vicepresident of the centrist 
christian democratic party 
but zaldivar who spoke in an interview and other pinochet foes 
say most chileans are still struggling to recover from a fierce 
recession in 1982 which they blame on a radical freemarket 
experiment launched after the coup and only later modified in 
addition the recent boom has benefited the rich much more than any 
other social group 
pinochet has destroyed the middle class zaldivar contended

according to economist alvaro garcia those with higher 
incomes have achieved a level of income almost 25 percent higher 
than in 1982 workers and mediumincome groups have not yet 
recovered the levels they had before the 82 recession 
in any event the opposition contends any economic advances are 
more than overshadowed by a grim legacy of human rights abuse 
more than 700 people were arrested and disappeared during 
pinochets rule most of them in a wave of official repression 
following the coup that affected thousands of dissidents the 
number of atrocities has declined in recent years but illegal 
arrest beating and torture of leftists persists according to 
international and local human rights groups 
impunity still continues for those who violate human rights 
said gustavo villalobos a lawyer for the local roman catholic 
churchs human rights agency 
shadowy bands of armed civilians threaten shoot at and 
sometimes kidnap and torture opposition activists he said in an 
interview 
we are convinced of an association between these apparently 
private terror groups and official security organs 
pinochet insists that tough action was necessary to turn the 
marxist tide represented by allende and remains needed to stem 
subversion including two active communist guerrilla organizations 
but with his electoral campaign in full swing and critics 
calling for greater political freedom pinochet lifted states of 
emergency that had persisted since he took power he also ended a 
ban on the return of more than 300 leftists in exile 
he pledged that his new government would be fully democratic 
while retaining certain anticommunist safeguards 
the constitution crafted in 1980 by his administration and 
overwhelmingly approved in a referendum formally bans marxism the 
same document outlines a phased return to democracy requiring the 
upcoming referendum and a reestablishment of congress which was 
disbanded after the coup 
if a majority votes yes in the referendum pinochet will begin a 
new eightyear term in march the military junta which 
theoretically served as the legislative branch of pinochets 
government will be disbanded the new congress will be seated in 
1990 twothirds elected and the remaining third appointed by 
pinochet 
if the electorate rejects pinochet in the referendum pinochet 
will stay on as president but an open election must be held in a 
year he then must step down in 1990 
no matter what the outcome of the referendum congressional 
elections will be held in 1990 but the legislature will have 
limited authority it will be virtually powerless to amend the 1980 
constitution which gives the military autonomy and a supervisory 
role in national policymaking 
pinochet has said he hopes to see the congress filled with a 
new generation of leaders who put the nations welfare ahead of 
party interests he portrays his chief opponents as people eager 
for personal gain and power and too busy feuding among themselves 
to provide coherent leadership 
for years the opposition had been chronically divided this past 
february however 16 parties ranging from the centerright to the 
socialist left formed a united front called the command for the no 
vote 
with an unusual degree of cooperation they have agreed on a 
moderate political platform and have launched a grassroots 
campaign party leaders who once battled each other now embrace at 
crowded antipinochet rallies 
there has been a process of maturation in the opposition 
said genaro arrigada the coalitions general secretary he said 
political parties had realized their feuding only helped pinochet 
gain and keep power 
confident of getting a novote and defeating pinochet in the 
referendum opposition leaders said they will seek talks with the 
military to speed up the open elections and pinochets replacement 
with a fouryear transitional government 
they claim the military will be willing to negotiate once their 
commander is defeated 
there is no indication yet however of a conciliatory spirit in 
pinochets army by far the most powerful branch of the armed 
forces several top army officers are openly politicking for him 
and the vicecommander gen santiago sinclair has declared that 
troops are in a state of readiness to defend their leader and

his election in the year of three popes was 
a startling surprise he was nonitalian and came from a 
communistruled country as john paul ii he set a record for papal 
world travel reflecting his determination to reach out to all in 
his flock a longtime vatican reporter looks back on 10 years of 
high visibility and the inevitable controversies of an outspoken 
activist reign 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
ten years ago karol wojtyla of krakow 
poland assumed the papacy ushering in a decade of activism that 
has seen pope john paul ii travel the world attempt to bring an 
unruly flock into line and suffer the jolt of schism in the ranks 
he has drawn the admiration of many as he assumes the role of a 
world leader on matters of peace and social justice speaking out 
on causes ranging from the rights of latin american peasants to the 
plight of palestinians he has also upset many roman catholics in 
the united states and elsewhere by his consistent doctrinal 
conservatism 
no pope has ever traveled so much and delivered so many 
speeches embarking on a path to prepare his church for the next 
century when the vatican expects there will be 1 billion roman 
catholics in the world 
the 10 years have allowed the pope to place likeminded 
conservatives in key dioceses and in the curia the churchs 
central administration and to put his people into the college of 
cardinals which serves as an advisory body and elects his 
successor 
from the vatican there have been crackdowns on dissent the 
censuring of several prominent theologians among north american 
and western european catholics have been signs of alienation and a 
feeling among some women that john paul is unsympathetic to their 
aspirations 
the pope was particularly upset when traditionalist french 
archbishop marcel lefebvre ordained new bishops on june 30 without 
his approval provoking the first significant schism in the church 
in more than a century the pope was described as deeply pained and 
bishops asked catholics to rally around him 
wounded in an assassination attempt seven years ago and now 68 
john paul has perhaps slowed down a step he often appears tired 
and drawn although vatican officials insist hes lost none of his 
drive to set down his vision of the church 
to say as many have that the present bishop of rome does not 
understand the church in the united states or in other parts of the 
free world is not to condemn him the rev richard p mcbrien a 
university of notre dame theologian said in a comment published in 
a 1988 anthology the church in anguish 
he seems to assume that the only effective way to combat our 
common enemies in todays world atheism and materialism is 
through a completely united front no dissent no public 
quarreling no breaking from the ranks 
the year 1978 the year of the three popes saw the death of 
paul vi after a 15yearpapacy and the death of his successor john 
paul i after only 33 days then on oct 16 the cardinals elected 
archbishop karol wojtyla of krakow as the first nonitalian pontiff 
in 455 years and the first pole ever 
at 58 young for a pope and coming from a communist country 
where the church has traditionally been a second center of power 
karol wojtyla seemed the ideal man to head a growing church still 
in turmoil from the changes initiated by the second vatican council 
and battling the challenge of marxism 
he has pursued his goals energetically and encouraged his 
bishops to do likewise whether through an unsuccessful attempt in 
1981 to overturn italys law allowing abortions or the successful 
effort to permit his meeting with political opposition leaders in 
paraguay last june 
john paul says the church has an obligation to speak out on 
moral issues but that priests and nuns have no business in partisan 
politics 
throughout the decade john paul has been critical of both 
liberal capitalism and marxist collectivism among his visions is a 
europe united by its common christian roots 
the vaticans attempt to pursue its agenda in eastern europe 
appeared to suffer a setback when john paul was wounded by a 
turkish gunman may 13 1981 there were allegations never proven 
that the shooting was inspired by the soviet union to halt john 
pauls support for the independent solidarity labor movement in 
poland 
but with mikhail gorbachev leading the soviet union relations 
between the soviets and the vatican have improved to the point 
where the vatican sent a senior delegation to moscow this year for 
the celebration of a major religious event by the orthodox church 
there has even been talk of a papal visit to the soviet union 
although nothing immediate is expected

another focus has been latin america where he has sought to 
weed out marxist liberation theology by church activists while 
seeking to counter inroads made by protestant sects 
nine of the popes 39 trips have been to latin america 
reflecting vatican interest in a region expected to include half 
the worlds catholics by the year 2000 the vatican estimates that 
catholics now number 850 million worldwide 
john paul has repeatedly stressed the churchs option for the 
poor but has refused to tolerate the more openly political 
liberation theologists such as brazils leonardo boff who in 1985 
was punished with a year of obedient silence for criticizing 
what he called the churchs feudal hierarchy 
cardinal paulo evaristo arns of san paulo brazil a leading 
human rights advocate and a sort of patron of liberation 
theologists in the worlds largest catholic country has praised 
the pope for encouraging church leaders to work for greater social 
equality 
in brazil where the abyss between the rich and poor is 
immense where traditionally the elites rule with scandalous 
egotism the words of the pope have encouraged bishops priests and 
laymen in a common struggle for a new society marked by signs of 
faith of hope and of fraternity arns said in an interview 
the pope has frequently reached out to other christian 
denominations and religions convening a multifaith prayer session 
in assisi italy in october 1986 but he has said that the 
ordination of women in the anglican church poses an obstacle to 
church unity and has angered jews by receiving plo leader yasser 
arafat and meeting with austrian president kurt waldheim who has 
been linked to nazi war crimes 
it is often said that pope john xxiii breathed new life into the 
church by calling the second vatican council 196265 that 
produced major changes in the liturgy the churchs relations with 
other religions and its view of its role in the world 
if johns successor pope paul vi was seen as troubled by 
doubts and inclined to compromise john paul ii steers the church 
with obvious selfassurance 
a close aide to the pope told this story to describe how john 
paul runs his church 
this summer while on vacation in the italian alps john paul 
indicated he wanted to climb a narrow risky trail to reach a cross 
planted atop a peak he sounded out his aides who all advised 
against the climb but decided to do it anyway 
its not that he doesnt listen to advice but once he makes 
up his mind nothing can change it said the aide who asked that 
his name not be used 
although vatican officials dismiss the suggestion that the pope 
has little interest in the superdeveloped western societies the 
vatican is clearly counting on the churchs growth in the less 
developed nations vatican figures show for example that most of 
the increases among seminarians are in the third world 
africa is one area the vatican is counting on for such growth 
and the pope has made several trips to that continent 
john paul has twice visited the united states the 1987 
pilgrimage allowed for candid criticism from the ranks but the 
pope was unbudging and made it clear that it was a grave error 
to believe dissent from church teaching was compatible with being a 
good catholic 
troublesome issues among north american catholics include 
mandatory priestly celibacy and the ban on women becoming priests 
prohibitions on contraceptives divorce and abortion 
were not going to have a sufficient number of qualified 
priests if they have to be male celibates said the rev daniel 
donovan a theology professor at st michaels college in toronto 
the pope recently affirmed that the church is determined to do 
all it can to fight discrimination against women and has written a 
document on the issue 
but some american nuns have been among the popes strongest 
critics 
there have also been differences over the role national bishops 
conferences should play as a body and investigations of us 
seminaries and religious orders 
the popes world vision as laid out in a social encyclical in 
february drew some questioning from the catholic right usually 
his strongest defenders 
world peace is inconceivable unless the worlds leaders come 
to recognize that interdependence in itself demands the abandonment 
of the politics of blocs the sacrifice of all forms of economic 
military or political imperialism and the transformation of mutual 
distrust into collaboration john paul wrote

pope john paul ii is so welltraveled that 
the focus has shifted to where he hasnt visited instead of where 
he has already stopped 
since setting out for the dominican republic and mexico three 
months after assuming the papacy 10 years ago john paul has made 
39 foreign pilgrimages stopping in 72 countries 
easily the most traveled pope in history he has flown some 
370000 miles including his trip to southern africa in 
midseptember thats like traveling from the earth to the moon and 
more than halfway back 
but if he has visited every continent but antarctica he has yet 
to visit the soviet union china cuba south africa and the holy 
land 
early in his pontificate john paul described himself as a 
pilgrim messenger who would travel the world to see his flock he 
has kept his word far surpassing pope paul vi the first jet age 
pontiff who became known as the apostle on the move 
paul made nine overseas trips from 1964 to 1970 when weary and 
72 he halted all foreign travel 
john paul has made nine trips to latin america alone reflecting 
the importance the vatican attaches to a region expected to contain 
half the worlds roman catholics by the turn of the century 
he has also paid four visits to africa where the church has 
been making inroads as well as three pilgrimages to his native 
poland and two to the united states 
the trips are central to john pauls papacy he has bristled at 
suggestions he should spend more time at the vatican vatican 
statistics say he is away less than 8 percent of his pontificate 
or that the trips cost too much 
he chose a bishops conference in mexico on his first trip to 
reject marxistinspired liberation theology he influenced the mood 
of his fellow poles during his 1979 pilgrimage that helped lead to 
the birth of the solidarity free trade union and he expounded 
church teaching to americans in 1987 saying that dissent was 
incompatible with being a good catholic 
still to come are a trip later this year to strasbourg france 
to address the european parliament and a visit to scandinavia next 
year 
john pauls hopes of visiting the soviet union have not yet been 
realized he has disclosed that hes been prevented from visiting 
lithuania the roman catholic stronghold in the soviet union and 
insists that he must be allowed to visit with his flock on any 
pilgrimage 
the holy land is an especially delicate case paul vi made a 
whirlwind visit to israel and jordan in 1964 but that was three 
years before israel took over predominantly arab east jerusalem and

looking back on those halcyon also the 
name of the yearbook days college chums are undecided whether 
michaels barber shop on the third floor of wharton hall or courses 
nicknamed ditch digging and sewage disposal 1 amp 2 gave distant 
early warning of a future democratic presidential candidate 
of course it was the d in general physics that discouraged 
freshman michael dukakis from becoming a physician like his greek 
immigrant father and inspired swarthmores now bestselling 
tshirt anywhere else it would have been an a 
practical politics solving problems in state and local 
government as taught in the early 50s by paul ylvisaker 
intrigued the scholarship student who had graduated second in a 
class of 439 at intellectually topdrawer brookline high school in 
the suburbs of boston 
in a matter of weeks michael who in those days was never 
called duke and rarely mike was ringing doorbells in west 
philadelphia and handing out campaign literature for joe clark the 
reform candidate who became the first democrat in 70 years to 
capture philadelphias city hall 
swarthmore has always been pretty liberal an egghead campus 
where kids think they can change the world says leighton 
whitaker who was a year ahead of dukakis and now is director of 
psychological services at the college but michael wasnt a 
rahrah guy hed sooner do something about an issue than attend 
rallies and demonstrations 
theory wasnt his bag adds professor emeritus j roland 
pennock summoning up a memory of a darkeyed lad seated 
buddhastyle on his living room floor for those afternoon seminars 
on political theory his arguments were sound wellresearched 
but he was less aggressive and less talkative without a real 
problem to sink his teeth into 
actually it was jonathan fine his brookline buddy and now head 
of physicians for human rights who proposed boycotting the three 
barber shops down in the vill the village when they refused 
to cut the hair of three nigerian students dukakis made it work by 
wielding the comb and clippers in the dorm and sometimes out on the 
lawn 
some recall his charging 50 cents others say 65 cents for a 
flattop the only styling offered 
there may have been a twotier price structure depending on 
what the trade would bear mused associate provost emeritus 
gilmore stott who as admissions officer back then coaxed dukakis 
into entering swarthmore over a dinner cooked by his wife mary 
he was being pennywise as well as striking a blow for racial 
equality barbering gave him some pocket money 
classmate ted perkins a philadelphia patent attorney surmises 
the barber of wharton may have been a youthful edition of the 
tightwad governor who picks his suits off the rack still shops for 
specials at the supermarket grew his own lettuce on the front lawn 
when the price hit 89 cents a head pushes a 25yearold snow 
blower and often rides the t the suburban trolley from 
brookline to the massachusetts state house 
but with a captive audience in the chair michael never could 
resist politics perkins recalls frank sieverts his roommate 
told us the hotter the argument got the faster the hair flew 
a couple of christmas cards ago dean stott enclosed a 1 
campaign contribution suggesting dukakis run for president i 
like being governor the reply came back but stott says he 
kept the dollar 
swarthmore is a small college then as now with only about half 
of brookline highs 2000 enrollment but lush as a landscape from 
the brush of colonial painter benjamin west whose house is at the 
edge of the 380acre campus that flourishes as an arboretum of rare 
trees daffodils azaleas dogtooth violets lilacs and 
rhododendrons in seasonal succession perfume the paths of crum 
woods where in the delicate euphemism of the halcyon editors 
couples took field trips in baudelaire 
dukakis was attracted by the beauty of the campus when as a 
high school senior he visited philadelphia for a week in a class 
exchange program that swarthmore was coed and small enough for 
almost half the student body to take part in varsity sports also 
proved persuasive 
brookline high had conditioned him for swarthmores heady 
intellectual climate 
he was brilliant got all as isnt that disgusting 
marvels sandra cohen now bakalar his high school sweetheart she 
was secretary of the student council when dukakis solved the 
problem of broken milk bottles in the lunch room by having the 
distributor deliver paper cartons but michael lost a big

when sigourney weaver used a futuristic 
forklift to dispatch an alien beast during a climactic fight in 
the movie aliens it was a reallife triumph for caterpillar 
inc 
the image of the lifter which bore the caterpillar logo 
being pushed to its limit in triumph over an evil force was 
powerful enough but the positive exposure to caterpillar from the 
boxoffice success of the film surprised officials of the 
peoriabased company 
we had a number of people calling and writing in wanting to 
buy the machine said ron pilon manager of caterpillars sales 
and promotion division we had to explain to people that the 
machine in the movie doesnt exist 
the cinematic victory and accompanying wide public promotion 
of its machines as tough and versatile resulted from the work of 
caterpillars hollywood agent 
the company for two years has employed upp entertainment 
marketing of north hollywood calif to help it find scripts that 
would give its equipment a high positive profile in motion 
pictures and television and to protect itself from negative 
exposure 
we like to be selective so our machines dont come off as the 
heavy in a movie pilon said we dont want another movie like 
killdozer 
in that 1974 madefortelevision movie a thinlydisguised 
caterpillar tractor became possessed by aliens and proceeded to 
wreak havoc on the residents of a small island 
it was going around wiping out people pilon said of 
course we got up in arms about it because they made the machine 
look like a killer we want people to see our machines for their 
contributions to society building roads and homes and removing 
piles of snow in the winter 
the classic movie grapes of wrath also made caterpillar 
officials cringe as company equipment was used to destroy a home 
and came to symbolize the oppressive force that forced dust bowl 
victims off their land 
caterpillar declined an opportunity for its machines to appear 
in the recent steven spielberg movie batteries not included 
in that movie the construction company was the bad guy and 
caterpillar equipment would have been used to tear down a hotel and 
cafe where a bunch of old folks lived said cliff mcmullen 
president of upp entertainment marketing they had nowhere else 
to go 
thats typical of what moviemakers have in mind for heavy 
equipment mcmullen said and caterpillar is the equipment of 
preference he said 
thats the problem mcmullen said we probably keep them 
out of more films than we get them into caterpillar is a sensitive 
company and doesnt want to offend the sensibilities of its target 
market 
although caterpillar cant control the use of its equipment 
mcmullen often dissuades negative portrayals sometimes with 
threats of legal action 
but caterpillar always is ready for heroic roles such as 
fighting a creature in aliens stopping an oil well fire on 
dallas and constructing a pipeline on dynasty 
later this year three large tractors will appear in the comedy 
fugitives with nick nolte and martin short in the december 
television special a brady christmas a caterpillar 
wheelloader saves the day and the brady bunch from disaster at a 
construction site 
we have never paid anyone to use caterpillar equipment in a 
movie said don axt of caterpillars advertising department 
people think this involves big money but it really only involves 
a convenience 
we make it convenient or very easy for filmmakers to use 
caterpillar equipment and we usually share the costs

most state unemployment insurance funds would 
have to borrow billions from the federal government to pay benefits 
in a future recession because of inadequate reserves according to 
a congressional report released today 
the general accounting office study found the unemployment 
insurance systems ability to cushion economic hard times for many 
americans has declined as states have tried to manage their 
financially troubled programs 
created to help working people make it through economic hard 
times the state trusts are tightening eligibility requirements 
solely to keep their books in the black leaving more americans to 
face a bleak future if a recession strikes the gao said 
only one in four unemployed people received unemployment 
benefits in october 1987 gao said 
the gao an investigative arm of congress said that represents 
a decline in the proportion of unemployed receiving the benefits 
the average proportion of the unemployed receiving benefits 
during the 1980s has fallen by about 30 percent since the 1950s 
according to gao in 1952 nearly 55 percent of unemployed 
civilian workers were receiving benefits by 1986 only 32 percent 
received benefits 
although several changes in the makeup of the workforce explain 
part of the decline the report said 44 states took action to 
reduce eligibility 
the gao also said the drop in the number receiving benefits 
suggests a reduction in the systems effectiveness in stabilizing 
the economy and in mitigating the effects of income loss suffered 
by the unemployed 
the report warns congress to ease the current burden and help 
restore reserves or the country may see greater tax increases and 
larger benefit reductions in the regions that have experienced the 
least favorable economic conditions 
the unemployment insurance system was created in the 1930s as 
one of the new deal programs passed in response to the great 
depression it is run jointly by the federal government and the 
states with each state managing separate trusts within the federal 
treasury and setting its own eligibility requirements and benefit 
levels 
the system was designed to be selfsufficient subsisting on 
federal taxes to finance administration and state taxes to fund 
benefits 
but said the gao report the systems longstanding 
presumption of selffinancing has been eroding since the 1970s 
when the government began making major loans to states otherwise 
unable to meet benefit commitments 
although only three state funds had ever received loans before 
1972 during 198283 states needed loans of over 118 billion to 
pay benefits the gao said 
in 1986 state trusts owed the us treasury a total of 48 
billion and federal laws have given them greater incentive to 
repay the loans and to trim their spending on benefits 
the report stressed that the overall system is not insolvent 
the system had 194 billion in reserve in 1987 gao said enough 
to last about five months in a severe recession 
but recent recessions have lasted 12 months the report noted 
and the labor department recommends each state have enough on hand 
to pay benefits for 18 months 
the gao said those who qualify for benefits under state 
regulations will get them the federal government should cover any 
shortfall yet increased borrowing has been accompanied by an 
ominous decline in the percentage of people eligible for 
unemployment insurance 
in 1969 39 states had adequate reserves the report said but 
no more than two states have had adequate funds on hand in any year 
since 1976 the report said 
at the same time attempts to trim people from benefit rolls 
apparently have increased

the european economic community warned 
the united states monday that a new us trade law could lead to 
more protectionism 
the law could lead to greater recourse to unilateral measures 
by the united states which would be inconsistent with the punta del 
este declaration and with our common commitment to the multilateral 
trading system the 12 eec foreign ministers said in a statement 
the 1986 declaration in punta del este uruguay launched a new 
round of world trade talks designed to combat protectionism 
the eec ministers said they will monitor implementation of the 
us law very closely and will take prompt action if eec 
interests are threatened 
eec external relations commissioner willy de clercq told the 
ministers that the new us trade law by increasing trade powers 
for the us congress would diminish the scope for discretion by 
the administration 
he said it would open the door to lobbyists trying to 
influence the us administration to renege on its obligations 
under the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt the set of 
regulations governing world trade 
the united states and the eec are locked in several trade 
disputes at the moment 
these include eec objections to the use of hormones in american 
beef and us objections to government subsidies for airbus the 
european aircraft consortium 
the ministers also repeated their objections to another us 
trade initiative a bill offering protection to manufacturers of 
textiles clothing and footwear 
such a development would seriously affect trade in this sector 
and jeopardize the uruguay round negotiations the eec ministers 
said in their statement 
the bill would limit increases in textile and apparel imports to 
1 percent a year over their 1987 levels and freeze nonrubber shoe 
imports at their 1987 level 
both the us house and the senate have passed the bill but by 
majorities insufficient to override a promised veto by president 
reagan he has 10 days to sign it into law or failing that veto

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs

elsewhere baker hughes inc reports 
the small overall decline compares to last weeks drop of 17 to 
total 921 the total reported monday is the lowest since the count

rig count went with it dropping to 663 the lowest since hughes

ministers from five opec nations adjourned 
an emergency price review session monday without calling for a 
special meeting of the full cartel but urged all oilproducing 
nations to help stem the decline of world oil prices 
the price monitoring panel which tracks world oil trends and 
opec member compliance with the organizations output policies 
called for a joint meeting of the price committee and another opec 
group the longterm strategy committee 
the joint meeting which could be held in october would review 
the objectives and strategies of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries the ministers said in a communique following 
the meeting 
opec secretary general subroto speaking to reporters said that 
the ministers would decide following the joint session whether to 
call for a full gathering of the cartel before november 
the ministers began meeting sunday to review ways to harness a 
surge in production being blamed for forcing down international 
crude prices an opec source said 
the meeting of the price evolution committee of the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries began just after 11 am at the 
indonesian embassy in the madrid suburbs 
the committee comprised of delegates from nigeria algeria 
indonesia saudi arabia and venezuela was not expected to take any 
decisive action the source said 
the meeting was called after the recent slump in crude oil 
prices due largely to burgeoning oil production by opec members 
analysts say 
the parisbased international energy agency reported opec was 
producing 19 million barrels a day in august far more than the 
1506 million barrel ceiling set by the cartel last june 
in recent weeks world oil prices have fallen to their lowest 
level since the summer of 1986 when they dropped below 10 a barrel 
world oil prices firmed slightly in the days leading up to the 
meeting as hopes escalated that the gathering might lead to a full 
meeting of the oil cartel and a restoration of quota discipline 
within the group 
although the committee which monitors crude prices and member 
compliance with opec policies has no enforcement powers it can 
recommend an emergency meeting of all 13 opec member nations prior 
to the scheduled fall session set for nov 21 in vienna 
meanwhile iraqs oil minister issam abdulrahim alchalabi was 
quoted as saying that falling oil prices would not deter iraq from 
boosting its production 
in an interview published monday in nicosia cyprus the iraqi 
minister reiterated earlier statements that iraq would not adhere 
to its opec quota of 15 million barrels a day and instead was in 
the process of increasing oil output to 45 million barrels a day 
by 1991 
the minister said iraq needed to boost its oil revenue to 
rebuild its economy shattered during an eightyear persian gulf war 
with iran 
other opec countries including saudi arabia and the united arab 
emirates also are reported to be exceeding their quotas and 
competing for market share leaving some analysts skeptical about 
the cartels ability to reinstitute discipline among the 
organizations members 
on sunday the price committee held a onehour formal meeting at 
the same embassy in the madrid suburbs and discussed a report on 
the current state of world oil prices and production a senior 
delegate said 
the opec source said the meeting was likely to break for lunch 
monday at 1 pm and then resume talks in the afternoon 
the source also said indonesian opec secretary general subroto 
who is also attending may make a statement to reporters later 
monday 
he described the report as not very good 
on friday north sea brent crude for october delivery dropped to 
1310 per barrel on rumors later proven false that saudi arabian 
oil minister hishan nazer would not appear at the price committee 
meeting 
by 12 pm monday north sea brent crude for october delivery 
had risen to 1325 per barrel 
algeria whose minister hosted a dinner here saturday for his 
committee colleagues has complained to saudi arabia and other gulf 
producers that failure to respect opec production quotas is causing 
serious hardships for other opec members whose economies are 
dependent on oil revenues 
besides saudi oil minister nazer the others at the meeting 
include opec chairman rilwanu lukman who is also nigerias oil 
minister algerias belkacem nabi indonesias ginandjar 
kartasasmita and venezuelas new oil minister julio cesar gil

the international monetary fund said monday poor 
countries have been hurt by the recent rise in world interest rates 
and urged stronger steps to ease their staggering foreign debt 
burdens 
the policymaking arm of the imf also called on indebted 
countries to pursue policies that will spur growth and help 
restore domestic and foreign confidence 
the panel made up of the finance leaders of 22 countries said 
banks should be encouraged to offer adequate refinancing to the 
debtor countries and not just stretch out their payments over 
longer periods 
many countries continue to face severe financing and 
adjustment difficulties which have become more severe due to the 
recent increase in interest rates said a statement from the 
group attending the annual meeting of the imf and its sister 
agency the world bank the financial organizations count 151 
nations as members 
more forceful actions are needed in the context of the current 
cooperative casebycase approach to resolve these difficulties 
the statement said 
the ministers also said governments should not bail out 
commercial banks which have made risky loans to poorer countries 
there should be no official guarantees to private lenders 
said dutch finance minister h onno ruding the panel chairman 
finance ministers from throughout the world began a round of 
talks last week in conjunction with the imfworld bank meeting 
which officially opens on tuesday 
some 12000 financial officials bankers and journalists were 
expected to attend the sessions 
the officials talks have centered mostly on prospects for the 
world economy and the third world debt 
in its statement the policymaking panel said growth in the 
industrial countries has heen stronger than expected world trade 
has been buoyant and inflation has been kept moderate 
the group offered no new proposals for the debt problem and said 
it supported the current debt strategy 
it took note of an offer from the japanese exportimport bank to 
make loans on easy terms to large debtor countries following 
imfbacked economic policies 
japan it said intends to promote growth in developing 
countries and to contribute to the solution of the debt problem 
japans central bank governor satoshi sumita was expected 
tuesday to provide details of another debt plan again to help the 
larger debtors known as the middleincome countries 
this proposal first discussed in june at the toronto economic 
summit of key industrialized nations calls for the debtors to 
deposit some of their international reserves with the imf 
the finance leaders of the united states and six other major 
industrial nations over the weekend gave their final approval to a 
plan to help the very poor countries mostly in subsaharan africa 
but the big debtors like mexico and brazil also would like 
some special assistance in reducing the debt burdens that have 
slowed their economic development the two countries the 
developing worlds largest debtors have debts totaling more than 
220 billion 
in recent years the industrial nations have followed what they 
call a casebycase approach to the debt an approach that calls 
for dealing individually with the debtors 
the imf has been instrumental in fashioning financial rescue 
packages for heavily indebted countries the world bank provides 
assistance to these countries for economic development

opecs price monitoring committee ended a 
twoday emergency session monday by calling for prompt action to 
reverse the sharp decline in world oil prices but stopped short of 
calling for a special meeting of the full 13member cartel 
in a communique released at the conclusion of the meeting the 
oil ministers also said it was essential that a joint meeting of 
the price committee and the longterm strategy committee be held to 
review existing opec strategies and objectives 
no lasting stability in the world oil market can be achieved 
without concrete cooperation by the nonopec oil producing 
countries and their contribution in regulating world supplies of 
oil in line with demand the price committee said 
opec secretary general subroto of indonesia speaking to 
reporters at a news conference following the meeting underscored 
the committees statement saying the cause of the recent fall in 
oil prices was mainly due to a significant overproduction of some 
opec countries as well as nonopec oil producers 
subroto said the ministers would decide after the joint meeting 
whether a special session of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries should be called before its regularly scheduled 
meeting nov 21 in vienna 
oil futures prices on the new york mercantile exchange which 
had risen earlier in the day began falling immediately after 
subrotos statements then recovered slightly analysts said one 
broker said subrotos comments were interpreted as indicating opec 
was unwilling to take immediate action to restrain oil output and 
boost sagging oil prices 
the meeting of the price committee was called in response to the 
recent slump in world oil prices which earlier this month hit 
their lowest level since the summer of 1986 when they fell below 
10 a barrel 
according to many analysts sagging prices represent the failure 
of nearly all opec members to respect production quotas 
the secretary general did not give specific dates for the joint 
meeting except to say it would probably be held in october 
subroto said iran and iraq are to speak directly with each other 
at the longterm strategy committee for the first time in years 
within opec he downplayed the significance of such a meeting 
however saying it was normal that their respective oil ministers 
should speak since their foreign ministers began meeting last month 
in peace talks 
the longterm strategy committee is comprised of opecs founding 
members including iran iraq saudia arabia algeria venezuela 
and kuwait subroto said iran and iraq have both confirmed their 
attendance at the joint session saudi arabia venezuela and 
algeria also are members of the price committee along with nigeria 
and indonesia 
since the last price committee meeting aug 3 in lausanne 
switzerland a ceasefire between the two countries in their 
eightyear gulf war has begun to hold 
the price evolution committee as the price committee is 
officially named is an influential panel that studies price 
developments and compliance with opec policies namely production 
quotas by opec members although it has no enforcement powers 
the committee may however call for special meetings of all 13 
opec members 
the committee said it also examined during the emergency session 
in the spanish capital a report prepared by the viennabased opec 
secretariat on current market conditions as well as a report 
presented by subroto on the outcome of his recent visits to various 
opec and nonopec oil producing countries 
the parisbased international energy energy agency reported opec 
production at 19 million barrels a day in august and opec president 
rilwanu lukman has put opec production at closer to 20 million 
barrels per day 
last june opec set a 1506 million barrel a day ceiling to 
apply to all opec nations except iraq which has refused to go 
along with opec quotas saying it needs to produce more oil to 
rebuild its wartorn economy following eight years of fighting with 
iran 
on monday north sea brent crude for delivery in october was 
quoted at 1325 up slightly from friday

lowest close in nearly four months on the chicago board of trade as 
the accelerating harvest brought new supplies to the market 
grain futures also finished lower with oats for december and 
march delivery closing down the allowable limit of 10 cents a 
bushel 
soybeans for delivery in november plummeted more than 26 cents 
to close at the days low of 806 a bushel that was the lowest 
closing price for soybean futures since june 1 when soybeans for 
july delivery finished at 801 a bushel 
fine harvesting weather in the midwest over the weekend and 
rains in major soybeangrowing areas of brazil and argentina 
prompted heavy selling analysts said 
the markets very much on the defensive with the harvest going 
on said victor lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds 
inc 
harvest pressure also weighed on the corn market while wheat 
prices fell on a lack of significant new export business analysts 
said 
the corn market ignored bullish reports that aflatoxin a 
carcinogenic fungus had been found in some samples of corn from 
grain elevators in iowa and indiana 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 421 a bushel corn was 3 
cents to 5 cents lower with december at 280 a bushel oats were 
6 cents to 10 cents lower with december at 244 a bushel

the nations leading securities industry group 
offered a bleak assessment monday of the year since the stock crash 
and predicted individual investors will shun the market until they 
see major reforms 
edward i obrien president of the securities industry 
association said in a statement that although the worst fears 
about the economy never materialized after the oct 19 collapse and 
market conditions have improved in some areas the overall 
current environment is at best gray 
he said the sia the main trade group of wall street believes 
the nearterm outlook isnt likely to improve substantially until 
full investor confidence is restored in both the integrity of the 
marketplace and the strength of the economy 
in the longer term he said lackluster equities prices will 
make it more difficult for companies to raise equity funds at the 
very time capital needs and reconstruction of industry are 
necessary to effectively compete in the world market for goods and 
services 
obriens remarks were part of what the sia called his overview 
of events since the crash which erased 508 points from the dow 
jones industrial average and has continued to undermine the health 
of the securities industry 
quoting what he called currently available data obrien said 
the dollar amount of common stock offerings fell 375 percent in 
the first half of 1988 vs the same time a year earlier the drop 
would have been sharper without the inclusion of offerings in 
special investment companies called closedend funds 
although prices of new york stock exchangelisted issues have 
partly recovered from postcrash lows they averaged only 3280 
through august 1988 well below 44 in september 1987 obrien said 
volume on the nyse through july remained 8 percent off the 1987 
average and the drop would have been even sharper without 
inclusion of volumeinflating strategies in which stocks are traded 
to capture quarterly dividends he said 
largely as a result of these conditions layoffs and furloughs 
in the business totaled 16000 nationwide through the first 
quarter he said 
obrien said there have been a few steps to correct problems 
exposed as a result of the crash but major regulatory reform 
hasnt taken place 
as an example he said no concerted effort has emerged to place 
financial markets under one regulator a key recommendation of a 
presidential commission that examined the crash he also said the 
markets themselves have so far failed to agree on common ways to 
stop or slow the impact of another panic 
failure to have these and other systems in place contributed 
to the october 19 freefall and until they are rectified the 
individual investor is likely to continue to be wary of the 
marketplace obrien concluded

time inc is changing the layout of its flagship 
magazine to make it easier to read but an editor says the changes 
are minor and most readers may not even notice 
the changes will include the expansion of times onepage index 
to two pages introduction of new travel and interview 
sections and use of bigger and more informative headlines and photo 
captions executives said monday 
richard duncan assistant managing editor of time magazine said 
the changes represent a tuning up and modification of our 1977 
redesign that signalled the regular use of color photographs in 
the magazine 
he said some of the changes such as longer headlines and

with the oct 17 issue which will appear on newstands starting 
oct 10

monday outlining the changes to times bureau chiefs and editors 
who were not involved with the changes duncan said the company

demands on readers time and attention 
the key is to increase the accessibility of the story to the 
reader he said were helping them grab the essence of the 
story 
along with bigger headlines and longer captions he said the 
magazine will make more extensive use of taking quotes from a story 
and putting them in a box to draw more attention to the story 
he said he did not know if the average reader would have noticed 
the changes if the magazine did not call attention to them 
the new travel section will carry stories about issues such 
as fare wars as well destinations while the interview section 
will use a questionandanswer format alternating with the 
profile section he said 
the magazine also will offer an american ideas section 
alternating with its american scene section and focusing on 
people and how they succeeed or fail at bringing off their ideas

a partial settlement is close in a classaction 
lawsuit between one of ivan f boeskys companies and investors who 
claim they were defrauded by the imprisoned speculators insider 
trading lawyers said monday 
key details were not disclosed but the lawyers said it would 
cause a realignment in the morass of civil suits and countersuits 
that have enveloped boesky since he paid the securities and 
exchange commission a record 100 million nearly two years ago in 
penalties and illicit trading profits 
weve got it virtually done said david berger lead 
cocounsel of a group of shareholders who sued ivan f boesky amp 
co an investment vehicle once controlled by boesky 
the settlement would remove as defendants in the classaction 
suit the limited partners in boeskys investment company who 
themselves have sued boesky on grounds he defrauded them 
boesky would remain a defendant in the classaction suit as 
would drexel burnham lambert inc the wall street firm he has 
implicated in a number of allegedly fraudulent deals 
drexel was accused by the sec earlier this month of extensive 
securities law violations but has denied the charges it remains 
unclear what impact if any the partial settlement disclosed 
monday would have on the drexel litigation 
berger declined to comment on reports that the partial 
settlement could involve between 30 million and 50 million in 
compensation payments to his clients 
ive been working for one and a half years to get this 
settlement and dont want to see premature publicity he said 
others however speaking on condition they not be identified 
said the compensation element of the settlement remains unresolved 
and would involve petitioning the sec which will use part of 
boeskys surrendered money to repay others who can prove they were 
victimized 
in addition these lawyers said bergers clients would need the 
approval of the us district court in manhattan where all of the 
boeskyrelated civil litigation has been filed 
the sec which has been drafting a plan for how to compensate 
boeskys victims is scheduled to complete it by oct 3 sec 
officials declined to comment monday on whether plaintiffs in the 
classaction suit against boesky would be part of that plan 
boesky and the entities he once controlled were inundated with 
lawsuits after federal authorities disclosed his insider trading 
activities in november 1986 most of the suits were by shareholders 
who were selling stock at the time boesky and his associates were 
buying 
the speculator began serving a threeyear federal prison term 
last march after he pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to lie 
to the sec

automakers have learned from defense and 
aerospace programs how to develop coordinated systems rather than 
sticking with componentoriented piecemeal design approaches 
general motors corp chairman roger b smith said monday 
echnologies 
integrating them 
into new products and bringing the whole package to market more 
quickly than anyone else he said 
smith and honda motor co chairman tadashi kume gave keynote 
speeches at the opening of a fourday conference of the 
international federation of automotive engineering societies 
renault chairman raymond h levy another keynote speaker was 
unable to attend but his prepared remarks were read by mack trucks 
inc chairman john b curcio 
smith said gm started its project trilby electronics and 
computeroriented engineering effort years ago to answer the 
question what would an automobile be like if instead of the old 
addon approach we started to design it today with all of the 
systems knowhow and microprocessor technology that we have at our 
disposal 
resulting coordinated systemsengineering methods are now 
moving into mainstream auto design at gm he said 
smith said those approaches are vital not only for quicker 
reaction to the market but to coordinate design of advanced 
technology items such as active suspensions automated braking 
systems and traction control 
kume talked about his companys growth as an international auto 
manufacturing power and his resulting efforts to shake off 
complacency in the ranks 
kume said he sometimes keeps his executives on their toes by 
transferring them to new positions for which they have no apparent 
background 
sometimes i do that by challenging the organization to meet 
seemingly impossible goals he said 
the larger an organization becomes the more bureaucratic 
it becomes persons become contented with a standard way of doing 
things no chances are taken no mistakes are made he said 
spreading into worldwide markets also helps avoid those 
tendencies kume said internationalization of our company is 
causing it to become more flexible and from this flexibility comes 
more creativity he said 
levy estimated in his remarks that 25 million to 30 million 
people worldwide work in autorelated jobs but he predicted a 50 
percent drop in auto industry employment by 1992 
increased use of outside suppliers fewer supervisors as 
production workers assume more responsibility and fewer white 
collar workers as computers are used for more tasks will contribute 
to the decline levy said in the remarks delivered by curcio 
nearly 200 technical presentations are slated during the 
conference which continues through thursday on topics such as 
vehicle handling composite materials suspension systems vehicle 
safety power train design and electronic controls 
the international gathering of 22 automotive engineering 
societies is hosted by the society of automotive engineers inc in

kroger co said monday it would sell stores 
and food processing plants and reduce its work force as part of a 
46 billion restructuring aimed at defeating two takeover bids 
kroger officials contended the restructuring would be more 
lucrative for shareholders than a 46 billion bid by kohlberg 
kravis roberts amp co or a competing 432 billion offer from dart 
group corp 
late friday when kroger announced that its board had approved 
the restructuring the company also said it had rejected both 
offers as inadequate 
spokesmen for dart and kohlberg kravis declined comment monday 
the restructuring which must be approved by shareholders is 
worth 57 to 61 per share or as much as 46 billion officials 
said 
the plan first publicly proposed on sept 13 would pay 
shareholders 40 a share in cash plus securities valued at 8 and 
publiclytraded stock worth between 5 and 10 kroger has 786 
million outstanding shares 
dart a retailing company which has made a number of 
unsuccessful takeover bids in recent years offered last monday to 
buy kroger for 55 per share 43 in cash and securities valued at 
12 or about 432 billion 
kohlberg kravis which has outbid dart for three other 
corporations in recent years entered the bidding last tuesday by 
offering to buy kroger for 5850 per share 50 in cash and 850 
in securities or a total of 46 billion 
goldman sachs amp co krogers adviser told company officials 
the kohlberg kravis offer raised antitrust issues because the 
investment firm recently acquired two other grocery retailers 
safeway stores inc and stop amp shop cos 
kroger stock rose 62 cents to close at 5637 a share in new 
york stock exchange trading monday 
company officials said at a news conference they expected the 
asset sales to raise an estimated 333 million after taxes 
the restructuring would make the company smaller and increase 
its debt load but leave it economically viable and competitive 
chairman lyle everingham and president joseph pichler said 
everingham declined to reveal how many employees would be laid 
off the jobs would be eliminated at the grocery retailers 
cincinnati headquarters he said 
kroger said it would sell some of its food processing 
facilities its 27store frys division in northern california its 
welcome inc superwarehouse venture in the south and 29 
supermarkets in north carolina and south carolina 
the company also said it would sell its 16unit price savers 
wholesale warehouse inc to a managementled investment group and 
proceed with the sale of its florida choice division which 
comprises 43 supermarkets and 39 liquor stores 
kroger also announced plans to sell and then lease back stores 
and real estate in texas and sell its general merchandise 
distribution center in san marcos texas 
the retailer said it had commitments for 36 billion in 
financing for the restructuring 
kroger founded in 1883 by shopkeeper barney h kroger operates 
more than 1300 supermarkets 935 convenience stores and 15 
membership warehouses in 29 states the company also processes a 
variety of food products for sale in its retail stores and to 
outside customers 
kohlberg kravis won a hostile takeover battle for beatrice cos 
in 1985 in which the haft family was a bidder and outbid the 
hafts for safeway in 1986 and stop amp shop earlier this year 
dart group owns the crown books bookstore chain and the auto 
parts retailer trak auto stores

smithkline beckman corp whose profits have declined could come 
after a board meeting of the pharmaceutical company expected to 
take place wednesday 
the firm announced in july it planned to cut costs and become 
more efficient by restructuring its corporate staff the firm has 
refused to divulge details of the restructuring 
analysts and development officials who have spoken to smithkline 
executives believe the shakeup could lead to layoffs of as many as 
3000 worldwide 
painewebber inc analyst ron nordmann said as many as 2000 of 
smithklines employees could be laid off but cautioned that the 
restructuring may be more farreaching than that 
analysts have said they expect the board meeting wednesday but 
smithkline refused to confirm the date 
we just cant comment on anything right at the moment a 
spokesman said last week we have announced that we are studying 
the restructuring of the pharmaceutical business and corporate 
staff and work is continuing but we cant say anything fruther at 
this time 
the company said in july that it would reorganize its business 
following a lackluster firsthalf performance in which earnings 
dropped by 25 percent the company also predicted that earnings for 
the full 1988 fiscal year would be off by 25 percent as well 
smithkline blamed the drop in its profits on the disappointing 
sales of its two top drugs tagamet an antiulcer drug and 
dyazide a drug used in the treatment of hypertension

cocacola co hurt its independent 
bottlers when it changed its syrup formula and did not pass on the 
savings a bottler testified monday as trial began in a federal 
court suit against the softdrink manufacturer 
the us district court trial which is expected to take five 
months involves 24 independent bottlers seeking to have the court 
uphold a 1921 pact tying the price they pay for cocacola syrup to 
the cost of sugar 
if successful the bottlers could realize up to 35 million in 
damages 
william b schmidt of elizabethtown ky who filed the lawsuit 
testified that coke began substituting highfructose corn syrup for 
sucrose as a sweetener in 1980 without passing the savings on to 
bottlers 
schmidt whose grandfather established the fifth coke bottling 
plant in the united states said the changes made it difficult for 
him to compete with other major brands such as pepsi cola 
the company said theyd go to a 5050 sugarfructose syrup 
schmidt testified the problem was if coke went to fructose the 
cost decreases unless the decreased cost is passed on to the 
bottler then competitors would also add fructose and be able to 
charge less 
jane f vehko an attorney who argued for the bottlers alleged 
during opening arguments monday that atlantabased cocacola 
broke its promise to use sugar as a sweetener and when it 
changed to a cheaper sweetener refused to pass the savings on the 
bottlers 
frank c jones cokes attorney argued the bottlers are not 
entitled to any monetary relief 
the bottlers never contended they had a veto right to a 
change in ingredients in the syrup under the 1921 pact jones said 
he said in 1971 and 1974 coke changed the caffeine content in 
its product without consulting the bottlers and there were no 
complaints from the bottlers 
its absurd to think any bottler would have the power to 
veto a sweetener change jones said
