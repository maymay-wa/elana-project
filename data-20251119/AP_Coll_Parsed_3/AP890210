a drifter who sometimes posed as an american 
indian was convicted friday of murdering and sexually mutilating 
three indian women and sentenced to life in prison 
im not the serial killer billy glaze 45 told hennepin 
county judge jonathan lebedoff after the jury found him quilty 
but the judge said he wasnt swayed by glazes denial and 
sentenced him to three life sentences in prison to be served 
consecutively 
i have no reason to dispute the legitimacy of the findings of 
the jury lebedoff said he described the jury as extremely 
conscientious 
the horrors that weve been privy to over the last few weeks 
cannot be undone by any sentence theres nothing i can do to turn 
back the clock lebedoff said 
glaze was convicted of three counts of firstdegree murder and 
three counts of seconddegree murder in the slayings of kathleen 
bullman 19 angeline whitebirdsweet 26 and angela green 21 in 
1986 and 1987 police believe the women met their killer in taverns 
glaze said he had no complaint with the jury but he disputed the 
testimony of the witness that got up there and lied i never wore 
no bandana i never went into a bar and said those things about 
indian women 
im just not the serial killer but you do what you have to 
he told the judge 
noting that minnesota does not have a death sentence lebedoff 
said it was his strong wish that you serve the rest of your life 
in prison 
deliberations began tuesday after a twoweek trial 
assistant hennepin county attorney pete connors said in his 
closing statement that glazes motive was that he hated indian 
women he had a fury in his gut he wanted to hurt them badly he 
told people that 
but glazes attorney michael colich said the state had failed 
to prove that glaze killed anyone glaze did not testify 
colich characterized glaze as a nonviolent drifter who called 
attention to himself by saying despicable things about women he 
said police were not thorough in their investigation of other 
suspects because of public pressure to solve the killings glaze was 
indicted last june 
glaze is believed to have left minneapolis around may 1 1987 he 
was arrested later that month on a drunken driving charge in new 
mexico albuquerque police contacted minneapolis authorities when 
they learned glaze was sought for questioning in the three killings 
glaze once told a television reporter that he had claimed to be 
an indian because their culture fascinated him and federal 
authorities said he used aliases including jesse settingcrow and 
jesse sitting crow

fire swept through a historic hotel 
friday killing one person and injuring 14 others as freezing 
temperatures forced firefighters to draw water from a canal a half 
mile away 
the fire broke out about 4 am in the wall block inn where 
about 50 people lived authorities said 
more than 200 firefighters responded to the fire before it was 
declared under control at about 740 am said sue pinkham a 
spokeswoman for the county emergency services department 
state police fire marshal john pflantz said he did not know the 
identity of the victim 
there is no reason to believe there are any more bodies but 
we will continue to look pflantz said 
the cause of the fire which started on the second floor of the 
threestory residential hotel was under investigation pflantz 
said a previous fire at the hotel in 1978 had an electrical origin 
firefighters stretched hoses 2600 feet from the montclair canal 
of the schuylkill river because cold temperatures slowed the water 
flowing through water mains mrs pinkham said the hoses forced the 
closing of route 29 in this philadelphia suburb she said 
one man was in critical condition in a philadelphia hospital two 
people were admitted to phoenixville hospital and 11 others were 
released after treatment for minor injuries 
the hotel built in 1905 is listed on the national register of 
historic places as a significant part of a historic district said

congressional democrats reacted warily thursday 
as president bush began to spell out a budget based on his campaign 
promises criticizing him for vagueness and vowing to reject any tax 
changes that favor the wealthy but predictably republican praised 
bushs speech 
house speaker jim wright dtexas invited bushs budget 
officials to capitol hill for consultations next week and said we 
are ready to meet with president bush any time he wishes and seek 
common solutions 
but wright signaled that certain things would be off the table 
such as cuts in medicare and tax changes favoring upperincome 
taxpayers and he put the onus on bush to address homelessness the 
trade deficit the war on drugs and poor math and science scores 
among us students all of which he portrayed as legacies of the 
reagan administration america can do better than that wright 
said 
senate majority leader bob dole rkan said bush had extended a 
cooperative hand to capitol hill congress can swat it away or it 
can grasp the presidents hand in the true spirit of cooperation 
he said he called bushs plan was not the final answer its a 
starting point 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota the senior republican on the 
house budget committee said bushs budget was faithful to the 
campaign pledges he made last year although frenzel predicted 
that advocates of education the environment day care and aid to 
the homeless would complain that they got less than was needed 
the bush budget is a tough one giving first priority to deficit 
reduction frenzel said in a statement it will be subject to 
lots of negotiation but it is an important step toward a deficit 
solution 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn welcomed 
bushs emphasis on what he termed neglected social programs but 
added unfortunately president bush gave us a minimum down 
payment on his kinder gentler america with no clear indication 
of how he intends to make the necessary annual payments 
bush continued the reagan administrations practice of using 
unrealistic economic assumptions to pretend that the deficit is 
smaller sasser charged and the president painted an optimistic 
picture but shunned the responsibility for telling us what the 
sacrifices will be and who will make them he said 
overall the bush budget outline does not meet the rigorous 
economic demands of this moment in americas history said sasser 
it gives the illusion of deficit reduction without decisively 
addressing the deficit problem 
wright too hinted that he would look to the administration for 
more than small symbolic steps to fulfill promises to protect the 
environment aid education and fight drugs 
we know and you know that these goals cannot be achieved by 
words alone or by symbolic gestures wright said in a democratic 
counterpoint to bushs nationally televised budget speech they 
require money 
in his remarks wright pointed to some democratic priorities for 
the year including an increase in the minimum wage employerpaid 
health insurance for all workers boosting the share of cleanup 
costs paid by polluters and reining in the wave of leveraged 
corporate buyouts 
earlier in a speech at the national press club house ways and 
means committee chairman dan rostenkowski dill promised to fight 
bushs call for a cut in the tax rate on capital gains to 15 
percent reflecting the views of many democrats that such a break 
unfairly favors the rich 
im not about to tell the wage earners in chicago that they 
should pay a higher tax than stockbrokers rostenkowski said 
wright for his part said we would have to reject any kind of 
flexible freeze that would bend with flexibility for the rich and 
powerful but freeze out the middle income families of america 
but both wright and sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who shared the 
stage for the democrats televised response avoided any sharp 
disagreements with bush on specific programs we want to give him 
a chance to be heard wright said 
but some republicans were almost as wary as the democrats its 
not immediately apparent how all those initiatives are going to be 
paid for even with the defense freeze said sen gordon j 
humphrey rnh 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif said 
while bushs call for cooperation was welcome he left many 
questions unanswered 
many of the tough choices on deficit reduction were put off for 
another day he said adding that he and sasser would meet with 
bush budget director richard darman next week to quiz him about 
budget specifics 
in his response bentsen echoed the theme of his losing 1988 
campaign for vice president saying democrats will be guided by a 
set of enduring values at the top of that list is good jobs at good 
pay 
and he picked up bushs competitiveness theme noting that 
american workers are no longer the best paid in the world and that 
the nation is suffering from technological competition from its 
allies 
its all very well to say read my lips bentsen said in a 
reference to bushs oftquoted antitax pledge japanese computer 
companies tell customers read my chips its effective even the 
pentagon buys japanese microchips

a state appeals court thursday ruled the husband 
of a comatose pregnant woman can become her legal guardian so he can 
authorize an abortion that doctors say could help her recover 
but hours later an attorney for two antiabortion activists said 
he obtained a stay from the court of appeals the states highest 
court blocking martin klein from becoming the guardian of his 
32yearold wife nancy 
their action evoked an impassioned plea from klein last thursday 
im begging the american people to please help us he said by 
telephone from the couples home in the long island suburub of upper 
brookville 
our family is beaten down were torn up these strangers have 
come off the street and are intruding in our lives we dont know 
what to do about it 
klein was awarded the guardianship tuesday in a state trial 
court but that decision was stayed pending the outcome of the first 
appeal the appellate division of the state trial court thursday 
dismissed requests by the two antiabortion activists to be 
appointed guardians of mrs klein 
before the stay was granted klein said he was relieved and 
pleased with the appeals court decicsion 
i hope this will be the end of it now he said 
in rejecting the first appeal the fivejudge appeals panel said 
the record confirms that these absolute strangers to the klein 
family whatever their motivation have no place in the midst of 
this family tragedy 
but john short and john broderick who filed the appeal said 
they would take the case to the court of appeals 
it would be a tragedy if they go through with that abortion 
short founder of the long island righttolife committee said by 
telephone 
late thursday a lawrence washburn brodericks attorney said 
he had obtained a temporary stay from the court of appeals in 
albany he said no hearing was immediately scheduled he said the 
appeal had been filed before thursdays ruling and the temporary 
stay obtained by telephone 
mrs klein who is approximately 17 weeks pregnant has been in a 
coma at north shore university hospital in manhasset since a dec 13 
car accident hospital spokeswoman alice siegel said the hospital 
had confirmed the temporary stay with the court of appeals 
she is severely brain damaged and is given a slight chance at 
recovery klein sought an abortion for his wife after he said some 
physicians advised him that an abortion may enhance her recovery and 
could save her life the couple has a 3yearold daughter 
in testimony before the appeals court five medical experts said 
that pregnancy increased the risks for the comatose patient and 
could possibly threaten her life but two medical experts testified 
the pregnancy was not lifethreatening 
the appeals court said klein was fully capable of handling his 
wifes affairs and while medical opinion may be divided the 
record indicates that he intends to act with the full support of 
mrs kleins parents in such a manner so as to enhance his wifes 
chances of recovery 
in the lower court ruling judge bernard mccaffrey said that as 
of this time an abortion is not medically necessary to save mrs 
kleins life 
but mccaffrey said the issue before the court was mrs kleins 
constitutional rights if she were competent he said she would 
have the absolute right to an abortion up to the 24th week of 
pregnancy

police and paramedics should be wary of aids 
treating any body fluids they cant be sure of as dangerous 
according to new congressionally mandated recommendations from 
federal health authorities 
a 45page report from the centers for disease control contains 
tips for emergency medical technicians paramedics firefighters 
police officers and prison guards to avoid the virus that causes 
aids 
blood the cdc report stresses is the single most important 
source of hiv aids virus in the workplace setting and while 
aids transmission has not been documented through urine or sweat 
for example other bodily fluids also can carry the virus 
the cdc noted that the unpredictable circumstances faced by 
emergency workers may make differentiation between hazardous body 
fluids and those which are not hazardous very difficult and often 
impossible 
therefore when emergency medical and publicsafety workers 
encounter body fluids under uncontrolled emergency circumstances 
they should treat all body fluids as potentially hazardous 
the cdc recommends a wide range of precautions for various 
occupations and settings masks goggles gloves and gowns when 
handling a patient or prisoner who is bleeding badly but nothing 
more than disposable gloves for workers placing intravenous lines in 
patients 
officials of the cdc and the national institute for occupational 
safety and health learned from meeting with paramedics police 
officers and other personnel to discuss the recommendations said 
phil strine an aids specialist with niosh in atlanta 
we knew emts emergency medical technicians saw a lot of blood 
and body fluids he said what we didnt really realize before 
was how uncontrolled their environment is when its 3 am and its 
raining and youre pulling people out of a car you dont have time 
to tell what the fluid you see is 
the cdc report released this week also recommends special masks 
for use by workers giving mouthtomouth resuscitation although no 
aids cases have been traced to the procedure and the potential for 
salivary transmission is remote the agency said 
the cdc noted that 169 healthcare workers in this country have 
acquired aids with no other explainable risk factors the deadly 
disease chiefly strikes homosexual or bisexual men and intravenous 
drug users 
detailed information is available for 44 of those cases and they 
include nurses or nursing assistants doctors lab technicians a 
dentist and a paramedic 
three law enforcement officers also have similar cases 
followup investigations of the police and paramedic cases 
could not determine conclusively if their aids infections were 
jobrelated the cdc reported 
a number of cases have been reported previously in which doctors 
nurses or other healthcare workers have been infected with aids 
following needlesticks cuts or other injuries while working with 
aids patients 
to prevent needlesticks the cdc recommended that needles should 
not be recapped purposely bent broken by hand or removed from 
disposable syringes by hand and should be disposed in 
punctureresistant containers 
many of the cdcs precautionary recommendations such as the use 
of gloves and masks in certain situations were included in aids 
precautions the agency released for health care workers more than 
three years ago those recommendations urge that all medical 
patients be assumed to be infectious to guard against 
transmission of disease 
but the way that specific occupational groups or situations are 
addressed in the new report is different from anything weve had 
in the past strine said 
aids has now struck 85590 people in the united states killing 
48957 of them so far

less than four years ago donald johnson was cited 
for heroism after he rescued a family from a fire last week police 
fatally shot the teenager after he took a greyhound bus for a joy 
ride 
police maintain they shot at the bus killing johnson because he 
was endangering the lives of others by refusing to stop driving 
erratically through a boston neighborhood late at night and city 
officials in preliminary findings say the shooting was justified 
but his mother betty johnson a longtime community activist and 
other black leaders claim that police overreacted shooting someone 
who was unarmed and had no criminal background 
this means a black kids life in boston doesnt mean very 
much said the rev graylan ellishagler a minister in the mostly 
black neighborhood of roxbury police dont hesitate to use deadly 
force against kids of color 
mrs johnson 48 is unable to explain why her son a junior in 
high school who turned 19 the day before he died took the bus on 
jan 31 
she was further embittered by the fact that she was not notified 
by police about her sons death learning about it from a newspaper 
the next morning the boston herald ran an associated press 
photograph of her son taken at the scene the newspaper said the 
teenager had not been identified 
police spokesman james jordan on thursday said police did not 
know who johnson was until his mother having seen the picture in 
the newspaper went to the city morgue and identified him 
mrs johnson said she remembers her son as a boy with a heart 
of gold a boy scout who worked with her on community projects and 
was active in youth antidrug work 
donald wasnt on drugs he wasnt a drinker said mrs 
johnson im not saying he wasnt wrong in what he did im saying 
he wasnt out to hurt anybody 
if police had given him half a chance he would have come home 
to me in the bus and i could have gotten him out of there 
certificates attesting to donalds community work sit on a shelf 
surrounded by the plaque he received in 1985 for rescuing a mother 
and her three children in a fire in suburban winchester he and a 
friend were out selling candy when they spotted the blaze and led 
the family to safety 
family and friends said johnson wanted to be a bus driver and 
called him a dreamer 
police said johnson stole a greyhound bus in providence ri 
and drove it 50 miles to boston 
officers spotted the bus in the chinatown section of the city 
about 1025 pm a chase ensued through urban neighborhoods 
reaching 40 mph on small side streets he was apparently heading to 
his mothers home 
as the chase neared an end the bus hit several cars and struck a 
garage before stopping before a vacant house on a deadend street 
police say officers approached the bus when it suddenly leaped 
forward ramming into the house the driver then threw the bus into 
reverse hitting several police cruisers no officers were injured 
about five officers opened fire at the bus as it backed out of 
the street rounded the corner and came to a stop nearby johnson 
was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound authorities said 
a group led by ellishagler is conducting an independent 
investigation of the shooting and says johnson was wounded twice 
not once as authorities said 
separate investigations are being conducted by the suffolk county 
district attorneys office police and the metropolitan district 
commission whose police force also was involved in the chase still 
being determined officials said are which officer fired the fatal 
shot and whether johnson had drugs or alcohol in his system at the 
time of the chase 
but in preliminary comments mayor raymond flynn who had posed 
proudly with johnson after the fire rescue in 1985 backed the 
officers 
under the circumstances the law required that the police take 
some action to protect themselves and the public flynn said last 
week i dont think it is fair to jump all over the police every 
time they go out and do their job 
first assistant district attorney paul k leary said a day after 
the shooting that his preliminary investigation showed it appeared 
to be justified ellishagler disagrees 
it wasnt something to die for he said to spend all that 
time and energy chasing a greyhound bus with all the drugs and the 
gang activity around here is such a waste

a posh retreat laid out more than 800 years ago 
for emperors awaits president and mrs bush when they come to china 
feb 25 the guesthouse has 26 rooms in its two stories and costs 
20000 a night for regular guests 
an electric massage chair and whirlpool bath is in the main 
bedroom 
the diaoyutai state guesthouse stands almost as a contradiction 
to the austerity of todays china 
yes we are socialist explains sun guotong one of the 
officials who run the place but for heads of state you must have 
such things 
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union will stay 
there when he visits in may so will prince charles and princess 
diana when they come in november 
the 26room guesthouse on the complex simply called no 18 was 
remodeled for queen elizabeth ii when she visited beijing in 1986 
the chinese government pays the bill for official and state 
guests such as these but others have to come up with 20000 a 
night 
diaoyutai which means fishing terrace sits on 100 acres of 
pine groves where peacocks wander and swans grace a pond 
the complex is made up of 15 large guest villas no 18 is the 
most sumptuous 
from its goldplated bathroom fixtures and silkcovered walls to 
its displays of ancient bronzeware and gold cloisonne the villa 
radiates luxury and elitism in a grubby gray city where 
egalitarianism so lately was in style 
but ideology seems to stop at the gates to diaoyutai even during 
the extreme leftist cultural revolution of 196676 chairman mao 
tsetungs wife jiang qing relaxed in villa no 17 by watching 
western movies 
chinas shifting foreign policy can be charted however from the 
guest list in 1959 when the separate villas were built most of 
the guests were communist comrades 
now director cheng shaoliang said most guests are americans and 
japanese 
the vietnamese revolutionary ho chi minh soviet leader nikita s 
khrushchev president francois mitterrand of france and presidents 
richard m nixon jimmy carter and ronald reagan were among the 
parade of world leaders who stayed at diaoyutai 
other hotels in beijing may be more convenient guests can 
come and go more freely cheng said in a recent interview but 
we offer quiet and security they cant match 
diaoyutais telephone operators are ordered not to connect calls 
to guests if the caller doesnt know their room number the police 
who stand at attention at the compounds gates admit only cars whose 
license plates have been cleared in advance 
for the guests however almost anything is possible cheng tells 
a story of a guest years ago who wanted water chestnuts during the 
winter when they were out of season the guesthouse sent peoples 
liberation army soldiers to a nearby lake to cut through the ice and 
try to find some he said 
now we wouldnt do that cheng said but almost diaoyutai 
sends its own trucks to the coast to pick up fresh shrimp and has 
special ingredients flown in from all over the country 
it pays 1000 yuan 270 a pound for a rare herb necessary for a 
special scallop soup 
hotels wont do that cheng said 
with that kind of overhead rates start surprisingly low at 140 
a night for a standard room presidential suites cost 500 a night 
but the fanciest villas no 12 and no 18 must be rented in 
their entirety for 20000 a night 
among other recent users of no 18 were prime minister rajiv 
gandhi of india and armand hammer the american industrialist 
prince charles and princess diana are booked for nov 1 
no 18s presidential suite includes separate hisandher 
bedrooms and bathrooms each thickly carpeted and decorated with 
costly art works 
he gets the electric massage chair and whirlpool bath 
she gets a sunken tub with brass rails 
to help cover its annual 28millionyuan 75million budget 
diaoyutai began selectively accepting nonvip tourists and 
businessmen in 1980 and opened a club for locally based foreign 
businessmen last year 
but nonvips need connections to get a room reservation 
people cant come in off the street said sun guotong 
chengs deputy 
the club with a 40000 membership fee also is intended only 
for the leading people sun said 
if a lot of people come the air is not so fresh he added 
while walking through the deserted exercise room threelane bowling 
alley and billiards room the indoor swimming pool is only four feet 
deep very safe for visiting leaders sun said 
he paused in front of a green feltcovered table used for playing 
the chinese tile game of mahjong and pushed back the pieces to 
reveal a mechanism that automatically lines up tiles for each new 
game 
mahjong in china is practically synonymous with gambling which 
is illegal do guests gamble 
i dont know sun said diplomatically

an artist who designed a pair of earrings made from 
freezedried human fetuses has been fined by a court that ruled the 
earrings violated public decency 
the court thursday also fined the curator of an art gallery where 
the earrings were displayed 
a defense lawyer said the earrings were meant to denounce 
abortion but a judge said they were offensive 
the case centered on earrings made from two freezedried fetuses 
that were attached to the ears of a female dummy and displayed in a 
glass case in december 1987 
police raided londons young unknowns gallery the day the item 
went on display the case aroused heated debate in artistic circles 
where it was viewed as a test of cultural tolerance in britain 
judge brian smedley said he accepted that artist rick gibson a 
canadian living in london and gallery curator peter sylveire were 
sincere in their motives 
but he added in any civilized society there has to be a 
constraint on freedom to act in a way which has an adverse effect on 
other members of the society in which we live 
there are some things which although in your view have 
artistic merit are nonetheless so offensive that the public simply 
will not tolerate their exhibition smedley said 
gibson 37 obtained the 3 to 4monthold fetuses from a london 
college professor according to court testimony 
geoffrey robertson sylveires attorney said the work was a 
profoundly moral comment on a society that allows abortions to 
destroy tens of thousands of fetuses every year and tolerates animal 
furs as acceptable attire 
smedley told the jury it was not to judge the works artistic 
merit you are here to set the standards of public decency he 
said 
after deliberating for five hours the jury voted 102 to convict 
on charges of outrage to public decency gibson was fined 875 and 
sylveire 43 was fined 610

a motorist who eluded authorities 
for 2 years using attorneyclient privilege has been sentenced to 
30 months probation in the hitandrun death of a 28yearold man 
william d morser 55 was also ordered thursday to surrender his 
drivers license for 18 months and perform 500 hours of community 
service for leaving the scene of the accident that killed mark 
baltes on march 9 1986 
the victims mother was hoping for a stiffer sentence for morser 
who said he failed to stop after running over baltes prone body on 
south ocean boulevard in palm beach because he thought it was a pile 
of rags 
this man has no remorse he took a human life i feel he should 
be punished through the penal system of the court mildred baltes 
of middletown ny said after the ruling by palm beach circuit 
judge thomas sholtz 
morser a delray beach restaurateur changed his plea from 
innocent to no contest thursday in order to put an end to the highly 
publicized case his attorney barry krischer said 
morser who still faces a 6 million civil lawsuit by baltes 
family had faced a maximum sentence of one year in jail under state 
guidelines 
the case drew national attention when it was learned that the 
driver of the hitandrun vehicle had hired a lawyer the day after 
the accident krischer refused to disclose his clients name citing 
the attorneyclient privilege of confidentiality 
investigators first suspected morser on nov 3 1988 after 
inspecting his white buick riviera which resembled the car that 
struck baltes 
morser came forward two days later identifying himself as the 
driver under the terms of the subpoena issued to compel him to talk 
about the case morser was given immunity in exchange for a 
confession 
morser has denied he was at fault in the accident blaming baltes 
for being in the road in the middle of the night tests showed 
baltes had a blood alcohol level of 026 percent more than 2 times 
the legal limit in florida 
morser said he didnt realize he had hit a person until he read a 
newspaper the next day after learning a man had been killed he 
decided to seek a lawyers advice 
in the ensuing months krischer refused to disclose his clients 
identification despite the lawsuit brought by baltes parents

a year after she took over arizonas top job from 
evan mecham gov rose mofford says she has brought stability to 
the state and plans to run for a full term but some critics suggest 
shes in over her head 
the 66yearold democrat who often refers to herself as 
arizonas mother and is instantly recognized by her beehive hairdo 
has found it tough adjusting from the popularity that went with her 
largely ceremonial position of secretary of state to the controversy 
that goes with being chief executive 
she has tried to quiet those voices with such bold proposals as 
255 million in new taxes to balance a 335 billion budget on top 
of the 180 million tax increase she approved last summer she also 
has stood up to controversy by vetoing measures approved by 
lawmakers 
mrs mofford became acting governor when mecham the firstterm 
republican elected to the post in 1986 was impeached a year ago 
this week he was convicted and removed from office in april and 
she became governor 
mrs moffords supporters attribute what they acknowledge as her 
slow start to that turmoil 
they sort of hit the ground without any time to get 
organized said bill jamieson a former cabinet chief to 
democratic gov bruce babbitt mechams predecessor its like 
changing the tires of a truck while its still going down the 
highway 
but others see deeper problems saying mrs mofford lacks 
selfconfidence and is hurting herself by her reluctance to explain 
herself to lawmakers the news media and the public 
i dont have a theory on what is bedeviling this 
administration but clearly at this point it cannot be labeled a 
smashing success said jack lasota a former state attorney 
general and babbitt chief of staff 
shes in way over her head said republican senate president 
robert usdane 
roses problem is that she is so unsure of herself said rep 
peter goudinoff a tucson democrat and professor of political 
science at the university of arizona 
still goudinoff said he sees government moving forward after 
years of inertia in during the lameduck period of the babbitt 
adminstration and mechams crippled shortened term 
mrs mofford and top aides declined to be interviewed about the 
first year and what comes next but she said monday that her major 
accomplishments have been the staff i was able to assemble and the 
appointments i have made 
i think stability has been brought back to the state she 
added she plans to run for a full term next year 
she remains popular with voters though the level of satisfaction 
has ebbed a bit a behavior research center survey of 713 state 
residents in early january found 40 percent rated her good or 
excellent compared with 45 percent in a similar survey in july 
thirtyone percent rated her fair the same as in july but 14 
percent saw her as poor or very poor up slightly from 11 percent in 
july the pollsters said their margin of error was plus or minus 34 
percent 
politicians say journalists have treated mrs mofford more gently 
than they did mecham but there have been some embarrassments during 
her first year 
reporters found that while secretary of state and in charge of 
financial disclosure regulations she had failed to list property 
loans and income on the same disclosure forms that got mecham in 
trouble 
they also found that over five years as secretary of state she 
had spent at least 50000 in state funds on gifts to visiting 
dignitaries and office decorations while telling the public she paid 
for such things herself 
even ribboncutting and making speeches a favorite mofford 
pastime turned sour when she fell from a platform at a speech and 
suffered a concussion she worked a limited schedule for weeks 
afterward 
ken smith mechams last press secretary says mofford aides are 
smart to keep her away from most media contact because she does 
not cope well with those kinds of stressful situations 
mrs moffords few news conferences have been short 
reporters and the public have had difficulty getting answers 
to such questions as how she feels about restricting abortion or 
reinstating arizonas death penalty in the wake of a court decision 
invalidating it some newspapers have dubbed her the stealth 
governor 
yet in addition to showing courage by proposing new taxes mrs 
mofford won praise for vetoing a bill giving the states largest 
telephone company a tax break more controversial were her vetoes of 
a measure that would have allowed communities to set their own 
obscenity standards instead of relying on a statewide standard and 
one that would have made it a felony for people who know they have 
aids to have sex without telling the partner 
shes not a caretaker at all said state health director ted 
williams who has served five governors in a variety of posts any 
time i have any questions any time i want any policy clarified she 
has been there

president saddam hussein of iraq has 
foiled a military coup attempt that may have included plans to bomb 
his reviewing stand on armed forces day diplomats in baghdad report 
they said he remains firmly in control of the nation he has ruled 
for a decade and would not have visited north yemen in midjanuary 
if he had been worried 
iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz told reporters in new york on 
thursday reports of a coup attempt in his country were completely 
baseless adding we absolutely deny claims that iraqi army 
officers were punished 
aziz met un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar at un 
headquarters on thursday regarding peace talks with iran 
reports of the coup attempt centered on air force officers from 
samarra whose people are traditional rivals of husseins clan in 
tikrit another provincial town 
an armed forces day parade scheduled for jan 6 was canceled 
without explanation and european defense ministers who had been 
invited were asked stay away 
some diplomats in the iraqi capital said the plan was for three 
air force planes to bomb the presidents reviewing stand 
while acknowledging details were sketchy they pointed to the 
absence in public of air marshal hamid shaaban the air force 
commander highly decorated by hussein during the eightyear war with 
iran they said this indicated a plot and said shaaban might have 
been executed 
others said the attempt was made while hussein visited egypt in 
december with the result that up to 200 military officers and 
members of the ruling baath socialist party were executed 
dissident kurdish groups and iraqi exiles have reported the 
executions 
earlier reports said a top military commander disappeared just 
after the aug 20 ceasefire in the war with iran and two others 
died in mysterious helicopter crashes 
hussein 51 became vice president when the baath socialist party 
seized power in 1968 and has been president since 1979 he rose 
through the political ranks not the military 
iraq was plagued by coups before the baath party took over and 
islamic fundamentalist groups loyal iran tried to assassinate 
hussein several times in the early years of the war 
he has controlled the military by appointing members of his 
tikrit clan to the most sensitive posts and keeping other officers 
in line with a combination of favoritism and purges 
a middle east dipomat said he got rid of any generals or 
commanders as soon as their stars started to shine a bit brighter 
according to a western envoy theres always some potential for 
a coup the only plausible quarter is from the military 
the diplomats speculate that plotters may have been encouraged by 
trouble within husseins tightknit clan over his treatment of his 
eldest son odai who killed a favorite presidential bodyguard in 
october 
they said the son was imprisoned but later released and now is 
believed to have a diplomatic post in switzerland 
husseins wife protested when he ordered that odai be tried 
publicly for what some saw as a tragic accident and she went to 
live in switzerland where she remains the diplomats reported 
gen adnan khairallah her brother and iraqs defense minister 
also had a brief falling out with hussein because the general 
intervened they said 
if the opposition had come from any other direction saddam 
would not have hesitated in chopping their heads off but this was 
his clan the middle eastern diplomat said 
serious economic problems have gained attention in iraq since the 
ceasefire 
the president wants to revive ambitious development plans he had 
before the war including construction of steel and petrochemical 
industries that can produce hightech weapons 
his government borrowed an estimated 70 billion during the war 
and creditors are pressing for payment but none has offered to help 
finance reconstruction 
iraq still has 1 million men under arms and military analysts say 
it cannot afford to keep them there for long but demobilization 
would them on an economy with no industrial base 
many lack basic job skills because they have been fighting a war 
for eight years one diplomat said frustration might lead them to 
take up arms against the government if they became unemployed 
civilians

inaugural addresses are the style but budgets 
are the substance of new administrations with his first spending 
plan george bush completed the transition from the reagan to the 
bush presidency 
i dont propose to reverse direction bush told the nation 
thursday night in a televised speech to a joint session of congress 
what he set forth was a shift in direction not a reversal or a 
sharp turn while the direction remained conservative it was a 
direction that was clearly his own 
a dependence on growth and an opposition to taxes remained 
central to his plan for the economy he stood fast on star wars 
but in many of the priorities and most clearly in the tone this 
was george bush not ronald reagan 
compare their views of government 
government is not the solution to the problem government is 
the problem said reagan early in his presidency 
we in government cannot stand on the sidelines said bush 
when he turned to homelessness 
the new presidents budget offers tangible reminders of his 
campaign pledges to become the education president and encourage 
a kinder gentler nation 
he rejected reagans proposal to cut 17 billion from the 
medicaid health program for the poor he proposed increased spening 
for the head start preschool program as well as a new merit award 
program for schools and increased subsidies for black colleges 
at the same time however bush accepted his predecessors plan 
to cut 5 billion from medicare the corresponding health program 
for the elderly and his overall education budget fails to keep pace 
with inflation 
the overall numbers in fact vary little from reagans budget 
but the changes that bush did make were carefully designed to show 
movement 
hence bushs call for a child care tax credit of 1000 for poor 
families and for an expanded 3000 tax deduction for adoption 
expenses the types of programs reagan so often was accused of 
neglecting 
not only did bush walk away from reagans proposal to increase 
military spending by 2 percent above the rate of inflation but he 
dropped his predecessors militant rhetoric on central america 
for nearly his entire eightyear presidency reagan waged a 
crusade against the sandinista government of nicaragua a campaign 
that resulted in the major scandal of his administration the effort 
to channel covert funds to the antigovernment contra forces 
reagan devoted some of his strongest rhetoric to condemning the 
sandinistas and praising the contras 
this was bushs only reference to the conflict we must stand 
firm for selfdetermination and democracy in central america 
including in nicaragua 
there was a new emphasis on preventing the spread of nuclear 
weapons 
but bush did not turn away from his predecessors plan to 
established a spacebased missile defense system 
i will vigorously pursue the strategic defense initiative he 
said 
the seeds of conflict with the democratic congress were present 
his plan for a cut in capital gains taxes is certain to get a 
cool reception his belief that economic growth will provide new 
jobs and pay for new social programs surely will be tested by 
uncertainty about whether that growth can long be sustained 
but while reagan often fostered conflict even with congressional 
republicans over his budget proposals the new president went out 
of his way to keep relations smooth 
he recalled his own brief service in the house chamber and said 
i feel as if i am returning home to friends 
he continued i intend in the months and years to come to give 
you what friends deserve frankness respect and my best judgment 
about ways to improve americas future 
welcome words to a congress often locked in confrontation with 
his predecessor

federal officials seized 830 cases of kraft 
cheese slices from a manufacturing plant here after a routine 
inspection uncovered animal hair in one sample 
the confiscation of the kraft deluxe american slices was ordered 
by the us attorneys office in minneapolis after the fda found 
three hairs in a sample said jay allen acting director of the us 
food and drug administrations compliance branch in minneapolis 
once we find a violation we seize the entire lot he said 
thursday 
laboratory analysis determined one of the hairs was that of a 
dog allen said test results were not conclusive on the other two 
hairs but they did not belong to humans 
allen said that finding hair in cheese produced in the united 
states doesnt happen a lot 
its really hard to say how it the hair got in there said 
tom nelson consumer affairs officer at the fda in minneapolis 
kathy knuth a spokeswoman for kraft inc in glenview ill said 
marshals tagged the cheese and left it at the plant none of the 
cheese in the lot had reached the market she said 
weve never had a consumer complaint of hair in cheese knuth 
said 
assistant us attorney mary jo madigan said kraft can appeal the 
confiscation order if the company does not challenge the order the 
cheese will be destroyed she said 
knuth said kraft has not decided whether to challenge the order 
she said the fda inspection occurred in middecember but the company 
never received a written explanation of the inspection findings 
despite our request for test results weve received no 
documentation she said we dont know what the situation is 
right now 
madigan said the fda will not seek any damages fines or other 
penalties against kraft

japans parliament resumed business today with an 
address by emperor akihito as it faced the prospect that a stock 
scandal would stall debate on the governments budget for the next 
fiscal year 
the legislative body opened its regular session with the new 
monarchs first appearance in the japanese parliament since he 
ascended the chrysanthemum throne following the jan 7 death of his 
father emperor hirohito 
the 55yearold monarch clad in a formal morning suit said 
japan is expected to promote world peace and prosperity and act as a 
nation that cherishes culture and nature 
i sincerely hope the diet will fully perform its mission as the 
highest organ of state power akihito said in a brief speech 
prime minister noboru takeshita and other top officials of the 
majority liberal democratic party were expected to address the 
parliament or diet 
opposition parties were widely expected to disrupt parliamentary 
proceedings with demands that takeshita or other top leaders resign 
to take responsibility for the involvement of prominent party 
officials in the scandal 
about 150 influential politicians bureaucrats and executives 
have been implicated in the scandal arising from purchases of shares 
in recruitcosmos co prior to their listing on tokyos 
overthecounter market 
although the government has determined the transactions were not 
illegal the affair has raised suspicions of influence peddling and 
bribery due to numerous financial links between recruit politicians 
and civil servants 
political analysts here say opposition parties are certain to 
demand that key ruling party officials who bought shares from 
recruit or received political donations from the company must 
resign to take responsibility 
opposition boycotts could delay passage of the most important 
item on the parliaments agenda the 4757 billion national budget 
the liberal democratic party which holds a majority of 297203 
in the house of representatives and a 143108 majority in the house 
of councillors often attempts to gain the support of opposition 
parties for its legislation 
in the past year however the party has abandoned traditional 
consensus politics on several occasions to make progress on crucial 
legislation forcing measures through the parliament despite bitter 
opposition from minority parties 
in december the governing party ended a 10year effort to reform 
japans tax system by forcing a set of bills through parliament 
after months of stalling by opposition parties demanding a thorough 
investigation into the recruit scandal

here is a transcript of president bushs speech 
thursday night 
less than three weeks ago i joined you on the west front of this 
very building and looking over the monuments to our proud past 
offered you my hand in filling the next page of american history 
with a story of exended prosperity and continued peace 
tonight i am back to offer you my plans as well 
the hand remains extended the sleeves are rolled up america is 
waiting and now we must produce together we can build a better 
america 
it is comforting to return to this historic chamber here 22 
years ago i first raised my hand to be sworn into public life so 
tonight i feel as if i am returning home to friends and i intend 
in the months and years to come to give you what friends deserve 
frankness respect and my best judgment about ways to improve 
americas future 
in return i ask for an honest commitment to our common mission 
of progress if we seize the opportunities on the road before us 
there will be praise enough for all the people didnt send us here 
to bicker its time to govern 
many presidents have come to this chamber in times of great 
crisis war depression loss of national spirit 
eight years ago i sat in that chair as president reagan spoke of 
punishing inflation and devastatingly high interest rates people 
out of work american confidence on the wane our challenge is 
different 
we are fortunate a much changed landscape lies before us 
tonight so i dont propose to reverse direction we are headed the 
right way but we cannot rest we are a people whose energy and 
drive have fueled our rise to greatness we are a forwardlooking 
nation generous yes but ambitious as well not for ourselves 
but for the world complacency is not in our character not before 
not now not ever 
so tonight we must take a strong america and make it even 
better we must address some very real problems we must establish 
some very clear priorities and we must make a very substantial cut 
in the federal budget deficit 
some people find that agenda impossible but i am presenting to 
you tonight a realistic plan for tackling it my plan has four broad 
features attention to urgent priorities investment in the future 
an attack on the deficit and no new taxes 
this budget represents my best judgment of how we can address our 
priorities there are many areas in which we would all like to spend 
more than i propose i understand that but we cannot until we get 
our fiscal house in order

next year alone thanks to economic growth without any change in 
the law the federal government will take in over 80 billion more 
than it does this year thats right over 80 billion in new 
revenues with no increase in taxes our job is to allocate those 
new resources wisely 
we can afford to increase spending by a modest amount but 
enough to invest in key priorities and still cut the deficit by 
almost 40 percent in one year that will allow us to meet the 
targets set forth in the grammrudmanhollings law 
but to do that we must recognize that growth above inflation in 
federal programs is not preordained that not all spending 
initiatives were designed to be immortal 
i make this pledge tonight my team and i are ready to work with 
the congress to form a special leadership group to negotiate in 
good faith to work day and night if thats what it takes to 
meet the budget targets and to produce a budget on time 
we cannot settle for business as usual government by continuing 
resolution or government by crisis will not do 
i ask the congress tonight to approve several measures which will 
make budgeting more sensible we could save time and improve 
efficiency by enacting twoyear budgets fortythree governors have 
the lineitem veto presidents should have it too 
at the very least when a president proposes to rescind federal 
spending the congress should be required to vote on that proposal 
instead of killing it by inaction 
and i ask for congress to honor the publics wishes by passing a 
constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget such an 
amendment once phased in will discipline both congress and the 
executive branch 
several principles describe the kind of america i hope to build 
with your help in the years ahead 
we will not have the luxury of taking the easy spendthrift 
approach to solving problems because higher spending and higher 
taxes put economic growth at risk 
economic growth provides jobs and hope economic growth enables 
us to pay for social programs economic growth enhances the security 
of the nation and low tax rates create economic growth 
i believe in giving americans greater freedom and greater choice 
and i will work for choice for american families whether in the 
housing in which they live the schools to which they send their 
children or the child care they select for their young 
you see i believe that we have an obligation to those in need 
but that government should not be the provider for first resort for 
things that the private sector can produce better 
i believe in a society that is free from discrimination and 
bigotry of any kind i will work to knock down the barriers left by 
past discrimination and to build a more tolerant society that will 
stop such barriers from ever being built again 
i believe that family and faith represent the moral compass of 
the nation and i will work to make them strong for as benjamin 
franklin said if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his 
notice can a great nation rise without his aid 
and i believe in giving people the power to make their own lives 
better through growth and opportunity together lets put power in 
the hands of people

three weeks ago we celebrated the bicentennial inaugural the 
200th anniversary of the first presidency and if you look back one 
thing is so striking about the way the founding fathers looked at 
america they didnt talk about themselves they talked about 
posterity they talked about the future 
we too must think in terms bigger than ourselves 
we must take actions today that will ensure a better tomorrow we 
must extend american leadership in technology increase longterm 
investment improve our educational system and boost productivity 
these are the keys to building a better future 
here are some of my recommendations 
i propose almost 22 billion for the national science 
foundation to promote basic research and keep us on track to double 
its budget by 1993 
i propose to make permanent the tax credit for research and 
development 
i have asked ice president quayle to chair a new task force on 
competitiveness 
i request funding for nasa and a strong space program an 
increase of almost 24 billion over the current fiscal year we 
must have a manned space station a vigorous safe space shuttle 
program and more commercial development in space the space program 
should always go full throttle up thats not just our 
ambition its our destiny 
i propose that we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to 
increase longterm investment history on this is clear this will 
increase revenues help savings and create new jobs 
we wont be competitive if we leave whole sectors of america 
behind this is the year we should finally enact urban enterprise 
zones and bring hope to our inner cities 
but the most important competitiveness program of all is one 
which improves education in america when some of our students 
actually have trouble locating america on a map of the world it is 
time for us to map a new approch to education 
we must reward excellence and cut through bureaucracy we must 
help those schools that need help most we must give choice to 
parents students teachers and principals and we must hold all 
concerned accountable in education we cannot tolerate mediocrity 
i want to cut the dropout rate and make america a more literate 
nation because what it really comes down to is this the longer our 
graduation lines are today the shorter our unemployment lines will 
be tomorrow 
so tonight i am proposing the following initiatives 
the beginning of a 500 million program to reward americas best 
schools merit schools 
the creation of special presidential awards for the best 
teachers in every state because excellence should be rewarded 
the establishment of a new program of national science scholars 
one each year for every member of the house and senate to give this 
generation of students a special incentive to excel in science and 
mathematics 
the expanded use of magnet schools which give families and 
students greater choice 
and a new program to encourage alternative certification 
which will let talented people from all fields teach in our 
classrooms

i have said id like to be the education president tonight 
i ask you to join me by becoming the education congress 
just last week as i settled into this new office i received a 
letter from a mother in pennsylvania who had been struck by my 
message in the inaugural address not 12 hours before she 
wrote my husband and i received word that our son was addicted 
to cocaine he had the world at his feet bright gifted 
personable he could have done anything with his life now he 
has chosen cocaine 
please she wrote find a way to curb the supply of 
cocaine get tough with the pushers our son needs your help 
my friends that voice crying out for help could be the voice of 
your own neighbor your own friend your own son over 23 million 
americans used illegal drugs last year at a staggering cost to our 
nations wellbeing 
let this be recorded as the time when america rose up and said 
no to drugs the scourge of drugs must be stopped i am asking 
tonight for an increase of almost a billion dollars in budget 
outlays to escalate the war against drugs the war will be waged on 
all fronts 
our new drug czar bill bennett and i will be 
shouldertoshoulder in the executive branch leading the charge 
some money will be used to expand treatment to the poor and to 
young mothers this will offer the helping hand to the many innocent 
victims of drugs like the thousands of babies born addicted or 
with aids because of the mothers addiction 
some will be used to cut the waiting time for treatment some 
money will be devoted to those urban schools where the emergency is 
now the worst and much of it will be used to protect our borders 
with help from the coast guard the customs service the departments 
of state and justice and yes the us military 
i mean to get tough on the drug criminals let me be clear this 
president will back up those who put their lives on the line every 
single day our local police officers 
my budget asks for beefedup prosecution for a new attack on 
organized crime and for enforcement of tough sentences and for 
the worst kingpins that means the death penalty 
i also want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted 
there is a cell waiting for him he should not go free because 
prisons are too full 
let the word go out if you are caught and convicted you will do 
time 
but for all we do in law enforcement in interdiction and 
treatment we will never win this war on drugs unless we stop demand 
for drugs 
so some of this increase will be used to educate the young about 
the dangers of drugs we must involve parents we must involve the 
teachers we must involve the communities and my friends we must 
involve ourselves each and every one of us in this chamber 
one problem related to drug use demands our urgent attention and 
our continuing compassion that is the terrible tragedy of aids i 
am asking for 16 billion for education to prevent the disease 
and for research to find a cure

if were to protect our future we need a new attitude about the 
environment we must protect the air we breathe i will send to you 
shortly legislation for a new more effective clean air act it will 
include a plan to reduce by date certain the emissions which cause 
acid rain because the time for study alone has passed and the 
time for action is now 
we must make use of clean coal my budget contains full funding 
on schedule for the clean coal technology agreement that we made 
with canada weve made that agreement with canada and we intend to 
honor that agreement 
we must not neglect our parks so i am asking to fund new 
acquisitions under the land and water conservation fund 
we must protect our oceans i support new penalties against those 
who would dump medical waste and other trash into our oceans the 
age of the needle on the beaches must end 
in some cases the gulfs and oceans off our shores hold the 
promise of oil and gas reserves which can make our nation more 
secure and less dependent on foreign oil when those with the most 
promise can be tapped safely as with much of the alaska national 
wildlife refuge we should proceed but we must use caution and we 
must respect the environment 
so tonight i am calling for the indefinite postponement of three 
lease sales which have raised troubling questions two off the 
coast of california and one which could threaten the everglades in 
florida action on these three lease sales will await the 
conclusions of a special task force set up to measure the potential 
for environmental damage 
i am directing the attorney general and the administrator of the 
environmental protection agency to use every tool at their disposal 
to speed and toughen the enforcement of our laws against toxic waste 
dumpers i want faster cleanups and tougher enforcement of penalties 
against polluters 
in addition to caring for our future we must care for those 
around us a decent society shows compassion for the young the 
elderly the vulnerable and the poor 
our first obligation is to the most vulnerable infants poor 
mothers children living in poverty and my proposed budget 
recognizes this i ask for full funding of medicaid an increase of 
over 3 billion and an expansion of the program to include 
coverage of pregnant women who are near the poverty line 
i believe we should help working families cope with the burden of 
child care our help should be aimed at those who need it most 
lowincome families with young children i support a new child care 
tax credit that will aim our efforts at exactly those families 
without discriminating against mothers who choose to stay at home 
now i know there are competing proposals but remember this the 
overwhelming majority of all preschool child care is now provided by 
relatives and neighbors churches and community groups families who 
choose these options should remain eligible for help parents should 
have choice 
and for those children who are unwanted or abused or whose 
parents are deceased we should encourage adoption i propose to 
reenact the tax deduction for adoption expenses and to double it 
to 3000 lets make it easier for these kids to have parents who 
love them 
we have a moral contract with our senior citizens in this 
budget social security is fully funded including a full 
costofliving adjustment we must honor our contract

we must care about those in the shadow of life and i like 
many americans am deeply troubled by the plight of the homeless 
the causes of homelessness are many the history is long but the 
moral imperative to act is clear 
thanks to the deep well of generosity in this great land many 
organizations already contribute but we in government cannot stand 
on the sidelines in my udget i ask for greater support for 
emergency food and shelter for health services and measures to 
prevent substance abuse and for clinics for the mentally ill and 
i propose a new initiative involving the full range of government 
agencies we must confront this national shame 
there is another issue i decided to mention here tonight i have 
long believed that the people of puerto rico should have the right 
to determine their own political future personally i favor 
statehood but i ask the congress to take the necessary steps to let 
the people decide in a referendum 
certain problems the result of decades of unwise practices 
threaten the health and security of our people left unattended 
they will only get worse but we can act now to put them behind us 
earlier this week i announced my support for a plan to restore 
the financial and moral integrity of our savings system i ask 
congress to enact our reform proposals within 45 days we must not 
let this situation fester we owe it to the savers in this country 
to solve this problem 
certainly the savings of americans must remain secure insured 
depositors will continue to be fully protected but any plan to 
refinance the system must be accompanied by major reform our 
proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring the best answer 
is to make sure that a mess like this will never happen again 
the majority of thrifts in communities across this nation have 
been honest they have played a major role inhelping families 
achieve the american dream of home ownership but make no mistake 
those who are corrupt those who break the law must be kicked out 
of the business and they should go to jail 
we face a massive task in cleaning up the waste left from decades 
of environmental neglect at americas nuclear weapons plants 
clearly we must modernize these plants and operate them safely 
that is not at issue our national security depends on it 
but beyond that we must clean up the old mess thats been left 
behind and i propose in this budget to more than double our 
current effort to do so this will allow us to identify the exact 
nature of the various problems so we can clean them up and clean 
them up we will 
we have been fortunate during these past eight years america is 
a stronger nation than it was in 1980 morale in our armed forces is 
restored our resolve has been shown our readiness has been 
improved and we are at peace there can no longer be any doubt that 
peace has been made more secure through strength when america is 
stronger the world is safer 
most people dont realize that after the successful restoration 
of our strength the pentaon budget has actually been reduced in 
real terms for each of the last four years we cannot tolerate 
continued real reductions in defense 
in light of the compelling need to reduce the deficit however i 
support a oneyear freeze in the military budget something i 
proposed last fall in my flexible freeze plan 
this freeze will apply for only one year after that increases 
above inflation will be required i will not sacrifice american 
preparedness and i will not compromise american strength

i should be clear on the conditions attached to my recommendation 
for the coming year 
the savings must be allocated to those priorities for investing 
in our future that i have spoken about tonight 
this defense freeze must be a part of a comprehensive budget 
agreement which meets the targets spelled out in the 
grammrudmanhollings law without raising taxes and which 
incorporates reforms in the budget process 
i have directed the national security council to review our 
national security and defense policies and report back to me within 
90 days to ensure that our capabilities and resources meet our 
commitments and strategies 
i am also charging the department of defense with the task of 
developing a plan to improve the defense procurement process and 
management of the pentagon one which will fully implement the 
packard commission report many of the changes can only be made with 
the participation of the congress so i ask for your help 
we need fewer regulations we need less bureaucracy we need 
multiyear procurement and twoyear budgeting and frankly dont 
take this wrong we need less congressional micromanagement of our 
nations military policy 
applause i detect a slight division on that question 
but nevertheless securing a more peaceful world is perhaps the 
most important priority id like to address tonight we meet at a 
time of extraordinary hope never before in this century have our 
values of freedom democracy and economic opportunity been such a 
powerful political and intellectual force around the globe 
never before has our leadership been so crucial because while 
america has its eyes on the future the world has its eyes on 
america 
it is a time of great change in the world and especially in the 
soviet union prudence and common sense dictate that we try to 
understand the full meaning of the change going on there review our 
policies and then proceed with caution but i first personally 
assured general secretary gorbachev that at the conclusion of such 
a review we will be ready to move forward we will not miss any 
opportunity to work for peace 
the fundamental fact remains that the soviets retain a very 
powerful military machine in the service of objectives which are 
still too often in conflict with ours so let us take the new 
openness seriously let us step forward to negotiate but let us 
also be realistic and let us always be strong 
there are some pressing issues we must address i will vigorously 
pursue the strategic defense initiative the spread and even use of 
sophisticated weaponry threatens global security as never before 
chemical weapons must be banned from the face of the earth never 
to be used again and look this wont be easy verification will 
be extraordinarily difficult but civilization and human decency 
demand that we try 
and the spread of nuclear weapons must be stopped i will work to 
strengthen the hand of the international atomic energy agency our 
diplomacy must work every day against the proliferation of nuclear 
weapons 
and around the globe we must continue to be freedoms best 
friend we must stand firm for selfdetermination and democracy in 
central america including in nicaragua for when people are given 
the chance they inevitably will choose a free press freedom of 
worship and certifiably free and fair elections

we must strengthen the alliance of industrial democracies as 
solid a force for peace as the world has ever known this is an 
alliance forged by the power of our ideals not the pettiness of our 
differences so let us lift our sights to rise above fighting 
about beef hormones to building a better future to move from 
protectionism to progress 
i have asked the secretary of state to visit europe next week and 
to consult with our allies on the wide range of challenges and 
opportunities we face together including eastwest relations and 
i look forward to meeting with our nato partners in the near future 
i too shall begin a trip shortly to the far reaches of the 
pacific basin where the winds of democracy are creating new hope 
and the power of free markets is unleashing a new force 
when i served as our representative in china 14 or 15 years ago 
few would have predicted the scope of the changes weve witnessed 
since then but in preparing for this trip i was struck by 
something i came across from a chinese writer he was speaking of 
his country decades ago but his words speak to each of us in 
america tonight 
today he said we are afraid of the simple words like 
goodness and mercy and kindness 
my friends if were to succeed as a nation we must rediscover 
those words 
in just three days we mark the birthday of abraham lincoln the 
man who saved our union and gave new meaning to the word 
opportunity lincoln once said i hold that while man exists it 
is his duty to improve not only his own condition but to assist in 
ameliorating that of mankind 
it is this broader mission to which i call all americans because 
the definition of a successful life must include serving others 
to the young people of america who sometimes feel left out i 
ask you tonight to give us the benefit of your talent and energy 
through a new program called yes for youth entering service to 
america 
to those men and women in business remember the ultimate end of 
your work to make a better product to create better lives i ask 
you to plan for the longerterm and avoid the temptation of quick 
and easy paper profits 
to the brave men and women who wear the uniform of the united 
states of america thank you your calling is a high one to be 
the defenders of freedom and the guarantors of liberty and i want 
you to know that the nation is grateful for your service 
to the farmers of america we appreciate the bounty you provide 
we will work with you to open foreign markets to american 
agricultural products 
to the parents of america i ask you to get involved in your 
childs schooling check on their homework go to the school meet 
the teachers care about what is happening there it is not only 
your childs future on the line it is americas 
to kids in our cities dont give up hope say no to drugs stay 
in school and yes keep hope alive 
to those 37 million americans with some form of disability you 
belong in the economic mainstream we need your talents in americas 
work force disabled americans must become full partners in 
americas opportunity society

to the families of america watching tonight in your living rooms 
hold fast to your dreams because ultimately americas future rests 
in your hands 
and to my friends in this chamber i ask for your cooperation to 
keep america growing while cutting the deficit it is only fair to 
those who now have no vote the generations to come 
let them look back and say that we had the foresight to 
understand that a time of peace and prosperity is not the time to 
rest but a time to press forward a time to invest in the future 
and let all americans remember that no problem of human making is 
too great to be overcome by human ingenuity human energy and the 
untiring hope of the human spirit i believe this i would not have 
asked to be your president if i didnt 
tomorrow the debate on the plan i have put forward begins i ask 
the congress to come forward with your own proposals if they are 
different let us not question each others motives let us debate 
let us negotiate but let us solve the problem 
recalling anniversaries may not be my specialty in speeches but 
tonight is one of some note on feb 9 1941 just 48 years ago 
tonight sir winston churchill took to the airwaves during britains 
hour of peril 
he had received from president roosevelt a handcarried letter 
quoting longfellows famous poem sail on oh ship of state sail 
on oh union strong and great humanity with all its fears with 
all the hopes of future years is hanging breathless on my fate 
churchill responded on this night by radio broadcast to a nation 
at war but he directed his words to franklin roosevelt we shall 
not fail or falter he said we shall not weaken or tire give 
us the tools and we will finish the job 
tonight almost a halfcentury later our peril may be less 
immediate but the need for perseverance and clearsighted fortitude 
is just as great 
now as then there are those who say it cant be done there are 
voices who say that americas best days have past that we are bound 
by constraints threatened by problems surrounded by troubles which 
limit our ability to hope 
well tonight i remain full of hope we americans have only begun 
on our mission of goodness and greatness and to those timid souls 
i repeat the plea give us the tools and we will do the job

here is a transcript of remarks by house 
speaker jim wright thursday night 
for 200 years this nation has given every new president its hand 
and its help and a chance to lead 
senator lloyd bentsen and i are here tonight to tell you that the 
democratic congress wants to work with this president in every way 
that we can well give him our sincere cooperation that does not 
mean obedience it does mean our honest help and our very best 
advice 
in world affairs democrats in congress are committed to seeking 
true bipartisanship in all areas of americas foreign policy as we 
deal with other nations of the world friend or foe americans 
should stand as one 
america struggles today to overcome three enormous deficits the 
budget deficit the trade deficit and the social deficit which 
results from our prolonged underinvestment in such things as public 
education and industrial modernization 
these deficits have been feeding on one another in a vicious way 
in just the short time it took us to hear mr bush make his speech 
tonight the public debt was increasing by about 15 million that 
much is added to our childrens bill every 50 minutes 
as the debt skyrocketed during the past decade the trade deficit 
grew and our standard of living began to fall for the first time in 
modern recollection 
instead of employing americans making goods to sell abroad and 
lending money to those who buy our goods weve been buying things 
that others make and borrowing from them to pay for it and to pay 
for our borrowing weve been selling off little pieces of america 
foreign interests own a bigger and bigger slice of this country and 
thats not good enough 
we have seen the gap grow wider between the rich and the poor in 
our own country and average american families today are finding it 
harder not easier to pay for such necessary things as housing and 
health care and higher education for our children 
as we sit in our warm homes right now gazing at our television 
sets some things are easy to forget i ask you to remember when you 
go to bed this evening that 3 million of our fellow countrymen are 
homeless tonight

a government official said less 
than a third of czechs surveyed can be considered healthy and an 
official newspaper blamed poor nutrition and bad living 
the communist party daily rude pravo in its thursday article 
quoted josef podstata a deputy minister of health care and social 
affairs of the czech socialist republic as citing a selective 
investigation in 1986 that disclosed 669 chronic diseases per 
1000 inhabitants 
the article did not say how many people were surveyed and no 
figures were given on the health situation in slovakia the other 
major region of czechoslovakia 
one citizen out of four dies of cardiovascular diseases and one 
out of four due to malignant tumors the paper said on the most 
frequent causes of death in the czech republic 
there is no doubt a role is played here by the bad living and 
working environment and nutrition ie lack of foodstuffs that 
would correspond to requirments of good nutrition podstata was 
quoted as saying

they have no place of their own to eat or sleep to take a bath 
or wash their clothes their children have no place to study or play 
no these are not just derelicts or neerdowells or social 
misfits they represent many families of the working poor who have 
lowpaying jobs and work every day but just cant find a way to pay 
for the inflated price of housing 
america can do better than that we must do better 
of course we cannot expect to vanquish all these evils 
immediately but if we have the will we can make significant 
progress against all three deficits this year 
we in the congress and surely all americans everywhere are 
anxious to help our new president fulfill his promise of a kinder 
gentler america i want very much to help george bush qualify to 
be known as the education president 
we in congress are eager to help him attain the goals he has 
expressed of wider access for all americans to head start services 
to safe and wholesome child day care in an age when both parents 
must work to affordable housing and to a cleaner environment 
by working hard together we must drive the scourge of drugs from 
our streets and our schools as mr bush pledged in his inaugural 
speech and his speech tonight congress made significant progress 
last year in this truly bipartisan goal we developed a good battle 
plan for the war against drugs but when it came to paying for the 
war the government ran out of money right now were financing not 
a war but a skirmish 
thats not good enough our society can afford to pay for a 
vigorous antidrug effort truth is we cant afford not to thats 
our first line of defense 
that and the education of our children more vital to our 
national security than star wars 
but since 1980 the federal investment in education has actually 
declined by 12 percent is it any wonder that american students 
better fed and surely just as smart do worse in mathematics and 
languages and geography and science than students do in almost 
any other industrial nation 
thats not good enough we can do better than that and we will

working together congress will pass a clean air bill this year to 
protect that precious commodity upon which all human life depends 
a kinder gentler america thats old time democratic religion 
we embrace it enthusiastically 
we know and you know that these goals cannot be achieved by 
words alone or by symbolic gestures they require money the 
commitment of resources sufficient to win the battle against these 
common enemies 
on the question of how these vital initiatives will be paid for 
the democrats in congress will insist on fairness 
we would have to reject any kind of flexible freeze that 
would bend with flexibility for the rich and powerful but freeze out 
the middle income families of america 
we will oppose attempts to cut medicare 
we are ready to meet with president bush any time he wishes and 
seek common solutions our house budget committee will begin its 
formal hearings in just a few days the presidents representatives 
are invited we are determined to complete our work on time and 
pass our appropriations bills on time again this year just as we 
did last year 
we do have limited resources and urgent challenges but you know 
there are some things we can do without spending public money 
we must raise the minimum wage held down for eight long years 
because those who work honestly for wages in america must never 
receive less than they would on welfare 
we can ask that polluters pay more of the cost of cleaning up the 
poisons which they create and from which they profit 
we must encourage american corporations to reinvest in america 
in plants and factories and jobs and strength not in leveraged 
buyouts and paper profits 
we should require that corporations insure the health of their 
employees so that the hardearned family savings of a decade or 
more cannot be just wiped out by the single illness of a child 
when it comes to shaping a kinder gentler fairer nation the 
real test is not whether we have the words but whether we have the 
will for ultimately we will be judged by what we have done 
in the years ahead long after this night is forgotten and the 
phrases have faded and our page of history has turned let it be 
said of us that we have refreshed americas sense of common concern 
that we renewed americas basic strength that together we reached 
out for americas future and put our faith and our investment in the 
american people 
in our earnest efforts to help the new president build this 
future the house and senate will work together the senate 
democratic majority is represented tonight by the chairman of the 
senate finance committee our recent nominee for vice president of 
the united states senator lloyd bentsen

here is a transcript of remarks by sen lloyd 
bentsen thursday night 
my friends george bush and i have had our battles but weve been 
on the same side too as far back as 45 years ago we were both 
young men bomber pilots defending the cause of freedom theres 
nothing like the first puffs of antiaircraft fire to teach a flight 
crew about the need to work together 
tonight were together again democrats and republicans may 
disagree on tactics but we have the same destination in mind a 
strong free prosperous america 
theres a lot we can do together because we have worked as a 
team america is stronger militarily president reagan achieved a 
major nuclear arms reduction treaty thats good 
my old colleague the late scoop jackson once said that in 
foreign policy the best politics is no politics i agree 
democrats wont play politics with matters of war and peace 
remember that military buildup was enacted with lots of democratic 
votes democrats know how to work as a team weve done it 
that doesnt mean we wont disagree therell be sharp 
principled disagreements among democrats and republicans over one of 
the greatest challenges america has ever faced 
because today our great industrial heartland is under attack not 
from foreign military forces from new technology from foreign 
competition often from our allies 
you see the evidence everywhere you see it in ships pulling up 
to american docks loaded not with immigrants but with volkswagens 
you see it in the living rooms of america in those vcrs so many of 
you tonight have sitting beside the tv set none of those vcrs are 
made in america not one its all very well to say read my lips 
japanese computer companies tell customers read my chips its 
effective even the pentagon buys japanese microchips 
the result were losing good jobs and that hurts the very 
fabric of america a few months ago in dawson ga after two 
plants closed wiping out 2000 jobs a high school class was asked 
where they would settle after graduation only two out of 20 wanted 
to stay in dawson at the beginning of this decade our workers had 
the highest average income in the world today that distinction 
belongs to the west germans and the japanese 
is it inevitable that we lose to japan or the other pacific rim 
countries or europe united by 1992 should kids growing up in 
dawson ga settle for a secondclass economy dependent on the 
goods of others 
i dont buy that america is a country of great strength we can 
take charge of our economic future 
but to do that were going to have to be more productive you 
cant have a vacuum tube outlook for the age of microchips well 
have to get tough with those countries whose trade practices are 
unfair we deserve a level playing field and well have to face 
some hard facts 
example under the last administration we became the largest 
debtor nation in history last year our trade deficit was 150 
billion thats cost us 500000 manufacturing jobs 
example the last administration rolled up more debt than every 
administration from george washington to jimmy carter combined this 
year one out of every seven federal dollars another 150 billion 
will go just to pay interest on that debt 
we dont oppose foreign investment but why should the money from 
average taxpayers go to pay off bonds owned by rich bondholders 
whether from tokyo or palm beach how can we stay competitive 
how can we even preserve social security when we saddle ourselves 
and our children with such a debt its like putting lead weights on 
michael jordans legs and asking him to slam dunk anyway

frankly i dont think republicans have faced up to these twin 
towers of debt or some other problems 
education right now 25 percent of our youngsters wont finish 
high school twentyfive million americans cant read the warning 
label on a bottle of poison the army uses comic books for 
instruction manuals theres a fivepage comic to explain how to 
release the hood of a jeep 
how are we going to stay competitive that way we have to cure 
adult illiteracy we must train americans for the sophisticated jobs 
of the 1990s 
the environment we have to send a message to polluters whether 
they dump pcbs into our river beds or fluorocarbons into the 
atmosphere we have to tell them the free ride is over that we want 
air we can breathe and water safe to drink 
and lets send a message to those who think they can fly light 
planes loaded with cocaine across our southern borders or sell 
crack in the schoolyards of new york and chicago the message to 
drug dealers and criminals is this you cant hide behind smart 
lawyers we wont plea bargain away our rights well find you 
well catch you and well put you away 
a few years ago yelena bonner the soviet dissident visited 
america americans dont want war she wrote they want a 
house 
shes right but its becoming harder and harder to find housing 
not just for the homeless but for those who grew up in homes and 
want to buy one for their families for the first time in four 
decades the homeownership rate is declining in america i meet lots 
of young couples whove simply had to move in with mom and dad 
theyd like to be on their own 
and mom and dad think thats a good idea too 
finally ethics do we really want korean companies getting 
favors from influence peddling exadministration officials or 
racketeers in new york getting contracts from cronies of an attorney 
general its one thing to have a government thats a friend to 
business its quite another to have one that just wants business 
for its friends 
george bush is right there is a new breeze blowing through 
washington but dont expect us to stand with our fingers in the air 
to see which way that breeze is blowing we democrats will work with 
president bush but we will be guided by a set of enduring values 
at the top of the list is good jobs at good pay we want american 
workers to be the best paid in the world just as they were eight 
years ago 
you know ive been around a long time but in the last few weeks 
my thoughts have often turned to a man who was around even longer 
in fact for almost half the history of our country 
he was born dirtpoor his parents were homesteaders on the 
plains of south dakota in a sod house when that first blizzard blew 
in the family took turns staying awake during one 36hour stretch 
burning bundles of straw so they wouldnt freeze to death 
they made it through the storm they lived my father worked 
hard he prospered and last fall shortly before his death he had 
the privilege of seeing his son campaign for vice president of the 
united states 
i wish wed done a little better for him 
still my friends in the story of lloyd bentsen sr lies the 
promise of america its a reminder that this country allows those 
who believe in hard work and teamwork to succeed whether 
sodbusting during a south dakota winter or as president 
at this moment when president bush has announced his flight plan 
for the years ahead we democrats in the copilots seat say lets 
work hard together to keep america strong not just in planes 
and tanks but in the factory in the farmhouse and in the 
schoolhouse well make sure that when our children look back on the 
last years of the 20th century theyll say we did the job we kept 
the american dream alive 
thank you and god bless you

senators say the bureau of indian affairs in 
for a major overhaul after an initial series of hearings detailed 
contract fraud mafia infiltration and child sexual abuse on 
reservations 
senators heard emotional testimony thursday from hopi indian 
mothers who say their children were sexually abused at reservation 
schools 
five mothers some near tears told of teachers and relatives who 
had molested children and their desperation to find counselors who 
could help them and their young ones deal with the trauma 
the testimony came as two weeks of hearings wrapped up before a 
special unit of the senate select committee on indian affairs the 
hearings which also detailed fraud in the governments 
indianpreference contract program and mob influence on reservation 
gambling operations are to resume feb 21 
but senators said they have heard enough already to decide that 
the bia is in need of major changes and that more funding is needed 
to help indians victimized by the problems on the reservations 
sen john mccain rariz assured the mothers who testified 
thursday that more money will be provided for counseling centers to 
combat the child abuse problem well get the funding he said 
the mothers told of the case of john boone a former teacher and 
coach at pollaca day school which is operated by the bia on the 
hopi reservation in northeastern arizona 
boone molested 142 to 144 boys over nine years said a mother who 
identified herself as sylvia he now is serving a prison term after 
pleading guilty to sex offenses on the reservation said mary lou 
soller an attorney for the committee 
debra whose son was one of boones victims said she reported 
boone to the school principal in 1986 after her son came home and 
said hed taken a shower with the teacher in the teachers home 
she said the principal got angry with her and took no action 
i was devastated she said 
debra said that to no avail she forbade her sons from going to 
boones house and on one occasion sent her daughter to retrieve 
them 
the daughter told her she saw boone wrestling around with one 
of the boys and stole a sex book from boones house that had 
photos and definitions of sex terms 
this time about a year after the first incident debra went to 
the tribal investigator and later the fbi arrested boone 
during the investigation agents found a list boone kept of boys 
and the kinds of relations he had had with them said sylvia 
another mother mary told of seeing a teacher fondling a little 
girl at the hoteville bacavi school a nonbia school on the 
reservation she said she complained and the teacher was dismissed 
but no other action was taken and he is now teaching in new mexico 
last may as a result of the boone incident the federal 
government set up a child sex abuse center on the reservation to 
provide counseling but the center is understaffed and 38 people are 
on its waiting list said sylvia 
she said some of the boys who were abused by boone are now young 
men who are becoming abusers themselves 
funding for the center is due to expire this may but mccain 
assured that it would not 
dont tell me they the bia dont have the money to go into an 
area where 142 kids have been abused for nine years he said 
sen dennis deconcini dariz chairman of the special 
committee said the bia could expect some major changes as the 
result of the hearings 
when asked after the hearing if the bia needed an overhaul 
deconcini responded its pretty clear it does

president bush promises to relentlessly 
pursue crooked managers of failed savings and loans but his 
attorney general does not expect to recover more than a tiny 
fraction of the billions of dollars in federally insured deposits 
they embezzled or lost 
wed be fooling ourselves to think that any substantial portion 
of these assets is going to be recovered attorney general dick 
thornburgh told the senate banking committee on thursday 
in many cases he said the assets have been dissipated 
through laundering schemes or taken out of the country and are 
beyond the reach of federal authorities 
bushs 90 billion rescue package to take control of the 
remaining insolvent sampls and pay off their depositors would require 
at least 40 billion from taxpayers over the next 10 years 
while acknowledging that taxpayers ultimately will bear a burden 
many lawmakers say they first want federal prosecutors to recover as 
much as possible through forfeitures and fines from what sen 
barbara mikulski dmd called the gogo boys who perpetrated 
this outrageous fraud 
republican sen phil gramm of texas where the biggest portion of 
the fraudulent sampl lending cases have occurred agreed with 
thornburgh that you might not get blood out of a turnip but you 
can get some satisfaction 
the plain truth is that the real crooks have long left the sampl 
business gramm said but we want you to find your meanest and 
toughest prosecutors and go after these people 
rep paul k kanjorski dpa on thursday asked the general 
accounting office to review bushs plan and whether the 50 billion 
in higher insurance premiums that it would impose on sampls and banks 
will drive more of them into insolvency 
thornburgh blamed fraud embezzlement and other insider abuses 
for 25 percent to 30 percent of the sampl failures saying 
whitecollar crime in the industry was responsible for 2 billion in 
losses in 1988 alone 
there are clearly institutions where active criminal activity 
has been the primary source of the failure of the institution or 
losses to the point that it had to be taken over he said 
but he said he could not guarantee that the 600 new prosecutors 
other attorneys and investigators that bush wants for pursuing 
criminal wrongdoing will be able to recover even the 50 million 
that the effort will cost annually 
developers who dealt with many of the failed thrift institutions 
particularly in texas where federally insured deposits were used to 
buy yachts lavish parties and resort homes for sampl owners agreed 
david gleeson president of lincoln asset management co in 
dallas the nations largest apartment developer and also a major 
developer of shopping centers and office buildings told the 
committee he suspects a lot of the money has been squirreled away 
in foreign countries 
even if you could obtain a conviction and prove that funds were 
illegally obtained and used for building a 6 million house in north 
dallas that doesnt go very far in trying to recover 75 billion to 
85 billion gleeson told the senate panel 
thornburgh said the justice department would use the 50 million 
to set up several multiagency task forces similar to a 57member 
team that has been operating in the dallas area for the past 18 
months 
so far that dallas task force has brought eight indictments and 
16 criminal informations against 33 individuals the investigation 
has yielded 20 convictions fines totaling 133250 and 
courtordered restitutions totaling nearly 28 million 
of the 12 people who have been sentenced however only one 
received more than a oneyear jail term and four were placed on 
probation thornburgh said 
bush made his promise to relentlessly pursue sampl fraud cases 
earlier this week when he unveiled his plan which also calls for 
increasing the maximum prison sentences in such cases to 20 years 
thornburgh and other justice department officials acknowledged 
that current federal sentencing guidelines for whitecollar crime 
are too lenient to be an effective deterrent 
for a bank fraud violation resulting in a 25 million loss to 
the victim financial institution for example the culprit could 
receive a mere 30 months imprisonment perhaps even less said 
edward dennis an assistant attorney general in the justice 
departments criminal division

the agriculture department has officially given 
the green light to a scenic byways promotion by the plymouth 
division of chrysler motors but is shying away from endorsing the 
companys products 
a threeway partnership was worked out with the californiabased 
forest education foundation plymouth and usda to help upgrade 
designated scenic stretches of highways into major tourist 
attractions 
f dale robertson chief of the forest service said thursday the 
191 million acres of national forests if gathered in one place an 
area larger than texas offer some of americas most spectacular 
scenery 
this partnership will allow us to showcase the beauty of these 
areas for the american public nearly half of whom spend part of 
their leisure time driving for enjoyment he said 
robertson told a news conference the venture is the first major 
national effort undertaken by his agency with a private corporation 
the agreement is for three years and could be renewed 
he said the forest services involvement with plymouth and the 
foundation is strictly on behalf of the byways program and that the 
company will not be using our logo on any of its products or 
receive any endorsement by the agency 
but robertson and pat smorra general marketing manager for 
plymouth dodged reporters questions about details of the financial 
arrangement between the agency and the company 
smorra said that he was not announcing the exact dollars were 
putting into the program but it is extensive in terms of 
communication efforts as well as promotional efforts 
robertson said the budget proposed for the forest service in the 
1990 fiscal year which begins oct 1 calls for 15 million for 
challenge costshare projects including the byways program 
so we would anticipate at least that amount in 1990 and 
perhaps some more of our budget going into it he said 
the funds call for matching dollars at least from approved 
participants to carry out the costshare projects 
there is some upfront cash from plymouth but im not free to 
say how much right now robertson said 
the scenic byways program began last year with the designation of 
a 26mile stretch of us highway 64 in southeastern tennessee so 
far 30 have been designated covering 1676 miles and others are 
being identified for addition to the system 
one goal is to upgrade the highway areas to make them more useful 
and entertaining for motorists projects can include interpretive 
signs improved road maintenance pullouts at scenic overlooks 
parking areas some rest area facilities and shortloop walking 
trails 
according to an information folder by the nonprofit foundation 
plymouth will publicize the byways through an ambitious 
promotional program which includes 20 exhibitions at heavily 
attended regional consumer shows discreet signage in 3500 plymouth 
dealerships and in 700 hightraffic retail locations and ski 
areas 
the promotion also includes a national sweepstakes with a 
plymouth as grand prize

the entertainment industry wants film and 
television producers excluded from the flood of antiassault weapons 
bills proposed since a schoolyard massacre that claimed the lives of 
five children in stockton 
lisa rawlins director of the california film commission said 
she had already mounted a campaign seeking waivers in 10 
antiassault weapons bills before the state legislature 
when the california film commission meets wednesday in 
sacramento ms rawlins will seek official cfc endorsement of a move 
to preserve the right to use or simulate use of assault weapons in 
entertainment programs no opposition was anticipated she said 
the first such waiver was contained in a los angeles city ban 
approved by the city council and signed wednesday by mayor tom 
bradley 
the ordinance bans the sale of assault weapons and gives owners 
15 days to render such weapons inoperable or surrender them to 
police violators face six months in jail and a fine of up to 1000 
originally the law didnt specifically exclude the entertainment 
industry but councilman zev yaroslavsky revised the proposal at the 
urging of charles weisenberg the citys director of motion picture 
and television affairs 
an assault weapon may be maintained in the possession of an 
entity or establishment engaged in the business of motion picture 
television or video production but only for the purpose of being 
utilized as a prop the city ordinance states in part 
ms rawlins told the industry newspaper daily variety she had 
already alerted the legislative unit of the state department of 
commerce which will be monitoring the proposed state bills and 
induce their authors to offer proposals with industry exemptions 
in addition she plans to enlist the aid of the california league 
of cities and the county supervisors association of california 
los angeles county supervisor kenneth hahn plans to introduce a 
countywide antiassault weapons law next week 
the rush to enact assault weapons bans and restrictions follows 
last months stockton shooting in which a gunman with an ak47 rifle 
killed five youngsters

michael manley who led a procuban 
socialist government in the 1970s swept to victory thursday over 
conservative prime minister edward seaga in an election marred by 
gunfire and allegations of widespread fraud 
with 65 percent of the ballots counted jamaica broadasting 
corp the governmentrun television network declared manleys 
party the winner of at least 34 of the 60 seats in parliament the 
network declared seagas party the winner of eight seats with the 
remaining 18 undecided as of 10 pm est 
under the jamaicas britishmodeled system the party winning a 
majority of parliamentary seats forms the government 
in the popular vote manleys leftleaning peoples national 
party led seagas rightofcenter jamaica labor party vote 57 
percent to 43 percent or 429680 votes to 324486 
let us set an example for all future generations of dignity and 
cooperation in victory manley told a cheering throng outside 
party quarters in kingston 
it is not given to many people a second chance to serve a 
nation he added 
the results closely matched the findings of an opinion poll 
sunday that predicted manleys party would capture 48 of the 60 
seats of parliament seagas party now holds all 60 seats 
seaga conceded at 1045 pm est 
the people have spoken and we abide by their decision he 
said at party headquarters we can hold our heads high as a 
previous government and well hold our heads high as an opposition 
he added we shall take our defeat with a smile indicating 
he would not challenge the results 
manley was prime minister from 1972 to 1980 his government then 
embraced cuba alarming the united states and foreign investors but 
he lately has projected a more moderate image seaga has been one of 
the caribbean regions strongest us allies 
many polling stations closed early because of the violence and 
soldiers fired shots and used tear gas to break up skirmishes 
sporadic gunfire left one woman dead and at least six others wounded 
throughout the day the two candidates accused each other of 
fraud intimidation and voting irregularities 
the killing of glenna williams a 25yearold pregnant houswife 
raised to at least 12 the number of people killed in politically 
related violence since the campaign opened jan 15 seaga said mrs 
williams was shot a minute before he arrived to vote 
it was jamaicas first nationally contested election since 1980 
when an estimated 700 people were killed in political violence over 
a ninemonth campaign 
this campaign was shortened to just over three weeks because of 
fears of violence at the height of the islands winter tourist 
season 
attacks were confined mainly to slums in kingston the capital 
and a few towns where armed gangs control large voting blocs 
montego bay and other beach resorts on the northern coast were calm 
about 10000 police and soldiers were deployed to maintain order 
at more than 6000 polling stations 
some stations closed early because of the disturbances and fraud 
allegations moments before seagas motorcade drove through a 
central kingston neighborhood soldiers fired shots in the air and 
used tear gas to break up fighting and skirmishes outside polling 
stations similar incidents were reported across the country 
about 1 million people were eligible to vote in this country of 
24 million people and lines formed early although there was no 
official estimate voter turnout was heavy 
manley voted at a probation office in kingston he said he 
awakened at 530 am to check polling stations where there might be 
trouble 
he said seaga supporters were harassing his supporters verbally 
at one polling station and five other stations lacked red ink to 
mark voters fingers to prevent people from casting multiple ballots 
noting the atmosphere was less charged than in 1980 manley said 
jamaicans were returning to former habits of holding peaceful 
elections 
after voting at a kingston high school seaga accused his 
opposition of fraud 
the level of stealing of ballot boxes and stuffing of ballot 
boxes backed by intimidation and pressure from adjoining areas and 
by leading political figures is something thats undefinable 
seaga said 
seaga said mrs williams was killed a minute before i got 
there i saw her dead right there police said she was shot when a 
man fired at party supporters 
a member of seagas party sen george ramocan said manleys 
supporters intimidated some voters and that men posing as policemen 
stole ballot boxes from a polling station in a seaga stronghold 
manley dismised seagas charges saying frankly the charge is 
a pathetic excuse for the anticipated defeat for the jamaica labor 
party 
jamaicas leading pollster carl stone of the university of the 
west indies forecast manleys party would win 48 seats 
manley and the peoples national party boycotted the last 
election in 1983 in a dispute over voter registration 
seaga sought a third consecutive term something no prime 
minister has achieved since universal suffrage in 1944 
the campaign centered on breadandbutter issues and the 
contrasting personalities of seaga and manley 
seaga 58 is regarded as a skillful manager but aloof and 
autocratic manley 64 a powerful orator with an engaging 
personality is seen by supporters a champion of the little people 
manley has said he would restore diplomatic relations with cuba 
broken by seaga in 1980 but that priority would be given to good 
relations with the bush administration 
seaga bostonborn and harvardeducated was the first official 
foreign visitor to the reagan white house in 1981 and supported the 
1983 us invasion of grenada 
although seaga restored jamaicas tattered economy he raised 
taxes and devalued the currency cutting deeply into the buying 
power of poorly paid wage earners

broadcasters are going to have a tough time 
convincing congress they can provide balanced coverage of 
controversial issues without a new fairness doctrine a congressman 
says 
rep matthew j rinaldo rnj said at a hearing thursday that 
the doctrine from 1949 until its repeal in 1987 served as a mild 
reminder to broadcasters of their obligations under the law 
it is not the unblinking eye of government on our 
broadcasters said rinaldo the ranking minority member of the 
house commerce and energy telecommunications and finance 
subcommittee 
rinaldo added that while he was encouraged by broadcasters 
performance since the federal communications commission repealed the 
doctrine i think the facts of life are such that they have a 
long way to go before theyre going to convince congress that the 
doctrine is not needed any longer 
in repealing the doctrine the fcc said it violated the first 
amendment and did not serve the public interest broadcasters 
appearing before the subcommittee thursday argued that the doctrine 
was a chilling restraint on broadcast journalism and was an 
anachronism in an era of new technology and media diversity 
john spain news director of wbrztv in baton rouge la said 
the mere threat of a fairness doctrine complaint can make 
broadcasters hesitant to cover controversial issues 
the time and money stations expend whenever licenses are 
threatened by a fairness complaint clearly inhibits and harasses 
broadcasters spain told the panel 
but rep edward j markey dmass the subcommittee chairman 
said writing the fairness doctrine into law would be the 
subcommittees first order of business 
the fairness doctrine did not chill broadcaster speech nor did 
it infringe on broadcasters first amendment rights markey said 
the fairness doctrine did however ensure that broadcasters did 
not infringe the first amendment rights of the rest of us those of 
us without broadcast licenses 
commerce committee chairman john d dingell dmich 
reintroduced a fairness doctrine bill when congress returned to 
washington in january congress in 1987 passed a bill to make the 
doctrine a law but president reagan vetoed the measure the house 
passed the measure again but it did not come to a vote in the 
senate 
dingell said he hopes the bush administration will take a 
different perspective 
dingell left little doubt that congress will not take up other 
issues of concern to broadcasters until the issue of the fairness 
doctrine is resolved 
broadcasting issues congress may consider include possible 
restraints on childrens tv advertising federal support for 
highdefinition television and restoration of rules requiring cable 
tv systems to carry all local overtheair broadcast stations 
dingell said that once this issue has been disposed of we 
can then move on to address other questions and listen to requests 
for special treatment from the broadcasters 
phillip jones executive vice president of meredith broadcasting 
said he objected to use of the fairness doctrine as a bargaining 
chip between congress and broadcasters 
that bothers me greatly because this is my freedom of press and 
my freedom of speech i understand the freight train is coming 
along the track and its very hard to stand in front of this 
thing right now knowing that you want to get this done but i think 
you owe it to your constituents to consider the constitutionality of 
this thing jones said 
we feel that we can administer ourselves that we have the 
best interest of the local community at heart jones said to 
think that we dont want to cover all issues completely is somewhat 
insulting 
rep jim cooper dtenn said congress should pass the bill 
quickly let president bush veto it as he pledged to do during the 
campaign and then let the courts decide the issue 
rep tom tauke riowa took the side of broadcasters saying the

cia director william webster says libya 
recently experienced a serious toxic spill at chemical weapons 
production facilities as the country rushes toward largescale 
manufacture of mustard gas and nerve agents 
webster told the senate government operations committee on 
thursday that the spill occurred at rabta some 60 miles southwest 
of tripoli but he provided no other details 
he said that while such problems are expected to continue libya 
is on the verge of producing a chemical weapons capability far in 
excess of any realistic military needs posing the possibility such 
weapons could be transferred to middle east nations with past links 
to terrorists 
webster based his statements on intelligence estimates 
webster said the libyan facility is the largest single factory 
complex in the third world capable of producing chemical weapons 
iraqs overall chemical weapons potential is thought to be larger 
still he said 
we are concerned that the plants production capabilities far 
far exceed what libya could use for its own military purposes 
webster said 
therefore it becomes a potential brokering agent for other 
countries in the middle east with links to groups which may have 
past terrorist intentions he said he did not elaborate 
webster said the libyan chemical complex is linked to a nearby 
metal fabrication facility equipped with the precision materials 
to manufacture components for a variety of bombs and artillery 
other facilities are involved with filling and storing chemical 
weapons he said 
repeating previous us assertions webster said west german 
companies have given libya extensive assistance to assemble the 
chemical complex and provide materiel for it 
in a related development senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas predicted a strong american reaction unless west germany 
quickly cracks down on companies helping libya develop chemical 
weapons and enacts tough domestic laws to control the export of 
chemical weapons technology and material 
dole said he delivered that message thursday to wolfgang 
schaeuble chief of staff to west german chancellor helmut kohl 
during a meeting in his capitol office 
west germany is among our strongest allies and we cant afford 
to have this important issue on which we should share the same 
view divide us dole said 
dole is pressing for congressional passage of legislation 
imposing sanctions on foreign firms which help libya and other third 
world nations develop chemical weapons 
he said firms providing such assistance have been both witting 
and unwitting about the ultimate nature of the libyan facility 
asked why a western company would knowingly help libya and other 
third world nations achieve a chemical warfare potential webster 
said i can only surmise that greed is the explanation

when the patrician suburb of swampscott asked the 
gritty industrial city of lynn to share its sewage system lynn was 
agreeable but attached one condition help us integrate our schools 
the proposal left some in swampscott in a state of shock 
according to the town clerk and stirred up centuryold differences 
of race and class in the two seaside communities 
i feel very strongly that these people in my neighboring 
community feel that perhaps theyre a better class of people 
because theyre all white and affluent and theyre acting 
accordingly lynn mayor albert divirgilio said thursday 
the arrangement would have advantages for both swampscott a town 
of 14600 characterized by rows of victorian sea captains mansions 
and lynn a city of 79000 that was once the center of the nations 
shoe industry 
most officials agree that a regional school district would cut 
costs swampscott in fact is considering merging its school 
administrative staff with that of nearby nahant another affluent 
community on the other side of lynn 
divirgilio said he wants lynn to be party to such a 
regionalization he said the city could offer the two towns its 
strong vocational school and a wider offering of courses 
but swampscott is reluctant to open its schools to lynn students 
we listened politely but it didnt go over very well said 
swampscott town clerk jack l paster if i had to wager right now 
id say well be building our own sewage plant 
lynn which has been a magnet for immigrants since its peak 
shoemaking days a century ago still attracts newcomers because of 
its relatively inexpensive housing it has a median household income 
of 12000 about onethird that of swampscott 
swampscott officials facing a court order to improve the towns 
sewage treatment system first asked in december whether lynns 
sewage plant could start treating swampscotts waste 
donald brewer the towns public works superintendent said a new 
sewage plant would cost about 163 million some 5 million more 
than building a pumping station and hooking into lynns plant 
divirgilio gave lynns answer two weeks ago in a speech to the 
swampscott rotary club that left the rotarians in a state of 
shock according to paster 
the mayor said lynn would be glad to assist swampscott with its 
sewage if swampscott where 96 percent of the students are white 
would help lynn integrate its public schools 
the state education department is pressuring lynn to eliminate 
racial imbalances in its 17 elementary schools although 31 percent 
of the citys students are black asian or hispanic some schools 
consisted of less than 25 percent minorities last year and others 
more than 50 percent 
unless the city develops a plan to guarantee no recurrence of 
such imbalances the state will cancel a 340000 grant school 
superintendent robert j gerardi said 
divirgilio said his message to the rotary basically was that 
if you want to work with the city of lynn we should work together 
on all our problems not just the ones that are in your favor 
at least he said swampscott should accept lynn students instead 
of the 63 boston innercity students it takes in a program to put 
urban minority children in suburban schools 
swampscott school committee chairman robert ingram said the town 
might consider a limited number of lynn students 
swampscott officials while conceding that a financial and ethnic 
gulf exists between their town and lynn denied that racial or class 
prejudice was a factor in the towns reluctance to merge schools 
rather the issue is control paster said 
we dont want to be controlled by lynn and while it would be a 
nice idea if we could pay one price and tie in the sewers with 
them the mayor of lynn is putting strings on it and people here 
dont want to hear that he said 
swampscott is its own little community with its own way of 
doing things and it doesnt want to be beholden to the big city

president bush is challenging congress to enact 
within 45 days his plan to rescue the savings and loan industry 
including a yearlong study of methods to reduce the scope of 
deposit insurance coverage 
a review by the treasury department of deposit insurance would 
unearth a suggestion that created an uproar in congress when it was 
offered last month by the outgoing reagan administration 
the phrasing in the budget document released thursday is vague 
but trade association officials interpret it as a warning that the 
administration will take another look at lowering the 100000 
insurance limit on bank and thrift institution accounts 
treasurys study would include an examination of incentives for 
market discipline and methods to reduce the scope of deposit 
insurance coverage and the resulting liability of the federal 
deposit insurance corp the budget document says 
with that kind of language wed read it as a red flag said 
diane casey director of regulatory affairs for the independent 
bankers association of america wed oppose any lowering of 
deposit insurance 
many conservative economists argue that deposit insurance 
encourages banks and sampls to take risks because depositors have no 
incentive to monitor the health of their institution others argue 
that reducing deposit insurance could destabilize the financial 
system and contribute to bank runs 
bush outlined most aspects of his sampl program on monday it 
includes using taxpayer dollars and higher industry insurance 
premiums to pay for the 126 billion sampl crisis he also proposed 
restructuring the regulatory system 
in his nationally televised speech to a joint session of 
congress the president called on the legislators to enact the 
proposal within 45 days and pledged insured depositors will 
continue to be fully protected 
we must not let this situation fester he warned adding 
any plan to refinance the system must be accompanied by major 
reform our proposals will prevent such a crisis from recurring 
sen richard shelby dala a member of the senate banking 
committee called bushs appeal to complete a bailout bill in 45 
days a short timetable legislatively but said it is not 
impossible 
wed be moving mighty fast to do that but it can be done 
said rep tom bevill of alabama a senior democrat on the house 
appropriations committee 
rep henry gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee had said in an interview earlier this week he hoped to 
have the bailout legislation reported out of his committee by the 
first week of march 
the hint in the budget on the scope of deposit insurance comes 
only a month after the reagan administration suggested in its final 
economic report that curtailing deposit insurance would restore 
muchneeded discipline to the system 
the treasury department only an hour after the release of the 
reagan report issued a statement disavowing the suggestion 
however later it was reported that the department had considered 
reducing deposit insurance coverage in the early stages of 
formulating bushs sampl policy 
the passage in the bush budget could also be interpreted as 
meaning an investigation of curbing the socalled too big to fail 
syndrome 
regulators have been unwilling to allow large banks to fail 
fearing a possible ripple effect on the financial system so in 
many cases they have been protecting all deposits even those 
exceeding the 100000 insurance limit 
edwin dale an adviser to budget director richard darman said 
the treasury study was intended to find out whether the basic 
concept of deposit insurance should be changed 
however neither the president nor other administration 
officials nor materials given to reporters on monday made any 
reference to examining a reduction in the scope of deposit insurance 
bushs budget also proposed incentives to attract more private 
capital to sampls from banks and other financial service firms an 
apparent reference to lifting barriers to the acquisition of sampls by 
bank holding companies 
the president would also give financial regulators the power to 
set riskbased insurance premiums if further study demonstrates 
the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach currently 
every bank pays the same insurance premium regardless of the safety 
or riskiness of its activities

president bushs education budget makes good on 
his campaign promises but falls short of matching inflation and 
fails to restore cuts made under his predecessor 
bush the wouldbe education president is seeking 441 
million more in education department spending authority than former 
president reagan had recommended most of the money would be used to 
reward good schools and set up magnet schools two ideas bush pushed 
on the campaign trail 
but education officials while welcoming bushs initiatives and 
his proposed 250 million increase in head start funding also noted 
the new presidents budget would not save 24 programs reagan asked 
congress to kill 
and they said that even with the extra money bush has proposed 
the increase is about 360 million short of what would be needed to 
keep pace with inflation of about 42 percent 
funds have been moved around and a few dollars have been added 
but were still dealing with the status quo a maintenance level 
budget said mary futrell president of the national education 
association the nations largest teacher union 
the federal education budget would go from 219 billion this 
year to 225 billion in fiscal 1990 under the bush plan according 
to unofficial department estimates of the 441 million sought by 
bush less than 100 million would actually be spent in fiscal 1990 
the major bush education initiative is 250 million for a merit 
schools program designed to reward schools with safe environments 
highachieving students and low dropout rates grants would average 
about 100000 per school special emphasis would be given to 
schools serving disadvantaged children if congress approved the 
program about 30 million would actually be spent in fiscal 1990 
outlays would rise to 593 million by 1993 
bush is also asking congress to authorize 100 million for magnet 
schools offering specialized curriculum with an emphasis on math and 
science and on recognizing the potential of children from 
disadvantaged families outlays in fiscal 1990 would come to 12 
million the education department already runs a 115 million magnet 
school program but the money is available only for desegregation 
purposes 
bush also called for a 250 million increase for head start the 
preschool enrichment program operated by the department of health 
and human services the program now receiving slightly over 12 
billion currently serves about 20 percent of eligible lowincome 
children 
other education proposals include emergency grants to 
druginfested urban schools endowment grants to historically black 
colleges and universities science scholarships and teacher awards 
grants to help homeless students and illiterate homeless adults 
money to make it easier for scientists engineers and other 
professionals become teachers and principals and grants to schools 
that experiment in a broad range of areas including curriculum 
management and teaching methods 
congress would have to approve all but the homeless programs the 
drugfree school grants and the endowment grants to black colleges 
under the reagan and bush plans more than half of the 750 
million saved by eliminating 24 programs would go to the pell grant 
program for needy college students and the chapter 1 program for 
disadvantaged schoolchildren 
congress has refused in the past to kill the programs reagan and 
bush have targeted for extinction which include perkins or 
campusbased direct loans state student incentive grants that to 
spur states to set up needbased scholarship programs and some 
impact aid which goes to school districts with high enrollments or 
low tax revenues due to federal activities 
the combination of new ideas and old cuts left education 
officials with a kinder view of the bush administration but still 
nursing the wounds of past budget battles 
certainly this is a different administration than the one we 
had before they show a positive inclination to try and do something 
for education there are some promising things said gerald 
morris a lobbyist for the american federation of teachers and 
president of a coalition called committee for education funding 
but the additional investment in chapter 1 will come at the 
expense of other programs morris added thats the other side 
of the coin 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education 
and labor committee said bushs budget does not stem the serious 
erosion of education spending that has occurred over the past eight 
years he called the plan a framework for future discussion and 
i look forward to helping the president do a better job of making 
good on his campaign pledges

president bushs plan to cut 2 billion in farm 
payments next year as a way of mopping up red budget ink makes 
unreasonable demands on agriculture says the top farm lawmaker 
in the house 
we in agriculture are prepared to make a fair contribution 
agriculture committee chairman e kika de la garza dtexas said 
thursday night but this administration is asking us to take cuts 
which represent considerably more than our share of the 
budgetbalancing burden 
his comments came as bush delivered to congress a speech about 
his fiscal 1990 budget which called for something similar to the 
sweeping farm cuts proposed a month ago by an outgoing president 
reagan 
reagan called for a 19 percent cut in overall agriculture 
department spending ranging from payments for crop producers to a 
subsidy for school lunches for youngsters of families earning more 
than 39500 annually 
total usda spending would have dropped from 521 billion 
currently to 424 billion in the fiscal year starting oct 1 
reagan proposed to cut farm payments by 2 billion in next years 
budget but actually would only have reduced payments by 11 
billion paying 900 million to the farmers in the current fiscal 
year 
bushs blueprint said current programs were put in place to 
counter the farm crisis five years ago and noted that the farm 
economy is now flourishing 
it is now time to reform our farm programs and not wait until 
the current farm bill expires two years hence said bushs budget 
book it said agriculture secretary clayton k yeutter would work 
with the congress to develop a specific set of initiatives designed 
to reduce federal farm expenditures by 2 billion in 1990 
de la garza said in a statement however that the bush proposal 
still makes unreasonable demands on agriculture which already has 
given 30 billion in cuts from proposed budgets over the last eight 
years 
the 30 billion figure did not represent rollbacks in actual 
spending but included estimates of outlays under programs altered to 
head off soaring costs 
i would remind everyone that if we cut out the entire amount 
proposed for agricultural spending it would still make only an 
almost infinitesimal impact on the total budget situation de la 
garza said 
most lawmakers were waiting until the nittygritty of the bush 
blueprint became clearer before saying much about it 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas a power on 
agriculture issues met with reporters and pronounced himself 
pleased that bush touched on the farmers in his speech 
rep virginia smith rneb a member of the house appropriations 
committee said she did scan some of the details and found to her 
dismay that bushs assumptions about current spending were at sharp 
variance with those of his predecessor she said that could force 
down next years levels 
tough negotiations are expected between the administration and 
farm lawmakers wary over the reaction of farmers hammered by drought 
last summer and fearing more of the same this year she said 
ultimately mother nature and the us congress will have the 
last word she added 
bush cuts actually would be double the automatic reductions that 
would kick in under the grammrudman law if congress failed to 
reduce the deficit according to senate agriculture committee 
chairman patrick j leahy dvt 
an agricultural budget cutting twice as deep as the 
grammrudman sequester is not a kinder and gentler budget leahy 
said 
he also said reducing farm payments would do nothing to pressure 
americas trading partners to reduce their own agricultural 
subsidies some lawmakers say the way to force down payments that 
spur european community farm exports is for america to retaliate 
with huge subsidies of its own 
actually us subsidies are running at a level of about 13 
billion annually down from twice that amount only three years ago 
when the government pulled out all the stops to get agricultural 
exports moving and pump life into a farm economy that was wallowing 
in the doldrums 
leahy said that when the 1990 reagan budget was released i 
expressed my hope that it was designed to make bush budget kinder 
and gentler 
i also expressed my fear that the reagan farm cuts would 
undermine a tough us negotiating position in the gatt talks he 
said referring to efforts to reduce subsidies through changes in 
the 97nation general agreement on tariffs and trade i am very 
disappointed that the bush budget is neither kinder to the farmer 
nor tougher on our competitors in the gatt negotiations

president bush says former president reagans 
pentagon budget has to be cut but hes leaving it up to his defense 
secretary to figure out where the reductions will be made 
that means it may be several weeks before there are any specifics 
because the nomination of john tower bushs choice as defense 
secretary is bogged down in questions about towers personal life 
and financial dealings 
bush called on thursday for pentagon spending of 3088 billion 
in fiscal 1990 which would maintain defense spending at about the 
current pace allowing for inflation the pentagon is operating on a 
2995 billion budget 
the bush plan is a 2 percent cut from the proposal sent to 
capitol hill a month ago by reagan and bush says he prefers the 
reagan version 
the president would like to embrace even for the short term 
the defense budget projections which are in the reagan budget 
bush said in his budget message unfortunately the current 
economic situation requires defense budget savings 
the bush plan is on target with the predictions of leaders of the 
democraticcontrolled congress who said a month ago that the best 
the pentagon could hope for would be a budget which keeps pace with 
inflation 
there were few details in the bush plan outside his promise that 
the national security council will review us policy and defense 
commitments over the next 90 days 
bush also promised to reform the weapons procurement system but 
offered no specifics the system has been plagued for years by 
inefficiency and cost overruns and now is the target of a justice 
department criminal investigation of fraud 
one reason for the lack of details in bushs speech is towers 
stalled nomination without tower or any of the new toplevel 
defense team in place the pentagon has essentially been rudderless 
according to defense sources 
routine decisions are being made by holdover officials from the 
reagan administration but major decisions have been delayed until 
there is a new defense secretary 
towers nomination wont be voted upon by the senate armed 
services committee for at least two weeks that means that even if 
he were confirmed by the full senate he couldnt take office until 
late in february 
but tower has been advising bush on defense issues and sat next 
to the president thursday in a cabinet review of the defense budget 
he entered the house of representatives with the rest of the cabinet 
to listen to bushs nationally televised address 
one decision that will have to be made quickly is whether to 
build the singlewarhead midgetman nucleartipped missile or a 
railroadbased version of the 10warhead mx missile 
congressional democrats favor midgetman while reagan backed the 
railbased mx in a compromise last year the current pentagon 
budget includes 350 million which can be used for research and 
development of one missile or the other 
but that budget includes a march 15 deadline for making the 
decision unless tower is confirmed soon the decision may be made 
by brent scowcroft bushs national security adviser and a supporter 
of the midgetman weapon scowcroft chaired a 1983 presidential 
commission which recommended construction of hundreds of midgetman 
weapons 
if tower is confirmed he may also seek cuts in star wars the 
current budget is 41 billion and reagan last month proposed to 
increase the figure to 59 billion for the program known formally 
as the strategic defense initiative 
bushs budget plan called for the active pursuit of sdi but 
included no figures last month tower told senators at his 
confirmation hearing there are still a large number of unanswered 
questions about star wars 
the presidents message also urged a new partnership with this 
nations allies particularly in japan and western europe 
although bushs proposal offered no specifics the united states 
has been pushing both japan and the european members of the north 
atlantic treaty organization to increase their contributions to 
allied defenses

barbara blodgett kissed her newborn son as 
she happily recalled that just two months ago suffering from 
cerebral death she became one of the few comatose women in 
medical history to give birth 
since that time mrs blodgett has made a recovery that has 
confounded her doctors 
on thursday she gazed at little simon alan blodgett stroked the 
hair of her other son and nodded her head emphatically when asked if 
she hoped for full recovery she pointed to letters on a piece of 
paper to spell out words 
i felt wonderful the 24yearold woman spelled when asked 
her first response to seeing the newborn 
sitting in a wheelchair with her dark hair in a ponytail she 
watched her husband david feed the baby from a bottle then she 
kissed the infant 
one expert on head injuries speculates that simons birth on dec 
9 may also have triggered his mothers return to consciousness 
following a june 1988 auto accident 
one of the things that occurs during birth is massive changes 
in hormones said dr bill blackerby a specialist in head 
injuries in suburban nashville tenn there could be some 
relationship between hormonal changes taking place and in some way 
maybe that triggered some sort of metabolic process to increase the 
level of alertness 
dr thomas benedetti who delivered the baby said at the time of 
birth that it was only the fourth such case in the world that he 
could locate in medical records 
such a birth is so rare because any injury sufficient to cause a 
coma likely will cause a miscarriage too said blackerby a 
physician at rebound corp a private rehablition center for people 
with head injuries 
comacausing injuries are also commonly followed by respiratory 
problems which can kill a fetus he said 
dr loren winterscheid medical director of seattles university 
hospital said he doubts there is a connection between the birth and 
return to consciousness 
there is no way of knowing when or how much a patient in a coma 
is going to recover he said in a telephone interview from seattle 
although mrs blodgett was never diagnosed as brain dead 
hospital spokesman lg blanchard described her condition as 
cerebral death and her doctors did not hold much hope for her 
recovery winterscheid said 
but within a week after the birth mrs blodgett began to show 
signs of coming out of the coma doctors said since then her 
recovery has been steady 
by midjanuary after returning home she had regained limited 
use of her left hand and the ability to answer questions by shaking 
her head by late january she was able to mouth words could take 
wheelchair rides and hold a bottle to simons lips 
it seems like a miracle to family members who had been warned to 
hold out little hope for recovery 
family members are now watching with interest a new york case in 
which a man is seeking to abort a 17weekold fetus that doctors say 
is threatening the life of his comatose wife 
david blodgett sr mrs blodgetts fatherinlaw said he 
questions the advice of medical experts who recommend the abortion 
suggesting they cannot really know if that will save the mother 
any baby that is conceived should have a chance to live he 
said 
mrs blodgett was thrown from a jeep during an auto accident in 
yakima on june 30 1988 a cousin was killed but her husband and 
young son escaped serious injury 
mrs blodgett who was three months pregnant at the time of the 
accident went into a coma with damage to the cord that connects her 
brain to her spine 
she was transferred on aug 18 to university hospital where 
benedetti and other doctors monitored the pregnancy 
on dec 9 doctors used drugs to induce labor and delivered 
8pound simon by caesarean section

a congress used to being ronald reagans 
whipping boy ambled out of the house chamber thursday night trying 
hard to accustom itself to president bushs offer of partnership in 
shaping the next federal budget 
while the presidents debut of his 116 trillion spending plan 
for fiscal 1990 left many of them suspicious about its details the 
bush tone of conciliation seemed to make the biggest impression on 
them 
in a town that values comity as the best way to make progress 
many of the lawmakers agreed the mood bush strove to create was an 
auspicious way to start the legislative year 
this is a man i can work with said rep charles rangel 
dny the liberal chairman of the house narcotics committee 
with reagan i just never had the opportunity 
being a member of congress for the last eight years meant 
listening to speech after speech in which thenpresident reagan 
vilified the lawmakers as profligates whose unbridled pleasure at 
spending was a key cause of deficits hitting 200 billion annually 
but the president who spoke to the joint session of congress for 
50 minutes thursday was a different man with a different message 
his speech could have been delivered by any democrat said 
sen dale bumpers dark his problem will be getting it through 
his party ours will go along with 70 or 80 percent of it 
we know what we have to do now said sen alan simpson of 
wyoming the republican senate whip we have to go hump 
everyone realizes that once the tough work of actually shaping a 
budget begins there will be conflict as usual many of the 
battlefields on which bush will clash with the democrats who control 
both houses of congress became clear after the speech 
one was the presidents proposal to lump hundreds of programs 
mainly domestic into a single category that in total he would 
restrict to the same amount of spending as this year because of 
inflation population growth and the lurking possibility of 
unanticipated problems such restraint can be tougher than it sounds 
for bush this was a manifestation of his flexible freeze 
approach he mentioned vaguely during the presidential campaign for 
many democrats this was a crafty way of claiming deficit savings 
while leaving the hard choices for later 
its a black box that frankly we havent seen before 
complained rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee 
theres a black hole over at omb into which all these programs 
have sunk said senate budget committee chairman jim sasser 
dtenn referring to the presidents office of management and 
budget which wrote the spending plan 
i suspect his strategy is to not make specific proposals for 
cuts and to try to bring congress into negotiations so congress can 
share the blame for the cuts and the pain sasser said 
many democrats also grumbled that the president had simply not 
provided enough specific information on how the government would 
save raise revenues and reduce spending 
the only thing that troubles me is the arithmetic said rep 
norman mineta dcalif he has a lot of additional programs but 
the arithmetic doesnt add up 
another fight looms over bushs proposal to slash the capital 
gains tax on productive assets held more than two years to 15 
percent less than half the current top rate many democrats find 
his claim that the reduction would increase revenues by 48 billion 
next year to be implausible 
nonetheless senate minority leader bob dole rkan said the 
democratic reaction doesnt mean there wont be some compromise 
and sen robert byrd dwva chairman of the senate appropriations 
committee wouldnt rule out the idea i think hes going to have 
to sell that to the american people he said 
bush won democratic praise for his proposal to limit the increase 
in defense spending to the inflation rate and spreading some of the 
savings around to domestic programs 
nobody can come in and say hes controlling growth in domestic 
programs to fund defense said sen phil gramm rtexas 
overall it was a budget message that left congress feeling like 
it had been offered a hand not a fist 
tonight said sen joe lieberman dconn this was a 
president who didnt want to pick a fight

social services groups welcomed president 
bushs budget plan restoring funds that former president reagan had 
proposed cutting from medicaid but they said he should have done 
the same with medicare 
bushs proposal incorporating reagans 5 billion in medicare 
savings extinguishes forever some of the presidents vaunted 
thousand points of light said michael d bromberg executive 
director of the federation of american health systems which 
represents 1400 forprofit hospitals 
the savings would be achieved mainly by limiting increases in 
payments to hospitals doctors and other health care providers 
which bromberg said will result in more hospital closings and loss 
of healthrelated jobs 
medicare serves about 31 million elderly and 3 million disabled 
americans 
bushs spending plan would hold medicare growth to 8 billion 
about 5 billion less than it would be if the program were extended 
in its current form bush would fund the program at 925 billion in 
fiscal 1990 about 95 percent above the current level 
to meet his pledge for a kinder gentler nation bush 
proposed to maintain the current level of medicaid services for 26 
million poor americans in fiscal 1990 and extend coverage for 
pregnant women and children he also wants to increase spending for 
aids research and outreach the homeless and adoption services 
for medicaid the federalstate health insurance program for the 
poor bush restored 17 billion reagan had proposed cutting back 
and added 33 billion or 97 percent to bring the program up to 
376 billion the amount needed to maintain the current level of 
services under the program 
bush withdrew reagans proposal to cut 11 billion in matching 
medicaid payments to the states an action that drew praise from the 
american association of retired persons 
restoring medicaid to full funding is good news said 
horace deets aarp executive director but were certainly 
disappointed were not hearing a similar statement on medicare 
costs of the medicaid and medicare programs are among the fastest 
growing segments of the federal budget because health care costs 
have been increasing far faster than the general inflation rate 
the center on budget and policy priorities a nonprofit group 
that researches policy issues affecting lowincome people said bush 
took a step in the right direction by requiring medicaid 
coverage for pregnant women and infants at 30 percent higher than 
the poverty level up from the poverty level and expanding 
immunization coverage for children 
but ellen nissenbaum legislative director of the center said 
bush would be placing a heavier burden on states which besides 
paying for half the costs of the expansion would also have to pick 
up a larger share of the administrative costs of the program 
states which administer medicaid would end up having to make 
other cuts in medicaid protection for poor children and their 
families in order to finance bushs medicaid expansions unless 
states were willing to pump significantly more money of their own 
into the program she said 
spending on aids research and educational programs would rise 13 
percent to 14 billion next year not enough to satisfy aids 
activists who noted that the department of health and human 
services last year proposed 19 billion for aids research and 
education 
the reagan administration said reported cases of the fatal 
disease in this country are expected to reach 365000 by the end of 
1992 with 80000 new cases and 65000 deaths projected for that 
year alone

the state department will make sure any airline 
travel warning issued to government employees because of terrorist 
threats will also go to the general public a department official 
told congress 
l paul bremer ambassadoratlarge for counterterrorism told 
the house foreign affairs committee on thursday the american embassy 
in moscow violated policy in posting a warning about pan american 
flights from frankfurt to the united states 
the warning which was not made public came eight days before 
270 people died in scotland when a bomb exploded aboard pan am 
flight 103 which was headed for new york from frankfurt after a 
plane change in london 
it is not our policy to alert government officials and not the 
general public to such a threat bremer said at the second 
congressional hearing of the day on efforts to combat air terrorism 
after the dec 21 downing of the boeing 747 
there is and can be no double standard he said 
on dec 13 a notice was posted on the bulletin board of the 
moscow embassy disclosing the threat and advising embassy personnel 
they could decide on altering personal travel plans or changing to 
another american carrier 
bremer said the threat which came in a call to the embassy in 
helsinki and was relayed to embassies and the airline by the federal 
aviation administration was later determined to be a hoax and only 
a gruesome coincidence in light of the still unsolved bombing of 
flight 103 
the official said it is not state department policy to 
selectively alert people to terrorist threats 
if we have a credible and specific terrorist threat to an 
airline which cannot be countered effectively on the spot then our 
policy is to recommend that the airline cancel the flight he said 
he said if that is mpossible we would issue a public travel 
advisory to the american traveling public 
asked why the embassy posted the dec 13 notice bremer said 
it should not have been posted he said embassy officials later 
said they found the policy on warnings not as clear as we thought 
it was 
relatives of people killed in the explosion told the house 
science space and technologys subcommittee on transportation that 
the government must do more to alert passengers to terrorist threats 
and in installing sophisticated equipment to detect explosives and 
weapons 
i bring no particular expertise to this committee other than 
possibly sadness grief and tears said robert p berrell an 
automobile dealer from fargo nd whose 20yearold son steven a 
student at syracuse university was among those killed in the crash 
when threats as specific as this are received interested 
passengers must be notified berrell said 
several other victims relatives sat in the audience the parents 
of nine students who died in the explosion gave a letter to the 
committee asking why werent the passengers and their families 
warned why didnt airline security detect the bomb 
bremer who testified at both hearings said faa officials have 
told him an average of three bomb threats are received daily by 
american airlines and airports 
announcing all of the threats he said would encourage 
copycat terrorist threats would cause panic and disruption 
and would eventually not be believed by the public

those who met him say yu kikumura entered the 
united states with an easygoing manner cleancut looks and a ready 
smile a world away from anyones image of an international 
terrorist 
as he traveled the country in a strange monthlong odyssey 
staying in campgrounds and inns and shopping at k marts the quiet 
36yearold japanese visitor left few clues that he might have been 
something other than an ordinary tourist 
looking back now i can see a few strange things like he said 
he was a tourist but i never saw a camera recalled chris brande 
a manhattan accountant who rented half his apartment to kikumura 
he giggled and smiled and stuff and joked about getting a 
parking ticket brande said thursday in an interview with the 
associated press once he left i never thought i would have heard 
of him again 
brande didnt until last april 12 when police and fbi agents 
showed up at his apartment to question him about kikumura who had 
been arrested earlier in the day on the new jersey turnpike with 
three powerful homemade bombs in his car 
kikumura now longhaired and wearing a beard down to his chest 
was sentenced tuesday to 30 years in prison on explosives and 
weapons charges as well as carrying false documents prosecutors 
said he was planning to bomb a navy recruiting center in new york as 
part of a libyansponsored campaign of terrorism 
the japanese foreign ministry identifies kikumura as a member of 
the notorious japanese red army terrorist group us prosecutors 
say he received terrorist training in lebanons bekka valley 
kikumura and his lawyers deny the allegations 
during his short stay in the united states kikumura traveled 
with a wad of cash on a 7000mile trek to buy parts for the bombs 
he would build his travels apparently were financed in part by 
money drawn from a swiss bank account 
investigators used receipts found in kikumuras car to piece 
together his movements in the month before his arrest his travels 
took him to roadside motels through americas heartland across its 
colonial byways and into the bible belt 
the documents show he spent time in massachusetts new york new 
jersey ohio michigan illinois missouri tennessee kentucky 
west virginia and pennsylvania along the way he bought such items 
as gas cans a diet scale flash bulbs electrical wire and tape 
glue and fire extinguishers 
the materials he bought to make the bombs are most always used 
for legitimate purposes said assistant us attorney john p 
lacey who helped prosecute the case against kikumura and when he 
traveled around to buy the different materials it decreased the 
risk of somebody piecing together what he was doing 
kikumuras favorite store was k mart authorities said 
turn mr kikumura loose near a k mart and a sporting goods 
store and in a matter of hours literally he can make what was 
found in his car today said us attorney samuel a alito jr 
authorities say kikumura arrived at new yorks kennedy 
international airport last march 8 after using a stolen and altered 
passport to travel through italy france and switzerland 
within a week he had purchased a used mazda 626 from a car 
dealer in the bronx and set out on his tour staying mostly at 
smaller inns and bedandbreakfast houses in outoftheway towns 
he didnt make his first known bombparts purchase until march 
30 when he stopped in an art supply store in nashville tenn to 
buy two cans of aluminum powder 
the next day he went to a k mart in lexington ky and in two 
visits bought gas cans a diet scale coffeemaker accessories 
glue contact cement electrical wire and electrical tape 
in huntington wva he bought a toggle switch circuit tester 
phone jacks phone plugs and wire in one interstate shopping spree 
he stopped in several stores to buy sealing tape flash bulbs 
batteries and at least one fire extinguisher 
twice during his travels he stayed at carmen and herbert browns 
campground in huntington at one point the browns noticed bandages 
on his face and thought he had been in a fight prosecutors believe 
he was injured in a minor explosion while mixing combustible 
materials 
i thought he had been in a scrap and we dont want those kind 
of people around here brown said i never thought then that he 
was a darned communist terrorist 
prosecutors said kikumura intended to blow up the navy 
recruitment center in lower manhattan on april 14 1988 exactly two 
years after a us air attack on libya 
but kikumura in broken and heavily accented english said during 
his sentencing hearing that the charges were trumped up 
the united states had fabricated a story about libya in order 
to justify its own attacks against libya these attacks have 
violated international law and have caused the deaths of libyan 
civilians not guilty of any crime or acts against the united states 
so i denounce these illegal and immoral acts of state terrorism 
he said 
according to prosecutors kikumura planned to leave the united 
states the day after the bombing flight schedules were found in his 
car 
he was stopped from carrying out his plot only by luck alito 
said only by good luck

president bushs call for environmental action 
including suspension of some offshore oil leasing and increased 
antipollution measures has heartened environmental activists but 
left them looking for the fine print 
the presidents budget message thursday night was long on pledges 
of concern for environmental protection and contained a number of 
initiatives 
reexamination of offshore oil drilling projects in florida and 
california 
206 million worth of new recreation land acquisitions 
120 million in fiscal 1990 to curb acid rain through the clean 
coal technology program roughly 25 million more than proposed by 
the reagan administration 
a 64 million increase for coordinated federal water quality 
programs in four agencies 
stricter enforcement and fines on producers of hazardous waste 
but no superfund money for toxic waste cleanup beyond the 175 
million increase outlined in reagans fiscal l990 budget submitted 
last month 
bush left several specifics unanswered and he failed to back off 
one of the environmental communitys top priorities oil 
exploration in the vast arctic national wildlife refuge 
representatives of several environmental groups said they were 
inclined to welcome the improvement over former president reagans 
proposal but were wary of vague wording 
reagan was so abysmal that its making it easier for bush to 
come across as an environmentalist said ben beach spokesman for 
the wilderness society 
one of the most positive proposals from the environmentalists 
point of view was the postponement of lease sales for oil drilling 
off northern and southern california and southern florida pending 
review of environmental effects by a task force bush will set up 
under reagan preparations for leasing were already under way in 
all three areas bush singled out the former texas oilman said he is 
committed to continuing the sale of oil and natural gas leases if 
they are prudent and environmentally sound 
the president said lease sales along the california coast north 
from mendocino county which were scheduled for later this year 
would be indefinitely postponed as would a sale off southern 
florida 
lease sales for tracts scattered off southern california from san 
luis obispo to the mexican border scheduled for l990 also would be 
delayed pending task force review 
should the task force report indicate significant adverse 
environmental effects that have not been previously identified a 
decision will be made to delay further or cancel the sale bushs 
budget message said 
that brought criticism from michael fischer director of the 
sierra club who said the environmental hazards are already 
sufficiently documented to block drilling 
he also said if bush does not see enough environmental reasons to 
keep the arctic refuge from being leased there ought to be no 
cause for relaxation on the part of californians trying to protect 
their coastline 
david hawkins air quality specialist for the national resources 
defense council said bush did not specify specific tonnage of 
emissions to be decreased when he called for significant 
reductions in industrial emissions that cause the problem 
arguments on that point have been central to blocking a solution to 
acid rain 
he also said an emphasis on clean coal efforts and innovations 
could distract from timely removal of acid rain pollutants from the 
air he said

the us dollar closed sharply lower today against 
the japanese yen while stock prices rebounded after early losses to 
set a record high for the sixth consecutive day of trading 
the dollar closed at 12765 yen down 174 yen from thursdays 
close of 12939 yen the us currency opened at 12780 yen and 
traded at 1273012810 yen 
traders ascribed the dollars slide to its overnight drop on 
foreign markets 
japanese finance minister tatsuo murayama told reporters today he 
considered the new dollar level stable indicating monetary 
authorities are pleased with the currencys retreat 
a dealer with the bank of tokyo said there was no fresh incentive 
from president bushs budget address which was delivered late this 
morning tokyo time 
bush making his first appearance before the congress proposed a 
116 trillion budget for fiscal 1990 that he said would hold down 
the nations budget deficit to 911 billion 
the budget was also designed to increase money for social 
programs while freezing defense spending for a year said bush 
pledging to work hard with congress to put americas fiscal house in 
order 
the president will have to carry his pledges through a 
difficult period with the us economy predicted to slow down in 
1990 and a growing concern over inflation likely during the first 
half of this year stemming from high us interest rates said 
nobuyuki ueda a senior economist at the japan longterm credit bank 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues gained 5356 points or 016 percent to finish the 
week at 3213199 a new high the nikkei index shed 4636 points 
during the morning session but gained toward the end of trading it 
closed at a 3207843point record high thursday 
following an overnight fall on wall street investors had some 
concern over the indexs continued rise during the morning session 
but they came back with a strong buying drive toward the end of the 
day said a dealer at a major japanese brokerage who requested 
anonymity 
analysts say low interest rates in japan steady expansion of 
domestic demand and relative stability in exchange rates are pushing 
stock prices higher

president bushs 116 trillion spending plan 
makes a down payment on his campaign promises but leaves unanswered 
many important questions about how to pay for a cleaner and 
bettereducated america 
unlike president reagan bush didnt face a requirement to submit 
a full budget to congress spelling out precisely how every dollar 
would be spent and what programs would be cut to reach the deficit 
targets 
instead he offered a 193page outline of his priorities which 
went into some detail on his spending increases for education the 
homeless the fight against drugs and cleaning up the environment 
however the budget was a good deal less specific about where he 
would make cuts to finance the increases in the case of the 
pentagon bush called for a reduction of 26 billion in spending 
but provided few specifics about what military programs would come 
under the knife instead he proposed a 90day study by his national 
security council 
in other areas bush tacitly embraced many of the program 
eliminations reagan has repeatedly sought over the years although 
bush said he was willing to consider other ways to save the money 
which might be suggested in negotiations with congress 
in broad outlines the bush budget envisions collecting 1069 
trillion in the fiscal year which begins next oct 1 and spending 
1160 trillion leaving a deficit of 911 billion 
bush upped the deficit estimate for the current year to 1633 
billion 18 billion higher than reagans budget estimated just a 
month ago in part because of the worsening savings and loan crisis 
bushs deficit projection for next year would be well within the 
grammrudman laws target of 100 billion however most of the 
cushion comes from sales of government assets which cant be 
counted toward meeting the deficit targets and a highly 
controversial cut in the tax on capital gains which bush claims 
will make not lose money for the government 
bushs first budget projects that the deficit will be eliminated 
by 1993 when he estimates the government will enjoy a 38 billion 
budget surplus but that forecast relies on optimistic assumptions 
about the performance of the economy which many private analysts 
believe are highly improbable 
bush did not propose any new general tax increase but in what 
some might consider a violation of his nonewtaxes pledge he did 
recommend continuing two taxes that are scheduled to expire or 
decline the 3 percent federal tax on local and long distance 
telephone calls and the 8 percent tax on airline tickets 
many of the promises bush made during his long campaign for the 
white house were reflected in his budget blueprint to wit 
increases in education spending to boost by onethird the number 
of 4yearolds enrolled in head start to provide 30 million as a 
down payment toward an eventual 500 millionayear program of 
grants to reward excellence in schools and to provide smaller 
amounts for funding of new awards programs for teachers and 
students however bushs overall spending for education still would 
not keep up with inflation 
a new tax credit of up to 1000 per child under age 4 that 
would go to working poor families with infants and toddlers and a 
separate tax deduction of up to 3000 for families who adopt 
children 
increased support for the war on drugs pushing federal spending 
to 55 billion in 1990 the increases would include a 24 percent 
jump in spending for drug treatment 
increased spending to fight acid rain clean up ocean pollution 
and purchase park lands all in support of bushs drive to protect 
the environment 
full funding of the mckinney act to provide housing for the 
homeless increasing outlays from a projected 500 million this year 
to 644 million in 1990 
rejection of reagans proposed 17 billion cut in the medicaid 
health program for the poor but bush also accepted reagans plan to 
cut 5 billion from medicare the insurance program for the elderly 
also rejected was a reagan proposal to save 828 million by 
cutting the school lunch program and raising 394 million by 
charging veterans higher fees when they took out va mortgages 
bush kept reagans proposed reductions in farm subsidy programs 
and retained reagans proposals for a freeze in 1990 pension 
payments to retired civil servants for 1991 and beyond the 
president proposed limiting government retirees costofliving 
raises to 1 percentage point below inflation currently they get 
the full inflation increase 
in reacting to bushs proposals democrats in congress voiced 
strong opposition to the proposed cut in the capital gains tax 
which they branded as a giveaway to the wealthy they also 
complained about the lack of specifics in many parts of bushs 
budget 
unfortunately president bush gave us a minimum down payment on 
his kinder gentler america with no clear indication of how he 
intends to make the necessary annual payments said senate budget 
committee chairman james sasser dtenn 
but richard darman bushs budget director said the president is 
willing to negotiate with congress 
we are not claiming to have solved all the problems darman 
said this is an extremely credible beginning bush is saying he 
is ready to negotiate he doesnt expect it to be found 100 percent 
acceptable

i dont think its easy to make a good profit he said 
youve got to know what people want at the time and sometimes you 
just arent lucky enough to get customers 
worlandesquith wasnt really sure why slime was selling so well

an error at the internal revenue service has 
delayed 450000 federal tax refunds by a week but the government 
says the problem was corrected in time to get checks out after only 
the brief delay 
ellen murphy irs director of public affairs said checks for 
those who filed in the second or third week of january will be 
mailed feb 17 rather than feb 10 as had been planned 
people are going to get their refund checks in the 
fourtosixweek time frame that is typical at this time of the 
year she said thursday 
the problem the result of a human error in running a computer 
was fixed before it grew to the proportions of 1985 when millions 
of tax refunds were delayed for several weeks because of problems

a auto safety watchdog group says badly 
designed fuel filler pipes on 5 million ford motor co cars pose a 
fire danger that already has caused more than 200 deaths

that the company should spend 250 million to recall and fix the 
fuel tank assemblies on the cars a variety of models made since 
1965 
ford spokesman jerald terhorst said the company is not aware of 
any hazardous condition that would warrant a recall of older models

top iranian officials say their country 
took too big a bite trying to defeat iraq and pointed to us 
intervention in the persian gulf as having tipped the scales in 
their war against iraq 
in a series of unusually frank interviews with the official 
islamic republic news agency president ali khamenei parliament 
speaker hashemi rafsanjani and chief justice musavi ardebili also 
said the islamic revolution is still a long way from achieving its 
goals 
the comments on the iraniraq war were the first by senior 
figures to shed light on the inner workings of tehrans military 
planning and its eventual decision to accept the unmediated 
ceasefire last summer after eight years of fighting 
the interviews monitored in nicosia in recent days came as iran 
celebrates the 10th anniversary of the islamic revolution with the 
leadership divided over the countrys future 
irna quoted rafsanjani also acting commanderinchief of irans 
army as saying of irans aim of military victory we took too big 
a bite 
yes we wanted something but were not able to get it and that 
was military victory if we had moved with a bit more planning maybe 
it would not have been so far off he said 
rafsanjani is considered the second most powerful figure in iran 
after spiritual leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
ardebili noted that iran suffered a severe jolt when the united 
states and several european navies intervened in the persian gulf to 
protect shipping from iranian attack 
we saw that the united states was prepared to send its navy 
into the persian gulf and pull the world along with it he said 
we had not taken that into account 
he noted i am among those who believe that the war should have 
been stopped after the liberation of khorramshahr 
the iraqis were driven out of that southern iranian port city on 
the shatt alarab waterway in 1982 nearly two years after they 
invaded iran following border skirmishes 
the iranian news agency did not say whether ardebili indicated he 
had opposed khomeini whose objective was to defeat iraq and topple 
president saddam hussein in 1982 or sought to convince him to end 
the war after the iraqis were driven back across the border 
but the remarks by ardebili rafsanjani and khamenei appeared to 
indicate that some of irans more pragmatic leaders disagreed with 
khomeinis insistence on continuing the war 
tehran accepted a un ceasefire resolution last july after a 
series of battlefield defeats the ceasefire took effect aug 20 
khomeini said at the time that accepting the ceasefire was 
more deadly than poison 
ardebili said iran accepted ceasefire resolution after the 
iranian leadership had done some calculations on our 
capabilities after a series of iraqi offensives that left iranian 
forces in disarray 
dissident iranian sources have said that khomeini had little 
choice but to accept the ceasefire after rafsanjani khamenei and 
other senior officials and military commanders met in early july and 
concluded that poor military morale and severe shortages of heavy 
weapons gave iran no prospect of winning 
the news agency reported few comments by khamenei on the conduct 
of the war but when asked whether the islamic revolution had 
achieved its goals he was quoted as saying its true we have not 
reached our destination and we might not even be halfway there 
but we have started to move in the right direction and this is 
very important so the revolution can by no means be branded a 
failure 
all three leaders agreed that it was time to analyze the 
revolution and its objectives to prevent mistakes being repeated 
were still at the stage where were trying to blame others for 
our own sins ardebili noted we have to get through this stage 
if we dont it will bring catastrophe

believes adam whose orange cap was found near a small hole on the 
pond fell into the pond while trying to skate on the surface and 
that chad tried to save him 
chad died late monday afternoon at madisonvilles regional 
medical center where his mother is a nurse adam who would have 
turned 8 today died about 11 hours later 
on wednesday she and her husband sat in their living room 
looking at photograph albums filled with the boys pictures 
there were pictures of adam and chad on the soccer team that 
their father coached and photographs of the two in halloween 
costumes one picture showed adam watching as a proud chad posed 
with his first pulled tooth 
adam wanted to lose a tooth after chad lost one bates said 
i remember adam pulled and pushed trying to lose a tooth so he 
would be like chad 
mrs bates dressed them alike until this past year when each 
began asserting his own individuality 
they were about as close as brothers could get bates said 
if chad had a hamburger he would give adam half of it 
bates went looking for his sons monday after they failed to 
answer their mothers call he said that 15 minutes earlier they had 
been playing near the barn where he was working

adams mrs bates rushed to the pond to find her husband up to his 
chin in the cold water frantically searching for their boys 
he was breaking the ice with his elbows she said 
emergency rescue workers eventually pulled the boys from the pond

senior officials from five central american 
nations disagreed over how to monitor human rights but were united 
in asking for un inspectors to make sure none of them supports 
subversion against a neighbor 
foreign ministers and senior aides from nicaragua honduras 
guatemala el salvador and costa rica on thursday wrapped up two 
days of discussions aimed at reviving the central american peace 
plan of 1987 
nicaraguas foreign minister miguel descoto told reporters 
thursdays session was very successful 
in the discussions the leaders attempted to set the agenda for 
next weeks meeting of the five presidents in el salvador 
under the 1987 plan the nations agreed to ceasefires with 
rebels amnesties and democratic reforms including free elections 
and respect for human rights 
descoto said nicaragua and neighboring honduras reached 
agreement on general terms of reference on how human rights 
should be monitored 
they accepted nicaraguas proposal that the interamerican human 
rights commission verify and monitor human rights practices 
el salvadors foreign minister ricardo acevedo peralta 
supported forming a political commission composed of distinguished 
latin americans to monitor human rights 
guatemala advocates that each nation found a commission to review 
its practices and file quarterly reports said its deputy foreign 
minister ariel rivera irias 
the ideas will be forwarded to the five presidents for 
consideration next week 
the officials on wednesday asked un secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar to send west german spanish and canadian 
inspectors to guarantee that no central american nation shelters 
rebels from another or supports subversion in a neighboring country 
thousands of contra rebels and nicaraguan refugees are in camps 
in honduras near its long border with nicaragua which the 
usbacked contras cross to launch attacks 
the united states has accused nicaragua of aiding leftist rebels 
fighting a ussupported government in el salvador 
the foreign ministry officials requested latin americans be 
included in the un inspection team and told perez de cuellar they 
preferred that the inspectors be unarmed un military observers 
said a nicaraguan official speaking on condition of anonymity 
perez de cuellar said he is considering sending military 
observers saying civilians do not have the necessary authority 
for removing rebels from one of the countries 
plans for the force have already been drafted un officials 
said and spain canada and west germany have agreed to contribute 
observers 
a technical group to plan the inspection force has been appointed 
under the senior un peacekeeper undersecretarygeneral marrack

a us veteran who fathered a daughter 
during the vietnam war has started a halfway house in vietnam 
for the hundreds of vietnameseamericans who roam the streets and 
dream of a new life in the united states 
john rogers a 43yearold businessman from honolulu who spent 
six years in service in vietnam said today he has rented space in a 
downtown ho chi minh city building and obtained official permission 
to allow 40 amerasians to reside there 
more than 200 others he said would be able to use the facility 
to take showers or rest from their lives as petty vendors and 
beggars in the streets the amerasians have chosen two seniors among 
them nicknamed raymond and charlie brown to act as 
administrators 
the vietnamese authorities are willing to go along with just 
about anything these days to show they are on the good side 
rogers said in an interview after his most recent trip to vietnam 
he said city officials even gave him permission to buy a house 
for the amerasians but the price was too high 
rogers said the singleroom and adjacent bathroom facilities 
which he hopes to expand would serve as a halfway house giving 
the street children a sense of some permanence before they are 
accepted for entry to the united states most of the amerasians he 
has befriended have applied to leave vietnam 
rogers said he first returned to vietnam in may 1988 to find his 
daughter 19yearold gloria and ran into crowds of other 
amerasians in ho chi minh citys parks and streets 
rogers promised them he would to return and help 
they were skeptical said rogers who is fluent in 
vietnamese they told me a lot of americans had come and promised 
to help them but all they did was take their pictures 
rogers daughter and her mother are scheduled to leave vietnam 
later this month and he said he would be returning again in march 
hopefully after having raised more funds to expand the project to 
other cities in vietnam 
rogers served in noncombat duty during his army tours he met a 
vietnamese woman in 1969 to whom he is still married in the united 
states he fathered gloria during a brief liaison 
unlike most us servicemen rogers learned vietnamese on his 
most recent trip he sang in the language at several ho chi minh city 
nightclubs 
since 1982 more than 5000 amerasians have departed for the 
united states under a unsponsored orderly departure program an 
unknown number of others have fled illegally since the war ended in 
1975 
us officials say 8000 to 12000 remain in vietnam but other 
estimates range far higher rogers believes as many as 50000 remain 
and recalls seeing a dozen amerasians in a remote village near the 
cambodian border who had no idea that a resettlement program existed 
although vietnam and the united states have no diplomatic ties 
cooperation has increased significantly over the past year on a 
number of issues including the amerasians 
vietnam also has allowed private groups and individuals like 
rogers to initiate activities that would have been unthinkable a few 
years ago when suspicion of outsiders ran high within the communist 
officialdom

astronomers say they have documented the 
creation of an extremely dense spinning star known as a pulsar for 
the first time an insight that could change beliefs about how big 
stars explode 
the discovery reported thursday confirms a theory that pulsars 
are created by the explosion of enormous stars called supernovas 
said carl pennypacker a research physicist at the lawrence berkeley 
laboratory 
the pulsar a highly dense star known as a neutron star spins 
nearly 2000 times per second according to pennypacker who said 
its speed is three times faster than anything researchers have 
observed before 
its really phenomenal he said describing the pulsar as 
something that has the mass of the sun squished down to a 
10kilometer radius 
the discovery offers key information into what happens when a 
supernova explodes he said 
it tells us about the birth of pulsars and the final stage of 
big stars pennypacker said it will probably change our sense 
of what the supernova explosion mechanism is i think its going 
to have a pretty profound effect 
pennypacker a researcher at lbl and the space sciences 
laboratory at the university of california at berkeley said the 
pulsar emits light that creates sort of a searchlight effect 
the pulsars creation was observed as part of an international 
research project begun two years ago when astronomers first spotted 
the parent supernova named supernova 1987a 
located about 170000 lightyears away from the earth the 
explosion of supernova 1987a was much closer than any other 
supernova explosion in four centuries observers were able to watch 
it with the naked eye for several months pennypacker called that 
explosion probably the most exciting astronomical observation of 
the decade 
we barely have an understanding of what makes these stars 
explode he said theyre neat because all the atoms in us came 
from supernova explosions theyre some of the brightest things 
in the universe ancients watched them 
when the big stars core collapsed in an enormous explosion the 
neutron star was formed he said 
the pulsar was detected inside the cloud of gas dust left by the 
supernova in the large magellanic cloud near the milky way galaxy 
speculation about how fast the pulsar would spin had ranged from 
two or three rotations per second to pennypackers guess that it 
would spin at a rate of at least 100 times a second but no one 
had come close to anticipating the pulsars spectacular speed 
the pulsar which will likely keep researchers busy until at 
least 1995 probably existed for about two years but debris and fog 
have obscured its presence pennypacker said 
astronomers in chile gathered the first data that documented the 
discovery jan 18 pennypacker said adding that a team of about 
eight researchers has been interpreting the information since then 
more observations are expected soon from telescopes in australia 
and chile he said 
the team that discovered the pulsar included scientists from the 
lawrence berkeley laboratory the los alamos national laboratory 
the las campanas and cerro tololo observatories in chile nasas 
ames research center the mount stromlosiding springs observatory 
in australia and the universities of oregon and toronto

los angeles ap raymond buckey one of only two defendants left 
in the 5yearold mcmartin preschool molestation case was a step 
closer to gaining his freedom today after spending five years in 
jail without being convicted 
superior court judge william pounders who has heard personal 
assurances from some 20 people who posted their property to insure 
buckeys 15 million bail said he likely would decide today 
whether to release buckey after hearing the results of the los 
angeles county counsels investigation of bail security 
the judge expressed concern that buckeys five years in jail 
already has exceeded the average sentence for a person convicted of 
a felony and buckey has not been convicted on the charges he faces 
the 30yearold defendant is on trial with his 61yearold 
mother peggy mcmartin buckey on charges of molesting children at 
their nowdefunct preschool in manhattan beach 
mrs buckey has been freed on 295000 bail 
deputy district attorney lael rubin who has opposed buckeys 
release on bail told reporters she still considers him a danger to 
the community 
there are a lot of people parents of children involved who 
are concerned about his release she said 
buckeys attorney danny davis told reporters ray wanted to 
say hed not been in the company of so many friends in five years 
and it has restored his faith in not only people but the system 
davis said a total of 3 million in property was posted twice 
the bail amount required by the court 
pounders said buckey already has served the equivalent of a 
10year sentence with time off for good behavior 
buckey and his mother are the last of the seven original 
defendants in the case which burst into the national media 
spotlight in 1983 with lurid tales of mass sexual abuse devilish 
rituals death threats and animal mutilations 
buckey is charged with 52 counts of molestation and his mother is 
charged with 12 counts both face a combined charge of conspiracy in 
the case which stems from alleged abuse of 11 children at the 
school 
the case against the buckeys has run more than a year and a half 
in superior court 
five teachers originally charged later were cleared as defendants 
when the district attorney declared the evidence failed to support 
the charges

a top official of a puerto rican 
party that favors statehood for the us commonwealth praised 
president bush for calling for a referendum on puerto ricos future 
in his address to congress 
it is the type of direct message we were expecting from 
president bush said pedro rosello vice president of the new 
progressive party 
when the president says he is in favor of the process and asks 
for congressional cooperation it gives a seriousness to the issue 
which never before existed rosello said 
in his speech thursday evening before a joint session of the 
house and the senate bush said he favored statehood for puerto rico 
but believed the puerto rican people should decide their own future 
i have long believed that the people of puerto rico should have 
the right to determine their own political future bush said 
personally i favor statehood but i ask the congress to take the 
necessary steps to let the people decide in a referendum 
puerto rico an island of 33 million mostly spanishspeaking 
people has been a us territory since 1898 and a commonwealth 
since 1952 puerto ricans are us citizens but they pay no us 
taxes and cannot vote for president they are eligible for military 
service 
the islands three main parties are divided on its future 
supporting either statehood commonwealth or independence but they 
united in january to ask congress and the president to support the 
results of a plebiscite 
in the last referendum in 1967 60 percent of puerto ricans 
favored commonwealth status 39 percent favored statehood and 1 
percent voted for independence the referendum had no significance 
however because the results were not recognized by congress 
puerto rican leaders want congressional legislation to guarantee 
the results will be carried out

a us magistrate refused to suspend 
aroundtheclock medical surveillance of the ailing wife of 
convicted spy jonathan pollard despite her doctors contention that 
it aggravates her problems 
she has no dignity at all dr edward goldberg said thursday 
of the 24hour watch which includes trips to the bathroom i 
think that is the added complication to her condition at worst 
it is punitive at best it showed either inexperience or 
incompetence 
anne hendersonpollard who is serving a fiveyear prison term in 
connection with her husbands crimes is being treated at the 
federal medical center for gastrointestinal problems that have 
reduced her weight to 90 pounds 
in a lawsuit against the centers warden joseph bogan she 
charged that she is being subjected to cruel and unusual 
punishment because doctors have been deliberately indifferent to 
her medical needs 
at thursdays hearing her lawyer former watergate prosecutor 
hamilton fox asked interim relief from the 24hour watch us 
magistrate jan symchych denied the motion saying medical opinion is 
divided on the value of the surveillance 
symchych recessed the hearing until feb 16 when 
hendersonpollard is expected to testify 
the pale 28yearold inmate hunched over during the hearing as 
the centers medical director dr martha grogan said suveillance 
was needed because hendersonpollards weight is dangerously low and 
she has refused treatment 
theres never been a patient whos been so uncooperative 
grogan said 
grogan said hendersonpollard has been examined by 22 mayo clinic 
specialists at a cost of 55640 she said the primary diagnosis was 
irritable bowel syndrome a littleunderstood ailment associated 
with chronic abdominal pain 
fox maintains that his client suffers from a more serious 
gastrointestinal problem that has been exacerbated by a hostile 
patientphysician relationship 
late last month jonathan pollard who is serving a life sentence 
in a federal prison in marion ill launched a fiveday hunger 
strike to protest his wifes transfer from a danbury conn 
hospital to the rochester facility

returning to the chamber where he began his 
political career as a house member 22 years ago george bush drew 
his first cheer of his first address to congress when he said i 
feel as if i am returning home to friends 
eight times as vice president bush had occupied the chair next to 
the speaker of the house listening in silence as president reagan 
assessed the state of the union and drew the cheers 
on thursday night there was another vice president dan quayle 
to do the respectful listening to provide the dutiful applause 
george bush could at last look out over congress assembled the 
supreme court his own cabinet the diplomatic corps and address 
the nation and the world in his own right 
it was his turn to set the national agenda 
the new presidents debut before congress was interrupted by 
applause at least 62 times although there were times when lines 
that appeared to beg for applause failed to attract any at all 
the first cheers the first standing ovation went not to the 
president but to first lady barbara bush as she entered the family 
gallery of the house of representatives 
when his wifes moment was over bush took center stage and 
promoted his programs not attempting to match ronald reagans 
fabled charismatic style 
bushs delivered the address with a measured pace his voice low 
pitched and under control 
he was applauded when he was tough when he pledged a billion 
new dollars for the war on drugs when he hailed the nations police 
officers when he warned drug dealers if you are caught and 
convicted you will do time 
he was applauded for his initiatives on education and on the 
environment 
he was applauded when he denounced complacency when he pledged 
yet again that he plans no new taxes 
but when he asked for reductions in the capital gains tax the 
roar of approval from the republican side of the aisle produced a 
counterpoint in the distinct groan from the democrats seated to his 
right 
while bushs speech lacked much of the ideological pungency of 
many of reagans addresses to congress there were other times when 
the applause stopped abruptly on the republican edge of the aisle 
leaving democrats in frozen silence 
that happened when bush repeated reagans fervent wish that 
congress pass a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced 
federal budget 
and it happened with a vengeance when bush telling his audience 
dont take this wrong called for an end to congressional 
micromanagement of our nations military policy 
all cheers and clapping hands from the gop all silence and 
folded arms from the democrats 
it seems there is a slight division on that question the 
president ad libbed drawing a bipartisan laugh 
one bush line drew only a single pair of clapping hands 
we must make use of clean coal bush said to the applause of 
coalstate sen robert c byrd dwva 
during the 49minute speech bush quoted benjamin franklin a 
distressed pennsylvania mother whose son had become addicted to 
cocaine abraham lincoln sir winston churchill henry wadsworth 
longfellow and a chinese poet who bush said once advised his 
readers not to fear the simple words like goodness and kindness 
and mercy 
the 41st president did not reagan at least not by name he did 
praise his predecessor for reversing the nations course and said 
i dont propose to reverse direction 
and he drew a low rumble from democrats when he adopted without 
attribution democrat jesse jacksons 1988 campaign slogan keep 
hope alive 
still although bush carried on the spirit of conciliation he 
called for in his inaugural address there was a hint at the onset 
that the administration and congress may not be on the same path 
the white house took pains to portray the speech as just a 
speech a look at the new presidents budget priorities and not a 
formal state of the union address 
but the house and senate resolution authorizing thursday nights 
joint session said its purpose was to receive a message from the 
president on the state of the union

the daughter of james r hoffa the former 
teamsters union leader presumed to be dead has asked a federal 
court to force the fbi to give her its files on his disappearance 
13 years ago 
i think its time the family knows what the fbi knows said 
barbara ann crancer of st louis county i think it would benefit 
the public to know what kind of investigation was done 
crancer a lawyer said in a complaint filed in us district 
court that the fbi has twice denied her request for records under 
the freedom of information act she asks the court to require the 
agency to respond with her request under the act 
hoffa disappeared july 30 1975 outside a restaurant in 
southfield mich a suburb of detroit 
crancers complaint says she is seeking documents to help her in 
her search for those responsible for her fathers disappearance 
despite the 13 years that have passed since hoffa disappeared 
the complaint says there have been no indictments no trials no 
convictions as a result of the department of justices investigation 
instead the family of james r hoffa must glean information 
from official and unofficial leaks made to the media 
in rejecting crancers previous requests for information the 
justice department has said the release of the records could 
reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings 
crancer 50 said she wanted to learn what information the fbi 
had about the account of a nurse who saw hoffa forced into a car 
outside the restaurant

babe ruths autograph sold for 600 and first 
lady barbara bushs went for 350 but former president carters 
autograph couldnt bring down the gavel even at a bargain price of 
75 
no bid the auctioneer said thursday night at a herman 
darvick autograph auction 
very popular president one observer said sarcastically as 
some of the nearly 100 people who crowded into a manhattan hotel 
chuckled 
oliver north was far more popular an autographed copy of the 
former national security aides high school yearbook sold for 450 
the yearbook shows north with a printed quote i am not only witty 
in myself but the cause that wit is in other men 
another big seller was a greta garbo signature on an amended 
movie contract signed march 4 1939 the document sold for 3850 
she has the most valuable autograph of any living person 
said herman darvick whose firm specializes in celebrity signatures 
a signed thomas edison patent went for 7700 and a benjamin 
franklin autograph was sold to a doctor from pennsylvania for 
11000 
the babe ruth signature was splayed across a photograph of the 
bambino shaking hands with an unidentified man in a business suit 
two campaignrelated letters by mrs bush on her personal red 
white and blue stationery were sold as one item 
an autographed picture of president ronald reagan and then vice 
president bush sold for 750 but an autographed picture of carter 
with president gerald ford another slow seller went for 140 
its hard to explain darvick said of carters dismal 
signature value hes just not selling anything in books checks 
and letters 
actually an item billed as a rare jimmy carter white house 
card which was projected to bring between 700 and 800 did sell 
for 150 the card bore a vignette of the south portico of the 
white house and was signed in facsimile by carter 
but mostly the carter autographs drew silence like lot no 98 
an autographed copy of carters book why not the best 
do i hear 75 asked the auctioneer if not well pass 
pass on 98 
former president richard nixon enjoyed considerably more 
commercial appeal with a letter to a reporter signed dick 
selling for 500 
darvick said john f kennedy has the most sought after 
presidential signature followed by reagan and nixon 
kennedy became senator in 1953 ten years later he was dead he 
had machines that signed his autograph hes very rare in 
authenticated material darvick said 
referring to nixons watergate notoriety darvick said its 
like going to a wax museum people dont want to see the presidents

a former us congressman sailed today for the 
south china sea to launch about 1000 helium balloons toward vietnam 
and laos carrying messages offering rewards for american prisoners 
of war 
billy hendon and three relatives of us servicemen missing in 
action left the royal hong kong yacht club in mild weather on a 
65foot boat that once carried vietnamese refugees to asylum in this 
british colony 
hendon said late thursday he plans to sail at least 200 miles 
south of hong kong to encounter air currents that will send the 
balloons to laos and vietnam where he believes hundreds of missing 
americans remain imprisoned 14 years after the war in indochina 
ended 
the balloons will carry messages that say in local languages 
bring an american prisoner to freedom and you will receive a huge 
prize in return hendon said 
he said anyone who can free and bring to us custody an american 
prisoner of war would get a 24 million reward pledged by 21 
members of congress and others 
this is no joke were spending a lot of time and a lot of 
effort here said hendon who previously traveled to thailand to 
float balloons with the reward offer down the mekong river which 
forms the border with laos 
were not here to argue whether pows are still there or not we 
are convinced they are he said our job is to help solve the 
dilemma 
the us government says it has been unable to prove that 
americans remain captive from the war in indochina but it says the 
possibility cannot be discounted and investigations continue 
the united states has criticized the reward offer as a hindrance 
to official contacts with vietnam laos and cambodia to resolve the 
fates of 2383 americans listed as missing in action the communist 
nations have reacted angrily to the reward offer and have strongly 
denied holding any americans 
hendon 44 a twoterm republican congressman from north carolina 
who was defeated in 1986 is a member of a pow publicity fund formed 
by families of missing men and others to advertise the reward offer 
accompanying hendon are elizabeth stewart of washington bobby 
bischoff of wilson nc and jeffrey donahue of cocoa beach fla 
whose fathers are among the us servicemen reported missing in 
action the group expects to return to hong kong on sunday 
hendon said he visited hong kongs royal observatory twice before 
leaving to study weather data and acknowledged it will be tricky to 
land the messages in indochina during the weekend trip 
its sort of like shooting a basketball for a goal a mile 
away he said

a likely strike this summer by the screen actors 
guild would be devastating to the networks still struggling 
with the effects of last summers writers walkout the president of 
cbs entertainment said 
the other two network entertainment presidents brandon tartikoff 
of nbc and brandon stoddard of abc agreed with cbs kim lemasters 
at thursdays meeting of the international radio and television 
society 
the guild contract is up june 30th and a strike is considered 
likely contract issues are similar to those that prompted the 
24week strike by the writers guild of america among them the 
amount of royalties received from network programs sold into 
syndication movie production would also be halted if the actors 
guild called a strike 
we think it would be tremendously damaging to the network 
business if there was an sag strike said lemasters all three 
networks are still reeling from the wga strike it is a business 
where we are trying to increase and hold our shares not have them 
go down i fervently hope that there isnt a strike 
the writers strike caused delays in the start of the networks 
198889 television season and is blamed for further defections in 
network audiences to cable options and videocassettes the three 
networks aggregate share of the viewing audience has averaged 68 
percent so far this season compared to 90 percent a decade ago 
the threenetwork share rose into the 80s during this weeks run 
of cbs blockbuster miniseries lonesome dove which finished 
14th on the list of alltime highestrated network miniseries 
the critically acclaimed miniseries was considered proof that 
quality programming will still draw viewers to network television 
but the level of acting writing and productions values is not 
likely to be often repeated on network television 
nbcs tartikoff said studios and networks should start working 
now to deal with the strike threat 
i think the attitude on the part of the studios and certainly 
on the part of the networks is weve got to get out there much 
earlier than we did with the wga that we cant wait for certain 
periods of negotiation and deadlines to be hit before we start to 
take it seriously he said 
and i think the attitude is to start wrestling with the 
situation now and not waiting until we get to june 30th which is 
the dday date

canadians arent expecting much in the way of 
specifics toward resolving their dispute with washington over acid 
rain when president bush visits ottawa today 
us president george bush is coming to canada tomorrow and so 
are 8767 tons of us sulfur dioxide said a comment thursday in 
the montreal gazette illustrating canadas preoccipation with the 
subject sulfur dioxide causes acid rain 
bushs halfday trip for meetings with prime minister brian 
mulroney will be his first outside the united states as president 
officials of both countries portray the visit as a chance to get 
acquainted and set the agenda for future dealings 
canadians believe bush will do more than former president reagan 
did about acid rain in his speech to a joint session of congress 
thursday night bush said the time for action is now 
he proposed spending 120 million in fiscal 1990 to curb acid 
rain roughly 25 million more than was proposed by the reagan 
administration he also called for timetables to be set for the 
curbing of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions but didnt 
announce any deadlines 
the damage done in canada by sulfur dioxide and other emissions 
from the united states has been a sore point in relations for years 
william k reilly chosen by bush to head the environmental 
protection agency attracted widespread attention in canada when at 
his nomination hearing in washington he said legislation to curb 
acid rain would be first out of the box for bush 
bush said in washington on thursday that his administration will 
honor the us commitment to canada to spend 25 billion over five 
years to develop technologies for cleaner coal production 
mulroney is in the early months of his second term his 
progressive conservative party won an election nov 21 fought 
largely on the free trade agreement he negotiated with the united 
states 
parliament met briefly in december to clear the way for the pact 
to take effect jan 1 and will begin its regular business in march 
or april 
the trade deal phases out remaining tariffs over 10 years 
establishes panels to resolve disputes and eases barriers to 
investment and trade in energy and services 
opponents expressed fear that canada would be overwhelmed by its 
more populous and economically powerful neighbor bush and mulroney 
will discuss application of the agreement but their main topic for 
discussion is acid rain 
mulroney had sought a treaty requiring both countries to reduce 
emissions of toxic fumes bush is not expected to be any more eager 
for a treaty than reagan was but his willingness to submit 
legislation is considered a major step 
environment minister lucien bouchard said this week canada wants 
a timetable of six to eight years for reducing emissions 
president and mrs bush will spend four hours in ottawa before 
going to their home in kennebunkport maine mrs bushs activities 
will include a visit to a school and a tour of the new national 
gallery with mila mulroney wife of the prime minister

communist party members called on their 
leaders to close the deep divisions in the ruling elite and use 
todays central committee meeting as a springboard to social and 
political reform 
the official mti news agency in a brief dispatch said officials 
opened the central committee meeting and will discuss current home 
political issues to be presented by communist party leader karoly 
grosz but gave no further details 
the special session was called after a leading party reformer 
touched off unprecedented debate with a startling reassessment of 
the hungarian revolt in 1956 against the soviets 
it also comes after a weekly party youth magazine revealed that 
former premier janos kadar repeatedly called the revolt a popular 
uprising and urged soviet troops to leave his country just three 
days before they crushed the rebellion and elevated him to power 
kadar who relinquished the party leadership last may dropped 
the offending term following the revolt which began oct 23 1956 
with mass demonstrations for a new government and demands that 
soviet troops leave hungary 
the rebellion however quickly ended on nov 4 when 200000 
soviet troops entered budapest to quell the uprising 
what happened in 1956 remains as important emotionally to 
hungarians as the prague spring reforms and warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia in 1968 is to most czechoslovaks 
the ideological debate over 1956 revived jan 28 when politburo 
member imre pozsgay in a radio interview termed the revolt a popular 
uprising contradicting what for years has officially been termed a 
counterrevolution or communist parlance for a concerted effort to 
overthrow socialism 
party leader grosz who replaced kadar and other politburo 
members publicly disagreed with pozsgay 
but pozsgays statement has triggered a passionate debate that 
has ranged beyond the uprising to include the pace and extent of 
recent hungarian reform and relations with moscow 
last month hungarys parliament passed laws legalizing 
independent poltical movements and most demonstrations and setting 
an aug 1 deadline for a bill intended to legalize alternative 
political parties 
but party provincial members warned thursday that such reforms as 
a coalition government are in danger from party conservatives 
the reform wing of the partys csongrad county branch was quoted 
as saying the crisis of confidence among the party membership has 
been reproduced and the danger of a party rupture exists even 
before attitudes are cleared up 
similarly the newspaper magyar nemzet quoted a party 
organization of social science institutes in a budapest district as 
saying 
what we see is that passions have been unleashed and in the 
wake of this organizations have become stronger that endanger the 
process of political reform and democratization 
government spokesman gyoergy marosan warned thursday evening that 
the party must unite if the government is to improve the stagnating 
economy and repay hungarys 17 billion foreign debt 
marosan comments referred to increasing dissatisfaction over two 
waves of price hikes last month and other austerity measures the 
government says are necessary but which have slashed real wages and 
prompted strikes by workers 
this weeks edition of oetlet a publication of the communist 
youth union published the text of a stunning radio appeal made by 
kadar on nov 1 1956 
kadar reportedly referred to the revolt five times as a popular 
uprising but an informed source said the speech was not published 
afterward except in underground journals 
oetlet reported that in the same radio address kadar also said 
our people have proved that by shedding their blood they are 
solidly behind the governments demand for the total withdrawal of 
soviet forces 
we no longer want to be dependent we dont want the country to 
become a battle zone kadar reportedly said

an antiapartheid clergyman 
today denounced the vigilante actions of youths who served as 
winnie mandelas bodyguards and a newspaper said the body of a boy 
allegedly abducted by the group had been found 
the fate of the missing 14yearold stompie sepei has been at 
the center of the controversy surrounding mrs mandela wife of 
jailed african national congress leader nelson mandela and the 
socalled mandela united soccer team 
community leaders in soweto have accused the team members of 
abducting and beating four other youths who were living at a local 
methodist church one of the four stompie has been missing since 
jan 1 
the weekly mail a prominent antiapartheid newspaper quoted an 
unidentified soweto activist as saying stompies body was dug up 
thursday in the black township outside johannesburg police 
headquarters said today the report could not be confirmed 
bishop peter storey regional leader of the methodist church 
said that if stompies body had indeed been found the worst fears 
of the church and community have been realized 
some of mrs mandelas supporters have contended the four youths 
were taken from the church to the mandela home because they were 
being sexually molested by a white minister the rev paul verryn 
methodist officials say they investigated that claim and determined 
it to be false 
the national leader of the methodist church the rev stanley 
magoba issued a statement today saying church leaders noted with 
anger and concern the vigilante actions of mandela united 
he described the allegations against verryn as a transparent 
attempt to divert the attention of both church and community away 
from the ruthless actions of the football team and the 
disappearence and possible death of stompie 
the events point to an increasing lack of respect for the 
rights and freedoms of people and a vacuum in leadership in the 
townships through the detention of authentic leaders under the state 
of emergency 
the african national congress has asked mrs mandela to disband 
mandela united 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said thursday that police 
were investigating all aspects of the controversy including the 
alleged abductions the disappearance of stompie and the charges of 
sexual abuse 
vlok said police were wary of appearing vindictive against mrs 
mandela and expected difficulties finding witnesses who were 
prepared to testify in court against her 
widely regarded abroad as an antiapartheid heroine mrs mandela 
has been entangled in several controversies in recent years she was 
criticized for authorizing construction of a palatial new home in 
soweto and for endorsing necklacings in which burning tires were 
used to execute suspected collaborators 
last year her home in soweto was set afire by local high school 
students angered by actions of mandela united members

michael manley shed his bush jacket for 
a business suit and replaced antiimperialistic rhetoric with talk 
of free enterprise in his successful bid to return to power 
before his partys victory in parliamentary elections thursday 
manley tried to show he had changed from the radical who nearly 
bankrupted his country and was soundly defeated in 1980 after eight 
years as prime minister 
i think there are two types of people those who wont learn 
and those who try to manley told reporters this week i try to 
learn 
as prime minister in the 1970s manley catapulted jamaica to the 
forefront of the developing worlds nonaligned movement he forged 
close ties with neighboring cuba and railed against cia plots and 
capitalist domination 
his policies and defiant words alienated the united states and 
foreign investors plunging jamaica into economic chaos 
today the 64yearold manley encourages foreign investment and 
says he has abandoned all thoughts of nationalization and wants 
private business to flourish he says he would restrict relations 
with cuba to normal diplomacy and gives far greater emphasis to the 
united states and western lending agencies 
as vice president of socialist international manley says his 
true philosophy is what he calls social democracy 
what i really am he said in an interview recently is a 
hardline democrat but not democrat vs republican democrat in the 
sense that my abiding commitment is to the democratic process 
if less defiant now manley is still a powerful orator who can 
stir a throng to near frenzy they call him joshua after the old 
testament prophet away from the crowds he is a man of refined 
tastes wit and quiet pleasures he spends much of his time on his 
40acre coffee farm in the mountains and jogs daily 
the former prime minister is the author of seven books his 
latest a 575page history of west indies cricket he watches 
american football on television reads spy thrillers and is an 
enthusiastic but utterly indifferent bridge player 
but his real sort of secret passion is classical music 
for a long time ive loved people like shostakovich and 
prokofiev he said of the russian composers but not because of 
where they come from please 
he has been married four times and is separated from his wife 
beverley he has two sons and three daughters 
michael norman manley was born dec 10 1924 the son of norman 
manley founder of his peoples national party and his wife edna a 
sculptor and artist he was graduated from jamaica college in 1943 
and served in the royal canadian air force until the end of world 
war ii 
he then took an economics degree at the london school of 
economics and spent a year working as a freelance journalist for 
the british broadcasting corp 
on his return to jamaica in the early 1950s manley got involved 
in the trade union movement and was elected president of the 
caribbean bauxite and mineworkers union in 1962 
he was first elected to parliament in 1962 and became leader of 
his party in 1969 upon his fathers retirement 
picking up the mantle of radical socialism manley led his party 
to victory in 1972 he developed a warm relationship with cuban 
leader fidel castro and brought in scores of cuban doctors and 
technicians to build schools and train young jamaicans 
soon the firebrand jamaican with the trademark bush jacket and 
camouflaged ascot was a familiar figure around the world and a thorn 
in washingtons side foreign investors fled and grocery shelves 
emptied 
in 1980 with the country at the edge of bankruptcy manley was 
turned out of the prime ministers office by conservative edward 
seaga in a landslide 
now after eight years out of government manley considers 
himself a wiser man whose top priority is a new beginning with 
the united states and western financial institutions upon which his 
developing nation depends

the guggenheim museum may not reclaim a 200000 
marc chagall painting it says was stolen 24 years ago and discovered 
in a fifth avenue home a manhattan judge ruled 
state supreme court justice shirley fingerhood said thursday that 
amuseum officials never reported the theft of the 1912 gouache 
menageries because they admittedly were embarrassed by its loss 
and feared adverse publicity 
the property owner has an obligation to use reasonable efforts 
to locate its property the judge said in a sixpage decision 
plaintiff did nothing for 20 years except search its premises 
museum officials said they suspected a former mailroom employee 
had taken the gouache a type of watercolor along with four other 
paintings but had no proof 
jules and rachel lubell bought the painting in 1967 for 17000 
from the robert elkon gallery on madison avenue it was unclear how 
elkon got it 
when the lubells tried to have the painting appraised in 1985 an 
employee of sothebys who formerly worked at the guggenheim 
recognized the painting from an art dealers transparency 
that employee called the guggenheim about the missing chagall 
which has been valued at 200000 and the museum traced the 
painting to the lubells

roman catholic officials in the united states 
hailed a new vatican denunciation of racism saying it marks a 
milestone in the churchs assault on racial hatred 
this is the first time for a statement of this magnitude 
said john carr social development specialist for the us catholic 
conference 
carr said the document released today shows the connection 
between different types of social racism whether based on skin 
color religion ethnicity or economic condition 
racism is a part of prejudice against foreigners jews or the 
poor as well as against people of different color he said all 
are linked in some way 
he said the document sees them all as assaults on human 
dignity and to eliminate them calls for a change of hearts as 
well as a change of structures 
the vatican report the church and racism towards a more 
fraternal society examines the history and causes of racism and 
singles out specific countries for criticism it said much still 
needs to be done to combat racism in the united states 
several church authorities hailed the educational value of the 
document and its potential impact on society including its sharp 
condemnation of south africas apartheid system of racial separation 
this is particularly important at this time carr said 
eugene fisher director of the catholic bishops office for 
catholicjewish relations said the document was the first 
official church statement to link antizionism with antisemitism 
which it firmly condemns 
this is very helpful fisher said antizionism often is 
used as a cover 
regarding the document generally fisher said it seems to be 
striving for a fundamental theory of racism in all its 
manifestations and distinction as one of the fundamental evils 
of our times 
its the first document that attempts this kind of depth 
analysis putting racism into its larger context he said the 
phenomenon of prejudice and animosities in the world have the same 
dynamics 
hatred is hatred he added whether directed at the poor 
blacks immigrants foreigners or other groups treated as inferiors 
or outsiders 
he said the new document should help expand the horizons of 
americans by its dynamics i would like to see it become a 
centerpiece of educational efforts in communities across the 
country 
auxiliary bishop john ricard of baltimore chairman of the 
bishops committee for black catholics called the document a 
milestone 
it is the first time in my memory that the holy see has 
explicity singled out the issue of racism as a primary factor in 
causing divisions in the human family as a source of suffering and 
threat to peace ricard said 
ricard who is black termed the document very comprehensive in 
its breadth and depth adding i think it will be extremely 
helpful to us and to our brothers and sisters in south africa who 
are under institutional racism

military headquarters has denied a 
claim that south african troops invaded angola this week in 
violation of a regional peace agreement 
angolas defense ministry in a statement reported thursday by 
the angolan news agency angop said south african troops penetrated 
25 miles into southern angola a day earlier in support of the unita 
rebel movement 
angop said there was a clash in which the south africans used 
longrange artillery but it made no mention of any casualties 
south african military headquarters said in response that its 
forces were strictly observing the peace agreement signed in 
december 
the agreement bars south african military support for unita and 
calls for withdrawal of cuban troops from angola where they have 
been supporting the marxist government in the civil war the treaty 
also calls for implementation of a un plan to bring independence 
to namibia which south africa has ruled since world war i 
allegations like this could have a detrimental effect on 
agreements already signed the south african statement said 
conflicts between fapla the angolan armed forces and unita 
should not be laid at south africas door it said the joint 
military monitoring commission was established under the peace 
agreement precisely to investigate such allegations 
unita was not party to the peace agreement and says it plans to 
continue fighting

the government today began talks with two 
longtime foes tackling political reforms as part of a series of 
negotiations aimed at legalizing solidarity and signing a new social 
accord 
in southern poland solidarity leader lech walesa urged 2000 
people in a rally to support efforts to reach agreement with 
authorities 
in warsaw adam michnik and jacek kuron opposition philosophers 
and essayists who have been active in antigovernment organizing 
since 1968 were prominent among the group taking seats at the 
council of ministers palace 
last year the government opposed permitting the pair into the 
proposed talks but dropped the objections following last months 
communist party decision to seek an agreement with the opposition 
in 1976 michnik and kuron were founding members of the committee 
for defense of workers and michniks collected essays letters 
from prison have provided much of the philosophical underpinning 
for the polish opposition movement 
the broad talks began monday and working groups have been 
meeting through the week on specific topics the full negotiations 
are expected to last four to six weeks 
the group on political reform holding its first meeting today 
with 36 participants will face some of the most delicate problems 
the government has insisted that in exchange for legalizing 
solidarity again the union agree on a package of political and 
economic reforms help draft a new law on elections and participate 
in parliament and other official forums 
it would put the opposition in the position of endorsing a 
political system that guarantees communist domination and some 
opposition members are wary of being coopted 
in krakow walesa tried to sell his vision of seeking a 
compromise to the crowd at the 600yearold jagiellonian university 
walesa invoked a slogan that rhymes in polish agreement 
builds disagreement ruins 
if you take the path of peaceful evolution it will be a 
revolution he told the crowd including many students that 
overflowed from a cramped auditorium let us give the talks a 
chance let us not provoke because then we will all have to pay 
walesa spoke for 10 minutes and spent another hour answering 
questions from the audience earlier in the day he met privately 
with krakow roman catholic cardinal franciszek macharski 
later he was to travel to the industrial city of bielskobiala 
site of polands smallcar factory 
walesa met thursday night with workers from the strikeprone nowa 
huta steel mill asking them to set aside the local grievances for 
now in order to help regain solidaritys right to function legally 
a mediator sent by walesa helped settle a strike thursday by 
thousands of workers at the belchatow power plant in central poland 
but new signs of labor unrest appeared this morning when a strike 
over wages declared by the increasingly militant official union opzz 
crippled bus service in piotrkow trybunalski a central poland 
provincial capital of 80000 people

about twothirds of israeli jews would return 
some occupied territory in exchange for peace and more than half 
want to negotiate with the plo under certain conditions according 
to two polls published today 
the results indicate that israelis are more dovish than their 
current leadership prime minister yitzhak shamir has repeatedly 
said he will never negotiate with the palestine liberation 
organization and the platform of his likud bloc rules out 
relinquishing the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
likud and israels other main political bloc the centerleft 
labor party formed a coalition government in december after 
elections failed to give either party a clear mandate labor is 
willing to trade some territory for peace 
israel captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip from 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
a survey by the israel institute of applied social research 
showed that 65 percent of 1192 israeli jews questioned were willing 
to give up at least a small part of the occupied lands 
of those 17 percent wanted to return all or most of the 
territories according to the poll which was published by the daily 
jerusalem post thirtyfive percent opposed any territorial 
concessions compared to 45 percent two years ago the survey was 
conducted in january and has a margin of error from 3 percent to 5 
percent 
the poll indicated israelis resent outside involvement in 
settling the arabisraeli conflict asked whether israel should 
agree if the united states exerts pressure on it to withdraw from 
most of the occupied lands 73 percent said no the figure has 
remained unchanged for the past 11 years the poll said 
another poll conducted by the dahaf institute in the first week 
of february found that 53 percent of israeli jews favor talking to 
the plo under certain conditions 
of that group however 38 percent said the plo has not yet 
fulfilled its promises of renouncing terror and recognizing israel 
and that talks should only begin when those conditions are met 
plo chief yasser arafat said in december that he renounced terror 
and recognized israel prompting the united states to open a 
dialogue with the organization 
another 15 percent of those polled by dahaf said arafat has lived 
up to his promises and talks should begin immediately 
fortytwo percent opposed talks with the plo under any conditions 
a similar survey conducted in december found 54 percent backing 
talks with the plo under certain conditions and 44 percent ruling 
out any contacts 
dahaf questioned 1209 israeli jews the poll has a margin of 
error of 25 percent 
asked whether arafat was sincere in announcing that he was 
interested in peace with israel only 11 percent said yes while 89 
percent said no 
in results published earlier by dahaf the poll showed that 77 
percent of the respondents oppose the formation of a palestinian 
state compared to 23 percent who favor such a state 
the results indicated a slight thaw in israeli attitudes a 
decade ago 90 percent of israeli jews opposed the formation of a 
palestinian state

the winter flu season has hit full stride from 
coast to coast and 1989 is shaping up as a fairly typical year for 
the annual scourge according to the federal centers for disease 
control 
there have been numerous outbreaks requiring closings of 
schools and where everybodys feeling miserable dr robert 
cannon a cdc viral specialist said thursday i wouldnt feel 
uncomfortable saying there is an epidemic of influenza of course 
there is every year 
last week for the second week in a row the percentage of deaths 
attributable to either pneumonia or influenza exceeded the expected 
statistical standard for this time of year cannon said 
in the first week of the month there were 982 deaths attributed 
to the two illnesses in the 121 us cities the cdc regularly 
monitors the agency does not compile separate statistics for flu 
alone during the same period last year 820 people died 
flu hits its highest level during the winter months in the united 
states and the level has reached about as high as it was last 
year cannon said its a typical year 
researchers with the atlantabased cdc dont keep track of 
exactly how many people have influenza or flulike illness or 
even pneumonia what they do know is that states from coast to coast 
have reported at least some confirmed flu cases 
the 198889 flu vaccine recommended by the cdc contains 
protection against three different flu strains seen late last 
winter the victoria flu the sichuan flu and the taiwan flu 
all three appear to be back this year with the victoria flu seen 
most frequently cannon said

the largest exhibition of avantgarde art in 
chinas history reopened today five days after police shut it down 
when artists defied a ban on performance art and a sculptor shot her 
own work with a bb gun 
the sculptor said she didnt regret shooting her work and that 
finally the piece had been completed 
it was something i had to do but i didnt realize it would 
cause such a stir xiao lu the 26yearold artist said in an 
interview at the china art gallery the piece needed to be 
destroyed slightly to be perfected 
ms xiao and her boyfriend tang song were arrested and spent 
three days in jail after the incident they were released wednesday 
two days early and the case has been closed 
my speedy release is a good sign ms xiao said the police 
were very reasonable they tried very hard to understand my 
motives 
none of the 300 works of art were removed during the threeday 
closure although such a move was discussed said fei dawei an 
exhibition organizer 
museum officials however ordered the organizers to hire about 
20 security guards to prevent any more performance art 
fei said that if artists continued to defy the ban on performance 
art the show could be closed again he said museum officials banned 
the art form because they said it might cause chaos in society 
because this is the first nationwide show of avantgarde art 
they said it was too early to do performance art fei said but 
we will be doing it in the future 
police closed the show sunday after a series of performance art 
pieces rocked the exhibition 
one artist sold shrimp to protest the commercialization of 
art 
three others wrapped from head to toe in white cloth walked 
around the gallery bumping into viewers 
another took off some of his clothes and squatted over several 
eggs 
one strolled around the gallery tossing handfuls of change and 
condoms on the floor 
museum officials ordered these artists to stop their performances 
but none was arrested 
shortly before noon ms xiao and tang entered the museum 
tang handed her a bb gun and she fired twice into her work 
dialogue a glassandmetal sculpture of a man and a woman 
talking to each other from two phone booths 
ms xiao fled the museum but tang was arrested by police she 
later turned herself in after spending most of the day watching the 
museum from across the street 
ms xiao said it was significant that tang helped her shoot her 
creation 
it was an artwork about communication between men and women 
she said so i needed him to help me add a destructive element 
even without performance art the show is an impressive one 
covering three floors of the gallery a variety of styles from 
abstract to expressionist to video art are represented 
in one corner viewers surrounded a waterbed filled with dead 
fish in another a crowd swarmed around three huge balloons shaped 
like breasts

fire across beiruts dividing green line since last week police 
said today 
a police spokesman also said unidentified gunmen fired rifle 
grenades thursday night at two checkpoints manned by syrian soldiers 
in moslem west beirut but no casualties were reported 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
regulations said the sniper victims were civilians

western side of the green line which has divided beirut into 
sectarian districts since the outbreak of civil war in 1975 the two 
other victims were killed in christian east beirut the spokesman 
said 
he said it could not be determined who was provoking increased 
exchanges of sniper fire across the green line in the past two 
weeks the line is a traditional civil war front in beirut but had 
been calm for more than a year 
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the grenade 
attacks in west beirut which apparently were intended to discredit 
the syrians peacekeeping role 
syria the main power broker in lebanon maintains 40000 troops 
in eastern and northern provinces as well as in west and south 
beirut under a 1976 arab league mandate to end the civil war

galeforce winds that turned to breezes 
dramatically slowed the progress of the yacht thursdays child 
delaying its recordbreaking arrival at the golden gate by as much 
as a day 
the racing sloop made such poor progress thursday that 
spokeswoman nancy lush said it would be miraculous if thursdays 
child sailed into san francisco bay today 
she said it would likely arrive on saturday still smashing the 
worlds oldest existing speed record by nine days the ship left new 
york on nov 23 in an assault on a 135yearold record for sailing 
around cape horn to san francisco 
the record for the 14500mile trip had been held by the 
2376ton clipper ship flying cloud which sailed in 1854 and made 
the voyage in 89 days 8 hours 
at midday thursday the 10ton thursdays child was 300 miles 
south of the golden gate making only 6 knots in unfavorable winds 
the position was about 60 miles west of santa barbara west of san 
miguel island 
after hitting reported galeforce winds up to 40 knots earlier in 
the day thursdays child apparently hit shifting winds to the 
north forcing it to tack east and west in order to progress to the 
north 
northerly winds for northbound boats on the west coast always 
signal a frustrating timeconsuming tacking drill also tough on 
the crew 
the merchantman flying cloud with its 17story masts that could 
carry 35 sails was the marvel of its day it was reputed the 
fastest of thousands of sailing vessels that raced each other across 
the atlantic and pacific often with perishable cargo

the united states said today it is committed to 
ending apartheid in south africa but remains opposed to imposing 
further economic sanctions to achieve that goal 
us delegate william h marsh told the united nations human 
rights commission that american laws imposed some of the worlds 
most severe restrictions on trade with south africa but without 
significant results 
because of our experience the united states believes the idea 
of comprehensive and mandatory sanctions can contribute very little 
toward achieving the abolition of apartheid the fundamental goal we 
all share he said 
marsh spoke as the 40nation commission discussed a un report 
that says south africas black majority overwhelmingly favors 
sweeping economic diplomatic and other sanctions as the most 
effective way to pressure the white government to end racial 
discrimination 
earlier this week the us state department said in its annual 
report on human rights worldwide that conditions in south africa 
continued to deteriorate last year because of greater government 
repression of opponents of apartheid

accident in april 1986 
last week the government newspaper izvestia said 20 byelorussian 
villages were being abandoned the number of people affected was not 
given but the newspaper said 1200 apartments would be built for 
them 
the contaminated area is twice the size of massachusetts 
chernobyl is just south in the ukraine which was not addressed in 
the article 
soviet officials did not report the chernobyl accident until 
three days later when sweden complained of unusually high radiation 
levels reports on the cleanup have been sketchy 
tass said on thursday the radiation absorbed by the residents of 
the byelorussian zone was nearly three times that found elsewhere 
but still less than 60 percent of the permissible level according 
to yevtukh it added however that no one precisely knows how 
much radiation is dangerous 
the contaminated area is divided into four zones starting with 
that immediately adjacent to the power plant tass said 4400 people 
were evacuated from the closest zone immediately after the accident 
about 19000 people were moved in the next four months from what 
now is called the second zone the report said 
in the third zone which covers 400 communities in the gomel and 
mogilev regions of byelorussia authorities were giving medical 
checkups to more than 100000 residents and taking decontamination 
measures tass said 
in the fourth the health of the 200000 residents and the purity 
of their food were being monitored 
towns in the contaminated area were washed to remove fallout from 
roofs fences and walls also asphalt was replaced and hundreds of 
thousands of tons of topsoil were removed and buried tass reported 
but did not say where the contaminated soil was taken

prosecutors have dropped charges against a 
man accused of attacking actress tracy scoggins in a hotel elevator 
because she has refused to testify against him authorities said 
ms scoggins told a prosecutor she would not travel here to 
testify against pedro concepcion padilla because he was to be tried 
only on a misdemeanor assault charge the maximum penalty on the 
charge is 200 
she told me that she is unwilling to come here to prosecute him 
when all hes facing is a 200 fine assistant county attorney 
timothy byrne said at a court hearing thursday 
the charge was then dropped against padilla 36 of el paso 
ms scoggins who played the role of monica colby on the 
colbys television show said padilla pulled down her dress in a 
hotel elevator while she was in el paso to be cohost of the miss usa 
pageant in february 1988 
a grand jury declined to indict padilla on felony assault 
charges choosing to issue an indictment alleging a class c 
misdemeanor 
padillas lawyer jose montes said ms scoggins decision proves 
his contention that she was only seeking publicity from the alleged 
attack 
shes gotten what she wanted out of the case millions of 
dollars in publicity while my client has sat in jail montes 
said but padilla has spent only a few hours in jail since his 
arrest 
padillas arrest drew attention when he was released by a 
municipal magistrate on just 100 bond when arraigned on a felony 
charge of attempted sexual assault 
after it was revealed that padilla had given a false name at the 
arraignment another judge raised the bond to 100000 and ordered 
padilla rearrested padilla quickly posted the higher bond

a soviet newspaper said soviet jews have suffered 
discrimination for decades and that dictator josef stalin destroyed 
jewish culture in the country 
soviet officials have long denied western charges of 
antisemitism in their country however publications have recently 
engaged in far greater criticism of soviet society under a new 
government policy of glasnost or more openness 
the soviet culture newspaper carried a nearly fullpage article 
in thursdays editions on soviet antisemitism which it said has 
led to the moral damage of all society 
it is finally time to ponder the actual reason why tens of 
thousands of jews have renounced their soviet citizenship and left 
for other countries including israel the newspaper said in an 
article signed by historians c rogov and v nosenko 
because of the emigration of thousands even tens of thousands 
many jews who didnt intend to leave the motherland encountered 
problems in obtaining education and jobs 
the soviets have allowed growing numbers of jews to leave the 
country in recent years after granting visas for only 681 people in 
1986 they let more than 15000 depart last year 
an estimated 18 million jews remain in the soviet union 
although antisemitism in russia dates at least to the 19th 
century when pogroms sent the first wave of russian jewish emigres 
to the united states the article singled out stalin for blame 
stalin who killed millions of his own people destroyed jewish 
culture in the soviet union the newspaper said 
soviet officials and publications have in recent months 
repeatedly attacked stalin who ruled from 1924 to 1953 for many 
abuses including killing about 40 million people with his political 
purges and programs 
the newspaper implied that officials treated all jews as if they 
would soon be leaving and that soviets have long looked on emigres 
as traitors abandoning their homeland limits were secret but 
enacted without trouble it said 
the paper said the result of this discrimination can be seen in 
statistics 
the number of jewish students in higher education was cut in 
half and the traditionally high proportion of jews in specialty 
occupations also dropped the paper said it did not give more 
specific figures or the time periods for the decreases

a jet chartered by the united nations 
arrived in kabul today with 30 tons of wheat and dried milk to help 
feed the most needy people in the embattled capital 
the ethiopian airlines boeing 707 emblazoned with un on one 
side was loaded with 238 bags of supplies to be handed out to 
30000 people targeted as the most vulnerable to the bitter winter 
and food shortages plaguing kabul 
the food will be distributed from 30 centers around kabul 
beginning sunday said steffan de mistura a spokesman for the un 
office of economic and humanitarian assistance to afghanistan 
this is a small step a small shipment which we hope will be 
able to make a real difference to the lives of some of the 
vulnerable groups in kabul that have been suffering from a hard 
winter and being caught in the middle of war said ross mountain 
deputy drector of the countrys un development program 
an estimated 350000 people in kabul have been suffering from a 
lack of food and fuel during one of the citys harshest winters in 
years 
un officials say that if the conditions deteriorate those who 
will be most affected will be children between the ages of 1 and 5 
pregnant women and nursing mothers 
another 360 tons of food medicine and blankets will be airlifted 
into kabul within the next 10 days weather permitting de mistura 
said 
kabul has been hit by severe shortages since early january 
because of bad weather and attacks by moslem rebels that have 
disrupted convoys coming from the soviet union 
the soviet union last month began airlifting supplies into the 
city delivering flour canned meat and other items dozens of 
soviet military transport planes land daily in kabul 
soviet officials have delivered more than 6000 tons of flour 
this month about half the amount they said they wanted to airlift 
in before the feb 15 deadline for their armys withdrawal from the 
country 
the goods are distributed on a couponrationing system but only 
government employees and supporters of the ruling party have access 
to the supplies 
the united nations originally chartered an egyptian airlines 
plane to fly in shipments to kabul but on wednesday officials said 
the crew backed out because of concern for their safety 
a sixmember ethiopian crew headed by capt sisay tadisse 
agreed to do the job 
i find it rather beautiful that after many years when the 
united nations has been airlifting goods into ethiopia it is the 
ethiopian airline that helps out the un de mistura said 
michael keating of the world food program said the crew had no 
problems on the flight asked if he was concerned about safety 
during the flight tadisse said a little bit 
in neighboring pakistan afghan rebels met today to debate a

the meeting or shura coming five days before the scheduled 
departure of all soviet troops from afghanistan has been seen by 
western advisers as a lastditch effort to avert a civil war between 
the factions and consolidate power against the kabul government 
a spokesman for sibghatullah mojaddidi chairman of the alliance 
of pakistanibased rebels said after the opening session the 
meeting would adjourn indefinitely until leaders agree on a 
compromise for including the iranbased contingent 
mohammad karim khalili chairman of the iranbased coalition

brains dulled by age may be restored to the 
quick brightness of youth by a new drug developed for treatment of 
stroke chicago researchers report in a study published today 
experts at northwestern university medical school say that a drug 
called nimodipine was able to reinvigorate aging brains with the 
fast learning ability of youth in a laboratory test using young and 
middleaged rabbits 
the older rabbits receiving the drug actually learned at the 
same rate if not a slightly faster rate than the young rabbits 
said john f disterhoft a cell biology professor who directed the 
study twothirds of the control group older rabbits not 
receiving the drug never did learn the task 
he said that although the experiment used only a laboratory test 
of learning there is every reason to believe that the results 
would also apply to higher learning skills results of the study 
were published in the journal science 
the northwestern experiment used four groups of rabbits rabbits 
in two of the groups were about 30 months old about middle age for 
rabbits the other two groups were three months old young adult age 
for rabbits 
nimodipine was administered to one of the older groups and to one 
of the younger groups the others were kept free of the drug to 
provide control or comparison groups 
to test learning ability all of the rabbits were exposed to the 
sound of a tone immediately followed by a mild burst of air against 
the eye the air burst causes the eye to blink 
this process was repeated 80 times a day the researchers 
measured how soon and how often the rabbits learned to anticipate 
the burst of air by closing their eyes at the sound of the tone 
each group received 15 training sessions 
disterhoft said that four of six older rabbits who did not 
receive nimodipine never did learned to blink at the sound the 
other two did learn but at a slower rate than the older rabbits 
receiving the drug 
all of the aging nimodipine animals learned the task in less 
than eight days of training he said and this was slightly faster 
than the learning rate shown by both the groups of young rabbits 
disterhoft said nimodipine did not make the younger rabbits any 
smarter the drug appears to help only the aged brain 
disterhoft said the experiment was suggested after german doctors 
noticed that stroke patients seemed to recover some learning 
abilities when they were treated with nimodipine 
the drug manufactured by miles inc was approved by the food 
and drug administration last december to treat impairment among 
patients who have suffered a ruptured blood vessel in the brain 
which is a type of stroke bob quick a miles spokesman said the 
drug is marketed under the name nimotop he said it is approved for 
use now only by some types of stroke patients and is does not have 
fda approval for other uses miles plans to market the drug in the 
united states starting in april 
disterhoft said it is not known exactly why the drug appears to 
restore learning deficits in aging brains but it may be related to 
the cellular absorption of calcium nimodipine is a calcium channel 
blocker which means it prevents cells from taking up excess 
calcium this is not related directly to calcium in the diet 
in aging humans one of the causes of problems in neurons 
brain cells is too much calcium he said this nimodipine 
might counteract that inappropriately high level of calcium 
more study will be needed before the drug could be used strictly 
for the purpose of sharpening the learning ability of aging minds 
but disterhoft said it could be a candidate for such use 
the airpuffintheeye test used on the rabbits also has been 
used to test learning ability among humans 
at about 40 years of age there is a clear deficit of learning 
this task in humans said disterhoft a comparable deficit 
occurs in rabbits at about 30 months of age which is the beginning 
of middle age for rabbits 
the air puff task may not take great mental exertion but 
disterhoft said it is a direct test of mental sharpness 
this is an associative learning task and there is every reason 
to believe it test results would apply to other forms of higher 
learning as well he said 
working with disterhoft on the experiment were richard a deyo 
and karen t straube also of northwestern 
science is the journal of the american association for the 
advancement of science

afghan insurgents today met to debate 
a future islamic government in afghanistan but iranianbased 
guerrillas boycotted the gathering because of a feud with the 
pakistanibased faction 
journalists were allowed access to the site a religious complex 
at the outskirts of islamabad for only 10 minutes 
a spokesman for sibghatullah mojaddidi chairman of the alliance 
of pakistanibased insurgents said after the opening session the 
meeting would adjourn indefinitely until leaders agree on a 
compromise for including the iranbased contingent 
it will not be complete without representation from afghans 
living in iran the spokesman said earlier after the chairman of 
the iranbased guerrillas announced his group would not participate 
the meeting or shura coming five days before the scheduled 
departure of soviet troops from afghanistan has been seen by 
western advisers as a lastditch effort to avert a civil war between 
the factions and consolidate power against the weakened 
sovietbacked government in kabul 
several hundred pakistanbased insurgents officials of previous 
afghan governments scholars and exiles attended todays session 
mohammad karim khalili chairman of the iranbased coalition 
said the dispute was over representation to the shura and a separate 
supreme council composed of guerrilla leaders and their appointees 
the supreme council would make many daytoday decisions of a rebel 
government 
he said his iranbased guerrillas were promised seven cabinet 
positions and six seats on this supreme council as well as 100 
delegates to the shura during a meeting several days ago in tehran 
with mojaddidi 
on thursday the pakistanibased guerrilla spokesman qaribur 
rehman saeed said the insurgents living in iran were offered 80 
delegate seats there were no offers of cabinet positions or supreme 
council seats 
we have problems big problems saeed told reporters 
khalili said he agreed on the higher figures with mojaddidi but 
reports circulated today in pakistans official pakistan times that 
mojaddidi had been replaced as leader of the guerrillas based in 
pakistan 
a spokesman for mojaddidis afghan national liberation front 
ghulam waziri denied the reports 
waziri said the iranbased afghans broke off talks after four of 
the seven guerrilla groups in the pakistani alliance refused to 
accept their representation figures 
the majority of afghan fighters based in iran belong to 
afghanistans minority shiite sect of islam the pakistanbased 
guerrillas are sunni moslems which represent about 80 percent of 
afghans 
the guerrilla leaders had been touting todays meeting as a 
political solution to 10 years of fighting between us and 
pakistanibased guerrillas and sovietbacked communists 
the guerrillas political maneuvering over a future government 
assumes the fall of afghanistans ruling communists after the soviet 
troop withdrawal 
the soviets had 115000 troops in afghanistan before the 
withdrawal began in may under a unmediated agreement most of the 
several thousand remaining troops are believed headed home along the 
salang highway 
soviet forces intervened in afghanistan in 1979 to support the 
afghan communists against the guerrillas the communists seized 
power in a 1978 coup

andrei sakharov the human rights 
campaigner from the soviet union became an honorary citizen of this 
renaissance city today 
the scientist thanked the citizens of florence and all others who 
supported him during his struggles with five soviet regimes 
its been said here that liberty and fraternity unite people 
the nobel peace prize winner said certainly thats true but there 
is another thing that unites us the knowledge of the danger that 
threatens mankind 
i think a city like florence with its grand humanistic 
tradition can contribute strongly to mankinds following the road 
of understanding tolerance and wisdom the only road by which we 
can avoid this danger 
during his fiveday visit to italy sakharov has cited pollution 
and the threat of nuclear war as dangers 
he told 200 people in a city government hall that his trip to 
florence was an emotional one 
his wife yelena bonner also a human rights activist stayed in 
florence several times in the 1970s and early 1980s when seeking 
treatment for an eye problem she always told me how she felt 
protected and surrounded by warmth in this city sakharov said 
the florence city government voted in february 1980 to make 
sakharov an honorary citizen a month earlier he had been banished 
to the closed soviet city of gorky for what moscow called 
antisoviet behavior 
during his nearly seven years in gorky sakharov went on several 
hunger strikes so that his wife also sent into exile could travel 
to italy for operations 
in conferring the certificate of honorary citizenship florence 
mayor massimo bogianckino hailed sakharov for his human rights work 
sakharov accepted the document to the blare of horns played by 
musicians dressed as renaissance courtiers in redandwhite velvet 
tunics a huge banner with a red fleurdelis the symbol of 
florence dominated the gilttrimmed room where the government has 
met for nearly eight centuries 
during sakharovs sevenyear detention the soviet government 
said he would never be allowed to leave the country because of his 
knowledge of state secrets the nuclear physicist helped develop the 
soviet hydrogen bomb 
but in december 1986 soviet president mikhail gorbachev released 
the couple from internal exile

ronald h brown was elected today chairman of 
the democratic party the first black to head a major political 
party and said his chairmanship wont be about race it will be 
about the races we win 
you have made history he told the democratic national 
committee moments after it elected him chairman by acclamation 
a former aide to sen edward m kennedy dmass and adviser to 
jesse jackson brown was unopposed for the party chairmanship 
four other contenders to succeed paul g kirk jr in the top 
party post dropped out early in the contest 
there is no need to dwell on but we cannot ignore the history 
of this moment he said let me speak frankly he went on i 
did not run on the basis of race but i will not run away from it 
i am proud of who i am and i am proud of this party for we 
are truly americas last best hope to bridge the divisions of race 
region religion and ethnicity 
brown said his first priority would be winning elections and i 
promise you the story of my chairmanship wont be about race it 
will be about the races we win over the next four years 
he is stepping in as chairman of the democratic party with a 
pledge to reach out to the moderates and conservatives who opposed 
him because of his ties to kennedy and jackson 
as he made the rounds thursday of meetings of party officials 
brown acknowledged that many democrats had been reluctant to support 
his bid for the chairmanship 
it no longer mattered he said whether people were early 
supporters or late most of all weve got to be united as a 
party 
a 47yearold partner in one of washingtons largest and most 
politically active law firms patton boggs amp blow brown was 
deputy manager of kennedys 1980 presidential campaign and then 
served as general counsel and staff director of the senate judiciary 
committee 
he was a top adviser to jackson in the late stages of his 1988 
presidential campaign and was given credit for helping unify the 
party at its atlanta convention last summer 
brown grew up in harlem where his father was manager of the 
theresa hotel but his parents both graduates of howard university 
sent their only child to predominantly white schools on manhattans 
upper east side 
that pattern continued into college where brown was the only 
black in the class of 1962 at middlebury college in vermont 
i have maintained a significant interest in politics over the 
years brown wrote in autobiographical notes for his 25th reunion 
yearbook at middlebury 
his involvement with the liberal wing of his party was the focus 
of much of the opposition to brown when he announced his bid for the 
chairmanship 
but once he clinched the job even his most vocal opponents 
rallied around the chairmantobe 
i say lets give him a chance said john baker chairman of 
the alabama democratic party who once threatened to boycott the 
national party if brown became chairman 
a lot of democrats feel excluded feel rejected said baker 
they feel theres no room in the party for them because they are 
moderate or conservative in philosophy 
the alabama chairman said it would be helpful first of all if 
hed acknowledge that weve got that problem 
brown did just that 
the south is crucial to the future of the democratic party 
brown told a meeting of the southern caucus of the democratic 
national committee 
i dont want to be the chairman of a party that writes off any 
region of the country he said to democrats aware their 
presidential candidates have received none of the souths electoral 
votes in the last two elections 
brown urged democrats to speak forcefully on defense crime 
and drugs issues he said are in the forefront of voter concerns

a federal judge with a reputation for resolving 
lawsuits quickly has decided to slow down to protest the 
congressional vote to scuttle 51 percent pay raises for federal 
lawmakers and judges 
chief judge carl rubin of the southern district of ohio said he 
will limit himself to two civil trials a month starting with his 
oldest cases 
im not willing to take this lying down rubin told the 
cincinnati enquirer in an interview published today i believe i 
have been dealt with unjustly this is the only way i have to 
protest 
rubin 69 said he intended to work for 100 an hour since his 
pay is 89500 a year he calculated that he would have to work 900 
hours a year or about 20 hours a week 
congress voted tuesday to block a proposal which would have 
automatically raised pay for its members and federal judges to 
135000 
under his slowdown rubin said a lawsuit will take about 20 
months to come to trial in his court instead of a year he said 20 
months is the national average 
im not required to be a particularly speedy judge he said 
im going to be an average judge if im being paid in that 
fashion ill work in that fashion

the states house of representatives has 
passed a bill repealing new hampshires 200yearold law that makes 
adultery a crime punishable by a year in jail 
the measure passed 201149 thursday goes to the senate where a 
similar bill two years ago was defeated 
what two consenting adults do with each other is not for the 
state to interfere with rep scott green said during floor debate 
supporters of the measure also said the law is unenforceable but 
critics said passage of the repeal bill would lead to a perception 
that new hampshire tolerates adultery 
morality is a part of government said rep daniel healy 
washington dc is a good example of what happens when 
immorality takes place 
the law which hadnt been enforced in decades became an issue 
in 1987 when robert stackelbeck 37 of milford filed a lawsuit 
against daniel hebenstreit 37 charging him with committing 
adultery with 25yearold sharon stackelbeck 
hebenstreit denied the charge and police refused to prosecute 
stackelbeck filed his own complaint but later asked that the 
charges be dropped

striker was reported on the verge of kidney failure a human rights 
group said 
two antiapartheid church leaders archbishop desmond tutu and 
the rev allan boesak said they were considering joining the 
19dayold hunger strike about 300 of the estimated 1000 people 
detained without charge are participating in the strike demanding 
they be freed or put on trial 
the hunger strike represents one of the strongest challenges to 
the policy of detention without trial since president pw botha 
declared a national state of emergency in june 1986 
the three hunger strikers taken to hillbrow hospital in 
johannesburg brought to 11 the number that have been hospitalized 
this week according to the detainees aid center 
mark modiba who was sent to the hospital on wednesday was 
suffering from prerenal failure a serious kidney disorder the 
group said 
the strike began jan 23 at diepkloof prison outside johannesburg 
and has spread to at least three other cities 
the detainees some held for 32 months have demanded the 
government charge them with an offense or release them 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge for 
varying lengths of time under the state of emergency 
the emergency regulations have paralyzed the legal system 
because detainees cannot challenge their detention in court 
boesak said they have had to use this extreme method to draw 
attention to their plight 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said in parliament it is 
clear the strike is being orchestrated from outside 
it is not spontaneous but carefully planned worldwide by these 
organizations vlok said without referring to any groups by name 
most of the detainees taking part do not share the enthusiasm of 
these organizations 
he claimed some detainees were intimidated into joinging the 
strike 
vlok has said the detainees are being held for good reason 
and that the government chose not to charge them because it would be 
difficult to obtain convictions in many of the cases 
on thursday more than 40 civil rights lawyers pledged to fast 
for 48 hours in support of the strikers demands 
the star newspaper of johannesburg the countrys largestselling 
daily carried a feature article today about bobby sands the irish 
republican army leader who died at a prison in northern ireland in 
1981 after a 66day hunger strike

germany of a possible resurgence of ultrarightist tendencies

extreme rightwing group the republican party would win 115 
percent of the vote nationwide if federal elections were held now 
the republicans headed by a former nazi waffen ss soldier 
captured 75 percent of the vote in last months elections in west 
berlin that sends 11 party members to the local legislature and

officials said the foreign ministers of 
iran and iraq would hold direct talks today with secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar as mediator the first time the two 
ministers have agreed to facetoface talks 
the only thing i want is to agree on what to do next and to 
obtain from the two parties assurances that they will resume the 
direct talks perez de cuellar told the associated press as he 
left his home this morning 
the un chief said he hoped to persuade the foreign ministers to 
resume more extended direct talks perhaps in the end of march 
early april 
top un officials speaking on condition of anonymity said 
perez de cuellar would ask the two to begin talks with him today 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati met perez de cuellar 
this morning to receive the request 
his iraqi counterpart tariq aziz said thursday he is ready for 
talks with velayati in an effort to break the deadlock in the 
negotiations which began in august 
the two have met for peace talks in geneva and new york but have 
not held facetoface talks after initial appearances at a 
conference table for photographers they and their aides went to 
separate rooms 
velayati said on thursday that he expected to take part in 
threeway talks with aziz and the secretarygeneral he was at the 
un headquarters for a reception sponsored by his countrys un 
mission 
the persian gulf neighbors went to war in september 1980 they 
agreed to a unsponsored ceasefire that went into effect in 
august and was followed by peace talks 
unfortunately those meetings which were called direct 
talks were fruitless to a great extent aziz told reporters 
thursday 
 
both parties have expressed optimism and a willingness to talk 
but have given no sign they are ready to budge from their positions 
iran believes that the ceasefire is complete and that baghdad 
and tehran should move on to the next points in security council 
resolution 598 the 1987 un peace plan that calls for withdrawal 
of armies to the border exchange of prisoners of war and holding 
peace talks leading to a negotiated settlement 
iraq still occupies about 260 square miles of iranian territory 
baghdad says the ceasefire is not yet legally in place because 
iran has not yet yielded its right to search ships in international 
waters of the persian gulf for war material bound for iraq 
iraq says it will withdraw from the land it holds when iran gives 
up its right to search ships 
baghdad also wants iran to cooperate with an iraqi plan to have 
the united nations dredge and open the shattalarab waterway for 
use by both nations 
the waterway which forms part of their southern border is 
clogged with silt sunken ships and unexploded ordnance it is 
iraqs main outlet to the gulf along which iran has a long 
coastline 
iran has been unwilling to discuss the shatt alarab unless it 
retains sovereignty over the eastern half of the waterway under a 
1975 treaty iraq believes the treaty should be renegotiated

president bush told congress he needs 55 
billion to wage the war on drugs with the lions share going to law 
enforcement efforts including border interdiction 
the request is 21 percent more 974 million than the 46 
billion to be spent this year and it is 236 million more than 
former president reagan sought in his firstdraft 1990 plan 
submitted last month according to richard darman director of the 
office of management and budget 
bushs proposal thursday calls for almost 970 million to 
educate our young people to say no to drugs including programs 
from kindergarten through college 661 million to expand drug abuse 
treatment particularly for the indigent disadvantaged youth and 
expectant mothers and 39 billion for law enforcement efforts 
according to the budget documents 
although not included in the drug war proposals bush also called 
for 929 million in spending on corrections 
i want to make sure that when a drug dealer is convicted there 
is a cell waiting for him bush said thursday night in his 
nationally televised speech to congress he should not go free 
because prisons are too full 
sen joseph r biden ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee praised bush for adding 1 billion to the antidrug 
effort but said hes still got a way to go 
illegal drugs is a 100 billionayear business but we spend 
only onetwentieth of that amount trying to stop them he said 
at the very least we should fully fund the drug bill which will 
require another 500 million 
while the budget document listed actual outlay requests for broad 
goals it provided only multiyear authorization requests which 
generally are higher for more specific programs 
the authorization requests include 150 million for the justice 
departments program of drug grants to state and local governments 
reagan had eliminated all funding for such grants in his 1990 budget 
proposal 
the drug enforcement administration would get more than 300 new 
positions and would be called upon to increase its overseas 
operations 
funding for the state departments bureau of international 
narcotics matters would increase by 14 million to 115 million to 
allow for enhanced crop eradication and lab destruction in foreign 
drugproducing countries especially in the cocaineproducing 
countries of south america 
the us customs service would add about 550 people to its drug 
interdiction program authorized at a total of 442 million and the 
coast guards druginterdiction authorization would increase by 9 
percent to 690 million 
the defense department which congress authorized to get 300 
million in 1989 for its expanded role in the drug war would receive 
the same amount under bushs 1990 budget authorization request 
bush also requested 215 million for new organized crime drug 
enforcement task forces 
the budget request also calls for funding two new programs for 
antidrug education about 25 million would be spent on urban 
emergency grants to city school systems with the worst drug 
problems and 35 million would go for community partnership 
grants 
bush also is seeking 367 million for the drugfree schools and 
communities program which provide grants for states higher 
education institutions and teacher training among others 
in addition bush proposed 25 million to reduce admission delays 
to drug treatment programs 30 million for a new grant program to 
support expansion of treatment capacity for the indigent 
disadvantaged youth or expectant mothers in selected states which 
are seriously committed to expansion and a tripling of funding 
to 7 million for hhs research into effective treatment programs

after trading places with a student for a day 
georgia tech president john patrick crecine got into big trouble he 
was late for his calculus class 
meanwhile junior david ritchie was having a grand time as the 
universitys chief executive officer abolishing parking fees and 
giving pleasant contemplation to the idea of canceling classes 
crecine and junior ritchie exchanged car keys and identities 
thursday morning in a parking lot outside juniors grill 
crecine inherited a 1981 cutlass supreme and no special 
privileges while ritchie got the presidents new chrysler new 
yorker and all the perks and power of office 
each drove off with some lastminute advice from the other 
if the legislature calls theyre friends crecine told his 
alter ego take that call 
ritchie offered the president some tips on whre he might find a 
parking space an issue of great concern for tech students 
even with the inside scoop crecine had trouble parking and was 
15 minutes late for his 8 am calculus class 
this is embarrassing he said interrupting class about 
the best i can hope for is that there will be no pop quizzes 
trading places was the idea of techs student foundation a group 
that financially assists student organizations to raise money 
members of the foundation approached crecine about raffling off his 
job for a day and the president readily accepted 
ritchie said he bought 20 raffle tickets at 1 each about 260 
tickets were sold 
i wanted to get to see the administration from a different 
point of view or bring a different point of view to the 
administration the student said 
one of ritchies first actions although shortlived was to 
abolish fees at the new parking deck on campus he contemplated 
canceling classes but realized the move would let crecine off the 
hook 
but along with the power came responsibility after giving a 
speech to officials of the ford motor co ritchie was briefed on 
the universitys plans for restructuring its academic departments 
he also met with techs library director about the need for more 
funding 
ive found myself wanting to talk to people more but i have 
other appointments ritchie said the president only has so much 
time in a day 
although crecines schedule intentionally was designed by 
students to have builtin hassles getting a student identification 
card for instance the break from the daily meetings was a welcome 
relief 
this is a great luxury crecine said the notion of having 
some time where you get to concentrate on something longer than five 
minutes is refreshing its like being in an isolation tank 
ritchie and crecine both agreed theyd like to continue the swap 
but a deals a deal at the stroke of 5 pm they reluctantly 
resumed their former identities

a cuban cargo ship carrying 45 crew members was 
sliced in half by a miamibased cruise liner today just off the 
cuban coast leaving three missing and one man severely injured the 
coast guard said 
no one was reported hurt aboard the 734foot celebration cruise 
ship which remained in the area 20 miles off the eastern tip of 
cuba searching for more survivors said coast guard spokesman jeff 
karonis 
fortytwo of the 45 people aboard the 320foot cuban ship capitan 
san luis were rescued after the 6 am collision and brought aboard 
the celebration karonis said searchers were continuing to look for 
the other three 
karonis said the stern of the cuban vessel which carried cement 
sank immediately but the bow section remained floating 
we dont know what happened yet he said the only thing we 
know is that one of the cuban survivors said it happened rather 
suddenly 
numerous coast guard ships and planes were rushing to the site 
karonis said and a helicopter and a falcon jet were already on the 
scene this morning 
the cuban government is also sending out some boats to 
search said joe dye another coast guard spokesman the coast 
guard informally advised the cuban government shortly after the 
accident 
the injured man whose foot was severed in the accident was 
expected to be taken to nearby matthew town on the bahamian island 
of great inagua and then transferred by coast guard jet to a miami 
hospital with a trauma center dye said 
we have also informally advised the cubans this morning 
karonis said noting that the collision occurred in heavily traveled 
shipping lanes only 20 miles off punta guarico near the eastern tip 
of cuba 
he said cuban ships were within fairly easy reach of the spot 
but did not know if they had arrived yet 
karonis said there was no information yet on whether the accident 
caused a major oil spill but said it was likely fuel tanks were 
split aboard the capitan san luis when it was cut in half 
the liberianregistry celebration owned by carnival cruise lines 
in miami and believed to be on its way back to miami after a stop in 
san juan puerto rico reported only minor damage karonis said 
because the accident happened on the high seas between a liberian 
and a cuban ship the coast guard will not formally investigate the 
cause dye said those two nations will have to determine the cause 
of the collision 
carnival spokesmen were not immediately available to answer phone 
calls according to office secretaries

a judge has appointed a lawyer as 
guardian for authorsinger barry sadler whose disabling injury in a 
shooting last fall touched off a legal dispute among his relatives 
attorney david brandon appointed as guardian thursday said he 
hopes to return sadler from brecksville veterans administration 
hospital in ohio to a va hospital in nashville or nearby 
murfreesboro 
sadler 48 who had the 1960s hit record ballad of the green 
berets and has also written a series of adventure novels has been 
the object of a legal tugofwar since he was braindamaged in a 
shooting in guatemala in september 
i think its necessary that we get mr sadler back here as fast 
as we can probate judge jim everett said in making the 
appointment 
brandon represents neither side of the family everetts office 
said today 
everett ordered sadlers relatives thursday not to comment 
derogatorily about each other in the presence of mr sadler or 
anyone else 
sadlers wife and children who live near nashville and his 
business agent rob robison filed a lawsuit in probate court on 
jan 10 they said they were to surprised to learn on the previous 
day that sadler had been discharged from the wade park veterans 
administration hospital in cleveland where he was transferred in 
november from nashvilles va hospital 
the lawsuit said the group had just learned that sadlers mother 
bebe sadler of denver had filed a petition for guardianship in 
cleveland on jan 5 
i think everybody probably has the right purpose in mind but 
theyre not going about it in the right way everett said 
a cleveland judge who visited sadler in a private hospital ruled 
jan 31 that sadler needs help in making medical and other 
decisions but after hearing from attorneys for both sides of 
sadlers family that judge said he would let everett name a neutral 
guardian

israel today rejected soviet accusations that it 
is violating the human rights of palestinians in the occupied 
territories saying moscows remarks were unjust and onesided 
the soviet union on thursday accused israel of crudely 
violating human rights and trampling underfoot generally recognized 
international legal norms in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the israeli authorities are stiffening reprisals against the 
innocent palestinian population and extensively using firearms and 
ammunition which leads to suffering injuries and the deaths of 
many people soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov said in a statement 
alon liel a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry said the 
statement was blatantly onesided he said it is unjust and 
therefore cannot be accepted with indifference 
the soviet criticism was relayed through the dutch embassy in 
moscow which represents israeli interests in the soviet capital 
it came one day after the us state department released a report 
outlining israeli abuses in the occupied lands where government 
troops have been battling palestinians in the 14month uprising 
against israeli rule 
the soviets called on israel to halt violent activity in the 
territories which moscow said could not be justified under any 
circumstances 
gerasimov criticized israel for relying on power methods 
instead of pursuing a middle east peace settlement to end the 
uprising 
liel said the soviet union could not help bring peace to the 
region unless it restored relations with israel broken after the 
1967 middle east war 
only after the restoration of ties will the soviet attitude be 
based on an understanding of the complexity of the issues in 
question liel said quoting from a statement being relayed to 
moscow 
israelsoviet relations have been improving slowly and the harsh 
exchange was not expected to threaten that progress said arye 
levine who represents israels interests in moscow 
they have probably thought long and hard before taking a 
position on this he said on israel radio they have taken a 
position but that does not affect the process of normalization 
of relations

the cambodian government is holding the 
remains of about eight americans killed during the indochina war a 
us religious figure today quoted the cambodian prime minister as 
saying 
w stanley mooneyham a former president of the christian aid 
group world vision said the prime minister hun sen told him in an 
interview feb 3 that about 10 percent of the 83 american servicemen 
washington lists as missing in action in cambodia have been found 
let us talk and we can discuss an aircraft to take them out 
mooneyham quoted hun sen as saying

disappeared in cambodia during the war which ended in 1975 they 
included journalists contractors a missionary and a merchant 
seaman a total of 2383 are listed as missing in action in vietnam 
cambodia laos and china 
hun sen was quoted as saying his government continued to search 
for mias but might abandon its efforts if the united states did not 
respond 
our people are losing faith in the search because we are being 
scolded by the united states instead of being encouraged 
mooneyham quoted hun sen as saying 
mooneyham first went to cambodia in 1968 and has known hun sen 
for 10 years mooneyham said he would relay information from his 
talks with hun sen to us embassy officials in bangkok and had 
offered to act as a mediator 
some us officials say the cambodian government hopes to use the 
mia issue to gain some form of recognition from washington the 
united states regards the phnom penh government as a puppet regime 
set up by vietnam after it invaded cambodia in late 1978 
mooneyham served as president of world vision from 1969 to 1982 
and now is involved in consulting and christian activities in 1980 
he persuaded hun sen to allow world vision to reopen a pediatrics 
hospital in phnom penh that the group built and staffed during the

prejudice in the united states but it cited the country as one of 
the most interracial societies in the world 
examining the history and causes of prejudice the 45page 
document warned of possible new forms of racism saying modern 
science could be exploited by apprentice sorcerers seeking to 
produce human beings selected by race 
the document titled the church and racism towards a more 
fraternal society was writted by the vaticans justice and peace 
commission at the request of pope john paul ii 
it said the roman catholic church wants first and foremost to 
change racist attitudes including those within her own 
communities and noted that throughout history church leaders 
themselves have not been blameless 
the document said harboring racist thoughts and attitudes is a 
sin against the specific message of christ 
racism still exists and continually reappears in different 
forms it is a wound in humanitys side that mysteriously 
remains open 
the document called south african apartheid institutionalized 
racism justified by an ideology of the superiority of persons 
from european stock over those of african or indian origin or 
colored which is by some supported by an erroneous 
interpretation of the bible 
under apartheid that nations black majority has no voice in 
national affairs 
today apartheid is the most marked and systematic form of 
racism the document said change is absolutely necessary and 
urgent 
there was no immediate comment from south africas government 
the document added it would be hypocritical to point a finger 
at only one country rejection based on race exists on every 
continent 
it called antisemitism the most tragic form that racist 
ideology has assumed in our century referring to the nazi 
extermination of millions of jews during world war ii 
as if some had nothing to learn from the crimes of the past 
certain organizations with branches in many countries keep alive 
the antisemite racist myth with the support of networks of 
publications it said 
the document cited terrorist attacks against jewish people and 
symbols and said antizionism serves at times as a screen for 
antisemitism feeding on it and leading to it 
in an apparent reference to the soviet union it noted some 
countries impose undue harassments and restrictions on jewish 
emigration 
the document said the world should not forget other mass 
exterminations such as that of armenians after world war i and 
cambodians in the 1970s 
the document expressed fear about new and yet unknown forms of 
racism that might appear as a result of artificial procreation 
techniques and the possibilities of genetic manipulation for racist 
ends it called for laws to prevent this 
the document praised the role of the catholic church in 
contributing to the passage of civil rights legislation in the 
united states but added despite ongoing efforts much still 
remains to be done to eliminate completely racial prejudice and 
behavior even in what can be considered one of the most interracial 
nations of the world 
among other things the document 
condemned legislation that discriminates against religious 
minorities singling out the imposition of the sharia or 
islamic law on nonmoslems in certain countries it did not name 
them 
cited problems of people who although living in their own 
land are subjected to humiliating conditions while not naming 
any people it said in a footnote the pope has often stated 
palestinians have the right to a homeland as well as jews 
called for revision of school history texts which falsify 
history pass over the historical misdeeds of racism in silence or 
justify the principles behind it

the government will try to persuade its 
nato allies to put off a decision on replacing some nuclear missiles 
in europe with longerrange rockets a spokesman for chancellor 
helmut kohl said today 
some western allies have viewed west germanys position on the 
plan as a test of its loyalty to the western military alliance 
the kohl spokesman friedhelm ost told reporters today that west 
germany sees no need for the 16member north atlantic treaty 
organization to decide the issue before 1991 the decision is now 
expected to be made in june 
the united states britain and other members of the western 
alliance have already voiced support for the missile upgrading 
which is referred to as modernization they have also suggested 
the alliance lay out its position on the controversial subject 
during a nato summit expected in june 
west german officials have been sending out conflicting signals 
over the past few months on whether they will approve the 
modernization plan 
kohl and his government have hinted they consider a decision this 
year to be premature and potentially harmful to eastwest 
disarmament talks 
today kohls spokesman made that position explicit 
we want no decision during this dynamic disarmament process 
ost said 
he refused to be pinned down however on whether west germany 
would go along with the rest of the alliance if allies press for the 
plan at the summit

the government has proposed a law that 
would redefine north korea as nonhostile in an effort to promote 
trade and other exchanges officials said today 
the decision came despite a snag this week in talks aimed at 
improving relations between the two koreas 
on wednesday the north postponed todays scheduled meeting of 
parliament members in the border truce village of panmunjom to 
protest annual ussouth korean joint miltitary exercises 
however south korean officials said today that highranking 
government officials and representatives of the governing democratic 
justice party made the decision to redefine north korea as 
nonhostile at a meeting thursday 
the participants also decided to set up a special committee to 
coordinate exchanges with north korea and other communist countries 
the officials said they said the proposed panel will be chaired by 
prime minister kang youngsoon 
officials said a bill will be sent to the national assembly 
following an endorsement of the plan by the cabinet next week 
a special assembly session will convene monday to take up several 
bills possibly the one redefining north korea 
the law would take precedence over security law that now defines 
the north as a hostile country and bans private sector contacts with 
north koreans 
the capitalist south is ideologically anticommunist and has 
until now banned activities and publications that support or 
sympathize with the north 
south korea and north korea were created at the end of world war 
ii and fought the korean war from 1950 to 1953 they are technically 
still at war because no peace treaty was signed and more than 1 
million heavily armed soldiers face each other across the 150mile 
border 
about 42000 us troops are stationed in south korea under a 
1954 mutual defense treaty 
under the proposed law described by the officials south korean 
nationals will be allowed to visit the north trade with the north 
would be treated as internal commerce and imports from the north 
would be exempt from import tariffs 
under a policy of detente the south recently held preliminary 
contacts with north korean lawmakers and government officials south 
korean traders also began to purchase north korean goods

president bush arrived here today for talks with 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney after vowing to attack the 
acid rain problem that has strained sound relations between the two 
friendly neighbors 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater speaking with 
reporters on air force one en route from washington said no 
agreements were expected to emerge from bushs first foreign trip as 
presiden 
on the eve of his visit here for five hours of meetings with 
mulroney bush declared regarding acid rain that the time for 
study alone has passed and the time for action is now 
in a speech to a joint session of congress on thursday night he 
urged creation of an acid rain program that would curb sulfur 
dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions he said he wanted timetables 
set but didnt announce what deadlines he had in mind 
still that was a step away from the policy of the reagan 
administration which insisted for eight years that more research 
was needed on acid rain and cleancoal technology before 
emissionreduction timetables could be considered 
mulroney greeted bush at an air base outside the city with 
canadian and american flags snapping in the wind behind them the 
two leaders then rode in a motorcade through snowcovered 
countryside to the complex of government buildings 
the first in a series of meetings took place in the official 
canadian government guest house bush and secretary of state james 
a baker iii and other top government aides sat across a long table 
from mulroney and his top assistants 
were here to do a little business mulroney said joking at 
one point that the 16degree temperature outside was quite different 
from the usual climate of bushs adopted home state of texas 
bush said in his speech to congress that his administration would 
honor a us commitment to canada to spend 25 billion over five 
years to develop technology for burning coal more cleanly he 
proposed spending 120 million in fiscal 1990 to curb acid rain 
roughly 25 million more than that proposed by the reagan 
administration 
mulroney in the early months of his second term as the 
progressive conservative party head of government has called bush a 
great friend of canada 
mulroney has said he expects a good relationship with washington 
to produce an agreement on acid rain an issue that has caused 
lingering strains between ottawa and washington 
in a letter at the front of a press book assessing uscanadian 
relations bush said he thought it was entirely fitting that he 
chose canada for his first visit outside the united states he 
called it our friend and neighbor to the north 
in advance of bushs trip to ottawa canadian officials had 
voiced hope of making headway on winning an american commitment to 
precise timetables for reducing industrial emissions wafting into 
canada from the united states 
in his proposed changes to the fiscal 1990 budget that former 
president reagan submitted bush indicated he will seek specific 
dates for reductions of certain emissions although the timetable 
was not spelled out 
mulroney had a halfday of meetings including a luncheon 
awaiting bush and the presidential entourage which included 
secretary of state james a baker iii national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and white house chief of staff john sununu 
aside from discussions of acid rain the two leaders were 
expected to review how each country will implement the uscanada 
free trade agreement now approved on both sides of the border the 
pact is aimed at phasing out all trade barriers between the two 
nations 
during a visit to washington in april 1988 mulroney pleaded 
before a joint meeting of congress for what he conceded would be 
expensive programs to clean up us plant emissions such pollution 
he said was responsible for half the acid rain that has killed 
15000 canadian lakes and threatened or damaged 300000 more 
during a briefing for white house reporters earlier this week 
scowcroft said he did not expect major new bush administration 
acidrain commitments in the ottawa talks bush merely reaffirmed a 
commitment that reagan had made but he proposed spending more money 
to attack the problem 
scowcroft said bush believes the first step has to be the 
domestic part of the acid rain agenda before hes prepared to be 
all that specific with the canadians 
edward fried a scholar at the liberaloriented brookings 
institution here said he did not think substantive issues needed to 
be discussed 
the bush trip fried said is a useful inexpensive gesture to 
the canadian people and to the canadian government i think its 
important for both of them to say there are going to be 
problems but were both going to win on this

israel remains the most reliable us 
ally in the world but it must recognize that the killing of 
palestinian civilians in the strifetorn west bank and gaza strip is 
clearly unacceptable vice president dan quayle told an american 
jewish group today 
the uprising by palestinians in those regions has resulted in 
nearly 400 palestinians being killed and many more injured quayle 
said in a speech prepared for a conference of the antidefamation 
league of bnai brith 
some may say that by the grisly standards of some of israels 
neighbors a few hundred people killed in the course of a yearlong 
uprising is not a very staggering figure he said 
but he added israel should be judged not by those standards but 
on the basis of standards which prevail in the democratic west 
and on the basis of these standards the status quo on the west bank 
and gaza strip is clearly unacceptable 
on the other hand quayle said the recent firstever talks 
between representatives of the united states and the palestine 
liberation organization do not indicate any fundamental change in 
attitude toward the plo or its leader yasser arafat 
he reiterated the cautionary stance taken by reagan 
administration officials who began the dialogue in the last days 
before president bush took office 
simple prudence obliges us to monitor mr arafat and his 
organization very carefully and to probe his words very closely 
before arriving at a final determination quayle said 
he added that while arafat has recognized the state of israel and 
renounced terrorism factions within the plo hold opposing 
viewpoints 
the vice presidents trip to florida also included a scheduled 
dinner speech to the cubanamerican bar association 
quayle speaking to reporters aboard air force two en route here 
said the new council on competitiveness that bush has named him to 
head would continue some of the regulatory review work handled by a 
deregulation commission under former president reagan 
but he said it also go beyond that to look at other factors 
affecting us industrys competitiveness in the world he said some 
of those areas would be job training and human resources 
bush announced creation of the council in his budget address to 
congress thursday night 
besides the new competitiveness council quayles only official 
duties are to head the national commission on space and to preside 
over the senate 
the vice president has said that with very few ongoing 
assignments from bush his principal role is to be an adviser to the 
president

violence over a ninemonth campaign 
the killing thursday of a pregnant housewife glenna williams 
raised to at least 12 the number of people killed in politically 
related violence since the campaign opened jan 15 
the island was generally quiet this morning but police reported 
isolated disturbances 
police chased off dozens of political activists who erected 
barricades of burning debris and blocked a road for about an hour 
today just outside spanish town the old colonial section of 
kingston police would not say whether the demonstrators were manley 
or seaga supporters 
the campaign was shortened to just over three weeks because of 
fears of violence at the height of the islands tourist season 
tourism the main industry has bounced back after hurricane gilbert 
raked the island sept 12 killed 45 people and left about 1 
billion in damage 
across the caribbean island 10000 police and soldiers were 
deployed to maintain order at more than 6000 polling stations but 
skirmishes broke out 
many polling stations closed early because of violence and 
soldiers fired shots and used tear gas in many instances to break up 
arguments 
attacks were confined mainly to slums in kingston the capital 
manley 64 told cheering supporters outside his headquarters 
let us set an example for all future generations of dignity and 
cooperation in victory it is not given to many people a second 
chance to serve a nation 
manley was prime minister from 1972 to 1980 his government then 
embraced cuba alarming the united states and foreign investors but

seaga restructured the economy by emphasizing exports raising 
taxes and laying off thousands of government workers although the 
economy grew it did not recover from the collapse of the vital 
bauxite industry in 1983 and the standard of living of jamaicas 
24 million people fell 
he is regarded as a skillful manager but aloof and autocratic 
manley a powerful orator with an engaging personality is seen by 
supporters a champion of the little people 
in the 1970s manley alienated the united states and foreign 
investors broke off with the international monetary fund and 
plunged jamaica into economic chaos 
manley has said he would reestablish diplomatic relations with 
cuba broken in 1980 by seaga but that a greater priority would 
be given to the us ties and relations with international lending 
agencies and business

four wyoming counties surrounding 
yellowstone national park received an economic boost from the forest 
fires that raged in and around the park last year according to a 
state report issued today 
although the parks tourist flow plummeted in august september 
and october as the infernos charred thousands of acres sales tax 
collections in park teton sublette and fremont counties showed an 
increase from a year earlier the report said 
on the premise that visitors were held rather captive in 
jackson cody and the surrounding area due to park closures and 
that thousands of firefighters were brought into the area the 
boosted sales tax figures are fairly understandable it said 
prepared by the department of administration and fiscal controls 
research and statistics division the report said the four counties 
sales tax collections jumped 494 percent in june july august and 
october from the year before 
statewide sales tax collections through the same period were up 
678 percent the report said 
the areas most affected were the retail and service related 
sectors the reports authors said in analyzing the collections 
in reviewing the following data for these particular sectors it 
appeared that the impact was generally of a positive nature 
instead of negative in terms of taxable sales 
the four counties realized a 494 percent increase in sales tax 
collections from 88 million during the period in 1987 to 92 
million last year 
with roughly half of the 22millionacre park blackened by the 
firestorms visitation to yellowstone in 1988 was off 172 percent 
as a result of the fires the report noted 
the number of visitors was down 50724 in july 1988 compared to 
july 1987 down 187695 in august 1988 compared to august 1987 and 
off 186129 in september 1988 compared to september 1987 
in october however tourists flooded the park as the fires died 
down while 125597 people visited yellowstone in october 1987 the 
total jumped 393 percent in october 1988 to 175019

fiercelooking professional wrestlers may 
grunt groan and pound bodies to the canvas amid the roars of 
frenzied fans but dont be fooled 
these big guys arent really hurting each other says the new 
jersey state senate senators on thursday passed a bill to remove 
professional wrestling from the strict safety regulations posed by 
the state athletic control board 
wrestling is an entertainment event which poses little serious 
risk to the participants said state sen francis j mcmanimon 
the bills sponsor the strict regulatory procedures needed to 
protect the health of boxers are not needed for professional 
wrestling 
mcmanimon said his bill would attract more wrestling events to 
new jersey because wrestlers would be free from the states tight 
safety regulations of boxers including requirements that a doctor 
and an ambulance be at the matches the bill now heads to the state 
assembly 
and those snarling behemoths who regularly tell tales of how they 
will terrorize their opponents arent objecting to reports that 
their body slams pose no serious health dangers 
officials from the world wrestling federation are seeking wider 
access to the potentially lucrative new jersey market which 
includes the atlantic city casinos 
the officials recently admitted in a legislative hearing that 
hulk hogan and other bigname wrestlers perform in a sport of 
entertainment in which participants are trained to avoid serious 
injury

three elementary schools disciplined 
specialeducation students by locking them inside wooden 
timeout boxes for up to 30 minutes a punishment one critic 
said has not been seen since the dark ages 
the state began an investigation into use of the boxes after a 
12yearold boy escaped from one last month the boxes have not been 
used since at washington elementary school principal lyle stine 
said 
the boxes measuring about 3 feet by 3 feet and 7 feet tall are 
used in extreme cases as a very last resort stine said they 
are used for pupils who have behavior disorders and need 
isolation 
the only reason we do this is when we feel its needed for the 
safety of the kids or the teachers he said 
i would prefer not having to use it but sometimes you have no 
choice stine said today adding that he would rather use a room 
instead but there is not one available 
the state board of education is reviewing the practice and is 
expected to issue a report by the end of next week the the peoria 
journal star said in a story published today 
we dont necessarily oppose timeout procedures when used 
appropriately said rene christensen the boards consultant for 
the severely and multiply handicapped we do not condone the use 
of boxes 
timeout is a common disciplinary method in which a special 
education child who misbehaves is separated from classmates 
but use of a box for discipline has not been seen since the 
dark ages said michelle hall bolden of the champaignbased 
protection and advocacy inc a watchdog group advocating the rights 
of the mentally ill and disabled that is considering lawsuits to 
fight the practice 
the box i saw is in a vacant room why not use just the vacant 
room she said 
children are kept up to 30 minutes in a box which is equipped 
with a lock ms bolden said adding that it seems cramped 
stine however said the box is not cramped 
you can easily get three people in there he said 
stine said use of the box is the culmination of a 10step 
assertive discipline process which includes a trip to the 
principals office 
three elementary schools at pontiac a central illinois town of 
11000 use the boxes because they have special education students

processing center is located and so its our responsibility to our 
citizens to see that that facility is operated in a proper manner 
card said 
its unsanitary its a nuisance and were not going to allow 
for it to be operated any further the mayor said after meeting 
with city commissioners in a closed session this morning 
the ins has been processing about 2000 primarily central 
american political asylum applicants weekly in this city 25 miles 
north of the border city of brownsville 
hundreds of central americans began piling up at the southern tip 
of texas after the ins on dec 16 began a policy of restricting 
asylum applicants to the ins harlingen district while their cases 
were being reviewed 
a us district judge filemon vela in brownsville on jan 9 
issued a temporary restraining order forcing the immigration service 
to once again allow asylum applicants to travel on to their us 
destinations to pursue their claims for refugee status 
but vela has said he probably will allow the ins to resume its 
travelrestricting policy on feb 20

the security council met today to debate 
israels methods of combating the palestinian uprising in the 
occupied lands the meeting came after a us report criticized the 
israeli crackdown 
the plo has tried since midjanuary to draft a resolution 
condemning the israeli armys use of rubber and plastic bullets and 
tear gas but has been unable to formulate language that the united 
states will not veto 
about a week ago the plo gave up and withdrew its resolution 
after us ambassador vernon a walters said he would veto any 
language that did not also call on the palestinians to restrain 
their protests 
more than 370 palestinians have been killed in protests since the 
uprising began in the occupied west bank and gaza strip in december 
1987 
fifteen jews also have died in clashes 
asked about the latest resolution riyad h mansour the plos 
deputy permanent un observer said the language was still being 
drafted but it condemns the israeli policies and practices 
we expect a resolution to be adopted that will allow the 
security council to really assume its responsibility to stop the 
israelis from the continuation of this onslaught against our 
people said mansour 
there will be reference to human rights violations especially 
as it is coming from the united states the closest friend to 
israel 
the palestinian liberation organization and the arab league 
renewed their efforts after the state department criticized the 
israeli army in a human rights report for tactics that caused many 
avoidable deaths and injuries

mikhail baryshnikov earned bravos as a bug 
from the north carolina critics in the broadwaybound stage version 
of franz kafkas metamorphosis now playing at duke university 
tony brown of the charlotte observer the states largest 
newspaper called the dancers stage acting debut powerful 
adding the surprise is that baryshnikov in his first acting 
role in which he does not play a dancer does so well in the 
speaking parts 
as for the play written and directed by steven berkoff brown 
predicted it would be a success on broadway drawing dance fans 
kafka nuts berkoff followers and the strictly curious and the 
shows sheer power will win over the critics 
in the raleigh news and observer harry hargrave described 
baryshnikov as simply amazing saying his performance was an 
exhausting and very physical tour de force in the 95minute play 
which is performed with no intermission 
jim wise of the durham morning herald said the 41yearold dance 
superstar does make an engaging bug a sympathetic one even more 
importantly a metaphorical one which engages a viewers 
fellowfeeling and renders metamorphosis surreal as it is a 
moving expression of human feeling 
but wise thought the stage adaptation was not overwhelming 
theater despite the shows frequent humor and rapid 
intermissionless pace the tedium that is part of its theme 
eventually catches up with the showmanship even so however the 
storys essential humanity shines through 
abe d jones jr of the greensboro news amp record said baryshnikov 
seems perfect for the role of gregor samsa a young man who 
wakes up one day and finds he has started to turn into an insect 
not that the production needed favorable reviews to do good 
business at the 640seat reynolds industries theater at duke the 
run which ends feb 25 has been sold out for weeks 
metamorphosis opens on broadway on march 6 at the ethel 
barrymore theater

a fisherman from maine who knew a 
bargain when he saw one ended up getting a fishing boat valued at 
55000 for just 10 in a government auction 
the government lost 3000 to 4000 in storage advertising 
maintenance and towing costs on the deal said us marshal donald 
w wyatt 
one mans loss is another mans gain said the buyer mark 
lewis of brunswick maine who once was a member of the crew of the 
boat 
the auction thursday of the 65foot sandra and cindy which was 
seized by the government after it was used to smuggle hashish was 
expected to draw more interest but lewis was the only bidder said 
wyatt 
we didnt expect to get a good price for it it was built in 
1945 and had been laid up here since last june but we expected to 
get several thousand dollars wyatt said he got himself a 
bargain 
although the vessel was appraised at 55000 it may have been 
overvalued and will require several thousand dollars worth of 
repairs he added 
lewis was a member of the boats crew in the early 1970s long 
before it became involved in the 30 million smuggling scheme the 
boat was used to carry at least 8 tons of hashish from a freighter 
offshore to the harbor at point judith wyatt said 
last month two people were convicted in federal court in 
providence on charges stemming from the drug smuggling they face 
sentencing march 30

the antiracism statement issued by the vatican 
on friday was hailed by us roman catholic officials as a the 
churchs most comprehensive repudiation yet of prejudice in its many 
forms 
jewish leaders also praised the document for its extensive 
condemnation of antisemitism often in the name of antizionism 
the document was seen as likely to increase awareness of the 
problem and spur efforts to eradicate it 
auxiliary bishop john ricard of baltimore chairman of the 
bishops committee for black roman catholics called the document 
a milestone and added 
it is the first time in my memory that the holy see has 
explictly singled out the issue and dealt with it in such breadth 
and depth as a primary factor in human evil 
he said racism is pinpointed as a multiple problem because of 
the tendency to treat various groups as inferior whether because of 
skin color ethnicity nationality religion or economic status 
i think the document should be extremely helpful to us and to 
our brothers and sisters of south africa who are under institutional 
racism he said 
john carr socialdevelopment secretary for the us catholic 
conference in washington noted that the document strongly condemns 
the south african system of apartheid or enforced racial 
separation this is particularly important at this time he said 
he said the document points up the connections between 
various forms of racism linking prejudices againt blacks the poor 
immigrants jews hispanics foreigners and others as assaults on 
human dignity 
this is the first time for a statement of this magnitude he 
said 
eugene fisher director of the catholic bishops office for 
catholicjewish relations said the document was the first 
official church statement to link antizionism with antisemitism 
which is strongly condemned 
this should be helpful he said observing that 
antizionism often is used as a cover for antijewishness in 
the united nations arab representatives often assail zionism 
or jewish commitment to their biblical homeland claiming such a 
stance is not antisemitic 
rabbi james rudin interreligious affairs director of the 
american jewish committee said the document is a clear and 
powerful repudiation of all forms of racism and bigotry 
it represents another effective weapon in the global struggle 
to eradicate these cancerous mythologies from the human family he 
said he particurlarly applauded the statement that antizionism is 
used as a screen for antisemistism 
fisher said the document seems to attempt a theory of racism in 
all its manifestations as one of the fundamental evils of our 
times 
its the first document that attempts this kind of depth 
analysis putting racism into its larger context he said the 
phenmomenon of prejudice and animosities in the world have the same 
dynamics 
hatred is hatred he said whether directed at blacks 
immigrants the poor foreigners or other groups treated as 
inferiors because of external factors 
he said the document should help expand the horizons of 
americans by its dynamics i would like to see it become a 
centerpiece of educational efforts in communities across the 
country 
ronaldo cruz associate director of the bishops office for 
hispanic affairs said the document offers a broader perspective 
on racism including all sorts of victims even the handicapped 
it puts things into perspective as an educational tool he 
said he said it is important in clarifying the connectedness 
of differing kinds of prejudices

president bush is asking congress to vote a tax 
cut for the nations wealthiest people and a new tax benefit for 
some of americas poorest families 
the tax portions of his budget plan also include canceling a 
scheduled reduction in taxes on airline tickets and cargo making 
permanent the 3 percent tax on telephone service raising social 
security taxes on 2 million state and local government workers and 
cutting taxes on corporations in general and the oil industry in 
particular 
in a message to congress thursday night the new president showed 
no qualms about tinkering with the landmark 1986 tax overhaul even 
though some congressional leaders suggest any significant change 
could lead to a complete unraveling 
he is likely to gain wide support for some version of a new 
daycare tax credit that he recommended to help 25 million poorer 
working families a family with at least one worker and with income 
under 13000 could get a tax cut of up to 1000 a year for each 
child under age 4 the credit could even exceed the familys tax 
liability 
on the other hand bush is assured a fight over his plan to tax 
capital gains profits from the sale of stock real estate and 
other assets at a lower rate than applies to wages and other 
income the change is necessary he said to maintain american 
leadership in the world 
lower capitalgains rates will stimulate investment and 
economic growth and create additional jobs for americans bush 
said in a written message 
several hours earlier the senior taxwriter in congress rep 
dan rostenkowski dill had anticipated the proposal and wasted 
neither time nor verbiage in showing his distaste 
i personally will strongly resist any effort to undo the 1986 
tax reform including the return to a preferential tax rate for 
capital gains rostenkowski said im not about to tell the wage 
earners in chicago that they should pay a higher tax than 
stockbrokers 
rostenkowski chairman of the house ways and means committee 
contends restoring the capitalgains break would open the door to 
reenacting other deductions and exemptions that were eliminated or 
reduced in order to pay for acrosstheboard cuts in overall tax 
rates 
many democrats also have problems because the lions share of 
capital gains are enjoyed by the nations richest taxpayers 
more than 34 percent of the 135 billion in taxable gains that 
were reported on returns filed in 1987 were recorded by 34818 
taxpayers whose incomes exceeded 1 million apiece the internal 
revenue service says their gains averaged 13 million 
seventy percent of the overall gain went to 115 million people 
with incomes over 100000 each 
bush said the cut would generate such investment activity that it 
would bring the government more not less revenue over the next 
five years he said it would increase tax collections by 16 
billion although it would cost the treasury 20 billion during the 
following three years many economists ridicule the nocost theory 
capital gains and wages now are taxed the same at rates of 15 
percent 28 percent and 33 percent bush wants a new system that 
when fully effective would tax most gains at a top rate of 15 
percent if assets were owned more than 36 months people with lower 
incomes would pay as low as 825 percent paintings and other 
collectibles would not qualify 
couples with adjusted gross incomes under 20000 and single 
people under 10000 would pay no tax on any qualified capital gain 
the president apparently dumped a suggestion advanced last month 
by thenpresident reagan which would have required the irs to 
charge taxpayers for telephone calls with questions about how to 
file their tax returns 
bush did ask congress to

make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and longdistance 
telephone service which otherwise would expire dec 31 1990 this 
would cost taxpayers 6 billion in the following three years 
require 2 million state and local government workers hired 
before april 1 1986 to pay a tax for medicare which many already 
qualify for because of a prior nongovernment job or a working 
spouse the tax collected as part of the social security levy is 
145 percent of the first 48000 of annual earnings 
retain the full federal taxes on airline tickets air cargo and 
aviation fuel which are due to drop by half next year 
permit a deduction of up to 3000 for expenses of adopting a 
child with special needs such as a physical handicap 
give the oil and gas industry tax credits for the first 10 
million of expenditures each year on such intangible oildrilling 
expenses as labor and pipe and for spending required to use 
sophisticated tertiary techniques to produce oil rules that 
hinder the sale of proven oil properties to independent producers 
would be repealed independent producers would be allowed to deduct 
from the minimum tax 80 percent of certain exploratory intangible 
drilling costs 
make permanent a 20 percent credit for increased corporate 
spending for research and permit international corporations to 
deduct 67 percent of total research spending against domestic income 
give businesses 1 billion worth of tax incentives over four 
years for locating in economically distressed areas

ronald h brown telling democrats you have 
made history was elected chairman of his party friday becoming 
the first black to head a major political party he immediately 
urged americans to set labels aside 
my chairmanship will not be about race it will be about the 
races we win over the next four years he told cheering members of 
the democratic national committee 
the former aide to sen edward m kennedy and adviser to jesse 
jackson outdistanced four opponents in recent weeks and was 
unopposed friday as he won election to a fouryear term at the helm 
of a party that is struggling to reverse a string of defeats in 
presidential elections 
i couldnt be prouder said outgoing chairman paul g kirk 
jr as he handed the gavel to brown 
democratic party officials who had openly feared that browns 
bid for the chairmanship would split the party along racial lines 
stood and cheered 
hes his own man said florida democratic chairman charles 
whitehead who nominated brown for chairman 
when the campaign to succeed kirk began whitehead and most other 
southern party leaders were looking for an alternative to brown 
there also was opposition among some jewish democrats concerned 
about his involvement with jackson 
six leaders of major jewish organizations circulated a letter 
they sent to brown welcoming your election and saying we are 
confident that you bring to this critical post the same commitment 
and effectiveness in achieving unity that you demonstrated during 
the recent campaign 
there is no need to dwell on but we cannot ignore the history 
of this moment brown said after his election 
in choosing the first american of african descent to lead one 
of americas major political parties you have made history 
then in a wry reference to the early opposition to his 
candidacy brown said i know some people are wondering just what 
kind of history weve made 
let me speak frankly he went on i did not run on the basis 
of race but i will not run away from it i am proud of who i am and 
i am proud of this party for we are truly americas last best hope 
to bridge the divisions of race and region and religion and 
ethnicity 
he recalled john f kennedys need to overcome opposition to 
electing a catholic as president and said i ask america to do as 
you have done i ask america to set labels aside and i know 
america will do so 
as the nation approaches the 1990 census which will require a 
redrawing of congressional and state legislative district lines to 
reflect population shifts brown said the goal was to win 600 more 
legislative seats for the democrats 
state legislatures have a key role in drawing the new district 
lines and both major parties are devoting resources to legislative 
elections between now and 1991 
but said brown the political contest over the next four years 
will not be one about tactics but one about values given that 
matchup i have nothing but confidence about the future 
democrats are painfully aware they have lost five of the last six 
presidential elections four of them by landslide margins 
we need to chart a roadmap to the presidency said brown a 
roadmap that includes the south and the west 
we need to say flat out there is no one tougher than democrats 
when it comes to protecting our children from drugs when it comes 
to protecting our cities against crime and when it comes to 
protecting our nation against terrorism and aggression said the 
new chairman 
the democratic national committee also elected robert farmer as 
party treasurer 
jack otero a vice president of the transportationcommunications 
international union was elected a vice chairman with responsibility 
for voter registration 
other vice chairs elected were lynn cutler of the district of 
columbia carmen o perez of california and mayor lottie shackelford

foreign minister moshe arens has expressed 
support for a soviet role in middle east peace talks but said israel 
is not prepared to consider trading occupied territory for peace 
arens has opposed soviet participation in negotiations along with 
other permanent members of the united nations security council 
in an interview with the daily jerusalem post however he said 
he now believes moscow could play a useful role 
i would say in principle any country might contribute to the 
peace process if it has good will if its truly interested in the 
stability of the area and if in addition it has something to 
contribute he said in the interview published in the newspapers 
friday editions 
i think the soviet union falls in that category my 
impression is that they want to contribute in that area and since 
they have influence with some countries in the area i would say in 
principle yes to soviet participation arens said 
arens also said he would not support a peace initiative that 
included relinquishing any of the occupied west bank or gaza strip 
and that he opposed removing jewish settlers from the lands 
just what part of the territories israel would retreat from 
and just where the secure boundaries for israel are thats a 
subject for interpretation arens said it bears directly on a 
permanent settlement and is not something that is usefully discussed 
at the present time 
the palestine liberation organization has called for resolving 
the arabisrael problem through an international peace conference 
sponsored by the five permanent members of the un security 
council the united states the soviet union britain france and 
china 
although accepting some role for moscow arens repeated his 
opposition to an international conference 
he also said he was encouraged by progress toward resuming 
diplomatic ties with moscow 
the soviets halted diplomatic relations after the 1967 middle 
east war in which israel seized the west bank gaza strip and golan 
heights from the soviet unions arab allies 
israel has made normalization of ties a condition for soviet 
participation in peace negotiations

a man accused of killing 14 members of 
his family punched a prosecutor today in front of the jury and a 
crowded courtroom hearing his murder trial 
r gene simmons 48 and lawyers in the case were in conference 
at the bench of johnson county circuit court judge john patterson 
when simmons struck out with his right fist and hit prosecutor john 
bynum on the chin 
as simmons struggled and bynum regained his balance law 
enforcement officers swarmed simmons subdued him and hustled him 
out of the courtroom 
some spectators shrieked and several relatives of the people 
simmons is accused of killing ducked to the floor and huddled over 
each other 
im all right bynum said he just got me one time im all 
right 
bynum said the conference was about how much more time would be 
needed to complete the trial which began monday 
the scuffle took place in full view of the jury 
a few minutes later patterson had the jury brought back to the 
court and announced that the trial would take a recess for lunch 
i want you to set aside what happened in the courtroom just 
now patterson said this trial has gone on five days we want 
to finish it if we can you need to disregard the incident that 
happened here today 
defense lawyers said they were shocked by the attack and said 
they were considering seeking a mistrial 
earlier today firearms expert burwin monroe of the state crime 
lab in little rock testified that a gun handed to authorities by 
simmons was one that fired the bullets that killed several victims 
monroe cited tests that showed a 22caliber revolver which 
simmons had when he surrendered after a 40minute shooting rampage 
in russellville on dec 28 1987 fired the shots that killed his 
wife eldest son and others whose bodies were found that day in 
simmons house or the next day in a nearby grave 
on thursday defense and state attorneys blamed each other for 
leaking a statement to the press in which simmons said he would see 
his eldest daughter in hell 
simmons made the remark about sheila marie mcnulty 24 in a 
written statement found in his safedeposit box in a bank in 
russellville 
simmons also apparently refers to mrs mcnultys husband dennis 
mcnulty 33 in the note 
you have destroyed me simmons wrote i do not want d to 
set foot on my property he turned you against me you want me out 
of your life i will be out of your life i will see you in hell 
a threepage transcript of simmons fivepage handwritten 
statement was published in thursday editions of the arkansas 
democrat a little rock newspaper 
the bodies of the mcnultys and 12 other members of simmons 
family were found at his home on dec 28 and dec 29 1987 
following simmons arrest for a shooting rampage in russellville 
that left two people dead simmons was sentenced to death for the 
two russellville killings last year and has tried to waive appeals 
of his death sentence saying he wants to die 
patterson said he was disappointed at the disclosure of the 
statement which appears to be notes simmons made to himself 
possibly to prepare for a telephone conversation with his daughter 
i think evidence ought to come out in the trial not in the 
newspapers patterson said

ivan havel expressed optimisim the prosecutor wont indict his 
brother who was arrested with eight other dissidents jan 16 on 
pragues wenceslas square during a peaceful rally 
palach press a londonbased newsletter monitoring events in 
czechoslovakia said the fact that havel was not released indicates 
authorities are planning to put him on trial despite a mounting 
campaign at home and abroad calling for his freedom 
palach press also noted that havel continues to be under arrest 
although all three possible reasons for officially justifying 
continued detention no longer exist these include being a 
particular danger to society influencing witnesses while at large 
and the danger of repeating the offense 
havel was arrested for taking part in a peaceful demonstration to 
mark the death in 1969 of jan palach who burned himself alive to 
protest the 1968 sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia and for 
allegedly calling for such a rally in a foreign radio broadcast

his lawyer josef lzicar according to ivan havel who spoke in a 
telephone interview with the associated press 
while a previous charge was for hooliganism havel is now charged 
with violating the law in dealing with instigation of other persons 
to commit a crime an offense punishable by up to two years in 
prison 
the playwright whose works have long been banned in 
czechoslovakia is also charged with obstruction of the exercise of 
the authority of a public official punishable by up to six months 
in prison 
the material against havel now goes to a prosecutor who must 
decide whether it warrants indictment if it does he must daw up the 
indictment and inform the accused and his lawyer of the trial date a 
week in advance palach press said 
the other six detained jan 16 were released on jan 25 but 
they too face indictment still in detention are jana petrova of

a pioneering hypodermic needle exchange to 
fight aids has won final approval from the county health board 
despite lastminute opposition from some business owners 
the program to give addicts free needles when they turn in used 
ones was started on a private basis in august by former drug 
counselor dave purchase final approval of a government role in the 
effort came thursday when the the tacomapierce county health board 
approved 43000 to provide purchase with a van needles and a 
salary 
it is believed to be the nations first fullscale 
governmentsponsored effort to stop the spread of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome by offering drug users clean needles a similar 
program began in new york on an experimental basis in november but 
has attracted only a handful of the citys estimated 250000 addicts 
tacoma a city of 160000 has an estimated 3000 intravenous 
drug abusers 
it might be a risk it might save a life thats what i want to 
find out said pierce county executive joe stortini one of those 
who voted for the program 
city council member greg mykland who cast the lone no vote said 
the program sent a bad message and urged that the money be spent on 
drug treatment instead 
i do believe were condoning the use of drugs by giving out 
needles mykland said 
he also was joined by downtown business operators and others in 
questioning the effectiveness of the program 
they will feed their habit when they need to or when they can 
with the nearest needle available clean or dirty as they always 
have said jim mcdaniel assistant director of the tacoma rescue 
mission 
supporters like judy giles of the martin luther king center 
however said the issue was saving lives

attorneys for the white house state department 
and the office of government ethics are studying investments held by 
secretary of state james a baker iii to determine if any should be 
sold to avoid a possible conflict of interest administration 
spokesmen said today 
state department spokesman charles e redman denied a washington 
post report that white house counsel c boyden gray has pressed 
baker to sell off stock in chemical new york corp a bank holding 
company that has 45 billion in loans to third world nations 
redman also denied that there was some sort of resistance on 
bakers part to his investments being scrutinized 
the statement came amid questions whether the holdings might pose 
a potential conflict as the new secretary of state deals with the 
third world debt crisis 
at this point they havent reached a decision on disposing of 
the investments white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told 
reporters aboard air force one as president bush flew to ottawa 
canada 
gray bushs top adviser on ethics has been arguing that baker 
should sell the stock in chemical new york corp to avoid the 
appearance of conflict of interest the post quoted unnamed sources 
as saying 
at the state department redman said baker both as white house 
chief of staff and treasury secretary had removed himself from 
policy issues that might have specifically affected his holdings 
and had done so with the approval of the office of government ethics 
however redman added a new review of bakers holdings was 
underway because of a 1987 justice department interpretation of the 
ethics rules which requires officials to be more conservative in 
participating in broad policy discussions than previously believed 
necessary by government ethics attorneys 
redman said the secretary was seeking the advice as to whether 
additional steps such as a waiver under the statute or sale of 
assets might be advisable 
baker will take appropriate action after getting such advice 
redman said 
bakers latest disclosure form filed with office of government 
ethics lists some 5310 shares of various types of stock held in the 
chemical new york corp 
it is listed on a form under assests of a dependent child the 
bakers have a teenage daughter mary bonner baker 
on the form some types of chemical stock are listed as having 
values ranging from 1000 to 5000 while others are listed as 
being valued at 5000 to 15000 according to the list the stocks 
in total would be worth more than 12004 but less than 40000 
the stocks dividends were reported to have ranged from 3104 to 
8500 in 1988 
the form filed last month covers only january through august of 
1988 since baker left the government to head bushs presidential 
campaign 
the post said the secretary of state wants to hold his bank 
stocks arguing he can continue the practice he observed as treasury 
secretary for the last four years 
under that practice baker would remove himself from matters 
particularly associated with chemical and seek a presidential 
waiver of normal conflictofinterest regulations to allow him to 
participate in broader matters that might affect the bank 
the post quoted officials involved in the dispute as saying 
grays position that the stocks be sold is bolstered by a justice 
department ruling last year 
that decision said top administration officials whose personal 
holdings would inevitably and predictably benefit from policies they 
help establish cannot simply recuse themselves from involvement in 
those policies instead the department ruled they must sell the 
stock in question or get a formal waiver from a superior which in 
bakers case would be the president 
before last year officials such as baker could participate in 
developing general policy even though they had personal holdings 
that might be affected by the policy the report stated 
when baker first joined former president reagans white house as 
chief of staff in 1981 he put his bank stock and other holdings in 
a qualified blind trust an arrangement that left the assets in 
the hands of a trustee however under the arrangement baker was 
informed annually of his holdings and knew throughout that he still 
owned the bank shares 
originally they were shares in texas commerce bancshares a 
banking company that grew out of a bank organized by bakers 
grandfather the post said in may 1987 texas commerce was merged 
with a subsidiary of chemical and baker became a large holder of 
the new york bank companys stock it said

the government friday began work on 
political reforms with two of its longest and bitterest foes men 
it considered too extreme to take part when the broadranging talks 
were proposed six months ago 
solidarity leader lech walesa meanwhile was on the road 
promoting agreement with the government to skeptical followers in 
southern poland 
several small labor disputes broke out led by members of the 
governmentsupported trade union alliance and opposed by the 
unsanctioned but increasingly tolerated solidarity movement 
adam michnik and jacek kuron opposition philosophers and 
essayists who have been active in antigovernment organizing since 
1968 were prominent among the 36 people at the council of ministers 
palace to discuss political reforms 
michnik and kuron were founding members of the committee for 
defense of workers in 1976 michniks collected essays letters 
from prison have provided much of the philosophical underpinning 
for the opposition movement 
i am totally surprised that the talks did occur kuron said 
later they open great possibilities 
kuron said he spoke about the problems of minority groups in 
poland such as ukranians lithuanians and byelorussians while 
michnik said he concentrated on changes occurring in other communist 
nations and their meaning for poland 
last year the government vehemently opposed including kuron and 
michnik in the proposed talks calling them too extreme but the 
objections have been dropped in the wake of a communist party 
decision last month to seek common ground with the opposition 
the talks known as the round table began with a plenary 
session monday working groups have been meeting all week on 
specific topics the full negotiations are expected to last up to 
six weeks 
solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said the union seeks a 
country that belongs to the whole nation and is not dominated by one 
party 
at the meeting he said solidarity proposed the following steps 
legalizing solidarity 
removing political controls on the courts 
adopting a law to enable various groups to form including 
independent student organizations and groups representing national 
minorities and 
making municipal governments democratically elected 
the government said the first step should be constructing a new 
parliament with representatives from the opposition said politburo 
member janusz reykowski 
authorities have insisted that in exchange for legalizing 
solidarity the union agree to a package of political and economic 
reforms help draft a law on elections and take part in parliament 
and other aspects of official life the opposition has been hesitant 
to endorse a political system that guarantees communist domination 
and is wary of being coopted 
solidaritys leader at the talks historian bronislaw geremek 
said the session was difficult today was a show of differences 
there is no mutual trust there is a lack of or even crisis of 
trust on both sides he said 
in krakow walesa addressed 2000 people at jagiellonian 
university to sell his vision of seeking a compromise with 
authorities walesa invoked a slogan that rhymes in polish 
agreement builds disagreement ruins 
if you take the path of peaceful evolution it will be a 
revolution he said let us give the round table a chance let 
us not provoke because then we will all have to pay 
walesa also met with krakow cardinal franciszek macharski and 
went to the city of bielskobiala site of polands smallcar 
factory and addressed about 500 workers 
walesa has been urging workers not to strike during the talks 
with the government but followers of the official trade unions 
staged several actions around the country friday 
an opzz strike over wages crippled bus service in piotrkow 
trybunalski a central provincial capital of 80000 people opzz 
officials in warsaw said it was a local grievance and they had no 
immediate details 
opzz unionists at a steel plant in ostrowiec swietokrzyski near 
kielce in southern poland also went on strike seeking wage 
increases of about 59 a month official media reported 
solidarity spokesman robert bogdanski said solidarity activists 
distance themselves from the strike 
the opzz faced with the threat of legal competition from 
solidarity has grown increasingly militant in an apparent bid to 
demonstrate its independence 
representatives have tried to argue that the opzz can do a better 
job than solidarity of protecting workers interests because it does 
not have to appear moderate to authorities in order to get legalized

the justice department today sought for a third 
time to delay oliver norths irancontra trial contending that 
defense lawyers will hurt national security by spilling state 
secrets onto the public record 
the department asked a threemember panel of the us court of 
appeals to reconsider its refusal to delay the trial while it 
studies the presiding judges refusal to implement procedures the 
government argues are needed to prevent surprise disclosures of 
classified information 
if the trial were allowed to start next week under the ground 
rules set by us district judge gerhard a gesell the department 
said highly sensitive items of classified information will be 
revealed by the defense in its opening statement causing 
irreperable damage to both the national security and foreign affairs 
interests of the united states 
the justice department at the request of intelligence agencies 
including the national security agency wants more stringent 
controls on norths plans to introduce classified material in the 
case 
in a court filing wednesday the department criticized gesell 
saying he had adopted procedures that fail to identify what 
portions of the classified material north wants to present are 
relevant and whether they are admissible 
gesell finished selecting a jury thursday and rejected the 
departments censorship bid calling it wholly misplaced he 
told the jurors to report back monday morning 
gesell said the department has no standing to interfere in the 
trial at this point because independent counsel lawrence walsh is 
handling the prosecution of north walsh wants to proceed with the 
trial immediately and opposes the departments effort to halt the 
case 
a few hours later the appeals court upheld gesells decision 
loye miller a justice department spokesman said the appeals 
judges on thursday had before them a lot more material from 
walsh than they had from us 
assistant attorney general edward sg dennis head of the 
departments criminal division claimed that the risk to national 
security would be significant under the rules laid down by gesell 
he said the government would lack control over disclosure of very 
sensitive classified information 
gesell issued a ruling jan 19 permitting north to introduce 
classified material if it tends to show that norths purpose was not 
to violate the law or that government witnesses are lying 
he also said north may use classified information where 
relevant about the reagan administrations efforts to have other 
countries aid the nicaraguan contra rebels after congress had banned 
us military aid to them 
the justice department is seeking a court order saying that north 
may disclose no classified information to which the us government 
has any pending objection 
north is charged with concealing from congress and the attorney 
general the administrations secret support for the contras during 
the period in which direct us aid was banned 
he also is accused of illegally accepting installation of a 
security system at his home converting to his own use at least 
4300 in travelers checks from a contra leader and conspiring to 
use a taxexempt foundation illegally to raise money for the rebels

new york states high court today denied an 
appeal by antiabortion activists seeking to prevent a long island 
man from having an abortion performed on his comatose wife 
even before todays decision by the new york court of appeals a 
lawyer for the activists had said he would turn to the federal 
courts if the state court rejected the appeal 
the seven judges of the court of appeals without comment 
refused to hear the appeal of a lower courts ruling that appointed 
martin klein as guardian of his 32yearold pregnant wife nancy 
klein has said he wants the abortion in the hopes that it will 
save the life of his wife the antiabortion activists have sought 
to be appointed guardians themselves of mrs klein saying her 
emotional health is at stake 
im begging the american people to please help us martin 
klein said thursday after he was rebuffed a second time in his 
battle to be appointed the guardian of his wife 
were torn up he said these strangers have come off the 
street and are intruding in our lives we dont know what to do 
about it 
late thursday a state appeals court upheld a lower court ruling 
that made klein an accountant from upper brookville his wifes 
guardian but two members of the antiabortion group immediately 
appealed to the states highest court which placed a stay on the 
decision 
its just something you cant set aside said john short 
founder of the long island righttolife group our concern is of 
the psychological and emotional state of nancy klein if she wakes 
up 
under our plan we say the babys down at the neonatal clinic 
getting the best care possible under their plan theyve got to 
tell her theyve killed her baby emotionally that would kill her 
in its ruling the fivemember appeals court panel had dismissed 
requests by short and john broderick to be appointed guardians of 
mrs klein and her fetus 
the panel found that ultimately the record confirms that these 
absolute strangers to the klein family whatever their motivation 
have no place in the midst of this family tragedy 
but at about 830 pm 30 minutes after the appeals court 
ruling short and broderick obtained the temporary stay from the 
court of appeals in albany new york states highest court no 
hearing was immediately scheduled 
mrs klein who is approximately 17 weeks pregnant has been in a 
coma at north shore university hospital in manhasset on long island 
since a dec 13 car accident 
she is severely braindamaged and given a slight chance at 
recovery klein sought an abortion for his wife after he said some 
physicians advised him that an abortion may enhance her recovery and 
could save her life 
all we want to do is save nancys life he said thursday 
night time is precious any delay in terminating the pregnancy is 
only increasing the risks to nancy these peoples actions 
constitute severe harassment and interference with nancys rights 
and my wishes and nancys parents wishes 
the appellate court that ruled in kleins favor found that the 
case law in this state firmly establishes that strangers will not be 
appointed legal guardians of the incompetent unless it is impossible 
to find within the family circle one who is qualified to serve 
the decision further stated that the antiabortion activists have 
not made a sufficient showing of an adverse interest between mr 
klein and his comatose wife 
klein was awarded guardianship on tuesday from judge bernard 
mccaffrey but short and broderick won a stay of the ruling pending 
the appeals court decision 
in his decision mccaffrey said that the issue in the case was 
not what moral or medical determination klein should exercise if 
appointed guardian but nancy kleins constitutional right to an 
abortion

police said friday they were 
investigating a report that someone had found the body of a boy 
allegedly abducted by teenagers who have acted as bodyguards for 
winnie mandela 
an antiapartheid leader who heads south africas methodist 
church joined a growing number of blacks who have denounced the 
teenagers as lawless and accused them of kidnapping and beating 
other youngsters 
the fate of the missing 14yearold stompie sepei has been at 
the center of the controversy surrounding mrs mandela wife of 
jailed african national congress leader nelson mandela 
the weekly mail a prominent antiapartheid newspaper quoted an 
unidentified soweto activist as saying the boys body was dug up 
thursday in soweto no additional details were given 
police headquarters said friday it had not confirmed the report 
the youths associated with mrs mandela call themselves the 
mandela united soccer team they have served as her bodyguards and 
some live at her home in soweto the huge black township outside 
johannesburg 
the rev stanley mogoba national president of the methodist 
church friday said mandela united members had abducted four youths 
who were living at a local methodist church one of the four 
stompie has been missing since jan 1 
the other youths mogoba said were severely assaulted and held 
in defiance of the unanimous will of community leadership in 
soweto 
he said they were held from dec 29 to jan 16 
bishop peter storey regional leader of the methodist church 
said if stompies body had been found the worst fears of the 
church and community have been realized 
some of mrs mandelas supporters have contended that the four 
youths were taken from the church to the mandela home because they 
had been sexually molested by a white minister the rev paul 
verryn methodist officials say they investigated the claim and 
found it was false 
mogoba once imprisoned for his antiapartheid activities said 
church leaders noted with anger and concern the vigilante 
actions of mandela united 
the allegations against verryn were a a transparent attempt to 
divert the attention of both church and community away from the 
ruthless actions of the football team and the disappearence and 
possible death of stompie he said 
mogoba said the situation resulted from a vacuum in leadership 
in the townships through the detention of authentic leaders under 
the state of emergency imposed in june 1986 in response to 
growing unrest over apartheid the system of racial separation that 
discriminates against blacks 
an estimated 30000 people including many leading activists 
have been detained without charges during the state of emergency 
about 150 soweto community leaders met last month to investigate 
abductions allegedly carried out by the youth group and the anc 
later asked mrs mandela to disband mandela united 
black leaders say the group hurts the campaign to end white 
minority rule in south africa 
several newspapers have reported that continuing allegations that 
the teenagers engaged in unlawful behavior have become a source of 
friction between mrs mandela and her husband south africas 
bestknown black leader 
she says she has disbanded the group 
law and order minister adriaan vlok said thursday that police 
were investigating the alleged abductions stompies disappearance 
and the charges of sexual abuse 
mrs mandela widely regarded abroad as an antiapartheid 
heroine has been entangled in several controversies in recent years 
she was criticized for authorizing construction of a palatial 
soweto home she never moved into and for endorsing necklacings 
in which burning tires were used to execute suspected collaborators 
last year high school students angered by actions of mandela 
united members set her home afire

a 1582page paperback bible with the skyline of 
manhattan on an orange cover is going on sale in britain aimed at 
people who may not know what its all about 
discover the worlds greatest book says a headline above the 
main title the bible 
we used a color photo of manhattan as a symbol for a book that 
is both contemporary and timeless said julia young religious 
books publicist at publishers hodder and stoughton 
the wording markets the bible on its own merits without 
appealing to the readers religious commitment mrs young said 
inside the text runs right across the page instead of in the 
usual double column found in bibles 
this makes for ease of reading and shows the many poetic 
passages to best advantage the publishers say 
theres a 42page introduction to the old and new testaments and 
a reading plan for getting through the 810000 words in one year 
from genesis to revelations 
also included is a history of israel an account of the jewish 
religion and a few lines about each of the 66 books of the bible 
a page headed wellknown events in the bible starts with the 
creation runs through plagues on egypt daniel in the lions den 
and ends with pauls shipwreck 
the greatest story ever told is now being marketed as just 
that a sort of gigantic thriller reported londons evening 
standard newspaper theyve even dropped the holy from the title 
to leave it short and punchy in 2inch embossed silver letters 
we dont mind them saying that because we want to attract the 
general reader rather than the christian community who know the 
bible mrs young said 
the publishers have ordered a first print run of 100000 copies 
said dick douglas editorial manager of the companys bible division 
the book retails for about 860 and will be sold at train 
stations and airports as well as major bookstores 
asked if he thought sales would go over 100000 douglas said 
oh good heavens yes i should jolly well hope so 
the publishers hired frontrank advertising agents saatchi and 
saatchi to take care of the national press campaign and posters 
showing the book compared to moses tablets of stone and the slogan 
easier to digest than tablets 
martin lee who buys religious books for the wh smith chain of 
410 bookstores and newsstands said we think its a great step 
forward in bible publishing to make it more accessible to everyday 
man it really does look like a mass market novel 
the text of the paperback is the anglicized new international 
version a complete edition of the bible produced in the united 
states in 1978 by the international bible society and first 
published in britain in 1979 
it is now the worlds bestselling bible in modern english and 
the outright bestseller in many countries mrs young said 
its bang up to date but it has a kind of literary quality 
which sets it apart it preserves echoes from the king james 
version which is so central to english culture she said

in the near future said hines whose previous films include white 
knights with mikhail baryshnikov and running scared with billy 
crystal 
its good to start a career now hines told the students 
in 10 years youll have some craft behind you if you want it 
you have to be aggressive and make it happen for yourself 
hines also offered the students a warning if you want to follow 
in his footsteps as a performer be ready to make some sacrifices 
and hard choices along the way 
i think its a risk anytime someone wants to be an artist in 
our culture said hines to be an artist here is to be outside

the vatican said friday racism is a wound 
in humanitys side citing apartheid in south africa 
antisemitism and the treatment of peasants and native peoples as 
slaves 
apartheid received the harshest criticism in a major document 
the vatican said it was the most marked and systematic form of 
racism and economic sanctions against south africa could be 
justified 
the document the church and racism towards a more fraternal 
society stressed however that one country should not be singled 
out because it would be hypocritical to point a finger at only one 
country rejection based on race exists on every continent 
it also criticized discrimination against religious minorities in 
countries governed by islamic law and warned of apprentice 
sorcerers exploiting modern science in an effort to produce human 
beings selected by race 
although the united states is one of the worlds most interracial 
societies it said much still needs to be done to eliminate 
prejudice there 
pope john paul ii had the vaticans justice and peace commission 
prepare the document to help enlighten and awaken consciences 
naming countries in the document was a departure from usual practice 
the commission said it was not trying to gloss over the 
weaknesses and even at times the complicity of the roman 
catholic church in racism throughout history and declared that the 
church wants first and foremost to change racist attitudes 
including those within her own communities 
racism is a sin that blasphemes god it said and the church 
encourages legislation administrative measures and even 
appropriate external pressure against it 
it can be eliminated only by going to its roots where it is 
formed in the human heart the commission wrote racism still 
exists and continually reappears in different forms it is a 
wound in humanitys side that mysteriously remains open 
south africas apartheid policy of discrimination is 
institutional racism the document said it is justified by an 
ideology of the superiority of persons from european stock over 
those of african or indian origin or colored which is by some 
supported by an erroneous interpretation of the bible 
today apartheid is the most marked and systematic form of 
racism and change is absolutely necessary and urgent 
although some steps toward change have been taken in recent 
years the black majority remains excluded from effective 
representation in national government and enjoys citizenship in word 
only it continued 
cardinal roger etchegaray of france head of the commisssion that 
prepared the document said it reflects his observations during a 
twoweek tour of south africa last year 
at a news conference he described apartheid as monstrous and 
added that while south africa had made some reforms since 1978 
apartheid maintains untouched in its foundations 
he cited laws that register people by race at birth establish 
separate living areas for different races and reserve most of the 
land for whites 
etchegaray said the vatican supports the south african bishops 
who have said economic sanctions can be morally justified but 
should be applied only on condition they do not destroy the 
countrys economy and cause further suffering 
the document called antisemitism the most tragic form that 
racist ideology has assumed in our century referring to the nazi 
extermination of 6 million jews 
certain organizations with branches in many countries keep 
alive the antisemite racist myth with the support of networks of 
publications it said 
it cited terrorist attacks against jewish people and symbols and 
said antizionism serves at times as a screen for antisemitism 
feeding on it and leading to it 
discrimination against aboriginal people and immigrants and 
exploitation of poor peasants by powerful landowners are new 
forms of slavery which are frequent in the third world the 
document said

when benazir bhutto arrives here saturday she 
will be following in the footsteps of her father and other pakistani 
leaders who for decades cultivated close ties with china despite 
major differences between the nations 
ms bhuttos fourday trip to china her first abroad since 
becoming prime minister is a sign both of beijings importance to 
islamabad and to the new prime minister herself 
for china the visit comes at a time of great change in its 
relations with the rest of asia improving ties with india and the 
soviet union no longer make pakistan a natural ally but other 
factors such as a shrinking arms market highlighting pakistans 
importance as a buyer guarantee a good relationship for some time 
to come 
in other countries you are witnessing the first visits to china 
in 30 years said pakistans ambassador m akram zaki referring 
to the recent visit to china by indian prime minister rajiv gandhi 
and the planned summit in may with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev with us we have been friends throughout 
indeed despite momentous political changes coups and wars in 
pakistan the cultural revolution in china the relationship 
between the two countries has improved steadily since 1950 when 
islamabad first recognized beijing 
ms bhutto has been in office just over two months becoming 
prime minister in december after pakistani leader mohammed zia 
ulhaq died in a plane crash 
she will meet with all of chinas top leaders and is expected to 
sign two agreements of limited importance a barter trade agreement 
and an agreement on the mutual protection of investment 
the nations exchanged their first prime ministerial visit in 
1956 but the relationship began to pick up quickly after chinas 
border war with india in 1962 
military cooperation which remains the most critical element in 
the relationship began in 1965 during pakistans battles with 
india 
china began selling pakistan arms today 50 percent of pakistans 
400plane air force comes from china as do 1100 of its 1600 
tanks according to the stockholm international peace research 
institute only the united states sells more weapons to pakistan 
china also helps pakistan with its nuclear industry having 
signed an agreement in september 1986 
although the agreement said cooperation would be limited to 
peaceful uses there have been persistent reports china is helping 
pakistan build an atomic bomb 
both china and pakistan have denied this but western diplomats 
say they are convinced cooperation in this field is not limited to 
electricity 
trade has been a disappointing part of the relationship in 1987 
total trade hit 360 million with a large surplus in chinas favor 
relations with china went from good to very good during the 
administration of ms bhuttos father zulfikar ali bhutto who 
visited china three times when he was president and prime minister 
from 1971 to 1976 
the relationship improved under zia who ousted the elder bhutto 
in a coup significantly though beijing is said to have been quick 
to support ms bhutto once it appeared she enough votes to form a 
government 
chinas ambassador to pakistan met her three times within three 
days of the election

four weeks after former prime minister 
paul vanden boeynants vanished near his home leaving behind a shoe 
pipe and hearing aid police still dont know whether he is dead or 
being held for ransom 
about 100 officers are working on the case but police stopped 
holding daily press briefings for lack of information we are 
increasingly worried as time goes by deputy prosecutor andre 
vandoren said 
members of the 69yearold politicians family have made two 
television appeals for his return 
in the second jan 31 his son christian said tearfully he was 
willing to negotiate with the kidnappers at their convenience his 
plea for a sign that his father was alive went unanswered 
investigators said two weeks ago they were sure vanden boeynants 
was abducted by the socialist revolutionary brigade the previously 
unknown group claimed responsibility hours after he disappeared jan 
14 and sent his identity card and a letter in his handwriting to a 
brussels newspaper 
the alleged kidnappers have been silent since however and 
police now wonder whether the group is ideological or merely a front 
used by ordinary kidnappers to mislead them 
as a result authorities dont know whether they are dealing with 
belgiums first major political kidnapping or with its first 
political killing in 39 years 
assailants who were never caught shot a communist leader dead in 
1950 after he shouted long live the republic during king 
baudouins coronation 
vanden boeynants a rightwing christian democrat was a major 
factor in postwar belgian politics before a conviction for business 
tax fraud ended his political career in 1986 
prime minister wilfried martens said the former premier received 
threats in the weeks before he disappeared but martens did not 
reveal their nature vanden boeynants also had requested a meeting 
with the interior minister presumably to discuss his personal 
safety 
after he vanished the alleged kidnappers made conflicting 
statements first saying vanden boeynants would be returned in 
little pieces then claiming he would face a peoples tribunal 
and finally saying he would appear free before the people if 
ransom was paid 
the handwritten letter about his ordeal sent to the newspaper 
jan 24 demonstrated that vanden boeynants was alive after he 
disappeared but how long remains a question 
a ransom note from the socialist revolutionary brigade demanded 
30 million francs about 790000 twothirds to be given to the 
poor through relief agencies chosen in polls of their readers by two 
newspapers it said the money must come from the victims political 
and business allies 
neither paper took a poll of its readers because no further word 
ws received from the alleged abductors 
vanden boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and briefly 
in 1978 he was a skilled backstage negotiator during 40 years in 
politics and had a hand in most major government decisions 
he also made a fortune in the meatpacking industry and got into 
trouble over taxes the judge who gave him a threeyear suspended 
sentence in 1986 called the former prime minister an inveterate 
swindler for whom tax evasion is second nature

ronald h brown the new chairman of the 
democratic party doesnt have to wear a name tag at a party 
meeting or in black politics said a liberal activist involved in 
bringing brown into the jesse jackson campaign 
the ability to move smoothly between often contrasting worlds has 
characterized brown since his childhood when he was the black 
student from harlem at predominantly white schools on manhattans 
upper east side 
it came to the fore last may when the establishment lawyer whose 
clients included the japanese electronics industry and the 
government of haiti stepped into a key role in jacksons 
antiestablishment presidential campaign 
ann lewis who was a top jackson adviser recalled that brown had 
turned down jacksons request to be his campaign manager 
after the bitter new york presidential primary in april 1988 a 
contest during which new york mayor ed koch had said any jew would 
have to be crazy to vote for jackson the former civil rights 
leader sought again to bring brown into his campaign this time to 
be his convention manager 
lewis said a meeting of jackson campaign officials was held in 
her georgetown office brown chaired the session and everyone 
accepted his leadership role 
if you did it with lego blocks youd come up with someone with 
rons qualities she said when asked what characteristics the 
campaign was seeking ron doesnt have to wear a name tag at a 
party meeting or in black politics and it was his ability to move 
credibly in both worlds that worked so well 
most democrats cheered when brown agreed to be jacksons man in 
the negotiations leading up to the atlanta convention that would 
nominate michael dukakis for president 
there was a rather tense atmosphere going into the 
convention recalled paul brountas chairman of the dukakis 
campaign the reverend jackson had started a bus caravan in 
chicago which picked up speed and people on the way to the 
convention this was after several weeks where reverend jackson was 
hitting dukakis pretty hard building an expectation that jackson 
deserved more than he had received 
none of that created an environment which assured any kind of 
unity brountas said 
brown and brountas met privately on the saturday before the 
convention and the jackson aide showed up with a list of his 
concerns 
by the time their meeting ended brountas said i understood 
where he was coming from and i was able to respond to most of them 
and give an indication where i was coming from 
there would be more meetings including one that included dukakis 
and jackson the result was a convention that ended on a note of 
harmony 
from his childhood brown has bridged two very different worlds 
he grew up in harlem but his parents sent him to predominantly 
white private schools in the upper east side of manhattan 
he attended middlebury college in vermont where he was one of 
only a handful of black students when he joined sigma phi epsilon 
fraternity the house was stripped of its national membership for 
violating the whitesonly charter 
at st johns university law school one of his professors was 
mario cuomo 
brown ran the washington office of the urban league before 
joining sen edward m kennedy and becoming a senior aide on his 
presidential campaign later he became general counsel of the 
senate judiciary committee which kennedy chaired 
hes nobodys man but his own said kennedy ron could say 
no to me or to jesse jackson or to anyone else if he believed that 
whatever was requested wasnt in the interests of the party 
big time big money law beckoned and brown now is a partner in 
one of the capitals biggest most politically active firms 
during that period he also served as deputy chairman of the 
democratic national committee 
former party chairman john c white recalled brown and paul kirk 
from earlier days at the dnc 
they were around the office all the time mostly with a press 
release demanding my resignation laughed white 
a sandyhaired texan white was jimmy carters handpicked choice 
to head the party 
brown and kirk were aides to kennedy who was opposing the 
incumbent presidents bid for renomination 
this was downanddirty noholdsbarred politics ill whip 
his ass the president of the united states had said of the 
massachusetts senator who bore one of the most famous names in 
american politics 
but white was an old pro and brown and kirk were budding young 
pros 
hell they were so nice about it i just got so i would invite 
them in for a cup of coffee recalled white we just got to 
where we liked each other i knew what they were doing and they knew 
what i was doing 
six years later kirk became democratic party chairman and on 
friday the 47yearold brown succeeded him in that post

a council meeting of afghan guerrilla 
leaders was postponed friday after rival factions split over the 
formation of an interim government for their nation and 
iranianbased guerrillas walked out 
guerrilla officials said the meeting was postponed indefinitely 
because rival groups were deadlocked on issues including who should 
head a provisional government to replace afghanistans communist 
regime 
representatives of eight afghan shiite guerrilla groups based in 
iran refused to attend after the seven guerrilla groups based in 
pakistan reneged on an agreement to give the shiites 100 seats on 
the council 
the larger more powerful pakistanibased groups from the rival 
sunni moslem sect said the shiite demand was excessive but that 
they hoped to reach an agreement to include the iranian parties 
nobody knows what is happening the leaders cannot decide on 
who will lead the government and there is much disagreement said 
a senior guerrilla official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
delegates who included military commanders political leaders 
and academics adjourned after electing two leaders of the 
pakistanibased groups to head the council 
nabi mohammadi was elected chairman and rasul saiaf was appointed 
secretary 
the council meeting was called to form a provisional government 
and clear the way for elections in afghanistan now that the 
insurgents who have been fighting their nations communist regime 
for 10 years appear close to victory 
the communist government is not expected to survive for long once 
soviet forces complete their withdrawal expected by wednesday 
but the pakistanibased guerrilla groups are deeply divided and 
are scrambling for power some afghan leaders fear that without a 
broadbased government there could be a bloody power struggle 
between the groups which often have clashed 
about 350 delegates showed up friday for the heavily guarded 
meeting 526 had been expected 
god is great the delegates chanted when journalists were 
allowed inside the hall briefly 
mohammad karim khalili chairman of the guerrilla alliance in 
iran said the pakistanibased groups proposed renewed talks with 
the shiites and hinted they would give them 60 council seats 
but khalili said his alliance would accept nothing but the 
initial offer of 100 seats 
we dont want any new discussions we want to realize our 
agreement he told the associated press 
one guerrilla official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the council meeting had been postponed indefinitely and will not 
be complete without representation from afghans living in iran 
delegates had been instructed to remain in islamabad and some 
guerrilla officials said the council might reconvene by monday 
sibghatullah mojaddidi acting chairman of the alliance of 
pakistanbased guerrillas worked out the agreement earlier this 
month to give the iranianbased guerrillas 100 council seats the 
agreement was intended to get the shiites take part in the council 
but leaders of other pakistanibased groups rejected mojaddidis 
deal either because of religious opposition to shiites or because 
of the view that 100 seats was excessive 
the pakistani parties each got 60 council seats 
the shiite groups are much smaller than the seven sunni guerrilla 
parties khalili said about 30 percent of afghans are shiites but 
most prewar estimates put the figure at about 15 percent 
afghan leaders denied reports in pakistan that mojaddidi had been 
removed as chairman of the sunni alliance for making a deal with the 
iranianbased guerrillas leaders of the groups in pakistan take 
turns serving as chairman of their alliance 
afghan communists seized power in a bloody 1978 coup soviet 
forces entered afghanistan in 1979 to prop up the regime against the 
guerrillas and stayed for nine years

for one day georgia tech president john patrick 
crecine experienced life as a student and it wasnt all a big party 
for one thing he couldnt find a parking spot and was late for 
his first class 
crecine and junior david ritchie traded places thursday an idea 
of techs student foundation which raised money by raffling off the 
presidents job for a day 
when the president and the student exchanged car keys crecine 
inherited a 1981 cutlass supreme while ritchie drove off with the 
presidents new chrysler new yorker ritchie offered tips on 
parking spots 
but crecine still had trouble showing up 15 minutes late for his 
8 am calculus class 
this is embarrassing he said interrupting class about 
the best i can hope for is that there will be no pop quizzes 
ritchie abolished parking fees for the day and thought about 
canceling classes but realized it would let crecine off the hook 
his day was full a speech to officials of the ford motor co a 
briefing on plans to restructure the schools academic departments 
and a meeting about the need for more library funding 
crecine did enjoy his leisure time 
the notion of having some time where you get to concentrate on 
something longer than five minutes is refreshing he said

or is it ferrisburgh 
thats the question that seems to have troubled the town since 
the original charter of 1762 when both spellings with and without 
the h appeared on different parts of the now yellow document 
the most visible sign of the debate today is that the us post 
office for ferrisburg stands right next door to the town clerks 
office for ferrisburgh 
town clerk paul hoffman who favors the ferrisburgh spelling 
says he believes initially there was an h at the end of the word 
because the town originated from a land grant 
websters new world dictionary defines burg as a fortified or 
walled town burgh as a chartered town hoffman explained the 
town is about 20 miles south of burlington 
the ferrisburgh historical society officially readopted the 
h more than a decade ago but the word never reached the state 
or federal governments the post office still spells it ferrisburg 
as does the 1988 vermont year book which lists the towns 
population at 2117 
at the little otter creek general store even families disagree 
owner donald myers said he has always added the h 
his wife margie myers does not to be perfectly honest i 
didnt know it was spelled with an h she said

union officials representing federal defense 
and nuclear workers vowed friday to try to block a proposed 
presidential order that would eliminate protections accorded their 
members during security investigations for the past 29 years 
they promised to go to court or congress if necessary to stop the 
plan now under consideration by the bush administration 
among other provisions in the 21page draft order applicants for 
positions in the federal government and defense plants could be 
denied a security clearance and even a job without explanation 
or right of appeal 
a copy of the draft now being circulated to 30 federal agencies 
for comment was obtained by the associated press 
i think its really an outrageous action said bob tobias 
president of the national treasury employees union he said his 
union would ask congressional appropriations committees to bar any 
spending to implement the order if it is signed by president bush 
john n sturdivant president of the american federation of 
government employees which represents 700000 federal workers 
called the proposal unreasonable and unfair he said his union 
the largest one for federal workers would be reviewing the draft 
to determine whether court action to block it is possible 
this union would be appalled at such an action said pat 
ziska spokesman for the machinists union which has 200000 members 
who work for military contractors mostly aerospace companies 
its very frightening a real threat and shock to us 
nolan hancock legislative director of the oil chemical and 
atomic workers union said this is a farreaching order and its 
not in the best interests of our workers or of national security if 
somebody could arbitrarily revoke clearances 
the proposed order also has stirred opposition at the senate 
intelligence committee and elsewhere on capitol hill and among 
interest groups such as the american civil liberties union 
job applicants denied clearance and workers with lowlevel 
clearances who are denied access to more secret information would be 
stripped of their existing procedural rights to challenge damaging 
information workers whose clearances were being revoked would see 
their appeal rights curtailed under the proposed order 
the order would establish the first governmentwide standards for 
background investigations a goal long sought by both executive 
branch and congressional study groups 
it would require more thorough investigations than are done now 
for initial clearances and would require a new investigation every 
five years for those with topsecret clearance and at least every 10 
years for those with secret clearance some recently apprehended 
spies have not been reinvestigated for many years sometimes as a 
result of lack of manpower 
the order would authorize security officers to determine whether 
a worker or applicant has exploitable vulnerabilities or has 
engaged in any exploitable conduct or indiscreet behavior 
including criminal or dishonest activity alcohol or substance 
abuse or exploitable sexual conduct 
security agents also are to determine whether the individual 
has a history of mental emotional and financial stability the 
order said 
an employee could be denied a security clearance or an upgraded 
clearance because of an administrative error or simply because of 
personal dislike afges sturdivant said what harm would be 
caused by giving these employees the reasons for a denial its 
certainly not a question of national security 
tobias whose treasury employees union represents 140000 federal 
workers said people will be summarily discharged if they fail to 
get the security clearance there are many jobs for which the 
security clearance is required and if they lose it theyll be 
fired 
he said his represents all the nuclear regulatory commission 
employees all of whom must have security clearances as well as 
many energy department employees whose jobs require security 
clearances 
the same impact was predicted in the private sector 
the machinists ziska said lifting a clearance could mean a 
lower paying job or firing with vague standards this could be used 
against union shop stewards and leave a lot of room for abuse 
hancock whose oil chemical and atomic workers union represents 
10000 workers at privately owned nuclear plants said if they 
dont have a security clearance in those plants they dont work 
and they dont get paid waiting around the hearings that are 
provided now although it takes weeks and months to get through them 
under this your clearance could be revoked for reasons that 
have nothing to do with national security but more to do with your 
personal behavior 
last october the house intelligence committee said there were 
28 million pentagon workers and 11 million defense industry 
employees whose jobs required security clearances in addition all 
employees of the cia fbi and national security agency must have 
clearances as must numerous energy and treasury department employees 
circulation of the proposed executive order is the bush 
administrations first opportunity to review the question of access 
to classified information said national security council 
spokesman bob hall

the chief federal judge for southern ohio says 
he intends to work at a slower pace because congress killed a 51 
percent pay raise and says other judges have called to say they 
sympathize 
ive had a number of them fellow judges call me and 
congratulate me for saying it us district judge carl b rubin 
said friday i dont ask anybody to join me its a matter of your 
own conscience 
rubin a 17year federal judge nominated to the bench by 
president nixon said his slowdown would not involve criminal cases 
most of which must be heard within periods defined by the federal 
speedy trial law 
but rubin who prides himself on moving quickly to resolve civil 
lawsuits said he would hear those cases at a slower pace 
all im doing is im going to the level of the average federal 
judge thats all im doing rubin said would you rather that i 
got a picket sign and walked in front of the capitol 
s arthur spiegel another judge in the cincinnati federal court 
said he sympathized with his colleague im certainly disappointed 
that we didnt get our raise spiegel said 
the third judge in cincinnati herman j weber declined to 
comment 
members of congress and federal judges are paid 89500 a year 
under intense criticism from voters congress voted tuesday to block 
a proposal which would have automatically raised pay to 135000 
annually president bush signed the legislation 
rubin 69 said he will limit himself to two civil trials a 
month starting with his oldest cases instead of a lawsuit going to 
trial within a year in rubins court it now will take the national 
average of approximately 20 months he said 
im not willing to take this lying down rubin said i 
believe i have been dealt with unjustly 
he calculated he would be working at 100 an hour 900 hours a 
year or approximately 20 hours a week 
rubin said his current salary buys less than his first 40000 
salary as a federal judge 17 years ago he said he would need at 
least 120000 a year to restore the purchasing power he had when he 
was appointed 
i do this with great reluctance i just dont know any other 
way im not going to go on strike he said 
one effect of rubins decision could be to delay outofcourt 
settlements since some lawsuits are resolved just before they go to 
trial said robert a pitcairn jr a lawyer who frequently 
practices in federal court 
one of the strengths of judge rubin was his control of his 
docket and how hard he worked pitcairn said

which is packed with two million people and surrounded by guerrillas 
he accused the united states and pakistan of trying to prevent 
peace by continuing to aid the moslem guerrillas who began fighting 
after a communist coup 11 years ago 
the un airlift was to have begun wednesday but was delayed by 
a change of airlines 
an ethiopian airlines boeing 707 emblazoned with un on one 
side arrived with 238 bags of supplies for distribution to 30000 
people considered the most vulnerable in one of kabuls bitterest 
winters of recent years 
guerrilla blockades and attacks on supply convoys created severe 
food and fuel shortages as the red army packed up and left after a 
nineyear campaign against the insurgents that cost 15000 soviet 
lives 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 were in the country when the withdrawal began may 
15 under a unmediated agreement feb 15 next wednesday is the 
deadline for all to be gone 
pakistans official news agency said the un relief flight took 
off from quetta a southwestern city 65 miles from the afghan 
border and another flight with 36 tons of dried milk would be made 
saturday 
thirty centers in kabul will distribute the food beginning 
sunday said steffan de mistura a spokesman for the un office of 
economic and humanitarian assistance to afghanistan 
this is a small step a small shipment which we hope will be 
able to make a real difference to the lives of some of the 
vulnerable groups in kabul that have been suffering from a hard 
winter and being caught in the middle of war said ross mountain 
deputy drector for afghanistan of the un development program 
an estimated 350000 people in kabul have been seriously affected 
by food and fuel shortages un officials say those suffering the 
most are children aged 15 pregnant women and nursing mothers 
about 400 tons of food medicine and blankets will be flown to 
kabul in a 10day period weather permitting de mistura said 
soviet military jets began bring bringing flour canned meat and 
other staples to the city last month dozens of soviet transports 
land in kabul every day but soviet officers say the airlift will 
stop when control of the airport is turned over to the afghan army 
next week 
more than 6000 tons of flour has been flown in so far this 
month about half the amount intended by the withdrawal deadline 
soviet officials said 
the soviet supplies are distributed on a couponrationing system 
but only government employees and supporters of the communist party 
have access to the coupons 
when fridays un flight arrived de mistura said i find it 
rather beautiful that after many years when the united nations has 
been airlifting goods into ethiopia it is the ethiopian airline 
that helps out the un 
michael keating of the world food program said the crew had no 
problems on the flight 
in neighboring pakistan afghan rebels met to choose a future 
islamic government for afghanistan but guerrillas based in iran 
boycotted the council because of a feud with the pakistanibased 
faction 
a spokesman for sibghatullah mojaddidi chairman of the guerrilla 
alliance based in pakistan said the meeting would adjourn 
indefinitely while a compromise was arranged

washington should give europe some 
kind of signal to break the deadlock over a ban on imports of 
hormonetreated beef from the united states the top west european 
trade official said friday 
i think they should start trying to resolve the dispute 
frans andriessen new foreign affairs chief of the european economic 
community said in an interview at the brussels headquarters of the 
12nation trading bloc 
he said the community also known as the common market is 
limited in suggesting remedies because we believe this 
prohibition is in complete conformity with our international 
obligations 
so i think some kind of signal would be very helpful 
said andriessen a former dutch finance minister i dont know 
what can be done what we cannot do is change fundamentally our 
legislation 
on jan 1 the common market barred imports of meat from cattle 
treated with growth hormones when the united states refused to 
comply and imposed duties on several european products the eec 
threatened its own retaliatory tariffs 
on thursday the united states blocked a european demand for an 
international investigation of the american measures 
the community has no new proposals from the united states 
andriessen said but added that he and carla hills the new us 
trade representative had a long telephone conversation late last 
week 
both of us said that we should do lots of thinking to find 
some kind of solution because nobody wants this matter to 
escalate he said 
andriessen will travel to washington at the end of next week to 
meet with mrs hills and agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who 
was us trade representative in the reagan administration ray 
macsharry the eec agriculture minister will join some of the talks 
secretary of state james a baker iii will be in brussels next 
week on a tour of western europe and has scheduled a meeting with 
common market officials for feb 17 
european foreign ministers are to meet in brussels three days 
later to decide whether to apply countermeasures against the united 
states last month they threatened to impose high duties on 
american dried fruit and walnuts 
the actions of the united states until now are not very 
encouraging andriessen said mrs hills showed a willingness to 
find a solution he said but she was not very specific 
he reported contacts with texas officials who would like to ship 
hormonefree beef to europe but said any deals must be worked out 
through washington 
europeans imposed the hormone ban on grounds the stimulants may 
pose a health risk which the united states disputes 
importation of about 100 million worth of beef and beef 
byproducts from the united states is affected meat used to make pet 
food is exempt 
total trade between the eec and the united states last year was 
an estimated 166 billion 
asked about prospects for trade relations with the new 
administration andriessen said president bush is very well aware 
of the mentality and attitudes on this side of the atlantic and 
that i think is an advantage 
he described yeutter as a a determined man who likes to get 
some results out of negotiations and said mrs hills also has a 
reputation for determination 
if that is the attitude on both sides we might have perhaps 
difficult negotiations but we couldnt exclude achieving results 
as well andriessen said 
eec member nations are belgium britain denmark france greece 
ireland italy luxembourg the netherlands portugal and spain and 
west germany

ten car dealership employees who routinely pool 
money to buy lottery tickets are challenging a coworkers claim 
that she and her husband alone won a 13 million jackpot before she 
quit her job their lawyer said friday 
state lottery officials said friday they would hold up payment of 
the jackpot until they determine the rightful winner of the feb 3 
wild card lotto drawing which is worth 63190 a year for 21 years 
before taxes 
they could go to court said lottery spokeswoman jane shafer 
in harrisburg they may settle out of court were like a stakes 
holder were just waiting to find out who is the rightful party to 
pay 
officials said a woman and her husband whom they refused to 
identify walked into the state lottery office in the northwestern 
pennsylvania town of meadville on monday with what was apparently 
the winning ticket 
later that day attorney john petruso filed a counterclaim for 
the same prize on behalf of 10 people said judy terrell of the 
meadville lottery office 
the dispute involves workers at smithgray cadillac oldsmobile in 
meadville 10 of whom pooled 50 to buy tickets for three lottery 
drawings one feb 3 and two the following week petruso said 
names of the 10 participants were written on an envelope he 
said he declined to identify the woman who bought the tickets for 
the other workers but said she was not one of the participants in 
the drawing 
petruso said the woman told a coworker on sunday that none of 
the pools tickets were winners but that a ticket she and her 
husband bought won 
at work monday petruso said she was congratulated by 
everybody then at some point there were questions asked as to 
where the ticket came from he contended it came from the pools 
block of tickets 
the woman quit her job tuesday he said 
shafer said ownership disputes have occurred two or three 
times in the lottery commissions 17year history 
the winning ticket was one of a block of 1 tickets bought at the 
same time shafer said but she wouldnt disclose how many tickets 
had been bought or whether the winning one was in the middle of the 
block or at an end 
maxine percy who sells lottery tickets at the store where the 
disputed ticket was bought said she couldnt recall who bought the 
tickets 
no one can remember what she looks like said percy she 
came in quite a bit but nobody paid much attention she just bought 
them for all the guys at smithgray 
lottery officials said the period of several weeks for processing 
a lottery jackpot helps ensure that possible challenges will be 
filed before money is paid 
they said that period was lengthened in part because of a fraud 
case last year the lottery winner drew the first annual check 
before it was discovered the ticket was phony

the kids got a real hoot friday out of barbara bush 
and mila mulroney 
within minutes of arriving in ottawa with president bush who 
left to meet with prime minister brian mulroney mrs bush and mrs 
mulroney spent about 30 minutes visiting more than 250 young 
children at a school 
they read from the book owl moon stumbling momentarily over 
who was to handle the hooting despite the handy instructions pasted 
to pages by aides 
its terrible sorry mrs bush said after inadvertently 
delivering a series of hoots intended for her partner 
later the two fielded questions 
mrs bush 63 was asked whether she liked being the wife of a 
president 
i have loved being george bushs wife for 44 years so yes 
she said 
mrs mulroney 36 assured the children there was a lot of work 
but prime ministers wives have a lot of fun 
each listed her duties from running households to answering mail 
and working for favorite causes such as literacy and aids research 
for mrs bush and cystic fibrosis research for mrs mulroney 
but all of them are so much fun and so important that i dont 
feel like its work said mrs bush 
the children gathered in a gymnasium in one wing of an old 
convent school where they were entertained in a singsong by a 
guitarplaying duo who crooned such favorites as jimmy crack 
corn zippity do da and skinamarinky do 
among them was 3yearold nicolas mulroney who snuggled between 
the two while they read to his playmates 
the gym walls were adorned with youthful handiwork signs of 
welcome a banner reading hands across the border and canadian 
and us flags 
the children greeted the visitors with a song written for the 
occasion hello ladies what do you say its going to be a happy 
day 
natalie ryan 11 said it sounded like the women had wonderful 
lives because you always get to go everywhere and you always have 
security guards and aides to look after you 
after the visit the women toured the national art gallery 
stopping to admire works depicting the windswept shores of central 
ontario lakes 
a reporter asked mrs bush if she knew many of those same lakes 
were dead or dying as a result of acid rain a topic atop the 
agenda of her husbands meeting with the prime minister 
theyre beautiful she said of the paintings before walking

chancellor helmut kohl fears a 
controversial nato proposal to upgrade some european nuclear 
missiles would spoil opportunities for arms control and he is 
expected to press nato to delay the decision three years 
kohls spokesman told reporters friday the chancellor sees no 
reason for the alliance to decide prematurely on the question of 
modernization of shortrange missiles when no decision is 
necessary before 1991 or 1992 
a nato decision on whether to proceed with plans to replace 
usmade lance missiles with longerrange rockets had been expected 
in june when kohl and leaders of the other 15 alliance members 
gather for a summit in brussels 
the united states britain and other nato members have made clear 
they intend to reaffirm the decision taken five years ago that calls 
for replacement of aging shortrange missiles 
but west germans have been demonstrating increasing resistance to 
the plan because of what they see as improved opportunity for 
disarmament progress in light of troop reduction proposals by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
we want no decision during this dynamic disarmament process 
kohls spokesman friedhelm ost said at a news conference 
we will discuss all of the elements of our strategy at the 
brussels summit ost said but we want to leave our options open 
kohl said in an interview published friday that the lance 
missiles remain sufficient and intact until 1995 and that the 
alliance should put off its decision on modernization for the next 
three years 
he also rejected the view of some allies that west germanys 
position on modernization will be a test of its loyalty to the 
alliance 
it doesnt interest me at all if others see this as a sort of 
litmus test kohl told the british daily financial times i have 
to represent german interests and i am a reliable partner 
public opinion polls show that 75 percent of west germans favor 
removal of all nuclear weapons from europe and that an even larger 
percentage see no serious security threat from the east 
those sentiments run counter to nato policy which has demanded 
the warsaw pacts superiority in conventional weaponry be reduced 
before the west trades away its nuclear options 
at an annual nato strategy session in january west germany took 
a verbal beating from allied defense experts for dragging its feet 
on the question 
ost denied that the delay in making a decision was connected to 
nationwide elections scheduled for december 1990 kohls christian 
democratic union has lost ground in regional contests the past two 
years 
the modernization plan would replace all 88 lance launchers and 
the more than 700 missiles deployed with the firing units the new 
missiles would be capable of reaching targets 300 miles away 
compared with their current range of 75 miles 
the replacement missiles would bring the nato shortrange 
capability to the threshold of the mediumrange class which is 
being abolished under the december 1987 ussoviet agreement 
soviet and eastbloc officials contend the modernization program 
is intended to make up some of the ground bargained away by the 
mediumrange agreement and that such a move would jeopardize arms 
control efforts

excerpts from the englishlanguage document 
on racism prepared by the vaticans justice and peace commission at 
the request of pope john paul ii 
on south africa 
the most obvious form of racism in the strictest sense of the 
word to be found today is institutionalized racism 
this type is still sanctioned by the constitution and laws of a 
country it is justified by an ideology of the superiority of 
persons from european stock over those of african or indian origin 
or colored which is by some supported by an erroneous 
interpretation of the bible this is the regime of apartheid or 
of separate development 
this regime in the republic of south africa has long been 
characterized by a radical segregation in vast areas of public life 
between the black colored indian and white peoples with only the 
latter although numerically a minority holding political power and 
considering themselves masters of by far the greatest part of the 
territory all south africans are defined by a race to which they 
are officially assigned 
although some steps toward change have been taken in recent 
years the black majority of the population remains excluded from 
effective representation in national government and enjoys 
citizenship in word only many are relegated to homelands which 
are hardly capable of being selfsustaining and are moreover 
economically and politically dependent on the central power 
south africa is an extreme case of a vision of racial inequality 
the prolongation of a state of repression of which the majority of 
the population is victim is less and less tolerated such a 
situation carries within it the seed of racist reflexes on the part 
of the oppressed which would be as unacceptable as those of which 
they are victim today 
for this reason it is urgent that these prejudices be overcome 
in order to build the future on the principle of the equal dignity 
of every person experience has shown moreover that peaceful 
evolutions are possible in this regard the entire south african 
community as well as the international community must make every 
effort to promote a concrete dialogue between the principal parties 
involved 
on antisemitism 
if antisemitism has been the most tragic form that racist 
ideology has assumed in our century with the horrors of the jewish 
holocaust it has unfortunately not yet entirely disappeared as if 
some had nothing to learn from the crimes of the past certain 
organizations with branches in many countries keep alive the 
antisemitic racist myth with the support of networks of 
publications 
terrorist acts which have jewish persons or symbols as their 
target have multiplied in recent years and show the radicalism of 
such groups antizionism which is not of the same order since it 
questions the state of israel and its policies serves at times as 
a screen for antisemitism feeding on it and leading to it 
furthermore some countries impose undue harassments and 
restrictions on the free emigration of jews 
on the dangers of science 
there is widespread fear that new and as yet unknown forms of 
racism might appear this at times is expressed concerning the use 
that could be made of techniques of artificial procreation 
through in vitro fertilization and the possibilities of genetic 
manipulation although such fears are still in part hypothetical 
they nonetheless draw the attention of humanity to the new and 
disquieting dimension of mans power over man and thus to the urgent 
need for corresponding ethical principles 
it is more important that laws determine as soon as possible the 
limits which must no be surpassed so that such techniques will 
not fall into the hands of abusive and irresponsible powers who 
might seek to produce human beings selected according to racial 
criteria or any other characteristic 
this would give rise to a resurgence of the deadly myth of 
eugenic racism the misdeeds of which the world has already 
experienced a similar abuse would be to prevent the birth of human 
beings of one or another social or ethnic category through abortion 
and sterilization campaigns wherever the absolute respect for life 
and its transmission according to the creators intentions 
disappears it is to be feared that all moral restraint on a 
persons power will also disappear including the power to fashion 
humanity in the derisive image of these apprentice sorcerers 
on the united states 
it was only in 1964 that the civil rights law put an end to all 
forms of legally practiced discrimination this represented a 
considerable step forward matured over a long period and marked by 
numerous initiatives of nonviolent nature the catholic church 
especially through its extensive educational system as well as 
through the declarations of the episcopate contributed to this 
process 
despite ongoing efforts much still remains to be done to 
eliminate completely racial prejudice and behavior even in what can 
be considered one of the most interracial nations of the world 
proof of this is the statement adopted by the administrative board 
of the united states catholic conference on march 26 1987 which 
pointed out the persistence of signs of racism in american society 
and condemned the activity of racist organizations such as the ku 
klux klan

up the central government hanoi says it will withdraw its 50000

city officials friday evicted the 
immigration and naturalization service from the building where 
thousands of central americans apply for asylum each week accusing 
the ins of failing to follow fire codes or clean up litter and human 
waste around the building 
we are finally forced to take this drastic action said mayor 
bill card its a situation where we have not been able to get the 
cooperation and the attention of the federal government 
the fire marshal and police cleared the building at 10 am then 
locked the two main entrances and sealed a third with duct tape a 
notice was put on the door saying it was not safe for habitation 
state district judge robert garza later granted the city a 
temporary restraining order forbidding the ins to reopen the 
application center or any other facility in harlingen in such a 
manner as to constitute a nuisance and threat to public health and 
safety 
about 100 central americans and some ins employees stood outside 
the padlocked building while police turned away arriving immigrants 
we dont know what is happening said juan francisco mayrena 
a nicaraguan who was waiting in a van with about 15 other central 
americans 
on some nights scores of central americans sleep outside the 
building to secure places in line the next morning 
four portable toilets at the side of the building have been 
allowed to overflow according to the citys lawsuit and the 
parking lot and nearby vacant lots are littered with trash rotting 
food and human waste 
the ins kept a fire exit at the center locked and had seating for 
450 people in a building where the maximum occupancy under the fire 
code is 196 according to the lawsuit 
the ins hasnt performed any health screening of the asylum 
refugees for communicable diseases the lawsuit said local health 
officials have reported an increase in hepatitis cases 
the city commission voted unanimously friday to close the center 
a former furniture store on the edge of town the ins leases it from 
wolfgang benner of lewisville who is also listed as a defendant 
there was no answer friday at benners home in suburban dallas 
ins officials say they have been working to improve the center 
the agency has resolved two of the three fire code violations 
brought to its attention including recharging fire extinguishers 
and leaving a side door unlocked as a fire escape said ins attorney 
david ayala 
the ins also was reducing the seating capacity he said 
omer jerry sewell director of the ins harlingen district 
said he was shocked by the citys action 
ins officials did not say when or how theyll resume processing 
asylum applications in the area 
the state judge set a feb 17 hearing on the eviction case 
on feb 20 us district judge felemon vela is to rule on an ins 
policy that could bar asylumseekers from leaving southern texas 
until their applications are decided 
refugee advocates sued the ins on jan 6 and vela ordered the ins 
policy put on temporary hold allowing the people to travel again 
but vela has said he probably will allow the ins to resume its 
travel restriction policy 
local officials have said they were planning something to get 
federal attention they complain the federal government has dumped 
responsibility for the immigrants onto residents of the lower rio 
grande valley one of the poorest areas in the country 
the influx of immigrants into the border city of brownsville and 
harlingen 25 miles north swelled last spring and reached a crisis 
point after the ins adopted its travel restriction dec 16 
shelters filled up and hundreds possibly thousands of people 
were forced to stayed in rundown buildings and squalid camps around 
brownsville 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas and rep solomon ortiz dtexas 
have introduced bills that would provide federal assistance to 
people while their asylum applications are pending

the leader of an outlawed neonazi 
group said friday he has formed a new one to pursue his political 
goals although the banning order prohibits him from forming 
successor organizations 
his goals include expelling foreign workers and people who have 
sought asylum in west germany 
right after the banning of the nationale sammlung i formed a 
new organization with the name initiative volkswille popular will 
initiative michael kuehnen said i want to keep being 
politically active 
kuehnen said he hoped to run candidates in municipal elections in 
north rhinewestphalia state this autumn 
in bonn interior ministry spokesman michaelandreas butz said 
thursdays ban of the nationale sammlung a was a success and noted 
that the order would keep the party out of city elections in 
frankfurt and langen next month there was no official to kuehnens 
announcement that he had formed a new group 
nationale sammlung had entered candidates in the frankfurt and 
langen elections its platform included renaming a railway station 
after adolf hitler 
an appeals court ruled friday that the radical rightwing german 
national democratic party may hold a twoday rally this weekend at 
rahden 
officials in rahden about 35 miles south of bremen said they 
had forbidden the rally because they feared violence a court in 
minden rejected the ban and the appeals court in muenster agreed 
more than 1000 people are expected to attend the annual rally of 
the party which seeks the expulsion of foreigners to maintain a 
national german identity 
kuehnen who has spent more than seven years in prison for his 
neonazi activities spoke to reporters outside a munich court 
where he was fined 490 for holding an illegal rally there in the 
bavarian capital in may 
he said most members of his new group belonged to nationale 
sammlung and we want to do away with the system 
police raided homes of nationale sammlung members confiscating 
guns knives ammunition and nazi propaganda 
the gruesome dreams of neonazi kuehnen said a headline in 
the masscirculation newspaper bild 
it quoted kuehnen as saying hitler is for me the greatest 
german in our history were continuing what he wanted 
the crackdown on kuehnens 170member group came as west germans 
warily eye a possible resurgence of rightwing extremism 
opposition social democrats in the parliament scheduled a hearing 
wednesday to discuss the republican party another extreme 
rightwing group that made a strong showing in west berlin elections 
last month 
the social democrats want to question domestic intelligence 
experts about what they know about the party headed by former nazi 
waffen ss soldier franz schoenhuber 
social democrats have long argued that official government 
figures fail to take account of all extremerightist tendencies the 
number of such extremists is now estimated at 28300 nationwide 
with more than 1500 classified as neonazis 
in founding the nationale sammlung last summer kuehnen and his 
followers wrote we must create a nationalrevolutionary and 
socialrevolutionary alternative we must make protestvoters aware 
of this alternative 
the federal government cited that statement to justify its 
argument the nationale sammlung was attacking west germanys 
democratic system and should be banned

a large man whose death in police custody set 
off two nights of street violence suffocated partly from the 
exhaustion of a violent struggle with officers and from being bound 
facedown in a small space a medical report said friday 
an autopsy revealed that edgar allen price a 40yearold black 
man asphyxiated feb 1 after the struggle with eight police 
officers during an undercover crack cocaine bust 
prosecutors are investigating the death to determine if there was 
any criminal negligence or wrongdoing on the part of arresting 
officers 
at least 10 people were arrested in the two nights of 
disturbances and five officers received minor injuries one grocery 
store was looted and torched the tampa incidents followed three 
nights of rioting last month in miami which were sparked by the 
fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by a policeman 
the 6foot3 price was hogtied with hands cuffed behind him and 
legs manacled then tied to the wrists normally a method of 
restraint that is relatively innocuous however in this case a 
different set of circumstances existed dr charles diggs 
associate hillsborough county medical examiner said in his report 
mr price was a 296pound individual who had undergone 
extensive physical exertion and hyperventilation during the 
scuffle diggs said by being placed in a limited space with the 
head face down into the back seat associated with limited activity 
from being handcuffed and restrained the necessary conditions for 
producing an asphyxial death existed 
diggs said the autopsy showed seven bruises on the arms legs and 
abdomen and a single 1inch cut on the head none of these 
injuries contributed to nor produced the death in this individual 
he added 
diggs was unavailable for comment friday according to medical 
investigator jack hall 
i think we pretty much expected this said police spokesman 
steve cole i dont think there are any surprises it further 
illustrates he did not die from any wounds from us hitting him or 
he was not choked to death 
deputy police chief tom depolis had acknowledged that officers 
used nightsticks and flashlights on price who was punching and 
kicking 
police said they tried to arrest price after an informant made a 
crack cocaine buy in college hill a predominantly black housing 
development 
price battled officers before he was finally cuffed and bound and 
placed bellydown in the back of a cruiser a routine police 
procedure to subdue a combative prisoner officials said 
when medical personnel arrived rock and bottlethrowing erupted 
before they could check price in the back of the cruiser 
he was put into the cruiser and removed from the area for his 
own safety said cole 
it was after a oneminute ride that officials noticed price was 
having trouble breathing authorities said he died at a hospital 
two hours later 
police officers who subdued price said he was conscious and 
showed no signs of breathing problems when they put him in the car 
two officers have been placed on administrative leave while 
prosecutors review the case 
price served 11 years of a 50year prison sentence in texas for 
attempted murder of a houston police officer and a string of 
robberies he was paroled in 1984 and came to tampa in 1986 police 
said his girlfriend said price worked as a longdistance trucker 
and laborer 
the tampa tribune reported friday that price had no cocaine in 
his system when he died but had a bloodalcohol level of 006 
percent the legal standard for drunken driving is 010

farmers who signed up to produce 1989 soybeans 
on land normally used to grow other crops will be allowed to plant 
80 percent of the acreage they had requested agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter announced friday 
yeutter also said farmers who asked to plant sunflowers another 
oilseed crop on 1989 land normally used for the other crops will be 
allowed to plant all that they requested 
the options were authorized by congress in last years disaster 
assistance act which was drawn up to help farmers recover from the 
devastating 1988 drought 
normally farmers have to use their permitted acreage under 
the governments programs for wheat feed grains cotton and rice in 
order to protect their crop base or history of plantings 
but the legislation authorized the agriculture department to 
allow soybeans and sunflowers on the acres without farmers losing 
their acreage history 
the law also directed usda to adjust the special plantings so 
that the expected additional production doesnt force the 1989 
market price of soybeans below 549 per bushel or 115 percent of 
the 1988 price support level 
after reviewing the acreage requested by farmers yeutter said it 
was decided to trim the additional 1989 soybeans to 80 percent of 
the 35 million acres they had signed up to plant 
sunflower producers asked to plant 353000 acres on their other 
cropland and they will be allowed 100 percent of what they sought

the verdicts were read there was no reaction from spectators in the 
crowded courtroom 
superior court judge dominic f cresto dismissed charges 
pertaining to an eighth burglary and a seventh sniper attack before 
the case went to the jury on tuesday saying there was not enough 
evidence to support them 
during the time of prosecutor eva marie mancuso said before the trial 
began that her 
case would be based on circumstantial evidence 
she summoned ballistics experts to link a rifle found in stump 
pond in smithfield to bullet fragments and casings found at the 
scene of several of the shootings although the experts were unable 
to establish a definite link because they could not test the rifle 
itself 
paula laliberte a friend of trepaniers testified that 
trepanier confessed to her about the burglaries and snipings several 
hours before she persuaded him to turn himself in to police 
john j hardiman trepaniers lawyer portrayed trepanier as a 
jokester and attentiongetter who confessed to crimes to get 
publicity and said trepaniers knowledge of the crimes was gathered 
from the media 
trepanier and ducharme also face charges in two sniping attacks 
in bellingham mass just north of the rhode island border 
massachusetts authorities said they were waiting for the rhode 
island cases to finish before pressing charges

billion this year although zakharov put the figure at 56 billion 
the total soviet budget is 789 billion 
zakharov appeared to become angry when asked at a news conference 
whether his bank would help erase the red ink 
it is the difficulty of the ministry of finance and the 
ministry of finance must deal with its own problems on its own 
said zakharov

its trouble its misfortune 
aside from the money it already contributes he said the state 
bank will not give one kopeck more for the financing of budget

a loan could be offered but only if interest were charged 
zakharov indicated

deficit oleg t bogomolov director of the institute of economics 
of the world socialist system told reporters wednesday that the 
government could sell land and import video recorders and personal 
computers and tax them up to 10 teims their value 
leonid abalkin director of the economics institute suggested 
jan 25 that the deficit be reduced by scrapping some production 
targets and closing unprofitable businesses in addition he told a

been opened offering 10 kinds of accounts that pay 2 percent to 4 
percent interest 
the savings bank introduced checkbooks last year and so far 1 
million have been given out nakhmanovich reported

the armys current strategy for acquiring light 
helicopters is inconsistent with defense department policy and 
limits the amount of information available on the aircraft before 
fullscale development begins according to a report released friday 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of congress 
said the army made considerable changes in the acquisition strategy 
for the light helicopter or lhx to reduce development costs from 
54 billion to 39 billion 
the army has chosen a higher risk acquisition strategy that may 
not provide decisionmakers with critical information such as 
demonstrated performance and validation of cost estimates when 
needed for key decisions the gao said 
this information is pivotal for the lhx program given the 
advanced technology involved and the demonstrated impact of cost 
growth on the programs affordability the report said 
the lhx represents the armys next generation of scout and attack 
helicopters and the service envisions having the aircraft replace 
its fleet of aging helicopters 
the army expects the lhx to perform a number of missions 
including battlefield reconnaissance locating and attacking armored 
targets striking deep against enemy positions and engaging enemy 
helicopters in air combat 
the lhx program begun in 1983 is estimated at more than 40 
billion 
the report titled light helicopter program risks facing the 
program raise doubts about the armys acquisition strategy said 
the altered strategy eliminates the testing and evaluation of 
competitive prototypes of the lhx before the defense department 
awards a winning contract and fullscale development begins 
this strategy runs counter to defense department policy which 
calls for adequate test and evaluation to establish realistic 
performance thresholds and to reduce risk and uncertainty in 
addition the presidents blue ribbon commission on defense 
management recommended in 1986 that a high priority be given to 
building and testing prototypes 
the defense department defines prototypes as an original or 
model on which a later item is formed or based 
the report also said that technical risks still remain including 
the development of advanced technology such as more advanced threat 
sensors the army also must make additional reductions in the light 
helicopters empty weight 
the gao recommends that the department reassess whether the light 
helicopter should receive more research and development funds for an 
acquisition strategy that matches pentagon policy 
the defense department agreed in principle with the gaos 
conclusions and recommendations but noted the amount of money 
available limits the strategy

president bush declaring a determination to see 
that the uscanadian friendship becomes even stronger 
promised on friday that there would be speedy american action on 
curbing bordercrossing acid rain pollution 
bush on his first foreign trip as president said no specific 
timetable was set in talks with canadian prime minister brian 
mulroney on when acid raincausing emissions from us plants would 
be curbed 
but he said he was committed to move as fast as possible on 
the new initiatives he outlined thursday in his speech to congress 
i have an obligation to move forward with specifics bush 
said in an outdoor news conference with mulroney after a working 
lunch at the prime ministers residence 
later aboard air force one en route to maine bush said that he 
felt that mulroney in their talks was reasonably 
wellsatisfied with the us statements about acid rain 
i mean they probably are a little ahead of us in terms of 
where they wish we were right now in terms of bilateral 
negotiations generally speaking there was no tension over that 
it was very good in that sense bush added 
in ottawa mulroney praised bushs initiative on fighting acid 
rain including a promise to spend 25 billion toward solving the 
problem vowing to propose legislation setting new limits on 
smokestack emissions and negotiating an agreement with canada on 
specific acid rain levels 
this is real progress mulroney said and while i suppose 
i like a lot of people would like it done tomorrow in this area i 
know its not going to happen but this represents some very 
measurable progress 
both the prime minister and the new president proclaimed 
relations between the two nations good and getting better 
bush said he selected canada for his first presidential trip 
outside us borders to symbolize the importance that we place on 
the relationship with canada were each others largest trading 
partners we are friends we share a long peaceful border and we 
have many common interests 
standing with snow on the ground and us and canadian flags 
snapping in the breeze bush asserted we will keep in touch and 
each of us is pledged to see that this strong relationship becomes 
even stronger 
on another subject bush dismissed the importance of fridays 
report from the labor department that wholesale prices in january 
surged a full percentage point 
he said the producer price index jumps around some i am not 
overly concerned about inflation in the united states but he 
added he did not like the figures 
the economy is growing and i think thats good bush said 
calling fridays report a blip on an otherwise calm radar screen 
bush said he and mulroney discussed various topics including 
trade and eastwest relations 
he said he valued mulroneys advice on dealings with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
mulroney called the meeting very encouraging 
he fielded questions in both english and french and at one point 
bush tried to do likewise but his highschool french didnt take 
him very far 
would he take a question in french mais oui but yes bush 
said 
however when the question was shouted out bush said je ne 
comprends pas i dont understand 
bushs fivehour visit consisted of three events a twohour 
meeting with mulroney at 7 rideau gate the governments guest 
house a twohour working lunchin the prime ministers 
residence and a shorter tea at the conclusion of the day 
earlier mulroney said were here to do a little work as 
talk with bush and secretary of state james a baker iii began 
baker said later that bushs promise on moving to curb acid rain 
represents a major shift in us additude on the issue and that 
mulroney recognized this 
however he said discussing a specific timetable at this point 
would be premature given regional political feelings on the issue 
of cleanup costs in the united states 
major questions still unanswered baker told a briefing are 
what is the target for reductions and who is going to pay the 
price 
baker said bush and mulroney also discussed the presidents 
proposal for a oneyear freeze on us defense spending at the level 
of inflation as well as central america and ussoviet relations 
he called fridays session primarily an agendasetting 
meeting 
bush in address to congress on thursday night made a special 
pitch for fighting acid rain and talked about his 116 trillion 
fiscal 1990 budget that seeks to curb pentagon spending while 
providing more for domestic programs 
this included a commitment to spend 25 billion in a 
governmentindustry project to find ways to reduce emissions that 
cause acid rain 
bush also told congress he would propose legislation for new 
federal emission curbs saying the time for study alone has 
passed and the time for action is now 
the pollution is caused when contaminants from coalburning power 
plants and other industrial plants are carried in the wind and mix 
with the rain the rainfall kills some wildlife and damages lakes 
forests and structures 
as the two leaders had lunch about three dozen demonstrators 
stood outside in the snow some carrying antiamerican signs and 
protesting the testing of us warplanes in canadian skies george 
bush enemy of the peoples of the world one demonstrator yelled 
earlier bushs press secretary marlin fitzwater said the 
president felt his address to congress had been wellreceived 
he was very pleased by the general reaction to it including 
the democratic response which bush felt was very constructive 
fitzwater said fitzwater said democrats appeared receptive to 
bushs proposal for early budget negotiations 
the main thing is to sit down and start talking and see where 
it goes fitzwater said 
after leaving canada bush planned to spend the weekend at his 
familys seacoast retreat at kennebunkport maine no public events 
were scheduled 
on monday he makes a speech in manchester nh that aides said 
would focus on his new budget

make pasta products a trade usually dominated by the united states 
and canada the agriculture department said friday 
because of this years droughtinduced short crop in north 
america the increase in eec exports has been achieved somewhat 
easily the departments foreign agricultural service said but 
if the us and canadian durum crops return to their normal size in

the report said the eec had a good harvest and unusually large 
carryin stocks of durum wheat this season 
as in the past with a host of other commodities the eec has

prime ministerelect michael manley said 
friday he will visit washington to establish the widest and most 
constructive relationship possible with the bush administration 
he said he had met with us ambassador michael g sotirhos about 
the trip and wanted to make it as soon as possible manley 64 led 
a leftist jamaican government in the 1970s that alarmed the united 
states but has moved toward the political center 
manley spoke to reporters and members of the jamaican diplomatic 
corps at a news conference the day after his general election 
victory over conservative prime minister edward seaga a staunch 
us ally 
unofficial results gave his peoples national party 44 seats in 
parliament to 16 for seagas jamaica labor party manley led seaga

the people have spoken and we abide by their decision 
indicating he had no plan to challenge the results 
shootings and stabbings took 13 lives during the threeweek 
campaign period including two on election day but the scale of 
violence was nothing like the mayhem of 1980 an estimated 700 
people were killed in that ninemonth campaign 
i am very very proud of my country to have made that much 
progress manley said friday he noted the violence did not touch 
montego bay and the other big tourist resorts along jamaicas north 
coast 
manley said his first priority at home would be to foster peace 
between rival political groups and that church leaders had agreed to 
hold an ecumenical service of national peace and unity sunday 
the day before he is sworn in both he and seaga are expected to 
attend 
socialist policies manley pursued in his first two terms as prime 
minister from 1972 to 1980 alienated foreign investors as well as 
the united states in recent years however he has moved from 
radicalism to prous social democracy 
asked friday to respond to skepticism about his more moderate 
image manley said whats my answer what i say and what i do 
his previous administration taught him the damage confrontations 
with the united states can cause manley said the first thing we 
learned was that getting into any kind of squabble doesnt help 
he repeated his pledge to restore diplomatic relations with 
communist cuba which were broken by seaga but said it was not 
top of the agenda 
while in washington manley said he wants to meet key figures in 
the bush administration congress and such major lending agencies 
such as the international monetary fund and the world bank 
of his very specific objectives for the visit the first is 
to establish on the widest and most constructive possible basis the 
relationship with the new administration of president bush he 
said 
manley said he would consult with the drug enforcement 
administration to improve cooperation against the transit of 
narcotics through jamaica and will seek a bipartisan campaign 
against drugs and guns on the island 
seaga 58 was seeking an unprecedented third consecutive term 
he broke relations with cuba upon taking office in 1980 and was an 
outspoken supporter of the 1983 us invasion of grenada 
to restore the economy he instituted a series of austerity 
measures including higher taxes and a devaluation of the jamaican 
dollar that cut deeply into the buying power of workers who already 
were poorly paid 
the campaign focused more on personalities than issues with 
manley seen as a charismatic champion of the people and seaga as 
representing the interests of big business 
on friday the prime ministerelect said his government would be 
genuinely willing to listen he described seagas as 
essentially autocratic

a lake in one siberian city is so saturated with 
toxic materials that stray dogs are regularly tossed into the water 
to disintegrate 
a chemical plant on the volga river is so hazardous that 
employees routinely take medical retirement at the age of 45 
the rate of sickness from natural gas poisoning was so high in 
one village that the entire town was moved away from a 
gasprocessing plant 
those environmental horror stories are just three of the items 
that appeared friday in soviet newspapers an indicatation not only 
of the sorry state of the environment but the new aggressiveness the 
media has acquired for environmental reporting 
such reporting is now sanctioned under the regime of president 
mikhail s gorbachev as good citizenship rather than antisoviet 
treachery 
the newspaper socialist industry reported friday that moscows 
air contains double the allowable amount of hydrocarbons and that 
ceilings on nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide are exceeded by 30 
percent 
it said city water contains five to 20 times the permitted amount 
of fertilizers and other toxic chemicals 
the paper said moscow already has moved 174 factories outside the 
city limits in hopes of reducing its pollution problem city fathers 
had hoped to move 446 factories outside the city by 1990 but it now 
appears that goal will not be reached until the year 2000 the 
newspaper said 
the entire village of muzhichya pavlovka has been moved away from 
a local gas processing plant after 76 people suffered natural gas 
poisoning in january the newspaper nedelya reported 
meanwhile pravda reported friday that the volga river city of 
chapaevsk is known locally as the city of young pensioners 
because the chemical factory there retires so many people when they 
reach 45 to 50 years of age 
in the siberian city of kemerovo stray dogs that are not sent to 
research laboratories or converted into fur boots and hats are 
simply tossed into a lake filled with toxic phenols from a local 
chemical plant the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported 
after several days no trace is left the newspaper reported

death of her father and another brother for the healing of 
relationships between our countries and the hearts of the people in 
lebanon so they may live in peace

your wishes come true and that terry anderson is in good health

1984 olympic silver medalist in wrestling works as an oil 
consultant in syria and the united states

the state department on friday congratulated 
former prime minister michael manley on his partys victory in 
jamaicas national elections and expressed hope that his return to 
power there will not mean a strain in usjamaican relations 
when manley headed the government from 1972 to 1980 relations 
with washington soured partly because of jamaicas close ties to 
cuba but state department spokesman charles redman noted that 
manley has said that in contrast to his earlier period in office he 
envisions no large cuban presence or influence on the island 
in our view cuba is more than ever an anachronism in a 
hemisphere marked by a dramatic return to democracy in the 1980s 
redman said 
we have talked about these things before but cuban repressive 
practices at home and support for subversion and instability abroad 
argue in our view against reintegration in the hemispheric 
community he added 
a decade ago the state department was troubled by manleys 
radical rhetoric during a 1979 visit to cuba he said that no 
region in the world had suffered more from imperialist penetration 
than the caribbean had at the hands of the united states 
redman noted that manley pledged during the election campaign to 
pursue policies to promote jamaicas continued economic development 
in an atmosphere conducive to private sector activities and foreign 
investment 
importantly he has been clear and firm in stating his 
determination to work vigorously to combat narcotics problems he 
has clearly stated he wants good relations with the united states 
and we share that objective redman said 
the united states was elated in 1980 when manley was soundly 
defeated by prime minister edward seaga and his jamaica labor party 
seaga was elected just five days before ronald reagan won the 
us presidential election and close ties were forged quickly after 
reagans inaugural seaga was one of reagans first foreign visitors 
and he cooperated closely with the united states in the 1983 
invasion of grenada in which jamaica joined the united states and 
several other caribbean countries in toppling the leftist regime 
there 
the reagan administration embraced seaga as an avowedly 
anticommunist democrat who espoused free enterprise principles it 
hoped that jamaica would emerge as a model of capitalist development 
in the third world 
but officials said that seagas free enterprise policies did not 
match his rhetoric and there was open disappointment here over the 
performance of the jamaican economy a situation which was greatly 
aggravated by a disastrous hurricane last fall

the former head of israels intelligence agency 
said friday that rebellious french officers asked israel to aid in a 
plot to assassinate president charles de gaulle of france in 1961 
israel instead informed de gaulle leading to the arrest of the 
plotters isser harel said on israel tv harel directed the mossad 
from 195263 
maurice schumann a former french official who worked closely 
with de gaulle said it was simply preposterous for israel to 
claim any role in uncovering the plot 
the plotters reportedly were out to kill de gaulle because he 
agreed to allow selfdetermination for algeria then considered an 
integral part of france algeria became an independent north african 
republic in 1962 
de gaulle president from 1959 to 1969 died in 1970 
the yediot ahronot newspaper said israels knowledge of the plot 
began when a french officer met with yitzhak braun israels 
military attache in paris and promised increased military aid in 
return for help in killing de gaulle 
the hebrew daily was quoting harels new book security and 
democracy which was released in israel this week 
yediot said braun informed the late foreign minister golda meir 
of the plot and she asked harel for advice 
when i heard of this i said there were two reasons to 
immediately warn de gaulle harel said on television 
first if there really was a plot to kill de gaulle and we knew 
of it and didnt do anything we would be accomplices to the 
assassination of a world leader and a friend of israel 
second there were people in france who were saying that there 
were groups in the security services who were friends of the ultras 
the groups that favored a french algeria 
so i said to mrs meir maybe they the french are trying to 
test us harel added 
he said he immediately called a meeting with army chiefofstaff 
zvi tzur and deputy defense minister shimon peres to see if they 
knew of the threat 
they knew but they thought we should not become involved 
harel said 
concerned that the plot would succeed he turned to prime minster 
david bengurion for advice 
dont waste a minute warn de gaulle immediately harel 
recalls bengurion as saying 
harel said de gaulle foiled the plot and that the officers 
involved whom he refused to name were arrested some were 
executed he said 
a spokesman for the french foreign ministry speaking on 
condition of anonymity in keeping with government policy said 
allegations in harels book are a matter of history now we dont 
have any comment 
schumann then chairman of the french national assemblys foreign 
affairs committee said de gaulle never mentioned any israeli 
tipoff in the episode 
he would certainly have referred to it if there had been any 
foundation to it schumann told the associated press 
yediot quoted tzur as saying he didnt recall the incident but 
adding harel is apparently basing what he says on documents and 
i have no reason to doubt it is true 
yediot said peres who is now finance minister denied it ever 
happened it never occurred it quoted him as saying

workers have cleaned up most of the oil 
spilled into antarctic waters from a sunken argentine ship but the 
accident wiped out a colony of baby birds that scientists were 
studying officials said friday 
lt jose araya of the chilean navy said the oil leak from the 
ship was stopped after divers patched the damaged hull of the 
vessel the bahia paraiso 
but a national science foundation official at the palmer station 
a us antarctic research facility near where the ship ran aground 
on jan 28 said the oil that spill from the vessel has wiped out a 
colony of skua chicks 
bernhard lettau program manager for polar ocean sciences for the 
foundation said the oil killed all but six chicks in a rookery of 
53 nests the skua is a predator bird related to the seagull 
in another two days we expect the remaining chicks also to be 
dead lettau said by conference call to reporters in washington 
the deaths of the birds means that no chicks will be produced 
this year from a rookery that american scientists have studied for 
years on the antarctic peninsula about 600 miles from the tip of 
south america 
lettau also said two seals examined seemed to be having 
difficulty breathing some dead gulls were found and mortality has 
been very high among limpids and sponges living near beaches 
touched by the fuel oil 
american scientists are still evaluating the oil spill and the 
total effect is not yet known he said 
thomas forehand ocean project manager for the national science 
foundation said it is doubtful that the argentine vessel can be 
refloated because its damage is so great it is hoped that it can be 
it cut apart and removed he said 
officials are worried about removing the remaining fuel oil and 
drums of gasoline from the the vessel without creating another spill 
the united states argentina and chile have been working to clean 
up the wreckage the first real environmental threat to the 
untouched antarctic 
araya said a special skimming boat from the united states has 
cleaned up most of the oil slick asked in a telephone interview 
whether the problem is considered under control araya replied i 
would say so 
araya said the skimming boat had cleaned up palmer bay two miles 
from the ship the skimming craft was being used friday inside a 
ring of floating booms set up around the ship to contain the leak 
the emergency craft is supported by the polar duke a national 
science foundation vessel that traveled to the spill carrying 52 
tons of cleanup equipment

prospects for agreement on a 
guerrilla proposal to postpone elections vanished thursday when the 
government and armed forces hardened their positions and political 
parties failed to agree on a response 
the proposal has been the subject of intense debate since the 
farabundo marti national liberation front made it on jan 24 
the rebels offered to take part in elections if voting was 
postponed from march 19 until september it represented a dramatic 
turnaround the rebels had boycotted and condemned as a sham five 
previous national elections this decade 
the leftist rebels have been fighting since 1980 to overthrow the 
usbacked government 
the government of president jose napoleon duarte initially 
dismissed the rebel overture as insincere then retreated somewhat 
and left resolution of the matter up to political parties running in 
the election 
speaking to journalists thursday duarte criticized the 
suggestion that all candidates withdraw so no election could be 
held some sectors had advanced this as one way to postpone the 
election without violating the constitution 
we cannot use a subterfuge as a pretext for solution what must 
be sought is a true peace that will not lead us anew into 
confrontation and war duarte said 
col emilio ponce chief of the joint chiefs of staff said 
rejection of the guerrilla proposal would strengthen salvadoran 
democracy in a speech to the americansalvadoran chamber of 
commerce ponce likened the rebel initiative to a man bullying his 
way into a poker game with a pistol his own deck and his own dealer 
who deals him a straight flush of course he wins 
he said rejection was advisable even though the government could 
be perceived overseas as intransigent 
on tuesday defense minister gen carlos vides casanova said the 
rebel proposal rather than bringing peace would aggravate 
conditions vides said the armed forces consider the proposal a 
strategy to foment insurrection 
representatives of all main political parties have been meeting 
throughout the week trying to forge a consensus response to the 
guerrilla document with no sign of a breakthrough 
the marxistled insurgents said they would participate in the 
election and respect its outcome if it were postponed for six months 
and other conditions were met dealing with security and fraud 
prevention meeting the conditions would require constitutional 
changes 
the rebels said on their clandestine radio wednesday that 
response has been dilatory and irresponsible all we have seen 
are inconsistencies lack of will and indisposition to consensus 
the rebels insist that the army be confined to barracks for 
election day the point considered most objectionable by the armed 
forces 
on thursday two rebel commanders shafik handal and roberto roca 
sent a letter to the major political parties saying they were 
willing to travel to san salvador to discuss the election proposal 
with legislators 
if the assembly invites them we the armed forces will go 
along even though we dont like it said ponce 
sources participating in the politicians meetings said the 
rightist republican nationalist alliance or arena remained adamant 
that the election should not be postponed 
arena which trounced duartes christian democrats in legislative 
and municipal elections last march is favored to win the 
presidential ballot and arena leaders have said postponement can 
only hurt their prospects

president bush said friday its too 
early to recommend a new package of pay raises for congress judges 
and federal executives saying he wants to let the dust settle 
on the explosive issue 
answering questions from reporters aboard air force one en route 
to his vacation retreat bush bemoaned the refusal of the house and 
senate this week to approve 51 percent pay raises for themselves and 
for top figures in the other two branches of government 
the president reiterated his statement of wednesday saying 
signed legislation rejecting the pay raises because he respected the 
sentiment of the members of the house and senate the pay raise was 
overwhelmingly turned down in both chambers 
all i can do is make recommendations to the congress about the 
future legislation bush said having talked to some of the 
leaders up there im not sure the timing is right for that 
he said there has been a lot of wounds a lot of hemorrhaging 
up there and i dont want to do something thatll look like i am 
simply trying to step into the breach and raise a problem that has 
caused a great deal of divisiveness in the capitol 
bush had said all along that he supported the substantial pay 
raises for members of congress which would have elevated their 
salaries from 89500 to 135000 a year and he repeated that 
friday 
when i signed that bill rejecting the raise i made a comment 
about my feeling that the judicial salaries should go up i am on 
record as favoring an increase for members of congress and senior 
executives he said 
weve got to do something the president said signaling out 
the national institutes of health as an example of a federal agency 
that likely would suffer a loss of talent under existing pay scales 
for top federal executives 
but now he said ive got to rely on my people here to 
make a recommendation to me when i can be effective for the changes 
that i think are overdue 
but what you dont want to do is come in and when the wounded 
are still lying on the battlefield start fighting another battle 
bush said 
lets take a little time he added if i felt that a 
specific recommendation out of the president right now would 
have the effect of achieving what ive just spelled out id do 
forward right now

the government envisions a future 
political structure in which it will not matter whether the 
president is black or white a cabinet minister said friday 
a new constitution needs to be negotiated and the head of 
the state or of the government needs to be redefined information 
minister stoffel van der merwe said at a news briefing 
the ideal situation would be to create such a system where it 
becomes immaterial what color the occupants of the positions are 
a few years ago foreign minister pik botha was severely 
reprimanded by president pw botha after suggesting to foreign 
reporters that south africa might someday have a black president 
van der merwe was assessing the opening week of the 1989 
parliamentary session in which national party leaders gave broad 
outlines of the type of future government they would like to see 
progovernment media have depicted the speeches as representing a 
dramatic shift away from racially based politics and a repudiation 
of whiteminority domination 
but the governments liberal critics question whether the 
rhetoric will be matched by action and note that no government 
leaders have offered to give the black majority full voting rights 
president pw botha who resigned as national party leader last 
week is recovering from a stroke and has appointed a cabinet 
minister chris heunis as acting president another cabinet 
minister fw de klerk was elected new leader of the party 
we have to go through a very fundamental process of considering 
how the government of the country should be structured van der 
merwe said but the power distribution should be such that it will 
not matter what the color or origin of a particular incumbent is 
especially when one comes to the more symbolic positions 
earlier friday education minister gerrit viljoen told reporters 
that the black education system for many years kept substandard by 
law is now capable of producing a future black president he would 
not comment further 
de klerk and heunis have indicated they are rethinking 
fundamental principles that have guided the national party for 40 
years such as the strict allocation of political rights housing 
and education along racial lines 
van der merwe said the party has embarked on a process of 
longterm change but regarding things that can be changed 
unilaterally we have proceeded almost as far as we can go 
he said the government wanted to negotiate with leaders of other 
race groups before suggesting alternatives to key apartheid laws 
such as the group areas act which mandates segregation of 
residential areas 
heunis and de klerk have depicted a future south africa in which 
some people live in a multiracial society while others who wish to 
preserve segregation are allowed to do so on a local basis

tens of thousands of iranians chanted 
allahu akbar god is great from rooftops and fireworks 
burst over the city friday night to honor the islamic revolutions 
10th anniversary 
officials said the celebrations were repeated in cities and towns 
across the country as 10 days of celebrations moved toward their 
climax saturday feb 11 the date in 1979 on which the 
2500yearold persian monarchy fell 
millions of iranians were expected to brave icy winter winds 
sweeping down from the snowcovered alborz mountains to attend a 
huge rally in tehrans azadi square on saturday 
anniversary celebrations began feb 1 the date a decade ago on 
which ayatollah ruhollah khomeini returned to iran in triumph from 
15 years of exile 
the 88yearold revolutionary patriarch was not expected to 
attend the azadi square rally because of frail health he rarely 
leaves his residence in the north tehran suburb of jamaran 
this years anniversary is more festive than previous ones when 
iran was locked in a long and costly war with iraq 
fighting was halted aug 20 after eight years by a ceasefire 
sponsored by the united nations 
friday nights rituals in praise of god were decreed by the 
government to begin at 8 pm and last 10 minutes voices of men 
mingled with the lighter tones of women and children 
fireworks illuminated the sky over the sprawling city of 10 
million people traffic stopped in many streets and people emerged 
from cars and buses to stand on the snowy pavements and join the 
chant of allahu akbar 
ayatollah musavi ardebili the nations chief justice urged all 
iranians during friday prayers at tehran university to attend 
rallies saturday and demonstrate our faith in the revolution 
tehrans wide avenues were festooned with thousands of slogans 
praising khomeinis leadership and denouncing the united states and 
israel 
posters of khomeini and revolutionary slogans hung from every 
lamppost and arches of myrtle leaves were erected in the streets 
many building facades were covered by huge slogans or 
largerthanlife portraits of khomeini 
this years celebrations take place in a climate of increasing 
public dicussion and official criticism of the shortcomings of the 
revolution and the clergydominated government 
ayatollah hussein ali montazeri khomeinis designated successor 
said in an interview this week with the newspaper abrar 
unfortunately instead of safeguarding the values of the 
revolution we shouted slogans instead of keeping the people 
involved we isolated the intelligent and active forces making them 
more and more disgruntled 
the biggest blow against the revolution was inflicted by wrong 
management methods excessive zeal power in wrong hands 
factionalism and the disregard of true revolutionary values 
we must avoid allowing a certain group to monopolize the 
revolution and must value the ideas of all those individuals and 
groups who believe in the revolution the country and the 
leadership

de cuellar said 
velayati said of fridays session we have only had procedural 
talks 
but he said iran still maintains that the next step of the peace 
process should be an immediate withdrawal of forces to the prewar 
boundaries of both countries 
iraq still occupies 260 square miles of iranian territory it 
seized during the 8yearold war with iran 
this week aziz released a letter to perez de cuellar insisting 
that iran must first relinquish its right to search ships in the 
persian gulf for iraqbound war cargo 
aziz also said iran should show it sincerely wants peace by 
agreeing to cooperate with a un plan to dredge the shatt alarab 
waterway that forms the southern border between their nations 
the waterway which is blocked by silt and sunken ships is 
iraqs outlet to international waters 
aziz left without offering any substantial comments 
velayati and aziz seemed more comfortable this week than they had 
in previous negotiating sessions held in geneva and new york 
on wednesday the security council unanimously called on iran and 
iraq to stop stalling on implementing the uns peace plan 
the demand coincided with a remarkable series of disclosures in 
the iranian media in which parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
said tehran had overreached its grasp during the nearly eightyear 
war 
we took too big a bite rafsanjani was quoted as telling the 
official islamic republic news agency 
yes we wanted something but were not able to get it and that 
was military victory if we had moved with a bit more planning maybe 
it would not have been so far off said irans parliament speaker 
iraq had accepted a un call for a ceasefire in 1987 but iran 
did not agree to the truce until july after suffering humiliating 
defeats during an iraqi advance on the battlefield 
since the ceasefire took effect aug 20 iraq has often accused 
iran of seeking the truce only to halt its military losses 
peace talks that opened five days later in geneva immediately 
deadlocked 
iran says the ceasefire is in effect and the rest of the un 
peace plan should be implemented the peace plan calls for 
withdrawing armies to the border exchanging prisoners of war and 
negotiating a settlement to the conflict 
baghdad however says the ceasefire is not legally in place 
because iran has not relinquished its right to search ships in 
international waters of the gulf for war cargo bound for iraq 
both sides have shown flexibility in recent weeks over secondary 
measures iran pledged to drain an artificial lake it built between 
the opposing forces in the southern front near the shatt 
iraq suspended a warning to civilian air traffic not to fly into 
iran that ban had previously forced iranbound flights to detour 
north through turkey 
baghdad and tehran have agreed to set up a joint commission of 
military officers to discuss complaints of ceasefire violations 
along their 730mile front line 
the joint commission will be led by officers of the un 
iraniraq military observer group which monitors the truce 
both sides have released small groups of sick and injured 
prisoners of war which raised hopes that the international 
committee of the red cross might be able to register and repatriate 
about 100000 pows held by both sides

lawyers for ferdinand marcos asked a federal 
judge friday to remove the deposed philippines president from a 
racketeering case because of his health problems 
us prosecutors opposed the move saying it was too soon to make 
a final prognosis of the 71yearold marcos chances for recovery 
from pneumonia and other respiratory ailments 
us district judge john f keenan reserved decision 
marcos has been hospitalized for nearly a month at st francis 
medical center in honolulu for pneumonia and bronchial asthma he 
suffered a collapsed lung jan 19 while at the hospital but it was 
reinflated a spokesman listed him as in guarded condition friday 
in another development a senior adviser to philippines president 
corazon aquino confirmed that he met in san francisco with some 
supposed representatives of marcos earlier this week but said he 
ended the talk after learning they were not authorized to speak for 
the marcos family 
i am not in the habit of talking uselessly about these 
things the official mateo caparas told reporters outside 
keenans courtroom 
caparas head of the philippines presidential commission on good 
government said he was asked to the meeting by marcos lawyers he 
said he had no authorization from mrs aquino to talk with marcos 
earlier before keenan marcos attorney richard a hibey asked 
the judge to sever marcos from the case with a review of his health 
status at a later date 
the request if granted would not dismiss the charges against 
the ailing former president but only separate his case from the 
other defendants including his wife imelda 59 and saudi arabian 
financier adnan khashoggi 
the marcoses and others are charged with a racketeering scheme 
that allegedly looted 103 million from the philippines and funneled 
it through foreign bank accounts to buy new york real estate and 
artworks 
the marcoses have lived in exile in hawaii since fleeing manila 
in february 1986 
a feb 4 report by marcoss physician dr claver p ramos 
submitted to the court by hibey said the former president was in 
critical condition at st francis and required a respirator 
i dont see that the us courts are about the business of 
visiting their jurisdiction on someone who is in this condition 
hibey told keenan 
when keenan asked hibey about news reports that marcos was trying 
to negotiate a settlement with the philippines government the 
lawyer said there have been conversations there have not been 
negotiations 
hibey added it is clear we have communicated to the philippine 
government the desire of the marcos family that mr marcos be 
allowed to return to the philippines to die his condition is in 
extremis 
assistant us attorney charles labella insisted that it was too 
soon to make final determination of whether marcoss health problems 
precluded him from standing trial 
i think its much more prudent to wait three months to assess 
mr marcoss condition said the prosecutor adding either hes 
going to recover or hes not 
a continuation of a hearing by keenan to determine if marcos is 
well enough to be arraigned in honolulu is scheduled for march 6

president daniel ortega has raised the 
possibility of early elections electoral reform and amnesty for 
political prisoners the official sandinista party newspaper 
barricada said friday 
it quoted an opposition leader isidro tellez of the 
marxistleninist party as saying ortega made those points at a 
meeting with members of the opposition 
according to barricada tellez quoted ortega as saying he would 
bring it up at the central american summit that starts monday 
the reported offer would move toward compliance with a dormant 
central american peace plan that the central american presidents are 
trying to revive 
ortega has been meeting with tellez and other political foes to 
seek broad support for tough austerity measures nicaragua needs to 
save itself from economic disaster 
tellez revealed that president ortega has stated the 
viability of an immediate amnesty for all the former somocista 
guards and even the possibility of early elections barricada 
reported elections are now scheduled for november 1990 
the leftist sandinistas came to power in 1979 in a popular 
revolution that ousted dictator anastasio somoza the government 
said on dec 10 that it still had 1744 former members of somozas 
national guard in custody and that it had an additional 1398 
members of the antisandinista rebel movement in jail 
tellez quoted ortega as saying amnesty for the usbacked 
rebels known as contras would hinge on whether thousands of 
contras still based on the nicaraguan border in honduras would lay 
down their arms barricada reported 
the us congress cut off military aid to the contras in february 
1988 a month later the sandinistas and contras signed a ceasefire 
agreement the level of fighting in nicaragua has dropped sharply 
since then although some still occurs 
four rebels were killed and two were injured in fighting in the 
northern province of matagalpa on thursday a sandinista military 
spokesman said he said no sandinista soldiers were hurt 
ortega and the presidents of el salvador honduras guatemala and 
costa rica are to meet in el salvador on monday 
the foreign ministers of the five nations asked the united 
nations on wednesday to send a multinational force of inspectors to 
central america to verify that no country supports subversion 
against its neighbors

andrei sakharov assailed the soviet 
government on thursday for refusing to recognize ukrainian catholics 
and urged other catholics to campaign on behalf of the outlawed 
church 
sakharov a founder of the soviet human rights movement and a 
nuclear physicist told a group of siena residents at the northern 
citys university campus he wanted to point out the problem of the 
ukrainian catholic church 
there is an absolutely anomalous situation in which a whole 
church with a great number of faithful finds itself in a situation 
of illegality and clandestineness he said 
i think italian catholics should use all the influence they can 
so that this situation is normalized he added to a burst of 
applause 
sakharov first expressed public support last summer for the 
ukrainian catholic church 
his statements thursday appeared to be his strongest about the 
estimated 4 million ukrainian catholics who make up the largest 
underground church in the officially atheist soviet union 
the remarks were especially significant coming in the same week 
sakharov met pope john paul ii and cardinal myroslav ivan 
lubachivsky the romebased leader of ukrainian catholics 
sakharov 67 is on a fiveday visit to italy his second trip 
abroad since being freed in december 1986 from nearly seven years of 
internal exile 
his wife human rights campaigner yelena bonner accompanied him 
here she has been treated several times at the university of siena 
opthalmological clinic for glaucoma her doctor renato frezzotti 
said after a checkup thursday that she appeared to have been cured 
of the disease 
on the trip sakharov has spoken out on behalf of persecuted 
minorities focusing on ethnic armenians in the soviet union 
the winner of the 1975 nobel peace prize was awarded a gold 
doctoral ring by the university of siena for his defense of human 
rights 
sakharov beamed and waved his hand in the air to show off the 
ring 
in his speech he praised the restructuring policies of president 
mikhail gorbachev but he said the soviet government had not made 
enough progress in liberalizing the economy and introducing greater 
democracy 
later at a questionandanswer session sakharov said in part 
while replying to a question about religious liberty under gorbachev 
unfortunately i must say that there are members of the 
religious hierarchy who in the past didnt always behave as they 
should have they chose compromises and accords that perhaps werent 
justified 
he did not elaborate but appeared to be criticizing the russian 
orthodox church which has been closely aligned with the communist 
government 
dictator josef stalin suppressed the ukrainian catholic church in 
1946 and ordered it to merge with the russian orthodox church many 
catholics refused and the church went underground 
sakharov said he hoped that in formulating a new law about 
religion the government would take into account the opinion of 
churches outside the boundaries of the soviet union and the desires 
of believers 
sakharov who helped develop the soviet hydrogen bomb was barred 
from leaving the soviet union for years because the government 
claimed he knew state secrets from his scientific work his standing 
has improved dramatically since his release from exile and he is a 
candidate in nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for march

vice president dan quayle criticized 
israel before an american jewish group friday for a clearly 
unacceptable record of civilian killings in the west bank and gaza 
strip even as he pledged a strengthened usisraeli alliance under 
the bush administration 
quayle said that despite israels current difficulties and 
turmoil the last eight years have been good for that alliance 
speaking to a conference of the antidefamation league of bnai 
brith quayle said the united states must not be in a position of 
pressuring israel its longtime strategic and diplomatic ally to 
accept a precooked solution on peace with its neighbors 
but his comments also reinforced a recent state department report 
that criticized the civilian killings by israeli military forces 
friction involving palestinians living in the israelicontrolled 
regions has resulted in nearly 400 palestinians killed and many 
more injured quayle said some may say that by the grisly 
standards of some of israels neighbors a few hundred people killed 
in the course of a yearlong uprising is not a very staggering 
figure 
but israel should be judged not by those standards but by those 
of the democratic west he said and on the basis of these 
standards the status quo on the west bank and gaza strip is clearly 
unacceptable 
later in a speech to the cuban american bar association quayle 
urged improved human rights in latin american countries quayle 
cited a human rights lecture he delivered last friday to military 
forces of the usbacked el salvador government 
i believe i succeeded in getting my message across quayle 
said he said he told them about commitment to the rule of law and 
human rights two crucial areas in which they must do better 
while state department statistics show that political murders 
have declined from a high of 750 per month there in 1980 to 18 per 
month in 1988 quayle said that figure is still unacceptable 
he contended however that the worst violators of human rights 
in el salvador are the leftist guerrillas trying to overthrow the 
democratic government 
quayle said cuba nicaragua and panama represent tyrannical latin 
governments that are desperately holding out against a democratic 
tidal wave that is rising every higher 
the state departments recent report on human rights worldwide 
singled out israels military forces for excessively harsh measures 
against palestinian civilians 
quayle called for mutual restraint in the middle east and 
said the bush administration will continue to advance the cause of 
human rights around the world and we will continue to strengthen 
and deepen our strategic alliance with israel 
questioned by reporters quayle was reluctant to go further in 
criticizing israel saying only that israel is having some tough 
times and that the government is trying to do a better job 
he told the antidefamation league that the firstever talks 
between representatives of the united states and the palestine 
liberation organization do not indicate any fundamental change in 
attitude toward the plo or its leader yasser arafat 
simple prudence obliges us to monitor mr arafat and his 
organization very carefully and to probe his words very closely 
before arriving at a final determination quayle said 
quayle said that while arafat has stated recognition of the state 
of israel and has renounced terrorism some plo factions hold 
opposing viewpoints 
in miami quayle visited an inner city merit school charles drew 
elementary school where school test scores and achievement rank 
among the highest in the nation the vice president praised the 
students success and their voluntary attendance at school on 
saturdays 
the school is located near the neighborhood where racial violence 
and looting erupted last month sparked by the shooting of a black 
man by a police officer 
at the school about two dozen protesters waved signs reading we 
want justice now and another small group carried signs reading 
deport all illegals now 
quayle offered no solution to what the bush administration will 
do to help florida cope with the massive influx of latin refugees 
particularly from nicaragua but he criticized nicaraguas 
sandinista government as the cause of the problem saying the 
refugees left because their freedoms were repressed by the leftist 
government

doctors prepared to perform an abortion on a 
comatose woman after the us supreme court on friday rejected 
efforts by two antiabortion activists to stop her husband from 
authorizing the procedure 
tough battle but we won it said the husband martin klein 
we can now turn our attention to trying to help nancy justice has 
been done 
the abortion opponents waged a twoweek legal fight to prevent 
klein from becoming his wifes guardian to authorize an abortion 
that doctors said could help her recover 
new yorks highest court friday refused to hear an appeal by the 
two antiabortion activists and us supreme court justice thurgood 
marshall who handles new york cases later turned down their 
request for a stay 
the court of appeals and marshall rejected the motions without 
comment 
klein said he learned of marshalls decision while at north shore 
university hospital on long island where his braindamaged wife has 
been in a coma since a dec 13 car accident mrs klein 32 is 17 
weeks pregnant 
i told nancy that everything was going to be fine i gave her a 
kiss and came home klein told the associated press from his home 
in upper brookville 
klein 34 and his wife have a 3yearold daughter 
dan rosett a hospital spokesman said the hospital is preparing 
to perform the abortion saturday morning another spokeswoman carol 
hauptman said doctors friday night gave mrs klein medication that 
is routinely administered about 12 hours before an abortion is 
performed 
john short who along with john broderick fought klein for 
guardianship rights said they would ask supreme court justice 
antonin scalia to impose a stay so the case can be brought before 
the full supreme court 
they are criminally assaulting her and killing her child he 
said friday night it is tragic but we are pulling out every stop 
we can 
he said they would pursue the case even if an abortion is 
performed so that the questions raised by the case can be resolved 
a nassau county police officer was stationed in the hospital and 
a police cruiser was parked out front friday after hospital 
officials were told the antiabortion group operation rescue might 
try to stop the abortion 
the hospital said prochoice activist bill baird had warned of 
possible action by operation rescue 
thursday night the court of appeals granted a temporary stay of 
a lower state appeals court decision in kleins favor on friday 
the judges of the top court met for more than four hours to review 
the case 
the fivemember appellate division of the state supreme court in 
brooklyn calling the abortion opponents short and broderick 
absolute strangers ruled thursday that they have no place in 
the midst of this family tragedy 
short said thursday he was concerned about about the 
psychological and emotional state of nancy klein if she wakes up 
under our plan we say the babys down at the neonatal clinic 
getting the best care possible he said under their plan 
theyve got to tell her theyve killed her baby emotionally that 
would kill her 
mrs kleins parents frederick and anne zusselman of delray 
beach fla have been staying with their soninlaw during the 
court battle and support his decision to seek an abortion 
life will never be the same it was too terrible and then to 
have the complications come in and the publicity said zusselman 
on friday this has been such a horrendous ordeal i hope no one 
will ever have to experience what we have 
were really torn apart weve been up and down on a roller 
coaster these people have put us through absolute hell zusselman 
added 
the appellate division judges said thursday previous new york 
court decisions had established that strangers will not be appointed 
legal guardians unless its impossible to find someone within the 
family to serve in that role 
klein had first petitioned to be named his wifes guardian on 
jan 26 one day later the antiabortion activists moved to block 
his petition

the family of a woman who gave birth while 
in a coma urged a new york man on friday not to have his comatose 
wifes pregnancy terminated saying medical experts can be wrong 
we should take whatever god has given us and thats the way it 
is said david blodgett sr whose daughterinlaw barbara 
blodgett was three months pregnant when she suffered a brain injury 
in a june 1988 auto accident 
mrs blodgett 24 gave birth to a healthy baby boy simon on 
dec 9 despite a gloomy prognosis she began regaining 
consciousness shortly after the birth and can now sit up in a 
wheelchair answer questions by nodding her head or pointing to 
letters on a piece of paper and hold a bottle to simons lips 
blodgett said he spoke friday morning with john broderick one of 
two antiabortion activists who are fighting martin klein 34 of 
upper brookville ny to be appointed guardians of kleins wife 
nancy 32 and her fetus 
new york states highest court on friday refused to let broderick 
and john short intervene in the case the abortion opponents 
immediately filed a motion for a stay with us supreme court 
justice thurgood marshall who handles new york cases but he turned 
down their request late friday 
a spokesman at north shore university hospital on long island 
said doctors were preparing to perform the abortion saturday morning 
blodgett said he called mrs kleins mother thursday morning to 
offer information i told her what transpired with barbie he 
said i dont think taking the baby is going to be any benefit to 
the mother 
blodgett who opposes abortion said he was not able to talk with 
klein 
members of mrs blodgetts family point to her recovery as proof 
that doctors can be wrong in such cases 
they doctors were at one time telling us the same kind of 
thing said greg valenzuela mrs blodgetts father all we 
asked them to do is make the attempt to maintain both as best they 
could once they decided to do it it didnt seem like a major 
problem 
blodgett said his daughterinlaws life was also threatened by 
elevated body temperatures caused by the brain injury and that the 
antibiotics used to treat the fever were a threat to the fetus but 
there was never any serious consideration of trying to save one over 
the other he said 
mrs klein who is 17 weeks pregnant has been in a coma at a 
manhasset ny hospital since a dec 13 car accident she is 
severely braindamaged and given a slight chance at recovery klein 
said some physicians advised him that an abortion may enhance her 
recovery and could save her life

savers withdrew a record 81 billion from the 
nations thrift institutions in december but 34 billion of the 
total was accounted for by a single healthy institution which was 
shrinking deposits as part of a deliberate strategy the government 
said friday 
the withdrawals topped the onemonth record of 70 billion set 
in november bringing the net outflow for two months to 151 
billion said the federal home loan bank board which regulates 
2955 federally insured savings institutions 
meanwhile in a separate development the federal deposit 
insurance corp said friday it had taken control of six more savings 
institutions bringing to 10 the number of sampls brought under the 
agencys control since president bush on monday gave it that 
responsibility under his plan for the sampl crisis 
the december outflow the eighth consecutive was happening at a 
time of mounting publicity about sampl problems regulators closed or 
merged 75 institutions that month 
but bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria 
va said money was moving out of sampls because their interest rates 
are moving up more slowing than other investments not because 
depositors were nervous 
i dont think people are losing confidence what this is 
signaling is we have an industry that is under real pressure 
because of these rising rates he said 
ely noted some accelaration in the increase of interest paid to 
sampl depositors and said rates would likely be forced higher as the 
federal reserve board tightens credit in an effort to dampen 
inflation 
they have to start matching the rising rates and boy thats 
hard on the bottom line this does not bode well for thrift 
earnings he said the industry on the way to a record year of 
red ink lost 94 billion in the first nine months of 1988 
according to minutes released friday of a dec 1314 meeting of 
federal reserve policymakers the central bank decided to push up 
interest rates the lone dissenter was federal reserve board member 
martha seger who expressed particular concern that the higher 
interest rates would aggravate the troubled condition of the 
sampl industry the minutes of the federal open market committee said 
economist martin regalia of the national council of savings 
institutions said the presidents effort this week appears to have 
bolstered confidence in savings institutions 
if you look at the stock market they look at this whole 
process as being a net plus thrift stocks have risen in the last 
few days because i guess they feel the problem is being addressed 
he said 
james barth chief economist of the bank board said a single 
institution shrank its deposit base by 34 billion on purpose 
substituting lowcost borrowing 
he also noted that money normally flows out of savings accounts 
in december as people spend to celebrate the holidays 
for all of 1988 84 billion flowed out of sampls compared with 
18 billion in 1987 the annual record of 254 billion was set in 
1981 when interest rates soared and money flowed into money market 
mutual funds and other alternatives to savings accounts 
the six institutions taken over by the fdic under a cooperation 
agreement with sampl regulators are first federal of arkansas 
little rock ark savers federal savings and loan association 
little rock ark sandia federal savings and loan association 
albuquerque nm bright banc dallas university savings 
association houston and deseret federal savings and loan 
association salt lake city 
fdic chairman l william seidman said his agency which insures 
commercial bank deposits will take control of more than 200 
insolvent sampls in the next four to six weeks 
in an interview friday he confirmed published reports that top 
administration officials were worried that a faster takeover could 
trigger a depositor run he said the federal reserve board put 
together a plan to pump money into the sampl system in the event of a 
problem 
there were people inside the government who were very 
concerned seidman said i was on the other side but i was 
just as eager to have a contingency plan just in case 
he said he believed the danger to the sampl system had eased now 
that bush had submitted his sampl proposal to congress

a company of ukrainian ballet dancers down on 
their luck spent friday as tourists in the nations capital as 
american benefactors tried to find theaters that would book them 
the 65 dancers members of the donetsk state opera and ballet 
theater had been left in baltimore after promoters of their 15city 
american tour backed out leaving them without work costumes or 
music 
the experience has left the dancers with warm feelings about the 
americans who stepped forward to pay their hotel and meal tabs but 
it has soured them on the dogeatdog world of capitalist show 
business 
vadim pisarev the troupes lead dancer said of american 
businessmen theyre very harsh theyre very dangerous 
i will be very upset if we cant continue he said through an 
interpreter 
howard gillman who has paid most of the costs of housing and 
feeding the dancers through a foundation that bears his name said a 
decision has to be reached in the next few days on arranging a new 
tour or sending the troupe back to the ukraine 
this is something you do in a year he said this has to be 
done in days 
gillman said the troupe has landed one booking in new york city 
later this month 
in moscow the newspaper izvestia reported that an affiliate of 
the soviet government arts agency has reached an agreement to keep 
the tour going a schedule is being worked out the newspaper said 
the collapse of the tour has led to a crossfire of accusations 
with the promoters saying the dance troupe did not show up with big 
russian stars as promised while the other side accuses the 
promoters of having cold feet and empty wallets

a hardware store sold its entire 
stock of ak47 semiautomatic assault rifles and has about 150 
special orders to fill after it advertised a 
getembeforeyoucant sale this week 
i guess you can say sales increased said rob mccarthy a 
clerk at blairs true value hardware store who works at the gun 
counter 
mccarthy said friday the store had sold all 15 of the ak47s in 
stock and had put in special orders for many more since placing a 
fourinch classified advertisement in a milwaukee newspaper sunday 
menomonee falls is about 15 miles northwest of milwaukee 
the weapon has received increased attention since jan 17 when a 
gunman opened fire with an ak47 on 400 children in a stockton 
calif playground killing five children and injuring 29 others and 
a teacher 
store owner jim blair said there was no connection between that 
shooting and the sale although his store had benefitted from the 
recent news media attention the gun has received 
the day the ad was placed in the paper we had a poor response 
but since then theres been a lot of interest by the news media and 
sales have picked up he said two local television stations 
carried stories on the sale 
the advertisement offers one assault rifle a cleaning kit and a 
bayonet for 350 it also offers a buddy package deal in which 
two people can buy two guns and 1100 rounds of ammunition for 790 
state rep david travis criticized the store for using scare 
tactics to boost its sales saying the store had played upon 
unwarranted fears that the gun will soon be outlawed 
no bills restricting purchases of assault rifles are pending in 
the state legislature but congress is considered legislation that 
would ban ak47s uzis and other militarystyle semiautomatic 
rifles on friday police urged congress to pass the bill 
wisconsin law requires a 48hour waiting period before the 
purchase of a handgun is completed but there is no wait to buy an 
assault rifle such as the ak47 because they are classified as a 
hunting rifle 
federal law requires anyone buying a gun to fill out a form 
asserting that he or she is not a convicted criminal is not 
mentally ill and has not been dishonerably discharged from the 
military 
travis said sales like the one by blairs hardware have hurt any 
attempts to keep ak47s off the street since the california shooting 
i think the damage is already done if were having bluelight 
specials in wisconsin on the sales of these guns travis said 
state senate majority leader joseph strohl of racine who has 
supported stricter regulation of handguns blamed the news media for 
giving too much attention to the ak47 and thus creating a hysteria 
to buy the gun 
i think what has happened is once people discuss this and ask 
questions about the control and use of these assault rifles persons 
start saying i better go out and get one before its too late 
strohl said

communist party leaders will revise the 
official view of the 1956 antisoviet uprising which was branded a 
counterrevolution for three decades a source said friday 
one official offered a new assessment saying the revolt began as 
an uprising that turned into a counterrevolution 
the 108 members of the partys central committee met behind 
closed doors to discuss a reappraisal of the revolt an emotional 
issue that has gripped the nation since a politburo reformer stunned 
hungarians on jan 28 by calling it a popular uprising 
the reformer imre pozsgay was expected to survive fierce party 
criticism of his statement at fridays meeting the source said on 
condition of anonymity 
gyula horn a state secretary in the foreign ministry and a 
central committee member said a very careful assessment was 
made of the uprising 
horn said the revolt started as an uprising some may call it a 
popular uprising but later it turned into something which could be 
termed a counterrevolution 
horn appeared on state television after the meeting to take part 
in a film festival discussion group but was immediately asked by 
other panelists about the central committee meeting 
an official announcement said fridays meeting discussed a report 
by party chief karoly grosz on topical domestic issues and adjourned 
until saturday 
emil kimmel a central committee official told the state news 
agency mti 16 people spoke on issues including transition to a 
multiparty system and different views over how to assess the 
past 
pozsgay questioned the official view that the 1956 revolt was a 
counterrevolution crushed by soviet tanks his statement opened up 
public differences with other party leaders and an unprecedented 
debate in the staterun press and society about the events of 1956 
pozsgay based his statement on the stillunpublished report of a 
party committee investigating four decades of communist rule in 
hungary 
the partys new assessment of 1956 will emerge after discussion 
of the report friday and will be substantially modified from the 
old view the source said 
he declined to give details or say when the new view would be 
made public 
appeals to the central committee from groups seeking change 
appeared again in the media friday indicating the party is under 
pressure to modify its view on 1956 if it hopes to retain public 
standing under a multiparty system to be introduced by next year 
after 30 years of collective failure of memory only the open 
renunciation of the onesided falsification of history in the kadar 
period can prepare a rapprochement between the power and the 
nation the independent youth group fidesz said in the daily 
magyar nemzet 
janos kadar the party leader from 1956 until may 1988 was 
rumored to be ill friday and it was not certain whether he attended 
the central committee session as honorary party president he is 
entitled to be there but he has missed the last two sessions a 
western diplomat said 
a nov 1 1956 speech by kadar was published this week in the 
official journal idea and showed him referring five times to the 
revolt then as a popular uprising 
an article in the literary journal life and literature fiercely 
attacked kadar for staying silent on 1956 including his whereabouts 
in the crucial days when soviets rolled into hungary to crush the 
revolt 
the revolt began oct 23 1956 with demonstrations for a new 
government and demands that soviet troops leave hungary about 
20000 soviet troops entered budapest to quell the uprising on nov 
4 and kadar was elevated to power 
fidesz urged the members of the central committee to jump over 
their own shadows and perform a historic act of international 
importance by reassessing the 1956 revolt 
fidesz and 14 other mushrooming alternative groups said monday 
they would consider the coalition government talked of by some 
communist reformers only if the party changes its stand on 1956 
east bloc sources have suggested however that moscow could not 
agree with pozsgays assessment as the sole view of the 1956 revolt 
hungarians glimpsed possible new leeway from moscow however in 
a startling statement by the prominent soviet academician oleg 
bogomolov indicating he would see no threat to the soviet union in 
a neutral or socially democratic hungary 
hungarian papers gave prominent play to bogomolovs words which 
attracted almost as much public attention as 1956 and the central 
committee meeting 
although it appeared party reformers could win a victory with the 
official reassessment of 1956 there were also signs of strong 
conservative forces in the party 
a group identifying itself as the front for socialist democracy 
was quoted in magyar nemzet as expressing anxiety over the 
reevaluation of 1956

wayne l hays a 14term congressman 
whose affair with house clerk elizabeth ray in 1976 touched off a 
payrollsex scandal and destroyed his political career died friday 
he was 77 
hays suffered a heart attack at home friday afternoon said his 
wife pat he was taken to wheeling hospital in nearby wheeling 
wva where he died said hospital spokeswoman linda crook 
hays began his political career in 1939 when he was elected 
mayor of flushing in rural eastern ohio he was elected to his first 
term in the us house in 1948 with 514 percent of the vote 
he ended his national political career after nearly 28 years in 
congress when he resigned sept 1 1976 to stop a house ethics 
committee investigation into his conduct public hearings were to 
begin 2 weeks later 
i think he did it to save his family carl albert then house 
speaker told reporters after receiving hays resignation letter 
the ethics committee then voted to end its threemonth 
investigation of the scandal on grounds that hays no longer was a 
congressman and no longer under the panels jurisdiction 
the justice department which also was investigating decided not 
to prosecute department attorneys said they lacked evidence 
corroborating the account of ms ray the house clerk and her 
relationship with hays 
after leaving office hays returned to his 300acre red gate farm 
in belmont where he bred angus cattle and tennessee walking horses 
in 1978 hays made a comeback of sorts with his election to the 
ohio house there he pushed bills aimed at curbing big utilities 
and promoting ohio coal but generally kept a low profile one 
exception came during an incident in which he threatened to punch a 
television cameraman during a hearing 
he was defeated in a reelection bid in 1980 
in 1980 hays became chairman of the democratic party in belmont 
county and remained active in local party politics 
hays and his first wife martha were divorced in 1976 after 38 
years of marriage that same year hays married pat 
the sex scandal broke during the spring of 1976 hays first 
denied then acknowledged having an affair with ms ray then 33 
but he steadfastly denied her charges that she was kept on his 
administration committee payroll at 14000 a year in federal funds 
only to have sex with him hays maintained that she did regular 
committee work 
he was among congressmen who asked for the ethics committee to 
begin an investigation in may 1976 when ms ray made the allegations 
in a story in the washington post 
i cant type i cant file i cant even answer the phone 
ms ray told the newspaper 
hays first denied the charge to the post saying hells fire 
im a very happily married man 
but three days later in an emotional speech before the full 
house hays admitted he lied when he denied having the relationship 
with ms ray who began working for his house administration 
committee in april 1974 
hays later said he lied because he did not want his new wife to 
find out about it 
on june 3 1976 five days before the ohio primary hays bowed to 
mounting pressure from colleagues and stepped down as chairman of 
the house democratic congressional campaign committee 
despite hays washington reputation as mean and abrasive and the 
capitol hill bully many of his heavily bluecollar constituency saw 
him as a man who got things done such as pushing through pensions 
for blacklung coal disease or getting official documents such as 
army discharge papers and passports 
he could stand at a rally and call voters by their first names 
he sent greeting cards to mark marriages anniversaries births and 
graduations 
in a rally in smithfield at the height of the scandal hays 
said im not guilty of anything except a little damn 
foolishness and if they sent everybody to jail who made a mistake 
and i made one and i apologize for it well you know there 
wouldnt be enough to go around jails that is 
although he won the 1976 primary with 62 percent of the vote the 
scandal dashed his hopes of running for governor 
two days after the primary hays was rushed to a hospital in a 
coma from an overdose of dalmane a sleeping tablet his doctors had 
prescribed for him during the scandal he emerged from the coma in 
less than 24 hours but remained hospitalized for nine days 
hays later said the overdose was accidental if i wanted to 
commit suicide there were 30 or 40 more pills in the bottle and i 
could have taken all of them and that would have done it 
besides his wife hays is survived by a daughter and two 
grandchildren a burial service on monday will be private a family 
friend said

amid the tackiness of the recent syndicated 
television convention here were those defenders of good taste or at 
least good entertainment film critics roger ebert of the chicago 
suntimes and gene siskel of the chicago tribune 
in a cave buena vista television had constructed in back of 
the exhibition hall the two critics took up their places in front 
of a snackbar and popcorn machine to announce that next month they 
will tape a onehour retrospective of great moments from their movie 
review show 
originally they were paired on the pbs series sneak 
previews but more recently in the syndicated series at the 
movies and siskel amp ebert amp the movies the clips retrieved 
from 12 years on the air together will be titled siskel amp eberts 
500th show celebration 
we dont know if its the 500th show said ebert its 
around the 500th show it sounded better than siskel and eberts 
503rd show celebration 
they said the highlights of the special to air in june will 
include best arguments outtakes collections of parodies of the 
pair such as the one in the movie hollywood shuffle best and 
worst films and interviews with stars who get to say what they 
think of the critics 
longtime competitors in the chicago newspaper market siskel and 
ebert became an underground hit when they first began bantering on 
public television they later left public tv for a more lucrative 
syndication deal as evidenced by their appearance at the national 
association of television programming executives here they have 
gotten an effective standup routine down pat too 
since the beginning when a scruffy pooch leaped into the seats to 
announce the weekly dog of the week the weeks worst movie 
they have costarred with a collection of critters 
siskel recalled that when the dog was replaced with a skunk the 
striped bearer of cinema symbolism did not immediately recognize the 
importance of facing the camera so the director had to frequently 
call for someone to spin the skunk i thought im on a show 
where they spin the skunk siskel recalled with distaste 
ebert remembered an animal handler who wanted to use a turkey 
vulture in the role my only regret is that we never got to work 
with a vulture he said wistfully noting in an aside to siskel 
or at least you didnt

first screen test because she didnt think she had a chance of

the 22yearold british actress thought she was too young for the 
role of christabel bielenberg the englishwoman who married a german 
lawyer on the eve of world war ii together they resisted and 
survived the nazi regime 
the fourpart bbc drama airs in one installment per week 
beginning sunday on pbs masterpiece theatre 
hurley was selected over hundreds of other actresses for the 
role even though her only prior experience was a fourminute part 
in the anthology movie aria some tv commercials and roles in 
episodes of inspector morse and rumpole of the bailey 
the screen test was a difficult scene where she christabel is 
interrogated by the nazis hurley said in an interview during her 
first visit to los angeles it was a heavy scene i wasnt nervous 
because i didnt think id get it i was up against some wellknown 
actresses i was too young the producers only saw me because i had 
a good agent 
the screenplay was adapted by leading british television 
scriptwriter dennis potter the singing detective from mrs 
bielenbergs autobiography the past is myself mrs bielenberg

role in dick tracy but he was looking for an american girl 
afterward i rang up my friends in london and told them about it

many issues in the leveraged buyout binge of 
corporations are destined to have repercussions far into the future 
a future so hazy that nobody can really forecast what those effects 
will be 
everyone involved in a leveraged buyout understands that the 
mountain of debt incurred must be worked off but it is a safe 
assumption that a large percentage has very little idea of how that 
feat can be accomplished 
in short they rely on the future to somehow take care of things 
it has worked in the past during the 1970s for example inflation 
allowed real estate debtors to grow rich by repaying loans in 
discounted dollars 
but as one corporate economist stated those who have taken on 
tremendous debts to buy up corporations may not be so lucky they 
are he said simply placing their faith in the federal reserve to 
save them from default 
the future will make its decision and it could be a painful one 
but one decision doesnt await the verdict of the future it has 
been made painfully obvious already conventional bondholders have 
been damaged 
in an analysis of economic issues facing the new administration 
dun amp bradstreet economist joseph w duncan observes that 
bondholders the chief financiers of lbos might very well be the 
patsies 
in effect he states those who mastermind leveraged buyouts make 
the assumption that the stock price of the company they seek is 
undervalued they tender offers for the cheap stock funding the 
purchase with junk bonds 
in this manner he continues returns to stockholders are 
immediately maximized but at the expense of the bondholders whose 
values suffer for a variety of reasons 
because additional interest payments have to be made on the new 
debt capital meant for investment or expansion part of the 
security behind bonds may be diverted 
the greater leverage also increases the chance of a default to 
bondholders when troubled economic times occur this might cause 
bond prices to fall and bond yields to rise jeopardizing the 
further use of bonds as a financing tool 
the increased supply of bonds issued by a company and by the 
market in general reduces the attractiveness of bonds and hence 
also reduces their price 
whereas stockholders have the option to sell their shares to a 
new management thereby avoiding future risks bondholders have no 
such rights they are exposed to the additional unanticipated risk 
of that new management 
a leveraged buyout for instance means that existing bonds 
outstanding are backed not by the publicly owned company that issued 
them but by a privately owned successor the old company might have 
been solid the new one risky 
for another the highrisk bonds used to finance the leveraged 
buyout might relegate existing older once highquality bonds to 
junk status too 
institutional bondholders are furious about the situation 
claiming their trust has been violated some have gone to court 
most have also gone to a somewhat unsympathetic securities and 
exchange commission 
while some answers might be forthcoming from the courts and 
regulators the real impact might develop in the marketplace itself 
having been burned so badly in bonds that is can bondholders 
who are generally conservative individuals and institutions be 
expected to take such chances again

it takes five years for one of the 184 tiny wheels 
in a new swiss watch to complete a single revolution another wheel 
takes a century then after 400 years a lever has to be moved so 
the watchs calendar wont skip a leap year date 
it also is the first timepiece to calculate the date of easter 
and features a celestial chart showing the milky way and 2800 
northern hemisphere stars 
the 18carat gold calibre 89 which has a diameter of 34 
inches and weighs 24 pounds has two dials and 24 hands packed 
among its parts are 68 springs 126 jewels and 332 screws 
patek philippe the geneva company that recently unveiled the 
calibre 89 to mark its 150th anniversary says it hasnt any idea 
how much it can sell the watch for so it plans to auction it off 
april 9 in geneva 
we estimate that it will get between 5 million and 10 million 
swiss francs 32 million and 64 million said osvaldo 
patrizzi the watch expert at habsburg feldman auctioneers of 
geneva 
to date the highest price paid for a timepiece at an auction was 
12 million in 1984 for a clock from the mid17th century 
patek officials say the company did not keep any accounting of 
how much calibre 89 cost to make since it was not done for marketing 
purposes 
but patek is not likely to be contested in its claim that the 
calibre 89 is the worlds most complicated watch 
a team of watchmakers took more than five years to design its 
1728 parts and four years more to assemble them 
at some points we were greatly worried that we would not 
succeed said jeanpierre musy the head of the firms complicated 
pieces department 
calibre 89 has 33 functions that is 19 more than the firms 
packard watch of 1927 which it bought back last year for 13 
million 
calibre 89s features include a daily display of the sunrise and 
sunset chimes that ring on the hour and halfhour and power 
reserve indicators that show when rewinding is needed the 
mainspring can run for 30 hours 
but the makers pride is the watchs perpetual secular 
calendar 
it takes into account that a leap year is skipped at the turn of 
most centuries by the gregorian calendar introduced in 1582 only 
the century years that are exactly divisible by 400 such as 2000 
and 2400 have a feb 29 
to keep it up to date the complicated mechanism makes one 
wheel turn once every five years triggering a 20tooth century 
wheel to move on by one notch a peg gives that wheel an extra 
push every 100 years thus disengaging the calendar mechanism on 
three out of four century years to skip the leap year a lever 
reengages the mechanism after 400 years 
the date of easter which changes every year is shown on the 
watch at midnight of the preceding dec 31 calculating the date for 
more than 30 years would require additional mechanisms that would 
not fit into the watch so a special cog allowing the watch to 
display it must be replaced every 30 years 
a computer helped produce 1600 blueprints for the watch 
we could have managed without them said designer francois 
devaut who conceded he first thought the plan for calibre 89 was a 
utopian idea 
but it would have taken us an additional four or five years 
paul buclin of the assembly team said synchronizing the various 
mechanisms was the biggest challenge it would take about two months 
to take the watch apart and reassemble it 
its accuracy within one minute a month does not match a cheap 
quartz watch 
but precision is not the most important thing said philippe 
stern the companys managing director the tradition of 
watchmaking is 
based in geneva where the craft dates to the late 16th century 
patek philippe is the oldest familyowned watchmaker in the world 
the stern family bought the company in 1932 
stern said the company hopes to make three more calibre 89s over 
the next four years including one for the its private collection of 
historic watches 
the first one will be auctioned april 9 along with 300 other 
precious patek philippe watches after an exhibition tour of paris 
milan new york los angeles tokyo hong kong and singapore

while many stocks have prospered in the market 
rally of the past three months few groups have gone farther and 
faster than airline issues 
stocks like delta ual amr nwa alaska air and southwest have 
all traded lately at their highest levels in at least a year 
as it happens those six are all components of the dow jones 
average of 20 transportation stocks 
the transportation average unlike many other market indicators 
has recently come close to recouping all ground lost in the market 
decline of august through december 1987 
on feb 3 the average stood at 108344 just 219 percent shy 
of the alltime closing high of 110116 reached at the peak of the 
bull market in 1987 notes william lefevre an analyst at advest inc 
in wall streets view at least this would seem to suggest that 
the industry has begun to emerge from a long turbulent period of 
adjustment to deregulation and may be headed for smoother sailing in 
the future 
during 1988 everything that could possibly go right did 
said helane becker an analyst who follows the airline industry for 
shearson lehman hutton inc the airlines had one of their 
bestever years 
pretax industry earnings grew 18 percent she estimated in a 
recent report on a 12 percent gain in revenues 
the likelihood of the profitability continuing into 1989 is in 
our opinion quite high although the percent changes will probably 
not be as dramatic she added 
in its appraisal of 91 industry groups for their likely stock 
price performance over the next 12 months the value line investment 
survey ranks the air transport group a lofty ninth 
all this has caught some investors off guard since they have 
grown used to thinking of airline stocks as a kind of commodity 
like gold or soybeans best suited for shortterm trading strategies 
rather than longterm holdings 
two prime forces affecting most airline stocks have been 
developments in the industrys sporadic passenger fare wars and 
fluctuations in the price of oil 
traders looked for falling oil prices translated to read lower 
jet fuel costs or indications of a letup in fare competition as a 
cue to take airline stocks for a quick ride 
promotional air fares are not likely to disappear ms becker 
acknowledged however she said we think that overall air 
fares will remain relatively stable 
this should lead to better predictability of earnings 
consequently we think airline company equities will become more 
than trading vehicles they are likely to become investments 
despite the bright current picture presented by the industry 
value line analysts caution that some clouds may be forming on the 
horizon 
they say us airlines like many another domestic industry 
before them may be confronted with increased competition from 
abroad in the years ahead 
once members of the european economic community fulfill plans to 
form a single unified marketplace by 1992 value line says 
european airlines may well seek and gain the right to fly routes 
within the united states as some american carriers now do between 
destinations in europe 
that competition could be especially formidable the advisory 
service observes because of the reputation for good service that 
many european carriers enjoy 
we wouldnt be surprised if us carriers once again found 
themselves operating in a vastly different marketplace within the 
next few years value line concluded 
we think the adjustment would be a difficult one and one that 
might well lead to another industry shakeout

president bushs proposal to pay for a way out 
of the savings and loan crisis bears no resemblaterested in solving the 
problem than in assessing blame for 
letting it happen 
he made his savings and loan proposal in advance of his 
nationally televised budget address to a joint session of congress 
thursday night the equivalent of a firstyear state of the union 
message bush clearly wanted to isolate the sampl problem rather than 
see it packaged as a major feature of his domestic program 
indeed the president said that despite the huge price tag he 
would not let the savings and loan crisis significantly alter our 
overall budget priorities 
but nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of 
this magnitude he said as he presented his plan on tuesday 
nevertheless the new administration crafted it to make it seem as 
painless as possible that may have been overdone as it already is 
prompting democratic complaints about rigged accounting to make the 
price look lower and the budget look better 
when bush personally presented his sampl formula he said it would 
cost 90 billion that went up in a hurry the office of management 
and budget disclosed a day later without fanfare that interest 
over the next decade would push the figure to at least 126 billion 
over 30 years the bailout is going to cost about 200 billion 
but the bush program is designed to minimize the impact on his 
revised budget it actually would show about 200 million less for 
sampl rescues than the budget reagan presented before leaving office 
actually more money has to be spent but it would be charged 
against the current budget instead of the bushs new one 
the bush plan is to finance the rescue with a combination of 
general revenues the taxpayer share of the cost and higher fees 
on deposit insurance in all federallyinsured savings institutions 
for savings and loans which already pay higher premiums the 
increase would be 22 cents on each 1000 in deposits for banks 
the increase would be 67 cents per 1000 
while thats billed as a way to have the savings industry finance 
the plan the cost could be passed on to customers 
i believe that banks and thrifts should pay the real cost of 
providing the deposit insurance protection bush said but he 
added theres no guarantee the added fees will not be passed 
along to consumers 
in fact there is every prospect that they will be although the 
prudent and politic course for an industry in such circumstances is 
to wait until the issue subsides and then add back the cost 
gradually and quietly

on his 180th birthday abraham lincoln 
still makes news and historians continue to revise the reality and 
try to deflate the myths attached to the countrys 16th president 
the latest attempt to flesh out the portrait is the historians 
lincoln pseudohistory psychohistory and history according to 
the works editor gabor s boritt the book takes some of the 
best lincoln writers in the past decade and sums up what they have 
to say 
what they have to say in short is that the man who freed the 
slaves preserved the union and delivered the gettysburg address was 
afraid to be intimate with women had an unappreciated sense of 
humor and remains a complex subject that requires further study 
boritt a gettysburg college professor and a leading lincoln 
scholar said lincoln continues to be a subject of fascination and 
examination because he is both a central figure of american history 
and mythology 
in the introduction to the 416page book published to coincide 
with the 180th anniversary of lincolns birth on feb 12 boritt 
wrote that since his assassination in 1865 lincoln has been viewed 
as both a man and a god a dual role that troubles historians 
whatever the public thought the compromise whereby the common 
man captured the illinois years and the divine one the presidency 
could not be satisfactory for scholars since it suggested an 
inexplicable transfiguration accordingly they have labored through 
much of this century to bridge the gap 
in addition to bridging the gap the historians lincoln also 
uses relatively new tools to examine the president 
for instance charles b strozier editor of psychohistory 
review devotes a chapter of the book to traits and experiences that 
helped form lincolns personality 
lincolns story fades into legend strozier wrote as a 
result we are probably better informed about the trivial anecdotes 
and more confused about the significant events of his formative 
years than about those of any figure in american history 
most of us know or think we know a good deal more about his 
railsplitting or his absentmindeness than we do about the shape of 
his personality especially the sources of his periodic paralyzing 
bouts of depression what gave meaning to his relationship with his 
wife and his children and what made him a uniquely fitted leader 
for a nation rent by discord 
one section of his essay touches on lincolns sex life and his 
uneasy dealings with several women including mary todd who became 
his wife lincoln broke off two engagements including one with mary 
todd for no apparent reason 
lincoln it seems feared intimacy and had steered clear of 
heterosexual union in two relationships strozier wrote 
he suggests it took the marriage of lincolns best friend to get 
him over his fear 
when speed his friend at last actually consummated his 
relationship with fanny and the sky did not fall in lincoln was 
liberated from his fear of marriage speed experienced what lincoln 
could only fantasize about he served as a kind of emotional proxy 
for his conflicted friend strozier wrote 
such details may seem tame to readers familiar with the tales of 
gary hart and jim bakker but to historians such probing was 
unheard of until recently 
not so long ago a thing like psychohistory didnt exist these 
are ideas and concepts that wouldnt have occurred to people 75 
years ago boritt said it would have been bad manners it would 
have been voyeurism it would have been unacceptable 
despite the title boritt said he demanded that contributors and 
critics whose reactions are also published in the volume write for 
a lay audience 
in the last generation or so historians have been 
inaccessible boritt said they write only for themselves 
he added that if lincoln scholars write for themselves the 
popular vision of lincoln will be dictated by gore vidal author of 
lincoln a novel and others whose writings boritt dismisses as 
simplistic and flawed 
the most important thing history teaches you is to weigh the 
evidence boritt said you dont just hop on the bandwagon and 
rush off 
boritt an intense 40ish man seems always in a hurry in person 
but labors over historical points he spent a decade tracking down 
the size of lincolns big toe to try to determine if the president 
was a victim of marfans syndrome a rare genetic disorder boritts 
conclusion he probably wasnt 
the professor is already thinking about his fifth book yet 
another look at the civil war and lincoln from the view of the 
british 
things undiscovered remain yet to be discovered he said

after nine years of white socks and a charming 
bunkside manner as the cruise boat doctor on the love boat 
bernie kopell is up to no good in the abc movie get smart again 
kopell is back as conrad siegfried still with kaos still 
plugging evil and terror still trying to take over the world still 
being thwarted by agent 86 from control 
agent 86 was better known as maxwell smart siegfrieds american 
nemesis the truth is they were both a couple of dim bulbs but 
smart aided by his brainy and beautiful colleague agent 99 always 
managed to muddle through 
nearly the entire original cast from the get smart series 
which ran from 1965 to 70 first on nbc and then on cbs is back 
for the twohour movie on sunday don adams as maxwell smart 
barbara feldon as agent 99 dick gautier as hymie dave ketchum as 
agent 13 robert karvelas as larrabee and king moody as shtarker 
kenneth mars takes over as chief of control in place of edward 
platt who died in 1974 
in get smart again kaos kidnaps a scientist to obtain his 
secret formula for creating a weather machine siegfried and his 
henchman shtarker demand a ransom of 250 billion 
neither kaos nor control stood for anything the way uncle 
for instance stood for united network command for law and 
enforcement on the man from uncle their nemesis was thrush 
kaos ought to stand for kopells acts of comic subversion 
siegfried is more fun than anything ive done in my life 
said kopell i could let loose is there a comedy of anger 
siegfried always appears to be angry in the movie kaos has been 
taken over by a corporate raider which only adds to siegfrieds 
anger and frustration 
get smart was a spoof of james bond and it gave no quarter as 
it milked its laughs from sendups of secret agents disguises 
codes technological gadgets and monolithic intelligence 
organizations the series was created by mel brooks and buck henry 
it was biting incisive and stepped on a few toes said 
kopell we got a couple of good shots at the government it didnt 
pussyfoot around the way some other shows did it took a few swipes 
at some sacred cows 
kopell has been a regular or a recurring character on eight 
series at the same time he was on get smart he was on that 
girl starring marlo thomas 
i never had a contract for either show he said i got to 
know the assistant directors over at that girl and id call over 
and say look im not working tuesday and wednesday and theyd 
set up all my scenes for those days marlo thomas did that girl 
and she was the best boss i ever had she was very generous very 
supportive 
he was also on the steve allen show the danny kaye show 
the doris day show bewitched the love boat and when 
things were rotten the latter in which he played alanadale in 
a robin hood spoof was also created by mel brooks things were 
really rotten because it lasted only a few weeks 
kopell also supplied some of the voices for the saturday morning 
series lancelot link secret chimp a cartoon spoof of james 
bond the good chimps belonged to ape and the bad chimps led by 
the baron kopell belonged to chump 
his longestrunning series and the only time he was ever cast in 
a romantic role was the love boat he played the ships doctor 
adam bricker 
i was always a character actor he said i couldnt believe 
it when i got the role it was wonderful im grateful but i never 
knew how it happened i was cast when dick van patten pulled out 
after doing the pilots to do eight is enough 
kopell credits producer leonard stern with casting him as 
siegfried in get smart 
there was no reason why a 33yearold kid would get the part 
he said but leonard had seen me playing an immigrant in the 49th

sports illustrated didnt invent the concept that covergirls in 
skintight spandex make newsstand sales sizzle that idea dawned on 
magazine editors about the time they perfected glossy pictures 
the spectrum now ranges from four wheeler magazine which once a 
year compliments the bodies of its trucks with bodies of beauties 
to cosmopolitan the womens magazine that thrives on sensuality and 
cleavage 
sex is an attractive commodity if its packaged well said 
cosmopolitans editor helen gurley brown everybody likes to look 
at pretty girls in bathing suits 
and in cosmos business office theres mock surprise sex 
sells nooooooo really said debbie berg making the questioner 
feel like the farm boy caught looking at lingerie in the sears 
catalogue 
fashion designers know it health clubs show it car dealers grow 
on it makers of everything from beer booze and ice cream rake in 
dough on it 
not only does sexy sell which has been true since god created 
women and men theres a wholesomeness possible about sexiness 
said christie hefner empress of playboy enterprises which 
publishes the worlds largest mens magazine its an acceptable 
category of media its bigger than its ever been 
just ask sports illustrated it makes an annual marketing splash 
mixing merchandising and libido by showcasing babyoiled bodies in 
seethrough mesh rather than the normal fare of athletes dressed in 
sweat and grass stains 
the swimsuit issue now marking its 25th anniversary is devoted 
entirely to swimwear for the first time 
this edition may be the best read in the magazines 35year 
history an estimated 41 million people double the average will 
read it including 13 million women triple the norm 
the notion that sex sells has been around since the turn of the 
century when magazines learned they could reproduce a nice 
illustration said david stewart a consumer psychologist and 
professor of marketing at the university of southern california 
you tend to get the opposite sex paying attention to the 
picture but a person of the same sex responding to the copy he 
said women like to emulate what they see they want to know what 
are the beauty secrets 
the swimsuit issue was born during the midwinter sports doldrums 
when a bikiniclad babette march graced the jan 20 1964 cover 
the idea was to help readers weather the dead time between football 
and spring training and to help magazine sales 
the latest one could gross 30 million in sales and spinoffs for 
time inc 
the 25 million street copies are 395 each the 286page issue 
has 118 pages of ads worth over 15 million home box office also 
owned by time inc has a 50minute show on how the issue was made 
and has 600000 orders for a 1999 videocassette about 750000 
calendars at 1095 each are on sale 
the success of bigger sales with smaller suits tempted 
competitors to feature voluptuous women in teensy lycra straining 
against its carnal cargo 
inside sports and sport magazine have copycat versions swimwear 
illustrated and american swimwear exhibit sultry women in suggestive 
apparel supplying order blanks but not bothering with articles 
hot rod magazines swimsuit issue last april pumped circulation 
28 percent to more than 1 million copies four wheeler with an 
audience that is 90 percent male sold 156000 copies or 50 percent 
more than normal with a july swimsuit issue 
we got 17 letters of protest six from women who wrote send 
in the hunks they thought it was too onesided said editor john 
stewart how can sex not sell why shouldnt it sell 
sports illustrateds swimsuit issue gets tons of free publicity 
good and bad 
it was recently spoofed in the doonesbury cartoon strip dick 
bradley a cartoonist for the buffalo news once depicted hugh 
hefner holding the issue and saying actually i read it because 
of the interesting ah articles 
on the flip side critics blister the jock journal for 
sexploitation 
its about presenting women as bimbos what is a sports 
magazine doing publishing pornographic pictures of women said 
mary jo kane professor of sport management at bowling green state 
university 
i wish theyd spend half as much time presenting women as 
serious athlethes instead of playboy bunnies they wouldnt get away 
with it if they put stereotypes of racism or antisemitism on their 
cover she said 
it borrows from pornography it reduces women to a collection 
of body parts its a damaging presentation of women said norma 
ramos general counsel for women against pornography 
the swimsuit issue gets censored from school library shelves 
offensive indecent and chauvinistic was the review from 
kenneth roetzel superintendent of schools in new danube minn who 
removed it in 1985 in a letter to sports illustrated he said it 
stooped to the moral depths of playboy and penthouse 
the debate can even place columnists from the same paper on 
opposite sides 
sis swimsuit issue is little more than a euphemism for soft 
porn playboy before the public revolution it is the girlie 
magazine men figure they can buy without offending their wives 
wrote kathleen parker of the orlando fla sentinel 
but the papers sports columnist brian schmitz preferred models 
over basketball players he wrote id rather look at christie 
brinkley in her underwear than kevin mchale in his

the boeing co paid a 125000 fine in early 1988 
that was assessed by the federal aviation administration for the 
companys failure to properly inspect selflocking nuts used in its 
airplanes a company spokesman confirmed thursday 
after becoming aware of the defective parts the company 
tightened its specifications for manufacturing and testing the 
particular kind of selflocking nut involved boeing spokesman tom 
cole said 
the fine was the largest ever assessed against boeing for a 
qualitycontrol violation he said 
cole said the nuts are used in various parts of the airplanes 
including flightcontrol systems for the rudder and wing flaps 
he said there have been no boeing planes involved in accidents or 
incidents related to failure of the defective parts that he was 
aware of failure of the selflocking nuts would be unlikely to 
cause a serious problem because of backup systems built into the 
planes cole said 
boeing learned in 1985 that some of the nuts in planes delivered 
to customers did not meet specifications for torquing and locking 
cole said the company sent service bulletins to the customers and 
the faa issued airworthiness directives ordering airlines to check 
the nuts and replace them if necessary 
cole said boeing didnt blame the manufacturers who supplied the 
defective parts since it was boeings specifications that needed to 
be revised 
cole said boeing 767s were involved in the inspections but that 
the selflocking nuts are used on all types of planes the company 
manufactures he said the company paid four other fines of a few 
thousand dollars each for lesser qualitycontrol violations 
when we find things wrong we report it to the faa and take 
steps to correct it cole said

employees expecting medical benefits after 
retirement may wind up with drastically reduced health plans or none 
at all if a controversial accounting rule is enacted 
the financial accounting standards board on thursday proposed a 
new procedure that would force us companies to deduct billions of 
dollars in annual profits to account for medical and insurance 
benefits to be paid to employees after they retire 
but the proposed rules scheduled to take effect in 1992 could 
wipe out the earnings of many companies forcing some to reduce or 
discontinue benefits analysts said 
such cutbacks could affect millions of employees 
a 1988 survey by the wyatt co consulting firm of more than 2200 
employers showed that 54 percent of all employers offer medical 
benefits to retired workers twentyone percent of the companies 
pick up the entire tab while 74 percent of the retirees pay less 
than half of their bills 
the impact of the proposed rules would vary but probably would 
affect larger companies more than smaller ones said harry don a 
clevelandbased groupbenefit consultant for wyatt co 
there are moderatesized companies out there who will go from a 
profit position to a loss position this will more than wipe out 
their reported profits don said 
current accounting rules do not obligate companies to report 
estimated retiree benefit expenses or to reserve money for them 
they only have to report such expenses as they are paid 
but the new rule which has been in the works for a decade 
would require companies to deduct from their earnings enough money 
for a special reserve that would cover the estimated benefit 
expenses 
fasb a governmentsanctioned authority for setting accounting 
standards acknowledges that retirement benefits are the biggest 
liability for some companies yet they are not recognized in most 
financial statements 
the proposal would require companies to set up a reserve to cover 
retiree benefit costs companies would set aside funds when an 
employee begins working and would add to the reserve until the 
employee becomes eligible for retirement generally at age 55 
there also would be a reserve to make up for past years that 
companies did not set aside funds 
most companies have not set up such reserves because unlike 
pension costs other retirement benefits arent deductible from 
taxable income 
but ltv corp last november announced it was taking a 226 
billion charge for what it anticipates will be its potential health 
insurance cost liability for 118000 current and retired employees 
and earlier this month corning glass works announced an 84 million 
aftertax charge to account for retiree medical benefits 
fasb chairman dennis r beresford said the new rule would make 
financial statements more informative and complete and would enhance 
disclosure 
it will require companies to publicly acknowledge their 
existing commitments to investors and other users of financial 
statements who in turn can evaluate the implications of those 
promises beresford told a news conference 
he also said the proposed accounting would not change the nature 
or cost of current pension promises 
with medical costs soaring at an average rate of 20 percent a 
year the potential benefit liability of us corporations is 
staggering 
the employee benefit research institute a nonprofit 
organization in washington estimates that nongovernmental 
employers owe at least 1687 billion in retiree health benefits 
assuming medical inflation is brought under control the general 
accounting office puts the figure at over 200 billion 
those benefits may have been granted on the assumption that the 
costs would be relatively minor and could be paid for quite easily 
out of current cash flow and current earnings as they were 
incurred beresford said 
some companies already are looking closely at how to minimize 
their retiree health insurance costs by restricting or eliminating 
such benefits 
employer groups are preparing to fight the rule which could end 
up before congress and be dramatically modified by the time the 
battle is over said lee seidler an accounting specialist and 
senior managing director of bear stearns amp co 
seidler believes the debate will postpone enactment of the rules 
until at least 1995 and by then the impact will be dramatically 
reduced 
fasb will modify this thing companies will reduce benefits to 
employees and congress will allow them to take money from overfunded 
pension funds and put it in underfunded health funds that will 
relieve the impact seidler said 
companies will have six months to comment on the draft fasb 
proposal public hearings will follow in october and november in new 
york and washington and a final rule is expected in late 1990

kohlberg kravis roberts inc is in the final 
stages of its record 2453 billion acquisition of rjr nabisco inc 
having completed an epic tender offer for the food and tobacco giant 
kohlberg kravis said it was tendered more than 2166 million 
shares or approximately 972 percent of rjr nabiscos outstanding 
common stock by the time its 109pershare offer expired thursday 
the investment firm is undertaking the largest us corporate 
acquisition ever the next largest would be the 134 billion 
purchase of gulf oil corp by chevron corp in 1984 
as rjr nabisco shares changed hands thursday so did control of 
the conglomerate which makes such wellknown products as winston 
and camel cigarettes and oreo cookies 
company president f ross johnson defeated by kohlberg kravis in 
the takeover fight resigned as expected and was replaced by j paul 
sticht a former chairman of rjr industries inc rjr industries 
merged with nabisco brands inc in 1985 to form rjr nabisco 
johnson left praising the people who beat him i feel the 
company is in good hands he said in a statement issued by 
kohlberg kravis 
it was johnson who instigated the bidding war for rjr nabisco 
with the announcement oct 20 that a management group he led was tendered 
nearly 12 million 
shares or approximately 95 percent of rjr nabiscos preferred 
stock those shares would be paid for on friday the firm said 
ruth pachman a spokeswoman for kohlberg kravis said it was not 
immediately known when the firm would complete the acquisition 
because it must obtain federal approval for the new securities 
before it can close the deal 
after the acquisition is completed kohlberg kravis must begin to 
divest several food lines to comply with an order from the federal 
trade commission 
in clearing the rjr nabisco purchase earlier this month the ftc 
said kohlberg kravis must sell competing lines of oriental foods 
packaged nuts and ketchup produced by either rjr or another kohlberg 
kravis unit beatricehuntwesson inc 
kohlberg kravis will have a year to sell the product lines until 
the divestiture is completed it must run rjr nabisco as a separate 
operation 
kravis on thursday reiterated his companys intention to sell 6 
billion in food businesses over the next 18 months to help finance 
the deal which relies heavily on the use of highinterest junk 
bonds 
the purchase of rjr nabisco is a leveraged buyout in which a 
company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with 
money raised by asset sales or the companys cash flow 
the size of the rjr nabisco deal has prompted criticism of lbos 
in general and a series of congressional hearings about whether they 
should be curtailed

when it came to the budget bush did not claim to have the final 
solution 
he said he and his team are ready to work with the congress to 
form a special leadership group to negotiate in good faith to work 
day and night if thats what it takes 
there were discouraging words for the president from democrats 
who vowed to fight any cuts in medicare and rep dan rostenkowski 
said he would use his chairmanship of the house ways and means 
committee to contest cuts in the capital gains tax 
not all republican were entirely pleased either 
its not immediately apparent how all those initiative are 
going to be paid for even with the defense freeze maybe that will 
become apparent tomorrow said sen gordon humphrey rnh 
one democrat sen dale bumpers of arkansas chided bush for 
straying too far from conservative doctrine 
its a much kinder gentler budget his speech could have been 
delivered by any democrat he saidhis problem will be getting 
it through his party ours will go along with 70 or 80 per cent of 
it 
bush said his predecessor had wrought improvements in eight years 
i dont propose to reverse direction he said we are 
headed the right way nonetheless he proposed a string of 
initiatives that indicated shifts from some of the positions of the 
reagan administration 
among his proposals 
increased spending of 22 billion over reagans budget for 
basic research 
enactment of urban enterprise zone legislation to revitalize 
inner cities 
an increase of almost 1 billion for the war on drugs coupled 
with this threat to the drug pushers if you are caught and 
convicted you will do time he repeated his campaign call for the 
death penalty for the worst kingpins 
environmental initiatives including funding for a clean coal 
technology agreement with canada an improved clean air act with 
specific deadlines for reducing acid rain and new acquisitions under 
the land and water conservation fund he also called for indefinite 
postponement of two oil lease sales off the california coast and a 
third in florida 
in a bow to antiabortionists bush proposed a tax deduction of 
up to 3000 for parents who adopt a child 
he also called on congress to enact his savings and loan industry 
rescue plan within 45 days 
and he called for a host of changes in budgeting including 
several that have been rejected before including a constitutional 
amendment to balance the budget a law permitting the president to 
veto individual items in appropriations bills he recommended other 
steps to strengthen his hand in budget negotiations with congress 
as well 
bush also said he favors statehood for puerto rico but called on 
congress to establish a referendum to allow the people of the 
commonwealth to decide

retired civil servants wont like what george 
bushs kinder gentler america has in store for them but other 
citizens from drug addicts seeking treatment to couples adopting 
children may find hope in the presidents 1990 budget blueprint 
for veterans the president asked congress in a nationally 
broadcast address thursday night to retain a 1 percent origination 
fee on va housing loans but dropped former president reagans 
proposed boost in the mortgage fee to 38 percent 
bushs proposal to extend the 3 percent federal excise tax on 
local and longdistance phone calls will come as only the smallest 
of surprises to those who read bushs lips during the 1988 
presidential campaign bush pledged no new taxes but didnt say 
anything about expiring ones 
like reagan the president offered a bitter pill to federal 
retirees including military pensioners a 1990 pension freeze that 
would save taxpayers 14 billion 
bush also would ban federal retirees from collecting a portion of 
their benefits in a lumpsum that now averages nearly 30000 
in 1991 and beyond bush would limit the retirees raises to the 
costofliving minus 1 percentage point reagan himself now a 
federal pensioner also sought those cuts 
but the nations 38 million social security beneficiaries due 
for roughly a 36 percent increase in january 1990 would not be 
asked to sacrifice 
social security is fully funded including a full 
costofliving adjustment we must honor our contract bush said 
to keep campaign promises bush asked for a 149 million increase 
in the 12 billion head start budget to enroll up to 95000 more 
4yearolds in the preschool readiness program a onethird 
increase in that age group but advocates say more than 2 million 
poor prekindergarten children are eligible for head start and 
currently there are places for only 453000 
working poor families with infants and toddlers would benefit 
from another budget plank lifted intact from the bush campaign a 
new tax credit of up to 1000 per child under age 4 
this credit would be refundable to families that dont pay income 
taxes and would be phased out for families with incomes between 
8000 and 13000 in 1990 
bush also wants to tinker with the tax code to spur adoptions 
i propose to reenact the tax deduction for adoption expenses and 
to double it to 3000 he said 
he would pump more than a quarterbillion dollars extra into the 
war on drugs already slated for a sizable increase in the final 
reagan budget all told the bush administration sought 55 billion 
to wage the fight against drugs 974 million or 21 percent more 
than in the current budget 
among the increases 127 million or 24 percent more for drug 
treatment including a 25 million grant to reduce the waiting time 
for admission to treatment programs 
victims of crime might be helped by bushs request to increase a 
federal compensation fund to 125 million from 94 million 
he proposed a variety of incentives for americas students and 
teachers including the first 30 million toward an eventual 500 
million presidential merit schools program and new awards of 
5000 apiece to 1200 teachers 
top high school seniors in science and math could compete for 570 
college scholarships worth up to 10000 a year 
americans also might learn more about themselves and their 
economy under bushs blueprint he wants to more than double to 16 
billion the budget for gathering economic and demographic statistics 
while bush shelved a reagan plan to cut more than 1 billion from 
medicaid payments to states he still hopes to pare medicares 
budget by 5 billion 
bush said his medicaid budget would expand coverage to pregnant 
women and infants up to 185 percent of the poverty line and poor 
children up to age 8 he also wants to allow poor families to get 
immunizations for children under 6 simply by showing a food stamp 
card at clinics 
for the homeless bush proposed fullfunding of the mckinney act 
which would boost spending from 500 million to 644 million and he 
wants to launch a new 50 million initiative to help move homeless 
families out of welfare hotels and improve services for the mentally 
ill 
and every young american would be challenged to perform voluntary 
service under the aegis of bushs proposed yes to america 
foundation the government would provide matching grants of 25 
million a year for four years

the exchange plans to hold several smaller meetings with traders 
over the next three weeks to further explain the system before 
putting it to a vote of the 3500 members on march 2 according to 
traders who attended thursdays meeting 
also on thursday bot president thomas donovan said exchange 
officials have withdrawn tentative plans to restrict or eliminate 
dual trading after they were flooded with complaints from members 
dual trading allows members to trade both for themselves and for 
customers 
sources at the exchange said board of trade chairman karsten 
mahlmann told members the proposed electronic trading system was 
designed to give foreign investors access to the exchanges 
financial futures especially its us treasury bond futures market

but industry experts said the proposed move into computerizedke globex 
the system would be open to other futures 
exchanges that wish to list their products for trading the new york 
mercantile exchange and the sydney futures exchange of australia 
have already indicated they will list some of their products on 
globex 
but unlike globex the board of trade system would be developed 
and owned entirely by the exchange and its members 
exchange officials did not provide a cost estimate of the 
proposed system traders said

the lexus name for toyota motor corps new luxury 
car division will be history if a federal appeals court rules 
against it in a lawsuit a company official says 
well have to change our name lexus general manager dave 
illingworth said thursday in the event the us circuit court of 
appeal in new york rules against it in a lawsuit brought by mead 
data central inc of dayton ohio 
mead data contends the car maker is illegally diluting the name 
of its lexis legalinformation retrieval service 
illingworth who took control of the lexus division last month 
after jim perkins returned to general motors corp said he expects 
a ruling from the new york court by the end of the month but if the 
automaker loses there will be no appeal to the supreme court he 
added 
he said the timing of the launch of the lexus line consisting 
for now of two sedans requires that a name be in place by the time 
the cars are delivered to showrooms this fall 
also illingworth said i think its very doubtful that the 
supreme court would hear this case 
the process for choosing another name has begun he said but no 
alternative name has been selected he said he was aware of no 
settlement negotiations going on but that toyota always has wanted 
to resolve the case out of court 
if the court rules against lexus and the name is dropped 
illingworth said two years from now nobody will even remember 
the old name 
during the course of the lawsuit possible settlements had been 
drafted by mead data and toyota but those will not be resurrected 
illingworth said 
company officials have declined to say how much money is tied up 
in the lexus name but that it is the millions of dollars 
we arent that unbusinesslike that we havent made plans in 
case that something unfortunate happens illingworth said were 
fully prepared to make an adjustment and continue 
lexus plans to sell japanesemade cars costing between 20000 
and 40000 in the united states this fall but before that happens 
illingworth said he expected a decision on a battle with mead data 
mead data sued toyota last year claiming that lexus diluted the 
name of its legalinformation retrieval service lexis a federal 
judge in new york agreed and in december ordered lexus to stop using 
the name 
the automaker won a stay in the appellate court which last heard 
arguments jan 30 it has not said when it plans a ruling

president bush is asking congress to enact 
hundreds of millions of dollars in new tax breaks aimed at 
stimulating the struggling oil and gas industry and easing the 
countrys growing dependence on oil imports 
sufficient energy supplies at reasonable prices are vital to 
the economic wellbeing of this country and to the preservation of 
our national security bush said in remarks accompanying his 1990 
budget 
he called thursday for full decontrol of natural gas a 
reexamination of offshore oil drilling projects in several 
environmentally sensitive areas and four separate tax incentives 
aimed at finding new oil and gas fields and reclaiming old ones 
he said tax incentives can give the domestic oil and gas 
industry the necessary stimulus particularly to the small 
producers who are so vital to our energy security historically 
independent producers have drilled a majority of americas 
exploratory wells 
bush however called an oil import fee protectionist and said it 
amounts to a tax increase on all energy users 
his four tax incentives would encourage exploration of new oil 
and gas fields and reclamation of old fields and would be phased 
out if the price of oil reaches 21 a barrel 
the spot price for west texas crude the benchmark oil closed at 
1740 thursday 
charles j dibona president of the american petroleum institute 
called the tax incentives a step in the right direction but they 
alone cannot stem the serious decline in domestic petroleum 
production 
other steps are required including opening to exploration 
promising federal lands on shore in alaska and off shore in 
california and florida he said 
therefore it was gratifying to hear once again the president 
endorse access to the coastal plain off the arctic national wildlife 
refuge in alaska dibona said 
bushs budget would allow new drilling in selected offshore areas 
and in the alaska wildlife refuge 
the api however would be concerned about unnecessary delays 
in offshore leasing and believes a prompt review of offshore 
leasing would show that exploration and production is 
environmentally safe and should be permitted to proceed dibona 
said 
while welcomed by another industry official the measures must 
still clear a congress wrestling with a budget deficit and not known 
for rushing to the industrys defense 
its going to take work youve got a budget deficit thats a 
black hole and its difficult to give tax incentives to jr ewing 
thats how it plays in the public mind said barney white a vice 
president of corporate affairs at zapata corp in houston an oil 
drilling contractor founded by the president 
wells have been shut down because the costs of production exceed 
returns with the number of rigs falling from more than 4000 in 
1981 to less than 1000 today some 150000 jobs have been lost 
since 1986 and domestic production fell from 91 million barrels a 
day to little more than 81 billion a day 
bushs package includes a tax credit on intangible drilling 
costs those not directly associated with drilling a well such as 
hauling equipment the measure is expected to reduce revenues to the 
us treasury by 200 million in fiscal 1990 300 million in 1991 
and 1992 and 400 million in 1993 
he also recommends a tax credit for capital expenditures on all 
new tertiary enhanced recovery projects those that use steam 
carbon dioxide or chemical injectants to remove oil and gas from 
fields the measure is expected to reduce revenues by 50 million or 
less a year 
tax incentives are proposed to encourage exploration for 
independent producers at an anticipated cost to the government of 
100 million a year 
another element of the plan seeks to change oil and gas depletion 
rules that discourage the transfer of marginal wells to independent 
producers and result in the premature abandonment of producing 
wells the loss of federal revenues is estimated at 50 million or 
less annually

the figure came in well above advance estimates on wall street 
and touched off new concerns on wall street about the inflation

speculation quickly intensified about whether and when the 
federal reserve might tighten credit further in its campaign against 
inflation 
prices of longterm government bonds which move in the opposite

wholesale prices skyrocketed at an annual rate 
of 127 percent in january the biggest monthly surge in more than 
three years the government said today 
the labor department said the steepest increase in food prices in 
a year combined with the largest rise in energy prices in two years 
to push up the producer price index 10 percent last month 
analysts said the rise in food prices partly was due to 
aftereffects of last summers drought while recent increases in 
crude oil prices have pushed up energy costs but the report also 
showed strong increases in a variety of other categories 
the report signals that the economy has launched into another 
significant racheting upward of inflation said economist allen 
sinai of the boston co there was no comfort in this inflation 
report anywhere 
it was the biggest increase since an identical surge in october 
1985 the index hasnt risen faster in a single month since april 
1981 when it shot up 11 percent 
the large gain surprised analysts who were expecting a moderate 
03 percent to 04 percent increase 
dirk van dongen president of the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors called the report very troublesome 
with rising prices at the intermediate and crude levels likely to 
trickle down into further increases for finished goods weve got 
some high numbers ahead of us van dongen said 
economist robert brusca of nikko securities co international 
inc predicted in advance of the report that any increase 
substantially higher than 04 percent could roil financial markets 
in december wholesale prices climbed at half the january rate 
a still brisk 05 percent that was revised up from an earlier 
estimate of 04 percent 
for all of 1988 the producer price index rose 40 percent the 
steepest climb in seven years and nearly double the 22 percent 
increase posted in 1987 economists are looking for a slightly 
faster rate of increase this year 
energy prices at the finished goods level led by an 116 percent 
jump in home heating oil climbed 49 percent last month it was the 
largest boost since energy cost rose 72 percent in january 1987 
crude oil prices have climbed about 3 to more than 17 a barrel 
over the last several months but many analysts had predicted that 
unusually warm winter weather would hold any heating oil increases 
in check 
wholesale gasoline prices rose 41 percent last month after 
falling 31 percent in december natural gas increased 48 percent 
after rising 33 percent a month earlier 
the price of food one stop short of the retail level climbed 11 
percent the biggest jump since january 1988 
egg prices alone soared 201 percent and pork prices jumped 114 
percent 
goods other than food and energy collectively increased a 
moderate 04 percent there were however some sharp increases in 
individual catagories including prescription and overthecounter 
medicines magazines household electrical equipment flatware toys 
and games and automobiles 
the auto increase had been expected as car dealers phased out 
incentive programs 
the overall january increase left the producer price index for 
finished goods at 1110 meaning a hypothetical selection of goods 
costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 111 last month 1 more than 
in december 
price indexes for goods at the intermediate level of production 
and for crude goods show more inflation in the pipeline 
intermediate goods rose 09 percent the steepest monthly 
increase in nearly eight years while crude goods shot up 39 
percent the most since august 1980 crude goods rose 34 percent in 
december but those prices fell for three consecutive months prior 
to that 
the heated pace of inflation in the report was likely to raise 
concern at the federal reserve board which has been pushing up 
interest rates in an effort to slow the economy and dampen inflation 
last month fed chairman alan greenspan warned congress that the 
central banks policy would lean toward higher interest rates so 
long as labor markets remained tight and factory capacity was 
strained 
the unemployment rate of 54 percent last month is near a 14year 
low pushing wages up in some areas of the country use of factory 
capacity is at a decade high 
januarys higher wholesale numbers the first inflation report of 
president bushs term will likely be seen as disturbing news at the 
white house 
administration policymakers are counting on lower inflation to 
help bush hold the federal budget deficit down and keep his no new 
taxes pledge 
the nation will get its first look at inflation on the consumer 
level which includes imports and services when the labor 
department releases it consumer price index on feb 22 
david wyss an analyst with data resources inc a lexington 
mass forecasting firm warned that more food price increases may 
be ahead particularly for meat 
we had all that heavy slaughtering in the fall after the 
drought and now of course were running out of beef he said 
meanwhile lack of rain east of the rocky mountains is shriveling 
the winter wheat crop 
its no big deal yet but its not an encouraging start to 
the year wyss said

top administration officials today emphasized 
president bushs willingness to negotiate with congress over details 
of his 116 trillion budget while democrats said the white house 
had underestimated next years deficit by 20 billion 
were trying to work with the congress to resolve the tough 
issues budget director richard darman said in an nbc interview 
the morning after bushs nationally televised address to both houses 
of congress 
added white house chief of staff john sununu now i realize 
congress may try and suggest it cant be done but i think were 
ready to sit down negotiate and work with whatever slight 
differences they might have on the budget to fulfill our commitment 
to the american people 
how slight the differences turn out to be wont be known for 
several days as democrats sift through the details of bushs plan 
calling for no new taxes increases in scattered domestic programs 
such as education the environment and the war on drugs and a 26 
billion curtailment in the defense budget that president reagan 
bequeathed him 
democrats reacted cordially but warily to bushs proposals at 
first although the presidents call for a cut in the capital gains 
tax was criticized by several lawmakers 
but after a night of crunching numbers senate democrats issued a 
report claiming that bushs spending plan underestimated the deficit 
by 20 billion they said the administration had relied on overly 
optimistic assumptions about the economy 
bush says his plan would result in a deficit for the 1990 fiscal 
year of 948 billion not counting the proceeds from the sale of 
certain federal assets the democrats said the figure was really 
115 billion 
bush himself left budget politics aside in favor of a brief trip 
to canada but white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters 
the president was very pleased with the initial reaction 
fitzwater said that the main thing is to sit down and start 
talking on forging a bipartisan budget agreement 
we have every reason to believe the democrats will want to be 
encouraging about negotiations fitzwater said 
that was in line with bushs offer made in his speech to work 
day and night if necessary to tackle the deficit 
the people didnt send us here to bicker the new president 
said thursday night in a nationally televised speech before a joint 
session of the house and senate its time to govern 
initial democratic reaction to the new president and his 116 
trillion budget was cordial but wary republicans cheered when he 
renewed his campaign call for a cut in capital gains taxes most 
democrats sat silently in their seats 
fights also are likely over bushs proposed 5 billion cut in the 
medicare insurance program for the elderly and his renewed 
commitment to the star wars missile defense program 
democrats promised cooperation and left it at that 
that does not mean obedience it does mean our honest help and 
our very best advice said speaker jim wright of texas who 
presides over a house with a 261175 democratic majority 
senate republican leader bob dole termed the presidents budget 
blueprint not the final answer its the starting point he 
added congress can swat it away or it can grasp the presidents 
hand in the true spirit of cooperation 
the bush budget envisions a deficit of 911 billion beneath the 
100 billion mandated in the federal antideficit law but bushs 
deficit figure is predicated on rosy economic assumptions carried 
over from the reagan administration assumptions of continued 
strong growth that many economists question 
the presidents speech was not a state of the union address in 
the literal sense but it served as one from the pageantry of a 
house chamber filled with lawmakers the diplomatic corps supreme 
court justices and hundreds of guests to the breadth of his remarks 
we americans have only begun our mission of goodness and 
greatness he concluded 
bush said he would proceed with caution in his dealings with 
the soviet union but said we will not miss any opportunity for 
peace he vowed to work for the elimination of chemical weapons 
and said he would stand firm for democracy in nicaragua and 
elsewhere in central america 
the new president called for trimming 26 billion from president 
reagans final pentagon budget adding a few programs for education 
aid to the homeless and the environment all areas that fit in his 
campaign promise of a kinder gentler nation 
however his overall education budget would fail to keep up with 
inflation and his childcare credit is limited to only the poorest 
of families those making 10000 a year or less 
he urged enactment of measures to revitalize inner cities 
declared a fiercer war on drugs and took a page from jesse jacksons 
campaign text when he said to kids living in the inner cities 
keep hope alive 
bushs pentagon spending plan calls for an increase next year 
that would allow spending to rise with inflation but no higher 
after that increases above inflation will be required he said 
in their immediate postmortems on thursday night republicans 
and democrats alike predicted that bushs spending blueprint would 
pave the way for negotiations with congress 
the bush budget is a tough one giving first priority to deficit 
reduction rep bill frenzel of minnesota senior republican on 
the house budget committee said it will be subject to lots of 
negotiation but it is an important step toward a deficit solution 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who joined wright in delivering the 
official democratic response said his party will work with the 
president that doesnt mean we wont disagree therell be some 
sharp principled disagreements among democrats and republicans over 
one of the greatest challenges america has ever faced he said

governments lawyers to keep it secret for 20 days the government 
argued that media attention would adversely affect the fdics 
ability to collect the money 
lance said friday he had not seen a copy of the suit 
however i feel i must comment to the extent that over the 
course of the last four years i have made significant payments and 
goodfaith efforts to pay all my debts in full he said 
i have not made any efforts to compromise any debt for less 
than the full amount but because of certain disputes about the 
application of payments i have been unable to come to any 
agreement those disputes were not about my willingness to pay any 
debt that was due in full 
he added i consider it unfortunate that the fdic took the 
action it took but i remain determined to stand up for the rights i 
believe i ought to have i am hopeful we can resolve our differences 
as soon as possible 
lance declined to talk about the kris company inc saying it was 
a personal company 
the tennessee banking commissioner assumed control of united 
american bank six years ago and the fdic later took over various 
uab loans including the ones to lance and the kris company 
the fdic suit listed four notes with principal balances of 
348816 196656 227531 and 474664 totaling 1247667 the 
government also is seeking accrued interest as of jan 20 and per 
diem interest since then 
lance and the company were given 10 days to pay the 1509000 
before the amount is increased by 15 percent for attorneys fees 
fdic lawyers said 
the lawyers also asked murphy for control of the real property 
used to secure the loans but no action has been taken on that 
request 
lance was a calhoun banker and former commissioner of the georgia 
department of transportation when he was named white house budget 
director after fellow georgian jimmy carter was elected president in 
1976 he resigned in september 1977 amid allegations about his 
banking practices 
three years ago lance agreed to pay a fine of 50000 and not 
work at any federally insured bank in a settlement resulting from 
charges of bank fraud brought against him by the federal office of 
the comptroller of the currency

after a year of booming domestic sales and further 
declines in exports japanese automakers are introducing a fistful 
of new models and boosting overseas production to try to capture 
more of the global car market 
toyota nissan honda mitsubishi and mazda all saw increased 
sales in japan last year but reported sluggish exports largely due 
to the continued high value of the yen 
exports which fell 32 percent in 1988 are expected to continue 
dwindling this year but not just because of the strong yen which 
makes japanese products more expensive overseas 
while shipments to europe continue to be firm exports to the 
united states will encounter a more highly competitive environment 
due to a gradual downturn in the american economy nissan 
president yutaka kume said in january 
japanese companies produce about 29 percent of the worlds autos 
according to statistics compiled by the motor vehicle manufacturing 
association of america and japan automobile manfacturing association 
half of the 127 million cars trucks and buses made in japan in 
1988 were exported in 1987 the last year for which comparative 
figures are available 122 million motor vehicles were made in 
japan well ahead of 109 million produced in the united states 
exchange rates and continuing restrictions on exports to the 
united states have led japanese automakers to make the 1980s the 
decade of transplanting or producing autos in the markets where 
they will be sold 
the voluntary export quotas were imposed beginning in fiscal 1981 
to give us automakers breathing room to recover from growing 
japanese competition but the japanese have responded by relocating 
production overseas they already have established eight factories 
in north america and have fallen short of their 23 million 
vehicle annual quota in each of the last two years 
expansion planned for this year in north america would bring 
transplant output to about 1 million cars annually with expected 
growth to 2 million within two years 
transplants are crucial to lessening trade friction and they 
are also an intelligent alternative to exports which have become 
increasingly problematic due to yen appreciation said koji endo 
a nomura securities analyst in a february report on the auto 
industry 
automakers also have a strong base in the everhungry domestic 
market which grew a phenomenal 10 percent in 1988 and it continues 
to be fueled by vigorous consumption increasing personal income and 
leisure time more new models and high turnover of private cars 
toyota which is aiming for 10 percent of the world market this 
year is opening production in the philippines and a joint venture 
with volkswagen in west germany overseas production is expected to 
surge 82 percent in 1989 and toyotas joint venture with general 
motors corp new united motor manufacturing in california foresees 
80 percent growth this year 
this fall toyota will market its new lexus in an attmept to 
further penetrate the us market for luxury cars in the 20000 
40000 range 
nissan has the same strategy with two new cars under the infiniti 
label which will be marketed this year to challenge mercedes bmw 
and jaguar 
we have an image in the united states as a cheap truck maker 
so were introducing the entirely new infiniti sales network to shed 
that image nissans kume said in an interview 
last year nissan saw overall exports tumble 112 percent 
including a 365 percent plunge in the us export market japans 
biggest 
but nissan is banking on a slew of new models to boost exports 
and increase transplant production the fourdoor maxima and 
twodoor silvia sports car have debuted in recent months and the 
infiniti models will join them in the united states 
nissan will expand overseas production 151 percent this year and 
the automaker will expand its smyrna tenn plant by 1990 to build 
two new models for the us market 
honda the topselling japanese car in the united states started 
japans luxurycar assault with its acura legend in 1986 last year 
it began importing to japan cars it produced in ohio and plans to 
increase such imports tenfold to 50000 annually by 1991 
hondas production overseas this year will be little changed 
although it will inaugurate production of the fivedoor concerto 
developed jointly with the austin rover group in britain 
mazda motor plans to keep production at 122 million cars 
lowering exports but raising production at its us plant in 
michigan by more than 50 percent mazda does not reveal its global 
production figures 
president norimasa furuta told reporters in january that the 
automaker would continue developing oversears projects and examine 
new ventures with its longtime business partner ford motor co 
mazda produces fordbadged cars in japan for sale here and export 
elsewhere in asia it also is introducing a lightweight twoseat 
sports car this year in japan and the united states 
mitsubishi motors also expects lower exports but predicts a 475 
jump in overseas production this year including its joint 
diamondstar motors venture with chrysler corp 
fuji heavy industries and isuzu motors joint venture 
subaruisuzu automotive goes online in indiana this september

the us dollar rallied in late european trading 
friday after news of a higherthanexpected january us producer 
price index rekindled speculation of a rise in us interest rates 
gold prices fell 
the dollar initially weakened because of market disappointment 
that president george bushs projected deficit for fiscal 1990 
turned out to be little different from the reagan administrations 
projection last month 
however afternoon news that the us producer price index rose 1 
percent far higher than an expected 04percent rise triggered a 
dollar rally 
traders reasoned that the price rises meant the us federal 
reserve bank would raise interest rates to stop inflationary 
pressures and this prospect made the dollar attractive 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar closed sharply lower at 12765 yen down 174 yen from 
thursdays close of 12939 yen later in london it was quoted 
higher at 12815 yen

the securities industry association said friday 
it would file suit to block the federal reserve board from 
broadening the power of commercial banks to deal in securities 
the association representing nearly 600 stock brokerages and 
investment banks in the united states and canada intends to file 
suit later this month to overturn the feds decision enabling bank 
holding companies to underwrite corporate debt and equity on a 
limited basis according to a statement by sia president edward i 
obrien and the groups chairman hardwick simons 
the suit will be filed in the us court of appeals in 
washington dc 
in a ruling last month fed governors voted to allow banks to 
underwrite corporate debt through affiliates but severely limited 
the amount of underwriting the subsidiaries may handle 
the ruling was significant because it continued the evolution in 
the banking industrys financial powers 
the distinctions between the securities business and commercial 
banking spelled out in the depressionera glasssteagall act have 
blurred over time as each of the two industries have been granted 
permission to expand their services the fed increasingly has taken 
the lead in giving banks broader powers as congress generally has 
not done so 
the sia suit will attempt to persuade the court that the feds 
action was a dangerous piecemeal undermining of the safety 
barriers of the nearly 55year old glasssteagall the statement 
we believe the nations law should be amended if necessary by 
congress not by regulatory and administrative organizations such 
as the federal reserve the statement read 
legal issues aside it is absurd to let banks risk their 
capital in the volatile securities market at the very time they are 
still struggling with the developingnations debt problems and the 
economythreatening problems of the thrift industry they stated

the cable companies united artists communications 
inc and united cable television corp have agreed on new terms for 
their oftendelayed billiondollar merger sweetening the amount of 
cash available to united cable shareholders 
analysts and company officials estimated the deal which would 
create the nations thirdlargest cable company would be worth 16 
billion to 17 billion united cable also has an estimated 600 
million in debt 
the new company to be called united artists entertainment co 
would have about 24 million basic subscribers placing it behind 
only telecommunications inc and american television and 
communications inc a time inc unit 
the revised terms disclosed late thursday are subject to approval 
by the companies boards and approval of the board of 
telecommunications inc which owns stakes in both and would have 
52 percent to 55 percent of the new company 
the revised plan boosts by 350 a share to 3850 the amount of 
cash that will be available for about half of united cables common 
stock 
united cable has about 44 million shares of fullydiluted common 
stock and about 41 percent is held by either united cable or 
telecommunications 
the revised plan would give a combination of stock and rights to 
sell the stock under certain condition conditions in exchange for 
each of the remaining shares of united cable stock the same terms 
as were proposed previously 
united artists communications stock would be swapped on a 
oneforone basis for stock in the new company the same as in the 
earlier plan 
in midday trading on the new york stock exchange united cable 
was up 12 cents a share at 37 united artists communications was 
unchanged at 3075 a share in national overthecounter trading 
the companies first announced plans to merge in a stock 
transaction oct 18 1987 but the deal was called off two days 
later in the wake of the oct 19 stock market crash 
a new merger agreement was announced in march 1988 and amended in 
september but the companies disclosed jan 31 they would be unable 
to meet a feb 28 completion deadline because of regulatory delays 
analysts had speculated united cable would seek a higher price 
because prices being paid for cable systems have continued 
increasing sharply 
john tinker an analyst at morgan stanley amp co in new york said 
the extra cash should allow the deal to be completed 
there has been a sweetener and that will make it a lot easier 
all around he said he noted the two companies already are 
sharing office space in denver and said it would be hard for the 
deal not to go through 
in announcing the latest revision the companies said the new 
deadline for completing the merger is may 31 
this agreement will benefit all parties involved and should aid 
us in completing our merger in a timely fashion stewart blair 
president and chief executive of united artists and gene schneider 
chairman and chief executive of united cable said in a joint 
statement 
in addition to its cable interests united artists operates one 
of the nations largest motion picture theater chains

a seedy member of the turnip family has caught the attention of 
midwestern farmers who contemplate competing with canadians in the 
growing market for canola and the cooking oil squeezed from its 
seeds 
us citizens already consume canadian canola seed in such 
products as puritan cooking oil said jack ferris at michigan state 
universitys agriculture economics department 
its low in saturated fats its marketable there seems to be 
a growing interest in using canola oil not only in the food industry 
but in the fast food industry ferris said thursday 
our only problem is quality usgrown canola was not meeting 
the standards established in canada he said 
researchers believe a cool climate is the key and theyve turned 
to farmers in michigans chilly upper peninsula for the answer 
michigan state university cooperative extension agent ralph 
duffek in houghton said thursday he is telling his farmers that 
canolas seed production is so high 1800 pounds per acre that 
at 80 cents a pound it outperforms even soybeans one researcher 
estimates that canola can cash in at a 291per acre profit 
compared with 200 an acre for soybeans he said 
duffek said there is a ready market for canola oil and for the 
crushed seed as a feed supplement for cattle 
what he cant guarantee however is how canadians will welcome 
canola competition from across the border 
western canadians have been growing the mustardlike winter crop 
for years crushing its tiny round seeds into cooking oils and 
protein additives for cattle feed 
the only skepticism that i have heard and somewhat share is 
since the bulk of the canola is grown and processed in canada 
unless the trade agreements are worked out the us producers could 
be at a disadvantage duffek said 
archer daniels midland co inc is one of canadas largest canola 
processors only one of the companys plants in ontario actually 
is crushing the grain now said don wright with the companys grain 
marketing department 
archer daniels midland is devoting more and more of its resources 
to canola processing at the expense of soybeans as the lowfat 
crop catches on wright said 
weve had canola for some time its used in canada for 
margarines cooking oils salad oils and the like but when i came 
here two years ago adm had only six or eight suppliers of it 
wright said now i have a source list of 20 to 25 people i think 
its really coming along 
kentucky and illinois are the chief producers of canola in the 
united states kentucky growers planted about 2000 acres of canola 
in 1987 then 8000 acres as it caught on in 1988 according to a 
study by the university of kentucky 
farmers in indiana tennessee ohio and michigan so far have only 
dabbled in the crop 
canola growers in all of michigan probably harvested less than 
5000 bushels of seed last year said herm geers president of the 
michigan agriculture commodities inc in lansing 
the tough thing about a new crop is what if you only get 5000 
to 8000 bushels most crushers dont want to switch over from one 
day to the next frankly we dont have the production it takes 
geers said 
yet geers is pushing for the crops development in michigan and 
has pledged that his company will continue to clean store and 
broker the crop if agriculture officials will continue to promote it 
the potential is there he said 
canola a member of the rape seed family typically is planted in 
the fall and harvested in early summer leaving farmers enough time 
to put in soybeans the rest of the growing season 
we feel that winter canola offers a real potential for becoming 
a crop in michigan duffek said

the nations biggest banks today increased their 
prime lending rates to 11 percent from 105 percent reflecting the 
continuing rise of interest rates on financial markets 
it was the first increase this year in the prime rate which 
banks use as a benchmark for setting interest on a variety of 
consumer and corporate loans and put the rate at its highest since 
it was 1075 percent in late 1984 
the last increase from 10 percent to 105 percent was nov 28 
chicagobased continental bank and republic national bank of new 
york were the first to boost their prime rates and soon were 
followed by citibank the nations largest bank chemical bank and 
other major banks 
rates have been rising due partly to the federal reserves 
tightening of credit in an attempt to curb inflation the prime rate 
reflects a banks costs of borrowing money including interest it 
pays on savings accounts and certificates of deposit and generally 
reflects more subtle increases in other interest rates 
the rate is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis for 
calculating interest on corporate loans and for determining many 
types of fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans such as home 
equity loans 
republic said it increased its prime because of its rising cost 
of money at continental bank the former continental illinois 
national bank officials said they wanted to bring the banks rates 
in line with those on money markets 
chemical banking corp which owns chemical bank is the nations 
sixthlargest bank holding company 
continental is owned by continental illinois corp the nations 
14thlargest holding company while republics parent republic new

a federal appeals court on friday ruled that 
the federal communications commission had the authority to repeal 
the broadcast fairness doctrine but the court sidestepped the 
overriding issue of the doctrines constitutionality 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
upheld on statutory grounds the fccs august 1987 repeal of the 
40yearold doctrine which required broadcasters to provide 
balanced coverage of controversial issues 
the commission had said the doctrine no longer served the public 
interest and was unconstitutional on first amendment grounds 
in its ruling friday the appeals court said the fcc had the 
authority to decide whether the doctrine served the public interest 
but the threejudge panel decided not to address the constitutional 
issue which had been a primary basis for the court challenge to the 
fccs decision 
the fccs ruling had been precipitated when an antinuclear group 
filed a fairness doctrine complaint against wtvh a meredith corp 
television station in syracuse ny 
gigi b sohn an attorney for the media access project which 
represented the antinuclear syracuse peace council said fridays 
ruling paved the way for a bill pending in congress that would write 
the fairness doctrine into law 
the big victory here is that any law that congress passes 
will not be presumptively unconstitutional sohn said we 
believe the court was wrong about the statutory findings and well 
deal with that in congress or the supreme court or both 
congress is expected to make the doctrine a law again this year 
but president bush has said he would veto such a measure 
the fcc in a statement said the courts decision was a 
victory for the free speech rights of all americans the court has 
vindicated the publics right to receive broadcast press coverage 
free from government interference 
but a constitutional rights organization called it a hollow win 
for the fcc the courts decision leaves the door wide open for 
congressional action to codify the fairness doctrine said john h 
buchanan chairman of people for the american way 
the national association of broadcasters welcomed the ruling and 
said that in the absence of the doctrine the vast majority of 
broadcasters will continue to be fair in covering their communities 
and they will do so without government regulation 
all three judges concurred in fridays ruling but chief judge 
patricia m wald dissented in part 
the fcc in 1984 sided with the syracuse peace council when the 
group contended wtvh had not presented conflicting views when the 
station ran a series of advertisements in 1982 that said the nine 
mile 2 nuclear power plant was a sound investment for new york 
meredith petitioned the fcc for reconsideration in 1985 on 
grounds the doctrine violated its first amendment rights but the 
fcc denied the petition saying the constitutional question should 
be left in the hands of congress and the courts 
however the federal appeals court in washington remanded the 
case back to the fcc in january 1987 ordering the agency to 
consider the constitutional challenge 
congress stepped in and wrote the doctrine into law but 
president reagan vetoed the bill in june 1987 the fcc ruled in 
august in the meredith case that the doctrine violated the first 
amendment and did not serve the public interest as defined by the 
1934 communications act 
the antinuclear group appealed to the court where the case was 
joined on both sides by a host of media and citizens rights 
organizations 
writing for the court friday judge stephen f williams said that 
even though the fcc had intertwined constitutionality and public 
interest in statements supporting its meredith decision the fcc 
nonetheless was justified in not deciding the constitutional issue 
in making a public interest judgment under the communications 
act the commission is exercising both its congressionally delegated 
power and its expertise it clearly enjoys broad deference on issues 
of both fact and policy williams wrote 
we conclude that the fccs decision that the fairness doctrine 
no longer served the public interest was neither arbitrary 
capricious nor an abuse of discretion and are convinced that it 
would have acted on that finding to terminate the doctrine even in 
the absence of its belief that the doctrine was no longer 
constitutional accordingly we uphold the commission without 
reaching the constitutional issues 
williams said it was well established that american courts are 
not to pass upon a constitutional question if there is also 
present some other ground upon which the case may be disposed of 
judge kenneth w starr while concurring with the courts 
opinion said in a lengthy separate opinion that he felt the court 
should have addressed the constitutional question 
the fcc had struck down two parts of the fairness doctrine the 
first required broadcasters to provide coverage of vitally 
important controversial issues of interest in the community served 
by the licensees the second said broadcasters must provide a 
reasonable opportunity for the presentation of contrasting 
viewpoints on such issues 
in her partial dissent wald said the fcc in inviting broadcast 
community response to its fairness doctrine repeal had failed to 
give broadcasters proper notice that it would be looking at the 
first part of the doctrine she also said the repeal of part one was 
the very model of arbitrary and capricious decision making 
wald said the fcc appeared to have been motivated by a fear of 
doing things halfway if it only eliminated the second half of 
the doctrine 
this is deregulation running riot wald wrote

unilever group the european conglomerate has 
agreed to buy the faberge and elizabeth arden lines of toiletries 
cosmetics and fragrances for 155 billion in cash from new york 
investor meshulam riklis it was announced friday 
the deal marks the latest major european acquisition of a us 
company and continues the worldwide consolidation in the cosmetics 
business 
unilever a britishdutch consumer products giant with 31 
billion in 1987 sales bought chesebroughponds inc for 31 
billion two years ago and owns such brand names as vaseline ponds 
elizabeth taylors passion cerruti and white shoulders 
faberge inc and its independent subsidiary elizabeth arden 
include brands such as visible difference chloe lagerfeld 
flawless finish aqua net brut mcgregor and babe 
combined sales of the units being sold totaled more than 800 
million in the fiscal year that ended last month and operating 
profit was 100 million faberge said 
from unilevers perspective it makes a lot of sense said 
bonita austin an analyst at wertheim schroder in new york she said 
unilever would be able to get more mileage out of the faberge and 
arden brands than riklis had because of its strengths in 
distribution manufacturing and research 
the faberge and elizabeth arden businesses provide an excellent 
fit with unilevers existing personal products operations 
worldwide michael angus unilevers chairman said in a statement 
the faberge transaction is expected to be completed in 90 days 
and is subject to the government regulatory clearances a month ago 
the two companies announced they were in discussions which might 
lead to the sale of some of faberges businesses to unilever 
unilever is buying all of faberge inc except for the mcgregor 
apparel group which includes clothing lines such as botany 500 
wonderknit and billy the kid those units have sales of about 240 
million and 20 million in operating profits 
unilever will get the faberge name and faberge inc probably will 
switch its name to mcgregor as part of the deal according to daniel 
manella faberge incs chairman and chief executive 
among other recent big acquisitions by europeans british 
petroleum plc spent 8 billion for the 45 percent of standard oil 
co it did not already own and west germanys hoechst ag bought 
celanese corp for 29 billion in 1987 
in the consolidating cosmetics industry beecham group plc sold 
diane von furstenberg fragrances to revlon group inc in 1987 and 
american cyanamid corp sold the jacqueline cochran fragrance and 
treatment lines including the distribution rights to the nina ricci 
line to sanofi inc 
meshulam rikliss riklis family corp bought faberge inc for 
about 180 million in 1984 and added elizabeth arden for 700 
million at the end of 1987 
rikliss other properties include nine companies those companies 
include samsonite luggage and culligan water softeners which he 
bought among others for 12 billion last year from american brands 
incs eii holdings inc and mccrory corp which owns 1400 
variety stores

wholesale prices in january shot up at their 
fastest pace in nearly three years the government said friday in a 
report that analysts warned could signal spiraling inflation in 1989 
januarys unexpected 1 percent rise in the producer price index 
for finished goods was the biggest monthly increase since an 
identical surge in october 1985 and was equivalent to a 127 percent 
annual rate of inflation the labor department said 
the increase was paced by the steepest increase in food prices in 
a year the largest rise in energy prices in two years and sharply 
higher costs in a variety of other categories as well 
the report roiled financial markets unleashing a storm of 
selling in stocks and treasury bonds as traders became concerned 
that the federal reserve board would drive interest rates higher to 
try to control inflation 
the first inflation report since the change in administrations 
brought no good news for president bush who just a day earlier 
unveiled budget and deficitreduction plans pinned on optimistic 
assumptions for falling inflation and a strong overall economic 
performance 
bush asked about the latest inflation figures while on a visit 
to ottawa said that i would not make assumptions based on one 
monthly release of the producer price index he said the figures 
tend to jump around somewhat 
the president said that he is not overly concerned about 
inflation at this point although he added that i dont like the 
figures 
private economists skeptical about the rosy scenario presented 
by bush in his speech to congress thursday have been predicting 
slower growth this year and warned that the latest report from the 
labor department could lead the fed to boost interest rates to 
restrain the economy and keep inflation in check 
the report signals that the economy has launched into another 
significant racheting upward of inflation said economist allen 
sinai of the boston co 
we all should wait for another inflation report or two to draw 
too pessimistic a conclusion but my fear is that it will ultimately 
take a major slowdown or recession to get inflation back down to 
acceptable rates sinai said 
the producer price index for finished goods had risen 4 percent 
during 1988 the steepest climb in seven years and nearly double the 
22 percent increase posted in 1987 many private economists expect 
further increases this year although not at the doubledigit levels 
that plagued the nation in 1979 and 1980 
the index for finished goods items one stop short of the retail 
level stood at 1110 in january meaning a hypothetical selection 
of goods that cost 100 in 1982 would have cost 111 last month up 
1 from the previous month 
economist david wyss of data resources inc of lexington mass 
said the dramatic size of januarys increase was a onemonth 
aberration caused largely by rising energy and food prices but 
that the overall trend nevertheless has been one of accelerating 
inflation 
i think its going to be higher again this year and it could be 
a lot higher if we have another drought wyss said early signs 
dont look good we havent had much precipitation east of the 
rockies 
energy prices were up 49 percent last month in part reflecting 
recent acceleration in crude oil prices januarys increase the 
biggest since a 72 percent rise in january 1987 was paced by an 
116 percent rise in home heating oil and also included a 41 
percent jump in wholesale gasoline prices and a 48 percent rise in 
natural gas 
with the aftereffects of last summers drought still in 
evidence food prices one stop short of grocery store shelves were 
up 11 percent last month the steepest increase since a 15 percent 
rise in january 1988 
wholesale egg prices were up 201 percent pork rose 114 
percent and prices for bakery products increased 13 percent 
but even excluding energy and food costs wholesale prices were 
up a moderate 04 percent last month including sharp increases in 
childrens apparel prescription and overthecounter medicines 
books household electronic equipment flatware automobiles toys 
and games and costume jewelry 
prices also were up at the earlier stages in the production 
chain with intermediate goods costs up 09 percent the steepest 
increase in nearly eight years while crude goods shot up 39 
percent the biggest rise since august 1980 
dirk van dongen president of the national association of 
wholesalerdistributors predicted those price increases would 
translate into further rises at the finished goods level 
my fear is that we reach a point where an inflation psychology 
takes root in the economy he said it begins to feed on itself 
wages begin to chase prices its extremely difficult to get 
your arms around the problem without severely dampening economic 
activity 
the nation will get this years first look at inflation on the 
consumer level with the feb 22 release of januarys report on the 
consumer price index which measures imports and services into 
addition to goods consumer prices increased 44 percent in 1988

leaders of the machinists union said friday that a 
tightlipped eastern airlines is making arrangements through other 
aviation companies to hire mechanics baggage handlers and other 
workers in case of a strike 
an international association of machinists leader in atlanta 
charged fridy that eastern was recruiting mechanics through butler 
aviation at an office building near hartsfield international 
airport frank ortis vice president of local 702 in miami said 
hes received several reports of recruiting workers apparently for 
the strike but did not have proof and machinist leaders said they 
suspected similar efforts in other cities 
the machinists had an informational picket at the site in atlanta 
and were telling people who arrived for job interviews that the jobs 
would be for strikebreakers at eastern in case the unions walk 
a classified ad pitching the interviews in atlanta was headlined 
aviation careers and gave directions to the job interview site 
but no phone number it identified the employer only as a large 
national company 
michael flynn head of the iam local in atlanta said eastern 
airlines people were inside the building where the interviews were 
taking place and armed guards were outside 
he said he had heard of recruiting in several other cities but 
had few specifics 
they wont have much luck with mechanics flynn predicted 
all the airlines are hiring mechanics now 
butler officials declined to talk about the machinists claims 
we dont have any comment on that said bill wynperle vice 
president of marketing for butler international inc of montvale 
nj 
ortis said machinists are looking into several newspaper 
advertisements in the miami area offering aviationrelated jobs 
we have reason to believe they are hiring strikebreakers 
ortis said we expect companies to go ahead and start doing this 
but looking at the salary they advertised i cannot believe anybody 
would want to work for that thats why were on strike 
eastern continued to decline comment on strikerelated activities 
or union charges 
we have declined comment on any specifics of our contingency 
plan said eastern spokeswoman virginia sanchez 
but asked if there was a contingency plan she replied there 
is 
our goal is to operate obviously she said however our 
objective in the shortterm is always to reach a settlement because 
we feel a strike will not benefit either party 
the three unions met thursday to discuss their options if a 
courtimposed march 3 deadline passes without a settlement in the 
machinists 16month contract dispute with the airline 
alpa and machinists union members met with officials of the 
transport workers union which represents easterns 7000 flight 
attendants the twu executive board met thursday to discuss options 
but did not report on the meetings outcome 
easterns 3400 pilots thursday were being sent a taped message 
from local union leader capt jack bavis urging them to consider 
supporting the machinists if they walk off the job 
eastern announced record net losses of 3354 million for 1988 
nearly double the 1817 million loss the year before revenues 
dropped to 38 billion in 1988 compared to 44 billion in 1987 
the miamibased carrier owned by texas air corp is seeking 
150 million in union wage concessions it also claims to be losing 
1 million a day 
the 8500 machinists comprise some 30 percent of easterns work 
force mechanics make up about half of the union which includes 
baggage handlers ramp agents and other groundservices workers 
a national mediation board negotiator is continuing efforts to 
gain an agreement between the two sides although no recent progress 
has been reported and both sides have shown signs of gearing up for 
a strike 
union officials are predicted overwhelming approval of a strike 
when the vote is concluded feb 14 by locals in atlanta the outcome 
of that strike vote is expected late next week with a strike 
deadline of march 3

first nationwide bank announced friday it 
will close its 170 branches in k mart stores in 12 states ending 
the onceballyhooed program in favor of a strategy focusing more on 
traditional banking outlets 
first nationwide a 26 billion savings bank whose parent is 
owned by ford motor co said the planned march 10 closings are part 
of a more focused strategy that has seen the company acquire 
failed thrift institutions with billions of dollars in assets in 
recent months 
we regarded it as an experiment and it just hasnt met what 
our expectations were said lorna doubet a first nationwide 
spokeswoman it just hasnt attracted as many customers as we had 
thought it would 
first nationwide had the 170 convenience branches in arizona 
california colorado florida kentucky maryland michigan 
missouri new york ohio pennsylvania and virginia the branches 
accounted for about 200 million in deposits compared with more 
than 17 billion for the companys entire system which also 
included outlets in hawaii illinois and new jersey 
although we learned much about offering financial services in a 
retail environment we have concluded that convenience branches in k 
marts dont fit the companys new strategic focus on its target 
markets and profitable operations said robert c lackovic 
chairman and chief executive officer of the san franciscobased 
savings bank 
k mart has given us strong support and we have an excellent 
relationship but the bank has found it necessary to change its 
priorities lackovic said 
late in december the federal home loan bank board pledged 16 
billion to assist first nationwide financial corp the savings 
banks parent in the purchase of four failed savings and loans in 
three states with assets of nearly 8 billion when merged with 
first nationwide bank the company will have the nations 
secondbiggest thrift business 
first nationwide failed in its september bid to acquire american 
savings and loan association of stockton calif the nations 
biggest insolvent thrift 
jon hartman director of financial services for troy michbased 
k mart corp said the company had known for some time that results 
at the branches were not as good as they could have been he 
also said the thrift recent acquisitions by first nationwide had 
signaled the shift in their strategy 
i think what probably transpired is that we all thought this 
was a good idea and there are situations where it can and has 
worked but it appears in talking with the bank that its not 
something that can be rolled out nationwide hartman said 
first nationwide accounts in the k mart branches will be 
transferred to fullservice offices and affected customers will be 
notified this week by mail 
ms doubet said about 350 employees would be affected by the 
closings and first nationwide was attempting to find new positions 
with the company for many of them

next weeks demonstration by farmers against 
rebel killer swine wont exactly be a plea for support to stop 
renegade barnyard pigs 
its just a staged protest to tout some new vinyl action toys and 
their equally militaristic sheep foes debuting at this years toy 
fair 
bib overallclad protesters carrying placards proclaiming make 
bacon not war and lamb chops not karate chops will greet 
visitors to the 86th annual american international toy fair which 
starts monday 
a group calling itself hicks horticulturists incensed by 
commercialized killer swine issued a manifesto friday urging the 
publicto march shouldertoshoulder with pork producers and wool 
farmers and demonstrate your solidarity against animal 
exploitation 
the hicks actually are actors hired to pose as midwestern 
farmers outraged by the barnyard commandos menagerie of action 
figures being introduced at the fair 
playmate toys inc creators of barnyard commandos decided to 
take this offbeat publicity approach to poke fun at itself and the 
toy exhibition which over the years has been known to cultivate a 
healthy crop of advertising hyperbole 
no one will mistake this for a real protest said playmates 
spokesman christopher a perez its so tongueincheek and its 
all done in the spirit of fun 
playmates of la mirada calif claims barnyard commandos were 
the demented result of a military experiment gone awry 
in the companys orwellian scenario a platoon of rebel killer 
swine are battling against a rebel army of militant sheep for 
control of a farm 
the opposing forces communicate with their comradesinarms using 
secret languages the porks speak pork latin and the rams 
use baa code 
the militant critters are a spoof of the army figures and war 
toys now popular among children said perez 
in recent years some toy manufacturers have prided themselves on 
presenting stateofthe art items including gear that imitates the 
latest in pentagon weaponry and thinking 
perez said playmates wants to show it doesnt take itself too 
seriously and has retained a sense of humor despite its serious 
success last year with teenage mutant ninja turtles these 
creatures based on a comic book are described as the result of the 
mutation of normal pet turtles that fell into a sewer the turtles 
turned out to be 1988s no1 new toy 
the only people that could take offense at playmates hoax are 
real farmers the fake ones hired by playmates led by farmer 
fallow are portrayed as rather unsophisticated yokels 
their dummy announcement presented to look like it was printed 
on an oldfashioned typewriter concludes with a recommendation that 
wouldnt exactly appeal to animal rights advocates 
it says buy pork and lamb from your neighborhood butcher

returned the dollar to where it was at midweek 
the labor department reported wholesale prices rose in january at 
a 127 percent annual rate the steepest increase in more than three 
months 
currency dealers speculated the federal reserve would combat 
inflation by pushing up shortterm interest rates which would 
attract global investors to put their money in dollars 
gold prices fell even though investors usually flock to gold as 
a haven against inflation dealers said selling swept the market 
after gold failed to respond favorably to the wholesale price

policymakers at the federal reserve concerned 
that strong economic growth posed a risk of higher inflation 
decided in december to push up interest rates in an effort to hold 
down prices according to records released friday 
the federal open market committee which establishes policy for 
the central bank voted 111 at its dec 1314 meeting to increase 
somewhat its restraint on reserves held by commercial banks 
according to minutes of the session 
lowering the amount of cash which banks have available to back 
loans drives up the interest rates charged on those loans 
the fed minutes said most members favored some immediate added 
restraint on reserves with some further tightening to be 
implemented at the start of 1989 assuming that economic and 
financial conditions remained reasonably consistent with current 
expectations 
the fed whose main job is to guard against inflation has been 
pushing up interest rates in an effort to slow economic growth to a 
more sustainable level and thus keep prices in check 
at the committees december meeting the minutes said members 
focused on indications of continuing strength in the economic 
expansion 
many expressed concern that continued expansion at a relatively 
rapid pace raised the risk that inflation would intensify they 
said 
the lone dissenter was martha seger who viewed current 
business indicators as already pointing on balance to slower 
economic expansion the minutes said 
ms seger expressed particular concern that the higher interest 
rates implied by greater monetary restraint would aggravate the 
condition of the financially troubled savings and loan industry 
they said 
the fed began a series of credittightening steps last march 
which included a onehalf percentage point increase last august in 
the discount rate the interest it charges to make bank loans the 
discount rate now stands at 65 percent 
many private economists have been predicting the fed will 
continue to push interest rates upward in the face of strong 
economic reports 
those expectations were reinforced by a report from the labor 
department on friday showing wholesale prices in january rose at 
their fastest pace in nearly three years 
several of the nations biggest banks on friday increased their 
prime lending rate by onehalf percentage point to 11 percent 
reflecting the continuing rise of interest rates 
mortgage rates have been rising as well the federal home loan 
mortgage corp reported friday that fixedrate mortgages now stand 
at 1056 percent up from 984 percent a year earlier 
the feds open market committee met behind closed doors again 
tuesday and wednesday to review policy and set monetary growth 
targets for 1989 their actions will not be revealed until fed 
chairman alan greenspan testifies before congress on feb 21 
greenspan in testimony before congress last month said the risk 
of inflation remained strong enough that the fed should err more 
on the side of restrictiveness than stimulus in determining 
monetary policy 
but fed efforts to slow the economy could spell trouble for the 
bush administration which has tied its plans to reduce the federal 
budget deficit without increasing taxes to expectations of strong 
economic growth 
president bush asked about the latest inflation figures while on 
a visit to ottawa said he was not overly concerned about 
inflation at this point although he added i dont like the 
figures 
the open market committee decided to tighten the central banks 
grip because members felt the risks of a downturn stemming from 
the limited tightening under consideration were extremely small and 
needed to be accepted in light of what they perceived as the much 
greater threat of a recession if inflation were allowed to 
intensify the minutes said 
minutes of this weeks open market committee meeting wont be 
released until after the committees next meeting march 28 the 
committee is composed of the sevenmember federal reserve board and 
five of the 12 presidents of the feds regional banks

an unexpected leap in wholesale prices triggered a plunge in gold 
and silver futures prices friday as traders anticipated further 
credit tightening by the federal reserve board in an effort to 
control inflation 
on other markets coffee energy and soybean futures prices fell 
sharply grain futures were higher and livestock and meat futures 
were mixed 
gold futures prices settled 610 to 660 lower on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in april at 
39170 a troy ounce silver was 77 cents to 8 cents lower with 
march at 5835 a troy ounce 
the labor departments report of a 1 percent rise in the producer 
price index last month the sharpest monthly increase in nearly 
eight years shocked economists and sent financial markets into 
turmoil 
gold futures prices initially rose as startled investors bought 
into a market traditionally viewed as a safe haven in times of 
rising prices 
but the gold bulls were rapidly overtaken by sellers who feared 
the federal reserve would move quickly to drive up interest rates 
and clamp down on inflation 
the way the gold market reacted was not a good reaction 
said stephen platt a preciousmetals analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc in chicago we were able to rally a buck and that 
was it 
earlier this week the gold market had appeared to be struggling 
back from the depressed levels it slipped into in late january but 
the markets reaction to the wholesale price report held out little 
hope for recovery in the near future 
i dont think the market really believes that inflations going 
to build into a new problem said craig sloane an analyst with 
smith barney harris upham amp co in new york 
this really struck at the heart of gold bulls said platt 
coffee futures prices dropped sharply on new yorks coffee sugar 
amp cocoa exchange in technically inspired trading settling 110 
cents to 694 cents lower with march at 133 a pound 
weakening chart signals helped push crude oil for march delivery 
as low as 1705 a barrel on the new york mercantile exchange but a 
late rally partially erased the losses 
crude oil settled 17 cents to 35 cents lower with march at 1711 
a barrel heating oil was 61 cent to 125 cents lower with march at 
4736 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 20 cent to 79 cent 
lower with march at 4757 cents a gallon 
soybean futures prices fell sharply on the chicago board of trade 
amid slack demand for what one analyst called fairly comfortable 
supplies of soybean meal 
wheat futures gained on rumors that the agriculture department 
was preparing to target china for sales of us wheat at subsidized 
prices 
wheat settled 3 cents to 6 cents higher with march at 428 a 
bushel corn was cent to 1 cent higher with march at 266 a 
bushel oats were cent to 1 cents higher with march at 206 a 
bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 11 cents lower with march at 735 
a bushel 
cattle futures steadied and finished mixed after an opening 
plunge linked to wednesdays usda report showing a 
largerthanexpected us cattle herd 
pork futures also finished mixed in a day of choppy trading 
live cattle were 50 cent lower to 35 cent higher with april at 
7505 cents a pound feeder cattle were 75 cent to 115 cents lower 
with march at 8215 cents a pound hogs were 30 cent lower to 23 
cent higher with february at 4160 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 45 cent lower to 45 cent higher with february at 38

secretary of state james a baker iii said friday 
he was seeking a waiver from the bush administration to permit him 
to participate in decisions on third world debt even while holding 
stock in a major american lender to developing nations 
but baker stressed that he would accept any of several options 
that might be chosen by administration lawyers and ethics 
specialists including possibly selling his stock in chemical new 
york corp a bank holding company 
he denied reports that c boyden gray the white house counsel 
had pressed him to sell his holdings 
the discussions now revolve around waiver baker said at a 
news conference during president bushs fivehour visit to the 
canadian capital 
bush himself said all i know theres nobody more ethical than 
jim baker complied with the spirit and letter of good ethics 
practice i just havent had a chance to look into it well 
have high standards we know there will be no conflicts of 
interest 
bush commented aboard air force one after leaving ottawa 
baker who was white house chief of staff and then treasury 
secretary in the reagan administration has substantial interests in 
real estate oil and bank stocks including chemical new york corp 
a bank holding company that has 45 billion in loans to third world 
nations his latest disclosure form shows 
however the form shows the chemical holdings were not large at 
the time the form was filed last month between 12000 and 40000 
at treasury over the past several years baker put forward a plan 
to deal with the sagging economies of third world nations burdened 
with debt to commercial banks in the united states and elsewhere as 
secretary of state he would play a leading role in determining us 
policy toward the developing nations especially their debt burden 
i have concluded i should seek a waiver baker said as he 
calmly answered a halfdozen questions about the ethics issue raised 
in a frontpage article in fridays washington post he said a 
presidential waiver from normal conflictofinterest rules gives 
me additional protection and helps avoid the appearance of any sort 
of conflict 
baker a texas multimillionaire said that as white house chief 
of staff and then as treasury secretary ive been very careful 
about recusing myself from decisions where even an appearance of 
impropriety was possible 
at the same time baker said he recognized that bush made it 
very clear that ethics are an important issue to him 
baker said the thrust of discussions with administration lawyers 
was to find mechanisms or actions that could be taken in my case 
to insulate me from charges or suggestions of conflict of interest 
he said that if there were an ethical problem it would have been 
discovered while his nomination was under consideration by the 
senate foreign relations committee during two days of hearings last 
month the issue of his finances was never brought up 
baker said he would be willing to remove himself from policy 
discussions of third world issues restructure the trust holding his 
stock or even sell his stock if that were the conclusion of the 
current inquiry within the administration 
he said he had not talked to gray who is the white house counsel 
and the administrations chief ethics official however he said 
gray had raised the subject of baker selling his stock in comments 
to robert kimmit a washington lawyer recently named undersecretary 
of state for political affairs 
earlier on the flight to ottawa presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said at this point they havent reached a decision on 
disposing of any investments he was referring to ethics lawyers 
from the white house the state department and the office of 
government ethics which is also part of the executive branch 
in washington state department spokesman charles e redman said 
the new review of bakers holdings was undertaken because of a more 
stringent interpretation of government ethics rules based on a 1987 
justice department opinion the office of government ethics 
interpreting the justice department opinion requires officials to 
be more conservative than previously believed necessary by 
government ethics attorneys he said 
from his arrival in the reagan administration eight years ago 
until the present baker has had his holdings in a qualified blind 
trust redman said 
however the disclosure forms he has filed openly list his assets 
his latest such forms filed with office of government ethics 
list some 5310 shares of various types of stock held in the 
chemical new york corp listed on a form titled assets of a 
dependent child the bakers have a teenage daughter mary bonner 
baker 
on the form two types of chemical stock are listed with values 
ranging from 1000 to 5000 while two others are listed as being 
valued at 5000 to 15000 according to a range provided on the 
list the stocks in total would be worth more than 12000 but less 
than 40000 
bakers chemical shares originally were in texas commerce 
bancshares a banking company that grew out of a bank organized by 
his grandfather in may 1987 texas commerce was merged with a 
subsidiary of chemical and baker became a large holder of the new 
york bank companys stock

home heating oil prices fell sharply friday 
taking other energy prices down with them 
on the new york mercantile exchange the march contract for 
heating oil fell 125 cents to 4736 cents a gallon 
the heating oil market had every reason to rally but was 
unable to do so said andrew lebow an energy futures analyst with 
edampf man international futures inc 
severe winter weather in the united states should have given 
heating oil prices a boost but warmer weather overseas and an 
abundance of oil stocks here and abroad depressed prices lebow said 
the gloomy news spilled over to the markets for crude oil and 
gasoline 
the march contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude dropped 28 cents to 1711 a barrel and the 
march contract for unleaded gasoline declined 079 cent to 4757 
cents a gallon 
it was a heating oilled decline lebow said 
rising stockpiles of gasoline took a further toll on gas prices

in another major european investment in 
california wine the interests of the fabled chateau 
lafiterothschild of bordeaux france have formed an alliance with 
the states superpremium chalone vineyard 
chateau lafites baron eric de rothschild and board chairman dick 
graff of chalone made the announcement thursday at a news 
conference chalone whose best wines sell for 20 a bottle and up 
is the only publicly owned operating winery in the country 
the executives said the agreement subject to the approval of 
shareholders calls for an approximately 6 percent ownership swap 
between the companies with a contemplated rise to 20 percent for a 
15 million investment by each party 
rothschild said the swap included none of the property or vines 
of chateau lafite itself only the 200yearold winerys business 
ownerships specifically its domaines chateau rieussec chateau 
dehartmilon and chateau la cardonne plus the 50 percentowned 
vina los vascos of chile 
all the french wineries are in the famous red wine district of 
medoc 
great wines are made from the proper soil good weather and 
talented people said rothschild we found chalone the only 
american wine company that shares our philosophy 
chalone president philip woodward said the companies planned 
extensive exchanges of personnel marketing talent winemaking 
information and details of grape growing they also will make mutual 
investments in the development of winery and vineyard properties 
chalone now exports to 12 countries 
rothschild is the second of his family to invest in california 
wine though not in the same way his late cousin baron philippe de 
rothschild of moutonrothschild made the move after a california 
wine trounced the best of french wines in a blind tasting in paris 
in 1976 
in the late 1970s philippe who died last year entered into a 
joint venture with napa valley winemaker robert mondavi to produce 
opus one the proprietary name for a cabernet sauvignon blend whose 
vintages enter the market roughly at 50 a bottle 
there will not be an opus two said graff emphasizing that 
chalone plans no viticultural or blending combinations with the 
french 
the lafite domaines swap is regarded as an important boost to the 
prestige of california wine the deal also gives the french wineries 
an important new opening into the booming premium american wine 
market 
chalone the oldest winery in monterey county first planted 
vines in 1919 and today owns and operates acacia winery of napa 
valleys prized carneros carmenet vineyard of sonoma and 50
