two hostage passengers on a hijacked 
kuwait airways jet pleaded for their lives via radio friday and 
urged the kuwaiti government to give in to the demands of the 
shiite moslem gunmen 
algerian mediators shuttled between the boobytrapped jet and 
kuwaiti officials on friday the 11th day of the crisis 
the masked gunmen who commandeered the jumbo jet on a flight 
from bangkok to kuwait on april 5 want kuwait to release 17 
terrorists convicted of bombing the us and french embassies in 
kuwait in 1982 
in the name of god the merciful i greet my family and my 
friends and i ask the kuwaiti authorities to free the 17 prisoners 
held in kuwaiti prisons said soleiman mohammed soleiman 
almashari one hostage in a message to the control tower in 
the event of refusal they are going to kill us 
in a second message a man identifying himself as mohammed ahmed 
alajem said i am one of the hostages from the boeing i greet 
my family large and small and i ask the kuwaiti authorities to 
free the prisoners in the prisons without that the kidnappers 
have decided to kill us 
an estimated 31 passengers and four crew members were being held 
in grim conditions by eight hijackers armed with guns and grenades 
in washington a reagan administration official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said a man wanted in the united states in 
the 1985 hijacking of a twa jetliner was believed to be one of the 
gunmen on the kuwaiti plane 
the official said the man hasan izzaldin was named in a 1987 
federal indictment charging him and three others with conspiracy to 
commit air piracy murder and assault in the hijacking in which 39 
americans were held hostage and a us sailor was killed 
the boeing 747 which had 112 passengers aboard when it began 
its journey was diverted to mashhad in northeastern iran then to 
larnaca cyprus fiftyseven passengers were released in iran and 
another 13 in cyprus two passengers were killed in cyprus 
the air pirates have threatened to kill the remaining hostages 
and blow up the plane if their demands are not met 
algerian officials expressed disappointment friday that 
negotiations at the airport had not achieved better results 
negotiations began wednesday shortly after the plane arrived from 
larnaca cyprus 
western sources in paris said it was believed that parallel 
highlevel negotiations were also taking place between kuwait and 
iran with algeria acting as an intermediary 
a report by the official kuwait news agency friday said the 
hijackers appeared to be divided over the negotiations and it 
seemed that iran was directing the hardline faction 
some of the hijackers believed to have boarded in mashhad had in 
recent hours become more extremist and obstinate said the 
agency kuna without citing any sources 
stateowned kuwait radio reported that kuwaiti prime minister 
sheik sad alabdallah alsalim alsabah on friday telephoned 
algerian premier abdelhamid brahimi to discuss the 
intensification of efforts being exerted to bring about the release 
of the passengers 
the radio report monitored in london gave no details 
on thursday the hijackers released djuma abdallah chatti 70 a 
diabetic who was in urgent need of an insulin injection 
before his release he had been examined on board the plane by 
an algerian doctor who told the hijackers chatti was in danger of 
dying if he did not receive treatment 
after chatti was freed the gunmen issued a statement saying 
we are not highway bandits 
however the hijackers repeated their demand and said they would 
carry out executions even if the price we have to pay is very 
high 
a kuwaiti official who insisted on anonymity said chatti 
reported that all of the hostages had their wrists handcuffed 
behind their backs they were not allowed to speak or move from 
their seats in the midsection of the plane except to be escorted 
to the toilets by one of the gunmen who kept a pistol pointed at 
the hostages back 
chatti said the hostages were completely ignorant of the 
negotiations 
he said there were eight hijackers and that passengers were 
grouped in seat rows 22 to 36 located directly above the fuel 
tanks 
a kuwaiti official who demanded anonymity said chatti told the 
kuwaiti delegation that four bombs were attached to the four doors 
in the midsection of the plane 
among the hostages are three members of kuwaits royal family 
and at least four crew members 
algerian officials on thursday privately expressed optimism that 
their separate negotiations with the shiite moslem hijackers and a 
kuwaiti delegation would lead to the release of the last two women 
on board cousins of the emir of kuwait 
there was widespread disappointment when only chatti was freed 
chatti said the hostage treated most roughly was the fadel 
khaled alsabah 33 cousin of the emir of kuwait regarded as the 
hijackers trump card 
alsabah suffered from a severe nervous disorder even before he 
boarded the plane in bangkok and the experience of the hijack 
seems to have put him over the brink chatti said 
chatti said alsabah had continuous violent shakes was unable 
to speak and cries continuously the hijackers brought a microphone 
to him and tried to force him to make a statement but he was 
unable to do so

the alleged mastermind behind the 
hijacking of kuwait airways flight 422 is a longtime fugitive from 
justice linked to two earlier hijacks 
imad mughniyeh 36 is one of four suspects wanted by the us 
justice department in the hijacking of a twa airliner on june 14 
1985 by shiite moslem extremists a us navy diver was killed and 
39 americans were held hostage for 17 days before being freed after 
syrian intervention 
in washington a reagan administration official said another man 
wanted in the united states in the twa hijacking was believed to be 
a hijacker on the kuwaiti plane 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the man 
hasan izzaldin was named in a 1987 federal indictment charging 
him and three others with conspiracy to commit air piracy murder 
and assault in the hijacking 
western intelligence agencies also believe mughniyeh was 
involved in the december 1984 hijacking of a kuwaiti airliner to 
tehran that left two americans dead 
iranian security forces stormed the plane after five days the 
hijackers disappeared and tehran has issued no word about them 
western sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
mughniyeh is the leader of a clan one of several in the bekaa 
valley of eastern lebanon that control the drug trade in there 
he also is chief of security for the proiranian hezbollah or 
party of god in lebanon hezbollah is considered by western and 
lebanese intelligence agencies to be the umbrella organization for 
groups holding foreigners hostages in lebanon 
mughniyehs cousin and brotherinlaw is one of the three 
shiites among the 17 imprisoned in kuwait who have been sentenced 
to death 
western observers have said it is this family connection that 
has fueled mughniyehs mission to free the 17 terrorists 
the kuwaitis have identified the condemned man as elias saab 
but his real name is hussein ali badreddin he entered kuwait on a 
forged iraqi passport western intelligence authorities said 
ever since badreddin was arrested in kuwait mughniyeh has tried 
to free him 
mughniyeh dropped out of sight in beirut several weeks ago 
according to wellinformed sources who asked not to be identified 
one of hezbollahs factions is the islamic jihad or islamic 
holy war the shiite group holding foreigners hostage in lebanon 
it has said it would free the americans they hold if kuwait frees 
the 17 terrorists 
kuwait has refused and the hijacking of the kuwaiti airliner 
which was taken first to iran then to cyprus and finally to 
algeria has not changed that stance 
at one point during talks in cyprus palestinian negotiators 
said the hijackers offered to release half their hostages if kuwait 
freed the three among the 17 who had been sentenced to death 
mughniyehs cousin is among the three 
the cypriots acting on kuwaiti advice rejected the offer but 
it underlined mughniyehs suspected role in the hijacking 
western intelligence sources believe that mughniyeh joined the 
hijacked kuwaiti airliner in mashhad northeastern iran when it 
landed there after it was seized during a flight from bangkok to 
kuwait

the foreign ministry sent a formal 
protest to the united nations on friday alleging us violations of 
panamas sovereignty during a firefight involving us marines this 
week 
the protest said us troops closed a panamanian highway just 
outside the capital for three hours tuesday night after fighting 
broke out between soldiers of the united states and an unknown 
group 
at a news conference called by the us military marine 1st 
sgt alexander j nevglovski sr said friday that his company 
became engaged in a gunfight tuesday night at a fuel depot with 
uniformed men who were using us as training aids 
they were highly professional nevglovski who has served 
for 24 years in the marine corps told the news conference at the 
us southern commands headquarters they were good they were 
trying to provoke us 
nevglovski of camp lejeune nc said the intruders wore black 
uniforms and carried sophisticated night vision equipment but 
declined to speculate on whether they were members of the 
panamanian defense forces 
in the protest sent to un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar foreign minister jorge abadia called the highway closing a 
flagrant violation of panamas sovereignty by us troops 
according to earlier reports the highway was closed after about 
100 marines exchanged fire with what they described as 40 to 50 
uniformed intruders at the fuel dump near howard air force base a 
few miles west of panama city 
the us southern command said it consulted with the defense 
forces before closing the highway for security reasons 
col ron sconyers the southern commands chief spokesman said 
nevglovski was presented at the news conference friday to answer 
reporters questions because of skeptical reports in the united 
states and ridicule in the panamanian press which is largely 
controlled by the government 
nevglovski told of two separate firefights tuesday night and 
said that during one eight marines and a sailor were surrounded by 
a group of intruders about half a mile from the sergeants position 
no casualties were reported tuesday but a us marine was shot 
and fatally wounded by fellow marines in an incident monday 
nevglovski said the fatal shooting occurred as the marines tried to 
encircle eight intruders wearing black uniforms and moving in 
military fashion 
the defense forces are commanded by gen manuel antonio noriega 
who is under federal indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges the united states has imposed economic 
sanctions against panama in an effort to force noriega who 
dominates the civilian government to resign 
sconyers said a full investigation into the actions monday and 
tuesday was under way 
the united states maintains about 10000 military personnel in 
panama as a permanent force to defend the panama canal about 1300 
additional us soldiers and marines were sent to panama last week 
to increase security 
the panamanian government has described the us marines as 
inexperienced troops who were shooting at swaying palm trees 
nevglovskis account of tuesdays incidents left unanswered the 
questions of who were the intruders and why in more than two hours 
of sporadic gunfire were there apparently no injuries on either 
side 
he was asked to assess the intruders motives and the sergeant 
replied 
they were basically using us as training aides to see how 
they can get around and how they cant get around to see how they 
can get detected and how they cant get detected 
nevglovski raised a new question when he said marines did not 
chase the intruders into the surrounding jungle because a month or 
so earlier two air force mps chased an intruder into the jungle 
and one was hacked to death with a machete and the other was cut up 
pretty bad 
no such incident had been announced and after the news 
conference military spokesmen said nevglovski had repeated a rumor 
that had no basis in fact 
and while nevglovski said he had a group of about 42 intruders 
almost constantly in view with a nightvision device i didnt 
see a weapon on them i cant say why we could see them clearly 
he said of the shooting we received the first three rounds 
and our return fire lasted about 15 minutes what i could 
identify was three or four muzzle flashes coming from a certain 
area 
at that time i immediately went to my machine gunner and 
tapped him on the shoulder and told him to return fire 
nevglovski said he returned fire approximately 10 or 15 rounds 
and i tapped him again and told him to cease fire 
nevglovski said another marine opened fire at the same time with 
a second machine gun but none of the marines used their weapons 
or pistols because the word hadnt been given to open fire 
nevglovski said that while he and about 90 other marines were 
engaged with more than 40 intruders another group of nine american 
servicemen were surrounded by about 10 other intruders on a 
hill half a mile away 
the two groups were in radio contact nevglovski said and at 
least three 80mm mortar rounds were fired at the intruders 
positions

miss mann was found slain along with her sisters jenniffer 19 
and martha 14 and brother ernest 13 in their mobile home early 
friday

if the girls had been sexually assaulted 
the bodies were so mutilated that police first reported that

the dollar plunged on world currency markets 
thursday in reaction to bad news on the us trade deficit despite 
a massive coordinated effort on the part of the united states and 
its economic allies to halt the slide 
the dollars steep dive served served as an ominous reminder to 
the worlds economic powers that their bestlaid plans to steady 
the global economy can be quickly disrupted by events 
just as it had done several times last year the weakness in the 
dollar quickly spread to other financial markets sending interest 
rates up sharply and pushing the dow jones industrial average down 
by more than 100 points its second threedigit loss this year 
the market turmoil came only a day after the worlds seven major 
industrial countries had issued a glowing communique bragging about 
their ability to hold the dollar stable for the past four months 
finance ministers and central bank presidents of the seven 
nations the united states japan west germany britian france 
and italy reaffirmed on wednesday their commitment to keep the 
dollar stable 
they pledged to back up the commitment with coordinated 
intervention the process by which governments dump other 
currencies in exchange for dollars as a way of supporting the 
greenback 
participants in the daylong wednesday meeting said they had not 
been told in advance by treasury secretary james a baker iii that 
the february trade deficit would be an unexpectedly large 138 
billion triggering the need for intervention baker is briefed a 
day in advance on government economic reports 
the finance ministers professed satisfaction with the way their 
cooridnation effort had worked thursday but the dollar still 
closed sharply lower against other currencies 
in europe the dollar fell to 12360 yen breaking through a 
125yen barrier which has been considered the lower level for the 
greenback over the past four months 
in tokyo on friday the dollar opened a sharp 17 percent lower 
against the yen but stabilized later at that level on reports of 
heavy dollarbuying by the bank of japan 
while the global recession which some predicted following last 
octobers market collapse has not materialized the turmoil 
thursday served as an chilling reminder of the continued fragility 
of world economy 
baker and finance ministers from other countries tried to put 
the best face on the dollars tumble thursday contending that the 
speed with which the countries intervened to support the dollar 
showed that the drive for international cooperation was working 
currency traders reported that the federal reserve in the united 
states and the central banks of west germany england switzerland 
and italy were among those intervening to brake the dollars fall 
i think what you see today is a very good example of 
international cooperation because there has been concerted 
intervention in support of the dollar involving a very large number 
of countries nigel lawson the british chancellor of the 
exchequer said in a briefing for reporters 
the surge in the trade deficit and the dollars tumble were 
among the items discussed by the world finance leaders as they 
continued their talks thursday 
baker the prime architect of the threeyear effort to manage 
the level of the dollar was grimfaced when he arrived for the 
meetings held at the headquarters of the international monetary 
fund in washington 
he brushed past reporters without answering any questions but 
later his office released a text of comments he made during the 
closeddoor session in which he played down the significance of 
februarys widening of the trade deficit and stressed the resolve 
of the united states and its allies to keep the value of the dollar 
stable 
monthly trade figures are by their nature erratic what is 
important is that we are continuing along the general path of 
reduced imbalances baker said 
he said the united states has made progress in reducing its huge 
federal budget deficits something other countries have long urged 
baker singled out japan west germany and britain for praise in 
efforts to stimulate their domestic economies as a way of keeping 
the global economy growing 
bakers comments were echoed by other finance ministers who 
also dismissed the february jump in the deficit as an aberration 
but the swift drop in the dollars value raised questions of how 
successful countries will be over the long term in keeping the 
dollar at its present levels many economists have forecast that 
the dollar will eventually have to decline more to solve americas 
trade problems 
in their dec 22 accord the countries pledged to keep the 
dollar stable around current levels while the governments have 
never been specific about just what those levels were speculation 
has put the lower limit for the dollar at 125 yen 
after it fell below that level thursday west german finance 
minister gerhard stoltenberg was asked whether the countries would 
have to accept a new level for the dollar 
that is a very good question a thousanddollar question he 
answered 
the dollar turmoil also raised the possibility that the federal 
reserve would be forced to tighten interest rates further in this 
country to defend the dollar higher us interest rates while 
slowing the american economy are seen as a positive for the 
greenback because foreign investors are able to earn more on their 
dollardenominated investments 
karl otto poehl head of the west german central bank 
sidestepped questions about whether the fed should tighten up 
during a speech to the national press club 
with federal reserve chairman alan greenspan looking on poehl 
said i dont want to comment on american monetary and fiscal 
policies he said he believed that his country had done its part 
to stimulate world growth by lowering west germany interest rates 
as far as our monetary policy is concerned we couldnt have 
done more we have the lowest interest rates in the world and 
it would be irresponsible to pursue more expansionary monetary 
policies poehl said 
it was a heated dispute between baker and the west germans last 
year over interest rates which has been cited as one of the 
contributing factors to oct 19 stock market plunge 
since that time world finance leaders have gone out of their 
way to stress harmony and coordinated efforts to keep the global 
economy from toppling into another recession

frontons in the united states 
aries said there have been no decisions from the hartford and

involving the seating of blind people on airlines 
in the latst incident james gashel director of governmental

taken into custody thursday at ohare international airport after 
he refused to leave his seat in an emergency exit row on a united 
airlines flight bound from chicago to denver 
united attorneys later withdrew the complaint alleging criminal 
trespass pending a review of the case and gashel was released 
said chicago police sgt robert degraff 
gashel 41 who was on his way to a conference in boise idaho 
says united knew he was blind when they assigned him the seat and 
ordered him to move to harass him 
im not a safety hazard to anybody so i dont believe that 
theres a basis for requiring me to move he said in a telephone 
interview from ohare late thursday i didnt like being singled 
out that way 
mr gashel was adamant in his refusal to leave or to change 
seats and united susbequently canceled the flight the sergeant 
said 
the dc8 with 200 passengers was scheduled to leave at 3 pm 
cdt passengers were put on a later flight which left at 426 pm 
said united spokesman joe hopkins 
hopkins said uniteds policy is not to seat blind people in 
emergency exit row seats because theyre normally not manned by 
crew members if there were a fire in the wing area the blind 
person might be unable to assess the situation 
also if we had to evacuate the plane it could slow the 
evacuation hopkins said adding that the federal aviation 
administration says plane evacuations must take no longer than 90 
seconds 
i dont know the mechanics of how he got that seat hopkins 
said once we realized what had happened we attempted to 
relocate him to conform to our policies 
in a similar incident a blind attorney from iowa was arrested 
march 31 on a midway airlines flight at the washingtonnational 
airport after she refused to move from a smoking section seat into 
an exit area seat said mary ellen reihing a spokeswoman for the 
baltimorebased federation 
it is becoming clear to us that the pattern is deliberate our 
leaders some who move with canes are being assigned those 
seats and being forced to move from them it is a clear attempt to 
be be harassed she said 
some airlines say we cant sit in exit rows some say we have 
to sit in exit rows said steven benson president of the 
federations illinois chapter we regard it as blatantly 
discriminatory 
hopkins denied the allegation saying theyre after the 
publicity 
gashel meantime planned to fly to denver today on another 
airline 
i dont believe in going along with violating a law he 
said i wasnt causing a delay i feel sad that united airlines 
caused a delay for other passengers and me i feel about as sad 
about that as other passengers 
how do i get justice

about 200 of the students marched to the home of chancellor 
joseph duffey who imposed the ban last week no arrests were 
reported the chancellor was out of town 
students sang give booze a chance to the tune of give 
peace a chance 
this could definitely get out of hand but everyone here is a 
responsible drinker said student tim hopper 19 
deirdre ling vice chancellor for university relations and 
development stood outside duffeys house as long as its a 
peaceful demonstration students have the right to express their 
opinion she said 
students began defying the ban en masse wednesday when nearly 
1000 marched on the administration building 
students who are of legal age have the right to drink 
responsibly at public events said michael d ross president of 
the campus republican club which sponsored the wednesday rally

a suspected member of japans terrorist 
red army charged with possessing three homemade bombs was turned 
over thursday to federal authorities trying to determine what he 
planned to do with the explosives 
the 35yearold suspect who was identified by officials in his 
native japan through fingerprints as yu kikumura is listed by the 
japanese foreign ministry as a suspected member of the leftwing 
red army 
us officials said they had not yet established ties between 
kikumura and any group 
we have a lot of unanswered questions that we have to 
answer said john c mcginley agent in charge of the fbi office 
in newark 
kikumura was arrested tuesday at a new jersey turnpike service 
area in ridgefield after a state trooper found three bombs in his 
car officials said 
superior court judge charles digisi released kikumura to federal 
agents without setting bail thursday kikumura was taken to a new 
york city jail to be held for a hearing friday before a us 
magistrate in newark 
in a complaint filed in us district court by the fbi 
authorities charged kikumura with possessing a fraudulent visa and 
unregistered firearms if convicted he faces up to 260000 in 
fines and up to 15 years in prison 
state and federal officials heading a terrorist task force said 
thursday they have little information about kikumura and what he 
planned to do with the bombs 
mcginley said kikumura had not spoken to federal officials since 
being taken into custody 
according to japanese authorities kikumura was acquitted in a 
japanese court in 1986 of charges of possessing dynamite in his 
luggage at an airport in the netherlands which deported him 
the japanese news agency kyodo reported that kikumuras arrest 
tuesday had raised suspicions the red army might be planning 
attacks during the summit of leaders of advanced industrial nations 
june 19 in toronto canada 
the red army which advocates simultaneous world revolution 
and is believed to have members allied with propalestinian groups 
in lebanon has been linked to a bloody attack on tel avivs lod 
airport in 1972 that killed 26 people and the hijacking of a japan 
air lines plane in 1977 
the group has been largely inactive in the 1980s but south 
korean officials have expressed concern it might revive its 
terrorist activities at the olympics in september 
state police superintendent col clinton pagano said the 
terrorist task force decided to investigate because of the 
sophisticated nature of the bombs 
these are the first devices of this type that we have come 
across pagano said neither federal or state officials would 
elaborate 
according to the federal complaint police said the bombs 
consisted of three 18inch steel cylinders there was a total of 15 
pounds of black powder in the car officials said 
us attorney samuel alito said authorities have learned 
kikumura acquired an international drivers license in the name of 
masatoshi kishizona on jan 20 
kishizono is a 36yearold employee of a hospital in kyoto 
japan who had reported his passport missing police said 
on feb 29 kikumura using a fraudulent passport bearing 
kishizonas name applied for a visa to the united states at the 
us embassy in paris alito said he said kikumura entered the 
united states on march 8

the senate voted overwhelmingly thursday to 
slap aid and trade sanctions on mexico for failing to do enough in 
the war on drugs ignoring a plea from president reagan and 
warnings that sanctions would do more harm than good 
the move on a 63 to 27 vote came after backers of the 
legislation said it would shock mexico into doing more to combat 
the growing drug flow coming across the united states southwestern 
border 
earlier the lawmakers had voted voted 54 to 40 against taking 
the same action against the bahamas 
similar bills were pending in the house but the measures were 
given little chance of being finally enacted into law because of 
remaining procedural hurdles in the house and a threat that reagan 
would veto any such measure to reach his desk 
sen pete wilson rcalif sponsor of the mexico resolution 
conceded that point but said passage in the senate would send a 
message to the government of mexico and added we are compelled 
to face reality 
opponents of the antidrug sanctions protested that both mexico 
and the bahamas while they can be faulted for shortcomings are 
making goodfaith efforts to halt the flow of drugs through their 
countries into the united states 
and reagan in a letter to senate leaders had argued that 
imposition of sanctions against mexico because would adversely 
affect every aspect of usmexican relations 
the mexican foreign ministry released a statement thursday night 
rejecting the senate vote as foreign interference 
it is a profound conviction rooted in our history and in our 
laws that it only falls to ones own people to define without 
foreign interference their institutions and that at all time only 
they have the inalienable right to conduct their destiny the 
statement said 
in addition the statement said no one has the right to 
impose from abroad conduct ideas political or economic systems on 
other peoples 
during more than five hours of senate debate several lawmakers 
suggested that backers of the sanctions were jeopardizing bilateral 
relations in response to electionyear political pressure 
its a great opportunity to show them were tough show them 
whos boss and that were against drugs said sen john chafee 
rri but he noted that the bahamian government has won praise 
from drug authorities for its cooperation penalizing the islands 
just doesnt make much sense he said 
senate foreign relations committee chairman claiborne pell 
dri noted that mexico is the third largest customer for us 
exports and that the united states gets 14 percent of its petroleum 
imports from its southern neighbor 
this is likely to have a serious negative impact on that 
relationship he said 
under a 1986 law countries identified as production or transit 
points for illegal drugs must lose half their us foreign aid 
unless the president certifies that they are fully cooperating 
with the war on drugs 
reagan made such a certification on march 1 for 17 of the 24 
countries on the drugtrafficking list including the bahamas and 
mexico 
after that certification several lawmakers in both the house 
and senate began efforts to undo it 
the purpose of this resolution is not to bash mexico but to 
defend the united states said wilson sponsor of the mexico 
resolution along with sen alfonse damato rny 
but one colleague suggested that the united states has little 
room to criticize its southern neighbor sen john mccain rariz 
noted that marijuana is one of californias largest cash crops and 
that new york streets are unsafe because of drugrelated crime 
i wonder if we shouldnt decertify those states and cut off 
federal aid mccain asked 
while neither the bahamas nor mexico receives substantial us 
economic aid losing the administrations drug certification could 
lead to loss of other benefits including lucrative sugarimport 
quotas airline landing rights and trade preferences 
of particular concern to mexico was a requirement that if 
certification is lost us representatives to international 
development banks must vote against future loans to the affected 
country the united states has a weighted vote on the banks but 
not a majority loans from the banks have been crucial to mexico 
which is laboring under a mammoth foreign debt 
mexico had sent private diplomatic signals that if congress 
persists in publicly embarrassing it through resolutions of 
noncooperation it is likely to evict us drug agents and wage 
the antinarcotics fight without outside aid according to 
congressional and diplomatic sources 
in other action the senate approved on a voice vote a 
nonbinding resolution to place haiti on the list of drug producing 
and transit countries subjecting it to greater scrutiny and to 
possible similar sanctions next year 
reagan in his letter said the impact of the legislation 
would almost certainly be an increase in the flow of drugs to the 
united states 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater had said earlier that the 
administration was aware of congressional concerns about the 
international drug trafficking problem but he said that reagans 
advisers were prepared to recommend that he veto any legislation 
imposing sanctions on mexico 
he said it was necessary to keep in mind the broader national 
security interests of our two countries and other interests such as 
trade immigration and so forth

the state of texas is talking with the folks 
who brought you the oil embargoes of the 1970s looking for ways to 
cooperate with the opec cartel in a bid to revive its struggling 
oil industry 
by itself texas is still the seventh largest producer in the 
world but its oil real estate and banking industries have been 
devastated since a 1986 oil price collapse 
texans cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand and hope 
everything is going to be ok says kent hance one of the three 
members of the texas railroad commission which regulates oil 
production in the state 
hance met earlier this month with rilwanu lukman the president 
of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and discussed 
the possibility that his state and the cartel would cooperate more 
contacts are planned 
hance told hartehanks newspapers on tuesday that cutting texas 
production to hold up prices is one of the things that has to be 
considered it would be one of the items we would discuss at 
opecs april 23 meeting in vienna 
we can do it to prevent waste he said in an interview 
thursday from austin 
from the 1930s to the early 1970s texas played the role that 
saudi arabia can play today acting as the worlds swing producer 
whose production stabilizes the price of oil the commission by 
controlling the amount of texas oil produced thus had a 
significant degree of control over prices 
that influence dissipated with the rise of the opec cartel and 
since 1972 the texas commission has allowed wells in the state to 
produce at 100 percent of capacity 
opec demonstrated its clout in 1973 when 11 arab member 
nations angered over the arabisraeli conflict slapped the united 
states with an oil embargo that produced gasoline lines all over 
the country 
hance said that in the discussions with opec we are not 
trying to seek an alliance or cartel we just want input our 
goal is one of stability 
but opec head lukman who is nigerias oil minister told apdow 
jones in vienna last week after meeting with hance in london 
exchanging information isnt going to do the trick is it 
last week hance said he had discussed a more effective output 
monitoring system for opec which has been plagued for several 
years by member cheating 
that point struck john lamont oil specialist in the washington 
law firm of lobel novins lamont amp flug 
noting that the commission for four decades had effective 
control over oil prices lamont said i dont want texas going 
over there and showing them how its done 
lamont said cooperation with the cartel by the commission would 
be probably illegal under antitrust laws but that was disputed 
by william baxter a former head of the justice departments 
antitrust division who is now a professor at stanford university 
law school 
the economic harm resulting from higher prices and reduced 
output is precisely the evil that the antitrust laws are aimed 
against said baxter but he added that it is fairly standard 
doctrine that the laws apply only to private action not action 
by states 
states also can file antitrust suits and eight did so recently 
against insurance companies one of the attorneys general involved 
robert abrams of new york was asked about the chances of a suit 
against texas should it cut production in concert with opec 
his spokeswoman nancy connell replied opec pricefixing has 
cost us consumers billions maybe trillions of dollars and we 
wouldnt want to see a state of the united states participating 
but she said abrams office would want to know more about texas 
law before commenting on any legal challenges 
mark sheehan spokesman for the justice department antitrust 
division declined to comment 
but a state department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said you can imagine what the reagan administration 
thinks about it its a cartel that does not operate in us 
interests 
on the record doug elmets press aide to energy secretary john 
herrington said its the departments belief and the 
governments policy that assistance to opec in its effort to 
manipulate the price of oil is not the correct approach 
texas had 201000 oil wells a third of the national total at 
the end of 1986 down 8000 wells from the year before the 
states 23 million barrels a day in 1986 the most recent year for 
which statebystate statistics are available was more than a 
quarter of us crude production totaling 86 million barrels 
current us production is about 82 million barrels and most 
analysts believe texas production is more than 2 million barrels 
several analysts poohpoohed texas chances of achieving 
anything by talking with opec 
its a joke said ed rothschild assistant director of the 
citizenlabor energy coalition a group which advocates 
proconsumer positions he noted that opec has had trouble 
controlling prices in recent years 
since 1981 this organization has been a crumbling 
disorganized battling group of countries he said when they 
agree on action it never works out within a month its back to 
normal price discounting 
arnold safer president of energy futures group inc a 
washington consulting firm said a plausible texas production cut 
to help opec might be 70000 barrels a day but he said another 
70000 barrels a day would show up pretty quick on world oil 
markets i guarantee it perhaps even provided by other us 
producing states

the first returnfiling season under the 
broadest us income tax overhaul in history closes out at 
midnight but the average american will have to work 20 more days 
to keep federal state and local tax collectors at bay for another 
year 
tax freedom day will come may 5 the latest date since the 
tax foundation began counting a halfcentury ago if the government 
took every penny you earned until your share of the total tax 
burden were paid the foundation reckons you would have to work 
the first 126 days of 1988 just to meet those obligations 
thirty years ago tax freedom day fell on april 10 
several million americans didnt have time to fret about such 
fanciful calculations they were working up to the eleventh hour on 
their 1987 returns and many were sure to be standing in line in 
front of mail drops as the midnight filing deadline approached 
any return not postmarked by midnight and carrying the correct 
postage could be subject to a late filing penalty 
the internal revenue service cautioned taxpayers not to ignore 
the deadline even if they cant afford to pay all the taxes they 
owe although failure to pay on time can result in one penalty 
failure to file can bring an additional one 
the irs estimated that about 62 million couples and individuals 
would apply for an automatic fourmonth extension of the filing 
deadline by mailing form 4868 with a check for their estimated 
taxes that is up about 20 percent from last year due in large 
part to all the taxlaw changes that must be reflected on returns 
being filed this year 
congress 1986 overhaul of the tax law changed more than 2700 
provisions and led the irs to create 48 new forms but the typical 
individual was unaffected by the great majority of those changes 
and has to use few if any of the new forms 
nevertheless taxpayers have been sufficiently confused about 
the new law to telephone more than 17 million questions to the irs 
and to order record numbers of explanatory publications from the 
agency 
the new law reduced tax rates significantly and nearly doubled 
the personal exemption to 1900 but it reduced or eliminated a 
number of deductions and exemptions including those for sales 
taxes medical expenses moving consumer interest and individual 
retirement accounts 
one of the biggest sources of confusion was the requirement that 
every employee file a revised w4 form so that the amount of tax 
withheld could be adjusted to mirror the new law many workers 
found the new form so complex that the irs had to revise it again 
eventually the irs announced it would not penalize any worker 
for failing to pay enough tax in advance on 1987 wages 
the irs itself is having trouble keeping up with the new law as 
recently as thursday it was issuing advice to taxpayers on how 
they might avoid penalties that were caused by getting the wrong 
answer to a tax question from an irs telephone assistor about 
28 of every 100 callers are getting wrong answers the irs concedes 
economists for the tax foundation say benefits of the 
acrosstheboard tax cut enacted in 1981 have been wiped out by tax 
increases voted in 1982 1983 1984 and 1987 
like the cheshire cat in alice in wonderland nothing 
remains but the smile the foundation said 
tax freedom day calculations by the tax foundation a washington 
research organization assume that individuals pay all taxes 
including those collected from corporations the economists simply 
divide all federal state and local tax collections among taxpayers 
and assume that every penny earned each year goes to government 
until tax obligations are satisfied 
last year tax freedom day was may 4 this years may 5 date is 
two days later because 1988 is a leap year 
if taxes were viewed on the basis of an eighthour work day the 
foundation said the average taxpayer would have to work 1 hour and 
50 minutes a day to pay federal taxes and another 55 minutes for 
state and local taxes thats two minutes longer for federal taxes 
than in 1987 but the same as last year for state and local taxes

a federal grand jury is weighing testimony 
from a wealthy couple who won a 50 million lease for justice 
department offices after arranging to pay a 40000 salary for 
attorney general edwin meeses wife ursula 
independent counsel james mckay on thursday personally 
supervised the questioning of howard m bender and his wife 
sondra before the grand jury something he does only when major 
witnesses are summoned 
bender spent about three hours before the grand jury his wife 
was there only an hour she left at the grand jurys normal 
quitting time indicating she might be called back the benders 
were accompanied by their attorney seymour glanzer 
mckay is investigating whether meese violated federal law 
through any conflict between his personal financial dealings and 
his government job 
although mckay said april 1 he did not have evidence to indict 
meese in cases involving telephone stock and a mideast oil 
pipeline thursdays appearance by the benders underscored the 
prosecutors other announcement at that time that he still had 
some cases to pursue 
meanwhile trustees of the multiple sclerosis society said 
thursday that they never voted on the plan to hire ursula meese at 
40000 a year with money donated by the bender family foundation 
the associated press reported wednesday that a partnership 
headed by howard bender won a 50 million lease on justice 
department offices after the bender foundation put up the money to 
pay mrs meeses salary at the ms society 
meese in atlanta to attend a drug conference was asked by a 
reporter about the matter but declined to comment during a later 
stop at an immigration and nationalization service center in 
decatur ga he turned aside several questions about the lease 
arrangement saying thats not on the subject of immigration 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday that he 
knew nothing about the lease but that president reagan still has 
full confidence in ed meese 
ms officials have said the bender foundation of which sondra is 
president donated the money in october 1985 to give mrs meese 
previously a volunteer the salary for three years mrs bender and 
mrs meese are ms trustees 
several ms trustees said they did not learn of that arrangement 
until newspaper accounts appeared in the last two weeks others 
however said the board had been advised earlier 
susan sikorski wife of rep gerry sikorski dminn said she 
first learned about mrs meeses salary when her husband read a 
newspaper account mrs sikorski a trustee said the issue of mrs 
meeses job was never discussed in any board meeting that she 
attended 
another trustee remmel dudley gave a different version 
i guess you might say it was reported to the board said 
dudley i cannot say that a proposal was put before the board 
discussed pro and con and then a vote was taken but we were 
informed that this had been proposed 
i was pleased dudley said i was told the benders had 
this foundation and they could make a contribution to ms or pay for 
someones salary or designate for a specific purpose we were 
delighted to know she mrs meese would be a fulltime employee 
because shes a worker 
the board meets quarterly and not all the trustees attend each 
meeting 
another longtime trustee who spoke on condition she not be 
identified said i was shocked i was aghast when i saw it 
in a newspaper she said she never missed a board meeting but had 
no idea mrs meese was being paid as ms development director 
attorney bryan barkley also a trustee said i dont recall a 
discussion at a board meeting about the plan to hire mrs meese 
he said it is not normal to earmark a grant for the salary of 
a specific person thats a little unusual but he added its 
not necessarily something the board would get into to vote on or 
ratify 
ms society attorney james bierbower said the arrangement was 
brought up in october 1985 at a special meeting to discuss 
expansion of operation job match a program to help ms victims find 
work mrs bender was at the session he said 
mckay has subpoenaed records of mrs meeses job at the society 
and is known to be interested in a 50 million lease renewal won by 
the bender partnership in may 1987 
most of the offices in the lease were occupied by the justice 
departments immigration and naturalization service which had 
complained about the buildings maintenance size location and 
security 
the bender partnership sold the building 13 days after the lease 
renewal earning a 226 million profit on a twoyear investment 
the lease was crucial to the sale the new owner said 
the bender partnership had bought the building in march 1985 for 
nearly twice its assessed value at a time when the government 
wanted to move more than a third of its offices elsewhere 
three months after the bender partnership purchased the 
building the reagan administration disclosed publicly that it had 
decided to retain the building 
an attorney for the meeses james rocap denies any wrongdoing 
on their part in the transactions but acknowledges that the 
benders and meeses know each other the benders refuse to discuss 
the matter publicly a key government official said meese played no 
role in the real estate decision 
other bender buildings have done business with the justice 
department government documents show that howard bender and his 
two brothers morton and stanley as a partnership signed a lease 
in june 1985 to give the government more space in a downtown office 
building one mcpherson square where it has leased several floors 
since 1971 
the justice department occupies part of one floor there

striking tv and film scriptwriters have 
agreed to go back to work under interim contracts at only two of 
the several independent producers that asked for relief from the 
walkout the union said thursday 
east coast members of the striking writers guild of america met 
in new york city on thursday to consider the request for relief and 
take an informal vote west coast members met wednesday vote 
totals were not released 
wga leaders had recommended against separate contracts because 
it could lead to divisiveness and destruction of morale among 
members wga spokeswoman cheryl rhoden said in a statement 
announcing the outcome of the vote 
however rhoden said the wga membership approved two 
exceptions the new smothers brothers comedy hour and ivan 
reitman productions which has produced such film hits as animal 
house and ghostbusters 
the exceptions were granted because of unspecified legal 
considerations and because negotiations with the two producers 
were more advanced rhoden said 
it was not known how many scriptwriters would be affected by the 
decision to enter into separate contracts with the two production 
companies 
rhoden could not immediately be reached for comment 
an unspecified number of independent producers had asked the 
union for separate agreements that would allow them to resume work 
some 9000 union writers went on strike march 7 over creative 
control and residuals from reruns and foreign distribution the 
walkout shortened the season for many primetime shows and stalled 
the start of some series 
there have been no formal negotiations since march 10 
herb steinberg a spokesman for tv and film producers said the 
producers had no comment on the guilds decision not to seek side 
deals with independent producers other than the two exceptions 
he held out little hope for mondays negotiating session 
there has been no change in our position steinberg said 
unless this new meeting carries a lantern with it we see no 
light at the end of the tunnel 
on thursday about 300 union supporters rallied outside the gulf 
amp western building where paramount has offices among those 
appearing were writer and director john sayles and writers ernest 
kinoy and horton foote

all three showed the tennessee senator still stuck in single 
digits far behind dukakis and jesse jackson in the threeman race 
his support remains essentially unchanged after spending half of a 
1 million budget on the new york campaign aided by prominent new 
york television consultant david garth 
gore campaign aides including manager fred martin contend the 
campaign will continue after new york no matter what 
but one adviser speaking on condition he not be named said of 
the prospect of gore staying in the race despite finishing a 
distant third here can he sure should he no 
gore managed to raise 330000 in one evening this week at a 
reception with rich city democrats at a fashionable manhattan 
hotel yet gore has a debt of 16 million so far and appears to 
be putting all he can raise into television ads he needs a 20 
percent primary showing to win a restoration of his eligibility for 
most future federal campaign matching money 
gore jumpstarted his campaign and became a serious contender 
with his victories in six southern states on super tuesday six 
weeks ago but rather than gaining momentum with his impressive 
showing gores candidacy immediately stalled as the campaign moved 
into the north his best showing since then has been 17 percent of 
the vote in wisconsin and in four other states he failed to do 
better than 8 percent 
trying to catch up in the few days left to him gore launched a 
vigorous attack on what his campaign regards as dukakis weakest 
flank his lack of experience in foreign policy he accused the 
massachusetts governor of a revealing blunder in answering a 
newspapers question on the scenario for use of americas nuclear 
arsenal triggering a tense exchange of charges between the 
campaigns 
gores attacks however run the risk of reinforcing an 
appearance gore has gained of a desperate perhaps shrill 
candidate 
he has faced an array of complicating problems in new yorks 
complex ethnicdominated political scene he has appealed strongly 
for the influential jewish vote and pointed to a record of support 
for israel but faced charges of pandering in the process 
gore also has faced a quiet campaign of opposition through the 
suggestion that opponents of jackson shouldnt vote for gore 
because by hurting dukakis they would enhance jacksons eventual 
outcome 
our thinking is gore would be better for jews in america and 
for israel the problem is wed rather have dukakis than give too 
much power to jackson said a brooklyn woman who would give only 
her first name rachel 
in affluent rye brook ann mcdermit of nearby white plains said 
i wouldnt want to help jackson in any way 
gore addressed that issue headon before suburban westchester 
democrats 
some people have said in this election that one must vote on 
the issue of fear a vote for gore is a vote for jackson gore 
said i ask you to vote on the basis of hope and leave your 
fears behind

for children born in the 22nd century the 
adage you are what you eat may need to be rewritten to read 
you are what your greatgreatgreat grandmother ate 
pcb contamination of people who eat tainted food is a problem 
than can span six generations a researcher told a house public 
works and transportation committee subcommittee on thursday 
a 20yearold woman giving birth to a child passes on sufficient 
pcbs so that even if all exposure to the substance were stopped 
i would still measure pcb in the body fat six generations in 
the future said wayland r swain vice president of eco logic 
inc of ann arbor mich 
swains figures suggest that at 30 years to a generation 
children born in the year 2138 would still suffer contamination 
from pcbs ingested in 1988 inherited through the female line 
pcb production has been banned for years but the substance 
believed to cause cancer continues to enter the environment 
through such sources as old electric transformers 
using earlier research into the transmission of polychlorinated 
biphenyls pcbs for short swain calculated the amounts of the 
substance passed to an infant through nursing and retained in the 
infants body 
he said an infant nursed by a mother who regularly consumed lake 
michigan fish which have been found to contain small amounts of 
pcbs would be exposed to 62 milligrams of pcb by the end of 12 
months and 53 milligrams would be retained in the infants body 
it is clear that infants nursed by mothers who have consumed 
lake michigan fish exceed recommended consumption guidelines for 
adults for their entire breastfeeding experience he told the 
subcommittee on investigations and oversight 
the level of pcbs retained by such infants in terms of body 
weight was more than seven times the maximum consumption level 
recommended by the food and drug administration swain said 
a mother passes pcbs to a child not only through beast feeding 
but through the placenta before birth swain said 
infants exposed to excessive pcb levels tend to be shorter have 
smaller heads be more likely to catch infectious diseases and 
exhibit an inability to focus on their surroundings swain said 
a recent decline in pcb levels in the great lakes has slowed 
recent research suggests with the substance circulating from the 
sediment into the water and back into the sediment again in a cycle 
of continuing contamination of the food chain

the dow jones industrial average plunged more 
than 100 points the dollar sank and interest rates jumped thursday 
after the government announced a 138 billion trade deficit in 
february the biggest since last october 
the dow jones average of 30 stocks skidded 10146 points to 
200564 a 48 percent decline it was the years second worst 
drop after a 14058point slide jan 8 
the value of us stocks fell 997 billion or 37 percent 
according to wilshire associates of santa monica calif 
the white house and most economists said the trade deficit was 
still improving in spite of the setback but the markets took the 
news badly anyway 
most traders had convinced themselves the imbalance between 
imports and exports would be less than 12 billion and they bailed 
out when the disappointing report hit at 830 am edt 
there was a lot of wishingmakesitso attitude people 
wanted to see a good number said carl b weinberg chief 
economist of high frequency economics he had predicted a 14 
billion gap 
the decline in the dow triggered a ban on a form of computerized 
program trading on the new york stock exchange it was the first 
time the ban has been prompted by a decline of more than 50 points 
last week it was triggered by an increase of more than 50 points 
the dow had climbed nearly 130 points from april 5 through 
tuesday largely on anticipation of favorable trade news the news 
killed that rally as declining issues outnumbered advancing ones 
nearly 11 to 1 on the nyse 
the trade deficit report also battered major foreign markets in 
london the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index fell 13 
percent 
in tokyo stocks fell sharply from their record highs at the 
opening of trading today but later recovered much of their losses 
the key nikkei stock average of 225 issues down more than 250 
points at one time finished the morning session at 2696783 down 
14352 from thursdays record close 
the dollar opened a sharp 17 percent lower against the japanese 
yen but later stabilized at that level on reports of heavy 
dollarbuying by the bank of japan 
in us activity the dollar had lost roughly 2 percent of its 
value against the yen british pound and west german mark in spite 
of heavy intervention by virtually all the major central banks 
big trade deficits tend to push the dollar down by giving 
trading partners an oversupply of the us currency 
interest rates leaped as pessimism swamped the bond market the 
trade deficit signaled to some investors that an overly strong 
domestic economy was sucking in too many imports traders also 
feared a weak dollar could push up import prices causing inflation 
and hurting fixedincome securities 
the treasury departments benchmark 30year treasury bond 
recovered about halfway late in the day as stocks were sinking but 
still finished with a decline of roughly 11 for every 1000 in 
face value its yield which moves inversely to the price rose to 
roughly 887 percent a threemonth high

the chairman of the taxlawwriting house ways 
and means committee has been hit with more than 2000 letters from 
angry befuddled taxpayers complaining about the tax changes he 
once billed as simplification 
even rep dan rostenkowski acknowledges now that the system 
didnt get much simpler he blames lastminute tinkering with the 
tax reform act of 1986 and he says the flood of complaints 
doesnt surprise him 
we have been waiting for something like this to happen 
rostenkowski dill said thursday 
but he said he had expected even more letters to arrive as 
todays filing deadline approached perhaps closer to the 10000 he 
got after inviting people in a 1985 television address to write 
rosty if they wanted simpler tax laws 
i must say its a dog that didnt bark as far as were 
concerned rostenkowski said there are very few individuals 
who are writing 
committee aides said most of the letters contain copies of an 
article in money magazines april issue lambasting parts of the tax 
reform act of 1986 
fight back the magazine said send a message to 
washington by checking off the boxes by the laws that outrage you 
ripping out this article and sending it to the top tax lawmaker 
the hon dan rostenkowski 
the article criticized nine tax provisions including a limit on 
the deductibility of individual retirement accounts elimination of 
a deduction for married working couples and a higher threshold for 
claiming medical deductions 
there is a lot of frustration out there and what were trying 
to do is address it landon y jones moneys managing editor 
said of the mailin campaign 
people are mad he said theyre mad about tax reform 
theyre mad about how long it took them to fill their forms out 
theyre mad about losing their ira deduction 
pointing to two huge boxes of mail aides said rostenkowski has 
gotten more than 2000 letters in a couple weeks with no end in 
sight from angry taxpayers 
in the name of tax reform and simplification the federal 
government has once again botched it wrote a couple from denver 
colo 
would you believe there are parts of this country where you 
cant support a family and live in a decent neighborhood on 50000 
per year said a letter from new jersey there are and the 
situation is worsening 
from kankakee ill being a middleclass american i feel 
that once again we are the ones supporting our government paying 
for public aid persons who could help themselves and carrying the 
wealthy people right along when can we expect a change in the 
attitude of the government 
the internal revenue service says the changes are not without 
benefits bringing lower maximum rates for most taxpayers and an 
increase in the average refund from 806 last year to 825 this 
year

always interesting the paul taylor dance 
company was not trying for pretty with its premiere of 
counterswarm at the city center thursday night 
consider taylors 1986 a musical offering danced in caveman 
costumes to bach or his 1985 last look danced by apparently 
insane spastics 
in counterswarm dancers proved they were up to taylors 
choreographed speed and athleticism 
music for the 25minute counterswarm is from the hungarian 
composer gyorgy ligeti and contains droning and shimmering tones 
the two swarms were eight dancers in purple and eight dancers in 
red 
the purple swarm dances first with elbows bent and close to the 
body and hands cupped like cobra heads they dart their arms out 
and back looking like snakes striking one couple dances with 
cupped hands together behind their backs they strut giving the 
appearance of peacocks 
a couple in red enters and dances briefly the man seeming to be 
subservient lifting the woman who maintains a regal posture the 
red swarm dances about with shoulders shrugging looking like 
chickens 
suddenly the red swarm turns futuristic arms shooting up and 
back like antennae on robots 
the purple swarm enters doing backward sommersaults then walks 
around with knees bent arms dangling like those of monkeys 
a woman in red and two men in purple dance looking like insects 
after a blackout a short final section has everybody on stage 
for a not very serious war one person in red and one in purple 
rush together and bump stomachs 
one couple grappled arms in an unfriendly stance as the curtain 
fell 
we dont know what counterswarm represented but it didnt 
represent either the lyrical or humorous more fun side of paul 
taylor 
the company dances at the city center through may 1

a committee of bishops urges the roman 
catholic church to continue its conditional acceptance of 
nuclear weapons saying they have been a significant factor in 
preventing nuclear war 
in a dangerous world a world of both widespread nuclear 
knowledge and extensive nuclear arsenals we find condemning 
nuclear deterrence too drastic a solution and embracing it too 
simple a response the committee said in a report to their fellow 
bishops 
as a result the committee added the best moral evaluation is 
neither to condemn deterrence outright nor to accept it as 
selfregulating or normal 
the report calls deterrence a significant factor in preventing 
the use of nuclear weapons and said it has contributed to a 
more cautious posture of the two nuclear powers in world affairs 
the church adopted the conditional acceptance posture in 
1983 
the bishops in urging its continuation called the meeting of 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev last december 
the beginning of responsible statesmanship 
they said it raised cautious hopes that an authentically new 
opportunity for redefining the political relationship of the 
worlds two major military powers may be at hand 
the committee said the churchs acceptance of nuclear deterrence 
should be based on seven points one of which is significant 
reductions in strategic armaments which exceed the requirements of 
secondstrike deterrence 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago headed the committee which 
worked for two years to produce the report the committee will 
continue to receive recommendations before issuing a final version 
to be submitted to the next general meeting of american bishops in 
collegeville minn june 2427 
our publics share a certain tragic destiny the bishops 
said we are both targets the possibility of a future for our 
children is always an open question because the weapons that 
threaten both nations are absolute weapons publics can hope 
but governments must act 
despite the uncertain promise brought about by a better 
relationship between the united states and the soviet union 
there stands the historical fact of major additions to the 
strategic arsenals of both superpowers weapons whose character and 
numbers decidedly increase the danger of nuclear war occurring 
the report said 
this pattern of policy is not adequate to the moral danger of 
the age that these arsenals by miscalculation or mistake will 
escape human control and destroy in an hour the product of 
civilizations which it has taken centuries to build and shape 
the bishops said president reagans strategic defense initiative 
must be limited to research and development and not advanced to 
deployment and that the antiballistic missile treaty should not be 
cast aside or overridden they said each step in sdi should first 
be evaluated for its consequences in the arms race and that 
spending for the program be judged in relationship to the basic 
human needs of the poor in our country and in other nations 
said the bishops we cannot avoid our responsibility to lift 
up the moral dimensions of the choices before our world and 
nation

polls in the last week before the new york 
primary show massachusetts gov michael dukakis well ahead of jesse 
jackson in the race for the democratic presidential nomination and 
sen albert gore jr mired in single digits 
dukakis had the highest measure of support at 49 percent in an 
abc newswashington post poll released thursday the poll also gave 
jackson his highest numbers at 34 percent 
dukakis led jackson by 45 percent to 28 percent in a cbs news 
poll and 46 percent to 34 percent in a marist college poll also 
released thursday 
gore had only 8 percent support in the first two polls and 7 
percent in the third 
certainly nothing much moved this week except for solidity to 
the frontrunners said marist pollster lee miringoff 
a marist poll last week had dukakis at 47 percent jackson at 31 
percent and gore at 6 percent virtually the same results as the 
new marist survey conducted by telephone monday and tuesday among 
359 likely democratic voters 
dukakis strong support went from 53 percent to 67 percent 
jacksons became nearly unshakeable moving from 67 percent to 82 
percent strong 
gores strength remained at about 40 percent despite the 
tennessee senators aggressive campaign style and a television 
advertising budget that aides hope will reach 1 million 
in another bad sign for gore the jewish voters surveyed by 
marist still supported dukakis overwhelmingly despite efforts by 
the gore campaign to win them over by taking a hard proisrael line 
on middle east issues 
seventy percent of the jews in the marist poll backed dukakis 
just 12 percent chose gore and 6 percent favored jackson jews 
account for up to a quarter of the democratic primary vote in new 
york 
the marist poll found jackson with his customary overwhelming 
black support and support from about 16 percent of white voters 
the number really needs to reach into the 20s in order for him to 
overtake dukakis miringoff said 
the polls did indicate some room for movement 5 percent were 
uncommitted and 8 percent undecided in marists poll 8 percent 
uncommitted and 11 percent undecided in the cbs survey the 
abcpost poll had 6 percent favoring some other candidate and 2 
percent undecided 
the cbs poll was conducted by telephone monday through wednesday 
among 581 likely democratic voters and has a margin of error of 4 
percentage points the abcpost poll was conducted by telephone 
wednesday among 176 likely voters and has a margin of error of 9 
points 
the marist poll has a margin of error of 5 percentage points

here is a comparison of some major spending 
categories in the 11 trillion fiscal 1989 budgets proposed by 
president reagan and passed by the house and senate 
the comparison does not include automatically allocated 
expenditures such as social security and medicare benefits but 
does include administrative costs the figures are cash outlays in 
billions of dollars the estimates provided by the senate budget 
committee 
the senate approved a late amendment increasing outlays for the 
war on drugs by 14 billion in fiscal 1989 the spending spread 
over several categories is not included in these estimates

for the last century or so mankind has been 
engaged in an unintentional experiment with the earths climate 
the results should be available soon a scientist reports today 
warming of the earth caused by industrial gases spilled into 
the atmosphere could soon be large enough to measure with 
assurance said v ramanathan of the university of chicago 
thus the greenhouse theory of climate change has reached the 
crucial stage of verification because of the inadvertent experiment 
being performed on the atmosphere by human activities ramanathan 
reported in the journal science 
in a decade or two we should start to see something if not 
then its time to go back to the drawing boards ramanathan said 
in a telephone interview 
the one fly in the ointment he cautioned is that the 
relatively small changes seen so far have occurred in steps and not 
gradually 
thus if climate waits until the gases build up to a point to 
kick over a change it may take longer to see warming he said 
in that case significant changes might take 20 to 50 years he 
said 
signs could include larger temperature rises in polar areas than 
near the equator less precipitation in the middle latitudes where 
many crops are grown and a rise in ocean levels ramanathan said 
industrial gases can lead to climate change because they act 
somewhat like the glass of a greenhouse allowing energy from the 
sun to come to earth but trapping some of the heat that previously 
would have radiated back out into space such gases include carbon 
dioxide methane nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons 
this trapped energy drives the earths climate out of balance 
says ramanathan 
if the increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere continues 
he adds the cumulative surface warming would in the next two 
decades become large enough to manifest itself unambiguously 
the predicted changes during the next few decades could far 
exceed the natural climate variations in historical times he 
wrote 
measurements over the last century or so indicate that the 
planet has warmed about 1 degree fahrenheit that amount of change 
could just be part of the natural variation in climate he said 
but if concentrations of greenhouse gases continue increasing 
theoretical models indicate the warming could total as much as 8 
degrees fahrenheit during the next century a change ramanathan 
termed unprecedented 
still in question though are the consequences of such a change 
for example the warming could cause some melting of polar ice 
a process that would tend to accelerate the warming even more by 
increasing the sunlight absorbed by the darker underlying water or 
land surfaces ramanathan reported 
ice melting could cause an increase in ocean levels causing 
widespread flooding of coastal areas scientists have warned and 
many have expressed concern that the warming could cause changes in 
general weather and climate patterns 
another area of uncertainty ramanathan wrote is that of cloud 
formation 
warmer temperatures might increase the water evaporated to form 
clouds 
those clouds might reduce the incoming energy by brightening the 
planets surface and reflecting more sunlight back into space 
causing a cooling of the earth 
yet clouds also are good at trapping infrared radiation headed 
back into space from earth thus they possibly could raise the 
surface temperature instead of cooling it

senate leaders say the chamber is not in any 
hurry to vote on the ussoviet treaty eliminating mediumrange 
nuclear weapons raising the possibility the pact may not be 
ratified before president reagan visits moscow six weeks from now 
im not driven by a calendar deadline i want first last and 
always to have a good treaty senate majority leader robert byrd 
dwva told reporters thursday 
the reagan administration has pushed for a ratification vote 
before reagans may 29june 2 meeting with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev but byrd said there is a possible hole in the treaty 
that first has to be filled 
that question revolves around whether the treaty bans socalled 
futuristic weapons using exotic technologies such as lasers 
plasma or ion beams 
sen john warner of virginia ranking republican on the armed 
services committee said the treaty is not likely to come to the 
senate floor before early may after the chamber returns from a 
weeklong recess 
when the senate finally votes ratification is probable 
according to both byrd and republican leaders ratification 
requires a vote of 67 of the 100 senators and both parties say the 
treaty will likely be supported by 88 to 90 senators 
the armed services committee has been meeting behind closed 
doors with administration officials including chief treaty 
negotiator maynard glitman to try to resolve the issue of which 
technologies are banned 
the treaty doesnt mention futuristic weapons but glitman and 
administration officials have said the soviet union understands the 
pact bars the possession or flight testing of all mediumrange 
weapons no matter how they are armed or operate 
the armed services panel has already endorsed the pact but it 
is planning to issue another report on the futuristic weapons 
issue and byrd said no floor action is likely before that report 
is done 
two former top reagan administration officials said in letters 
released thursday they dont believe the treaty bans futuristic 
weapons 
the pair former defense secretary caspar weinberger and former 
arms control and disarmament agency director kenneth adelman 
outlined their views in letters to the armed services committee 
weinberger wrote i can simply state that there was no 
understanding of any kind that i knew about that the treaty covered 
anything related to these socalled futuristic weapons 
certainly there was no discussion or evaluation of the 
military sufficiency questions involved in banning futuristic 
weaponry that i ever participated in and i never heard any others 
having such a discussion said weinberger 
indeed had there been any suggestions that futuristic 
weapons were banned i would have opposed it in the strongest 
possible terms because it would have had an obvious adverse effect 
on the strategic defense initiative for us to agree to any 
limitation on any systems not yet designed or futuristic systems 
weinberger said 
adelman said he never knew about any such ban that was discussed 
in national security council meetings he attended or in any 
meeting with soviet officials with which i am familiar 
meanwhile howard phillips chairman of the conservative caucus 
a private group announced a nationwide campaign to defeat the 
treaty or to delay the senate vote 
phillips said black umbrellas emblazoned with antitreaty 
rhetoric would be sent to all senators to symbolize the campaign 
open the umbrella symbolizes the protective shield which for 
more than four decades has prevented soviet domination and 
intimidation of europe said phillips 
closed the umbrella today symbolizes the spirit of 
appeasement and the lack of resolve which characterized british 
prime minister neville chamberlains dealings with adolph hitler 
at munich precisely 50 years ago

costa rican president oscar arias is urging 
president reagan to tell soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev at 
their summit meeting that continuing soviet weapons shipments to 
central america are undermining peace efforts in the region 
arias rejected soviet denials that they are supporting rebels in 
guatemala and el salvador and said a stable peace in central 
america may be beyond reach if the kremlin does not change its 
policy 
arias said thursday that secretary of state george p shultz 
should prepare for the moscow summit next month by meeting with the 
five central american foreign ministers nicaraguas included 
such an encounter would end a threeyear freeze on substantive 
diplomatic contacts between the united states and nicaraguas 
leftist government 
us officials insisting on anonymity said there is no 
prospect for a meeting along the lines proposed by arias unless the 
sandinista government demonstrates a clear will to negotiate 
seriously with the contra rebels when talks on a permanent 
settlement are held 
us special envoy morris busby sounded out leaders from four 
central american countries friendly to the united states last week 
and they generally agreed the time was not ripe for a regional 
consultation that would include the united states and nicaragua 
the officials said 
arias himself had expressed that view last week and one us 
official expressed surprise that the costa rican leader had made 
the proposal thursday without reference to the qualifications he 
had made in his talks with busby 
arias author of the central american peace plan talked about 
his proposal during a luncheon appearance before the american 
society of newspaper editors and later discussed it with vice 
president george bush 
at the luncheon he was sharply critical of the soviet union 
following the congressional cutoff of us military aid to the 
nicaraguan rebels in february arias sent an open letter to 
gorbachev appealing for similar soviet restraint he said he 
received a response from the soviet foreign ministry that contained 
a lot of cynicism 
the soviets denied sending aid to leftist rebels in el salvador 
and guatemala and also said they were supporting nicaraguas 
leftist government militarily because the united states was 
supplying its allies in the region arias said 
he said it is quite obvious that both cuba and the soviet 
union are supporting the leftist insurgencies in el salvador and 
guatemala in violation of the peace plan the five central american 
president signed last august 
the reagan administration has accused cuba of sending weapons to 
leftist forces in the region but has not made the same allegation 
recently about the soviets 
cuban president fidel castro said recently that his country 
provides political and moral support to the salvadoran rebels 
but that there is no need to send them weapons because they are 
selfsufficient 
arias said he decided to write to gorbachev and not to castro 
because the cuban leader would not be sending weapons to central 
american insurgents without the kremlins consent 
in his prepared remarks arias said the soviets send military 
supplies worth millions to central america 
we ought to obligate the soviet union to rectify its policy 
about central america and we need for it the political backing of 
all friendly nations he said 
the coming withdrawal of russian troops from afghanistan 
provides hope for the political rectification needed in central 
america 
the reagan administration has said the soviets sent about 450 
million in military supplies to nicaragua last year and that 
shipments over the first two months this year were above the 
comparable period in 1987

senate passage of a 11 trillion fiscal 1989 
budget sets up a battle with the house over domestic spending and 
how far congress can stray from its deficitreduction pact with 
president reagan 
this years budget debate is framed by the bipartisan agreement 
with the president which sets out limits for taxes and major 
spending categories 
both the house and senate have now passed budgets obeying the 
pacts spending caps of 294 billion for the military and 161 
billion in foreign aid and neither chamber included tax increases 
beyond the 14 billion enacted last december 
so when the two sides begin meeting next week to resolve their 
differences the focus will be on domestic programs 
the senate plan approved thursday by a 6926 vote is similar 
to the house plan in supporting large increases in spending on aids 
research education and aviation safety both also reject reagans 
request to terminate several domestic programs 
but the senate plan is closer to the presidents in several 
areas it contains sharp increases for the space program and 
science the house last month opted for more modest boosts in those 
areas in order to better protect mass transit housing and 
development programs 
both plans fudge the numbers in order to claim they stay within 
the domestic spending limits but they do it in different ways 
the house voted to use what senate budget committee chairman 
lawton chiles dfla called creative accounting simply 
declaring that some expenses were not covered by the agreement 
the senate eager to make room for a new 26 billion antidrug 
program but unwilling to make cuts elsewhere in the budget at the 
last minute set up a special fund declaring the money wouldnt be 
tapped unless a dire emergency were declared the budget simply 
doesnt count that spending yet 
still budget leaders from the two chambers said they hoped to 
reach agreement quickly 
there are obvious differences house budget committee 
chairman william h gray iii dpa said in a written statement 
with good will i am sure these differences can be resolved 
chiles said the talks between the two chambers would begin next 
week and he hoped go quickly 
but sen pete v domenici of new mexico the senior republican 
on the budget committee said it is a more formidable challenge 
than i thought it would be in the wake of the deficit agreement 
the budget is a congressional resolution which does not require 
the presidents signature but it guides lawmakers as they pass 
their annual fiscal legislation 
congress has a selfimposed deadline of april 15 for finishing 
the budget it has failed to meet the deadline again but things 
are closer to being resolved at this date than they have been in 
recent years 
there was no expression of concern in either the house or senate 
about the tardiness while millions of taxpayers must file their 
returns by midnight tonight or face a penalty theres no 
punishment for the lawmakers if they dont figure out on time how 
to spend the tax dollars 
those tax dollars still dont cover government expenses in 
either the administrations or congress budgets but they all 
claim to meet the 136 billion deficit target of the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing law 
sen j james exon dneb said even those deficit numbers were 
based on toooptimistic white house estimates of a growing economy 
the wreckage of our fiscal policy will haunt the next 
president and presidents to come he said

tourists at philadelphias independence 
national historical park arent getting the whole story about the 
birth of the nation says a group fighting for us recognition of 
a burial ground for george washingtons army 
the 2000 members of the undermanned army were buried more than 
210 years ago in what is now washington square and they should be 
honored by making the square a national park a senate energy and 
lands subcommittee was told thursday 
washington square receives scant tourist attention compared to 
adjacent independence hall and the liberty bell 
how pathetic that these greatest of patriots were buried 
without even a headstone to mark their contribution philadelphia 
attorney malcolm lazin said the fact that washington square is 
not a part of our national park service is a disgrace to their 
memory and an embarrassment to all who pride themselves on being an 
american 
in 1777 john adams later the second president wrote in a 
letter to his wife i never in my whole life was affected with 
such melancholy as at the sight of the graves and trenches adams 
wrote he had been told that upwards of 2000 soldiers were 
buried at potters field later renamed washington square 
only in 1957 was the flame of the tomb of the unknown 
revolutionary war soldier placed at the square 
now it is time that those who fought and died and are buried 
in unmarked mass graves in washington square should be honored and 
celebrated by the united states said william e w gowen of the 
pennsylvania society of the sons of the revolution 
sponsors have placed no price tag on the bill sen john heinz 
rpa and other backers envision philadelphia which owns the 
land leasing it to the national park service perhaps for 1 a 
year 
as the bicentennial of the constitution has just been 
celebrated we must not forget those who made it possible heinz 
said 
a similar bill was introduced by rep tom foglietta dpa 
during the previous session of congress it passed the house but 
was not acted on in the senate

thursday with members of congress in the annual days of 
remembrance program of the us holocaust memorial council 
the ceremonies at the state department also featured a hymn 
honoring gypsy victims of nazi atrocities prayers by protestant 
and catholic clergymen and an appeal from deputy secretary of 
state john c whitehead that america not turn its back on human 
rights abuses around the world 
whitehead said he was shaken by a visit to the auschwitz 
concentration camp in february 
do not forget and do not allow the world to forget the 
inhumanity of which mankind is capable when it denies the sanctity 
of human life he said 
whitehead said the united states should resist the recurrent 
american temptation toward isolationism and continue to work for 
human rights in other countries 
high standards of education and culture attained by the germans 
did not insulate them from the virus of religious and racial 
prejudice he said 
the council which was set up by congress in 1980 to build a 50 
million memorial in the district of columbia awarded an eisenhower 
liberation medal to retired gen james m gavin who commanded 
forces that helped defeat the germans and liberate wobbelin

eisenhower medal for being among the first us soldiers into 
wobbelin

citizens for standing fast and speaking out in the face of 
threats and violence perpetrated by the members of a neonazi 
paramilitary group the aryan nations which made its 
headquarters near the town in 1982 
constant vigilance is the price of freedom the towns award 
read 
stone who was a high school and college history teacher before 
being elected mayor in 1986 said he spent only a few minutes in 
the concentration camp but it changed his life 
he said he tried to instill in his students the conviction that 
this thing must not happen again 
the program included a ceremony in which six members of congress 
and six people who survived the wave of arrests of jews in november 
1938 lit candles 
helga lesser franks now an evanston ill travel agent wept 
as she participated in the candlelighting with rep john e 
porter rill 
she said later she was 11 when soldiers stormed through berlin 
burning her jewish school and the synagogue next to her home 
i cant help reliving it and being amazed that i am here 
now said ms franks she said she had never participated as part 
of a holocaust observance program 
the site for the holocaust memorial next to the bureau of 
printing and engraving has been cleared and construction is 
expected to take about 2 years

congressional proposals to raise the minimum 
wage and require employersponsored health insurance could save 
taxpayers millions of dollars in subsidies for the poor and 
uninsured according to a labor union study released today 
our study shows that the public picks up an enormous tab for 
those employers who pay their workers subpoverty wages and offer 
no health coverage the service employees international union 
said of its study of los angeles home care workers 
by the unions calculations passing the current minimum wage 
and minimum health bills in congress would reduce taxpayer 
subsidies to los angeles home care program by 327 million in 
1992 
the savings would be achieved through reductions in cash 
assistance medicaid and medicare and indigent care costs as well 
as higher tax collections from home health care workers the union 
said 
congress is weighing plans to increase the minimum wage from the 
current 335 to 505 in 1992 and to require employers to provide 
minimum health benefits to their workers 
the service employees union based its conclusions on a survey of 
1031 home health workers in los angeles county the workers 
roughly representative demographically of the countys 40000 home 
care employees earn an average of 372 an hour 
sixty percent of those surveyed had no health insurance and more 
than half needed public support through direct cash benefits from 
the government or health services from public hospitals and 
community clinics 
assuming similar proportions throughout the home services work 
force the study said public subsidies for cash and health 
benefits amount to 84 million a year federal dollars underwrite 
61 percent of these subsidies the study said 
the seiu study was released in conjunction with house hearings 
thursday and today on the health plan 
 
end embargoed material 
 
a socalled minimum health bill introduced by sen edward 
kennedy dmass and rep henry waxman dcalif has already 
cleared the senate labor and human resources committee 
it would require employers to provide a minimum health insurance 
package to people working 175 hours a week or more benefits would 
have to include hospital and doctor care prenatal and baby care 
diagnostic testing and catastrophic protection 
employers would pay at least 80 percent of the premium pool 
arrangements and a phasein period would make plans more affordable 
to small or new firms the senate version of the bill also says 
very small or new employers would only have to provide catastrophic 
protection 
there are an estimated 372 million americans without health 
insurance about twothirds of them are workers or dependents who 
would be covered by the kennedywaxman bill 
in testimony thursday to the house energy and commerce 
subcommittee on health chaired by waxman the us chamber of 
commerce argued that the kennedywaxman bill would cause many 
workers to lose other benefits and maybe even their jobs 
but the president of another business group cited a strong and 
growing trend of acceptance among many major companies 
with each month we hear from more members who think that a 
federal mandate is far from the worst alternative and many of the 
changes we wanted have been accepted said willis goldbeck 
president of the washington business group on health which 
represents hundreds of fortune 500 companies and other employers 
one smallbusiness owner told the subcommittee he feels 
ethically obligated to offer medical insurance he urged passage of 
the bill saying it would make policies more affordable and even 
the playing field 
in my attempts to be responsible now and in the future i am 
put at a competitive disadvantage against those employers who do 
not insure said john lester owner of a carpentry and 
construction firm in warren nh 
lester said he had been on the other side of the fence and 
experienced longterm debt when his wife became ill other 
uninsured employees also recounted their experiences with sporadic 
inadequate medical care and skyhigh bills

shrimpers nationwide have been granted a 
reprieve from federal regulations requiring them to outfit their 
vessels with devices to exclude turtles from their nets 
us district judge patrick carr in new orleans told the 
government tuesday to stop enforcing the regulations until the 5th 
us circuit court of appeals rules on a lawsuit filed by the 
louisiana attorney generals office and concerned shrimpers of 
louisiana 
shrimpers contend the devices are expensive cumbersome and 
would drastically cut the size of their catch environmentalists 
say they are necessary to protect endangered and threatened species 
of turtles 
carr upheld the regulations as lawful in a feb 29 ruling but 
decided this week to prohibit enforcement while his earlier ruling 
is appealed 
were pleased that judge carr agreed with the states argument 
that little harm if any would be done to sea turtles if shrimpers 
continue to trawl without teds turtle excluder devices until the 
case is finally adjudicated louisiana attorney general william 
guste jr said on learning of the ruling thursday 
we argued that shrimpers would have to go to great trouble and 
expense to equip their nets with teds he said the possibility 
remains that the appeals court will reverse carrs earlier ruling 
and not require shrimpers to use teds 
guste said louisiana shrimpers could lose up to 15 percent of 
their catches if they have to use the devices meaning less tax 
revenue for the state 
in his order this week carr said shrimpers have had trouble 
obtaining the teds and getting adequate training in their use 
we still maintain the regulations are valid and lawful and 
necessary to protect turtles said jay johnson an attorney for 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in washington 
were preparing the papers to seek a cancellation of his order 
and an expedited ruling from the court of appeals 
noaa drafted the regulations to protect endangered and 
threatened turtles most notably the critically endangered 
kemps ridley sea turtle johnson said 
im thrilled with judge carrs ruling this is the first major 
victory in the shrimpers battle to stop ted regulations and it is 
important recognition that the ted regulations are impractical 
said rep solomon ortiz dtexas 
noaa and the environmentalists will probably ask that the 
court of appeals to overturn this decision but i believe that the 
evidence is overwhelming that shrimper compliance is impossible 
said ortiz 
noaa was phasing in the regulations depending on location they 
took effect march 1 along the gulf coast on jan 1 in southwest 
florida near the keys and in october near floridas cape 
canaveral johnson said the regulations were to take effect for 
the rest of the atlantic coast may 1 
we know they dont work tee john mialjevich of louisiana 
president and executive director of concerned shrimpers of america 
said of the teds 
more than 100 shrimping vessels converged on the florida keys in 
february to protest the regulations mialjevich said 
elizabeth megginson an assistant state attorney general in 
louisiana said the devices would create enormous problems for 
shrimpers and the state which would have to help enforce the law 
louisiana has 32000 commercial and recreational shrimpers and 
there werent enough of the devices on the market to go around she 
said

israeli orders to demolish a 
new mosque being built by villagers in their spare time has stirred 
religious and nationalist passions in this west bank village 
hundreds of arabs formed a human wall around the dusty hilltop 
site thursday after the israeli military government ordered the 
mosque torn down because it was being erected without a permit 
if the bulldozers arrive they will have to bury us inside the 
mosque seif khatib 50 said as he and hundreds of other 
villagers surrounded the halffinished limestone building 
villagers claimed the permit was withheld to punish them for 
taking part in the 18week antiisraeli uprising and for refusing 
to accept israeliappointed leadership 
since dec 8 at least 146 palestinians an israeli soldier and 
a 15yearold jewish settler have been killed in riots in the 
occupied territories 
but israeli officials said they want to halt construction 
because the new mosque an annex to a 61yearold mosque was built 
over archaeological ruins that may help identify anata as the 
birthplace of a biblical prophet 
the military government approved a fourday reprieve hours 
before the scheduled demolition thursday but the dispute has 
produced strong antiisraeli sentiment among villagers 
the israelis dont want more mosques they are afraid it will 
help the islamic movement and because of the uprising they want 
to take revenge against us said khatib wearing a white prayer 
cap and a gray pinstriped robe 
minutes later an army jeep pulled up the hill and shouts of 
the soldiers are coming swept through the crowd village 
elders in white arab headdresses restrained hotheaded youths 
pushing toward the jeep telling them not to provoke the soldiers 
a lieutenant colonel climbed out of the jeep and toured the 
mosque with village elders the officer told residents that they 
had won a reprieve until monday when the military government is to 
meet with anata residents 
olivier rafovitch a spokesman for the military government 
indicated the demolition order might be canceled to avoid a violent 
confrontation 
we know religous matters are very sensitive and we are going 
to work out a solution rafovitch said 
he said a construction permit was denied because the mosque was 
being built on ruins from the byzantine roman hellenistic periods 
and even the iron age 
one of the mosques outer walls is a yard away from the roofless 
ruins of a byzantine church 
avram biran an archaeologist who has excavated sites in nearby 
villages said remains underneath the church might provide clues as 
to whether anata called anathoth city of refuge in the bible 
was the birthplace of the prophet jeremiah 
he noted that anata just northeast of jerusalem has been 
declared an historical site and that all building was strictly 
regulated 
but villagers claimed the military government was trying to 
punish them for refusing to accept israelappointed village leaders 
construction of the mosque began about two months ago to provide 
more space for worshipers who have been forced to pray in the 
streets surrounding the old mosque 
residents have donated material and about 200 villagers labored 
at the site in their spare time 
this is our mosque and i worked hard said 15yearold 
moussa abd saleh who helped carry bricks and mix cement 
it is a gift to god added khatib this land should be 
exempt from regulations

witchcraft is sweeping britain and must be 
outlawed so british children dont fall into the sordid sexual 
and diabolical grasp of those who practice it a lawmaker told 
the house of commons 
geoffrey dickens of the governing conservative party asserted 
thursday that many people convicted of child abuse had been 
involved in witchcraft initiation ceremonies 
people laughed when i spoke nine years ago about child abuse 
most people are listening now said dickens asking for a debate 
on the subject i now warn the house witchcraft is sweeping the 
country 
his comments were met with laughter from other lawmakers house 
leader john wakeham rejected the call for a debate but urged 
dickens to pursue the subjects he thought important 
later dickens said he would urge the introduction of 
legislation banning witchcraft with prison sentences for offenders 
these are extremely devious evil people he said if we 
are to protect children from their sordid sexual and diabolical 
grasp we must bring in new laws to wipe witches off the face of the 
earth 
he said he had evidence that a vicar in northern england had 
surveyed 300 14yearold pupils and 87 percent had said they had 
dabbled in the occult 
i have not gone mad he said this is a serious and 
growing problem which must be exorcised 
the crime of witchcraft was abolished in 1951 with the repeal of 
the 1735 witchcraft act

the head of the us forest service is 
defending a plan to log about half the oldgrowth timber in pacific 
northwest national forests saying such action is needed to 
maintain the regions forest products industry 
in testimony thursday before the house appropriations interior 
subcommittee forest service chief dale robertson predicted that 
oldgrowth timber would have to be logged on about 3 million acres 
in the next 50 years in washington and oregon because secondgrowth 
trees are too young to sustain the harvest 
alternatives dont exist if you want to maintain the timber 
industry in the northwest robertson said 
rindy obrien the wilderness societys director of government 
affairs said it was the most clearcut signal to date of forest 
service plans 
its not so much new as that they have finally been forced to 
talk about the numbers publicly said ms obrien 
the head of the subcommittee rep sidney yates dill likened 
the harvest of old growth to cutting down sherwood forest of 
robin hood fame 
are you stealing our heritage he asked robertson 
we will be protecting some of our heritage and the 
forestproducts industry robertson replied 
robertson said there are roughly 75 million acres of what the 
forest service considers oldgrowth forest in the northwest with 
about 83 percent or 62 million acres in national forests 
the agency plans to offer for sale about half those trees 
robertson said at present about 50000 acres of oldgrowth timber 
is harvested annually 
about 700000 acres of oldgrowth timber is included in various 
wilderness areas in the region and already is protected from 
logging 
are you going to cut ancient trees yates asked 
i dont know what they are robertson said 
yates then asked whether the forest service would cut tall 
beautiful trees 
yes robertson said 
yates said after the hearing that he was convinced there was 
enough other 
timber available in northwest forests to maintain a healthy 
forestproducts industry 
there are plenty of other trees they can use he said you 
dont have to build houses out of old trees i would hate like the 
devil to see these old beautiful trees cut down

an experienced skydiver who was killed 
after leaping from a plane without a parachute had forgotten to put 
on a chute before an earlier jump the same day a federal 
investigator says 
ivan mcguire 35 fell 10000 feet to his death april 2 while 
filming an instructor and student at the franklin county sport 
parachute center the fatal jump was his third of the day 
there was no problem with the first time during which he 
videotaped the jump of a student and instructor walter rigsbee 
an inspector for the federal aviation administration said 
thursday on the second he forgot to put on his chute but one of 
the other parachutists brought it to his attention before he 
boarded the plane 
mcguire made the same mistake when he boarded the plane for the 
third jump but no one noticed rigsbee said 
after viewing the tape mcguire made on that last jump 
investigators said it appeared mcguire had been reaching for the 
release pin of a parachute that wasnt there 
mcguires videotaping may have caused confusion rigsbee said 
the harness mcguire wore for the video equipment is similar to 
that of a parachute it has the same feel he said

convention approved by the united nations on dec 9 1948 
the senate ratified the treaty 8311 on feb 19 1986 but it 
could not be put into force without the criminal penalties

the government says birth control pill 
manufacturers have agreed to phase out highestrogen pills based on 
a finding that they are no more effective than lowerdose pills and 
could heighten the risk of blood clotting 
the food and drug administration said thursday the three 
manufacturers gd searle and co ortho pharmaceutical corp and 
syntex corp will phase out distribution of the pills over a 
sixmonth period to allow physicians time to switch their patients 
to lowerdose estrogen pills 
the action follows a recommendation by an fda advisory panel 
that the highdose pills those containing more than 50 micrograms 
of estrogen be withdrawn because of the heightened risk of blood 
clotting 
i applaud the responsible decision of these manufacturers 
fda commissioner frank e young said in a statement low dose 
contraceptives are quite safe and for healthy young women are 
considered to be the most effective reversible means of preventing 
pregnancy 
the most commonly prescribed birth control pills contain 30 
micrograms to 35 micrograms of estrogen and are not affected by the 
phaseout the ones being withdrawn contain from 75 micrograms to 
100 micrograms of estrogen 
they are sold by syntex as norinyl 2 and norinyl 1 80 by 
searle as enovid e21 and ovulen and by ortho as orthonovum 180 
and orthonovum 2 mg

the immediate harvesting of organs from infants 
born with most of their brains missing could threaten entire groups 
of patients who have lost the capacity for thought two medical 
ethicists say 
such a policy of taking the organs for transplant before the 
infants are declared brain dead also violates medical ethics said 
john arras and dr shlomo shinnar writing in todays journal of 
the american medical association 
because these infants called anencephalic inevitably die 
within days or weeks and many children require organ transplants a 
debate has begun over the appropriateness of using anencephalics as 
donors and how soon 
these arguments are by no means unique to anencephalic 
newborns arras and shinnar wrote in their commentary 
they are equally applicable to other severely damaged infants 
as well as adults in permanent vegetative states we do not believe 
society is willing to harvest organs from living patients who have 
permanently lost the capacity for intelligent thought 
anencephalic infants have a brain stem enabling them to 
breathe they have no cerebral cortex the part of the brain 
allowing thought and voluntary movement 
between 2000 and 3000 anencephalic infants are among the 3 
million children born in the united states each year the federal 
centers for disease control estimates 
organ donation is very laudable and people say these kids 
will inevitably die shinnar a pediatric neurologist at 
montefiore medical center the albert einstein college of medicine 
said in a telephone interview from new york 
but he added what if there are not enough anencephalics and 
the transplant needs are greater two years from now who do we look 
at next 
the debate intensified in october following newspaper reports 
that organs had been harvested from anencephalic infants and 
transplanted into other children in west germany and california 
in the west german case they took a baby from delivery put a 
tube of oxygen in its mouth took it to the operating room 
harvested the organs and buried it shinnar said 
and in the united states although it did not pass there was 
a bill in the legislature in california to have these children 
declared braindead at birth he said 
legal definitions of brain death used in making medical 
determinations require an end of all brain functions including 
those of the brain stem shinnar said 
in december the loma linda calif university medical center 
developed a medical protocol under which anencephalic babies are to 
be used for transplants only after brain death occurs 
six anencephalic infants were kept alive by respirator for a 
week under those guidelines though none ultimately became an organ 
donor said loma linda spokeswoman anita rockwell 
we wrote our article before the protocol was developed 
shinnar said and this certainly lessens the magnitude of the 
ethical debate 
but he said this protocol is not without its problems as 
well what about extending the tragedy for the parents of an 
anencephalic child 
anencephaly can be detected before birth with ultrasound the 
commentary said and some doctors consider abortion appropriate as 
late as the final three months of pregnancy 
should we be encouraging pregnant women in essence to carry 
these children to term to provide spare parts shinnar said

there was no signs of celebration in 
peshawars hot and dusty streets no shots fired into the air as 
people do in central asia when they are happy about something 
the soviets had just signed the red armys ticket home from 
neighboring afghanistan but the prevailing mood among afghan 
refugees encamped here for years was skepticism and indifference 
tanvir ahmad a taxi driver said agreement what agreement 
it will make no difference the war will end when the refugees 
go home 
in camp no 6 of the nearby border town of munda sat 34yearold 
israyal ghairad a school teacher from kunar province in 
northeastern afghanistan 
were not concerned with this agreement ghairad said of the 
accords signed thursday in geneva 
the afghan moslem guerrillas were not invited to the 
negotiations that produced the withdrawal settlement the accord 
was signed by pakistan afghanistan the united states and soviet 
union 
ghairad said pakistan and afghanistan are not the real parties 
to this war 
the afghan rebels say the conflict is with the soviets and not 
the government in kabul the afghan capital which they consider a 
kremlin puppet the guerrillas say no agreement is valid without 
their participation 
the sevenparty guerrilla alliance did not issue a statement 
after the signing thursday but said a resolution would be read 
saturday at a public rally outside peshawar the pakistani border 
city that serves as its headquarters 
the statement is expected to repeat the guerrillas position 
that they will continue fighting until the last soviet soldier 
leaves afghan soil the geneva agreement calls for the estimated 
115000 soviet troops who began arriving in 1979 to begin leaving 
may 15 and be out within nine months 
ghairad said we will wait and see if there is entire peace in 
afghanistan and the communists are no longer in power 
he said his family of five will not return home until he feels 
it is safe there and predicted the 5 million other afghan refugees 
in pakistan and iran would do the same 
tony land the un high commissioner for refugees 
representative in peshawar said it was too early to prepare for a 
return home by the refugees 
countries in both the east and west hailed the troop withdrawal 
accord as a vital first step toward peace and some offered to help 
afghan refugees 
but skepticism remained over some aspects of the agreement 
particularly continued aid to combatants 
the times of india an independent englishlanguage daily said 
in an editorial titled meaningless agreement 
moscow will be able to withdraw its troops without having to 
acknowledge the plain fact that it has failed to pacify afghanistan 
in the face of resistance by usbacked mujahedeen guerrillas 
but on the face of it the agreement will be pretty meaningless 
otherwise 
for it will stipulate that the americans and the russians will 
continue to be entitled to provide arms to their respective 
clients and while pakistan will formally agree not to interfere in 
afghanistans internal affairs it will in reality continue to do 
so inasmuch as it will still serve as a conduit for us arms 
supplies to the mujahedeen

three patients in 1000 were infected with the 
aids virus according to anonymous blood tests at four midwestern 
hospitals but researchers say that rate of infection doesnt 
necessarily apply to the nation 
the national centers for disease control attempting to gauge 
the prevalence of aids infection of the virus that causes aids 
tested blind blood samples from nonaids patients at 40 
sentinel hospitals in 30 cities 
in results from the first four hospitals enrolled in the 
program all in the midwest 03 percent of the 12000 tested 
patients showed signs of aids virus infection the cdc said in a 
report made public thursday 
the early data however may not be representative of the 
nation said dr tim dondero a cdc aids researcher you cant do 
a national estimate based on four spots he said 
federal health officials continue to estimate that between 1 
million and 15 million americans are infected with aids virus 
no new data have become available to prompt a change of this 
estimate the cdc said adding accurate estimates of the 
prevalence of aids virus infection in the entire us 
population are not possible at this time the agency expects to 
enroll all 40 hospitals in its testing program by september 
if 15 million of the nations estimated 240 million population 
were infected the rate would be about 06 percent about twice as 
high as the early cdc results one million americans would be about 
04 percent 
the four hospitals reported that antibodies indicating aids 
infection were more common among adults 25 to 44 rates also were 
higher for blacks and hispanics than for whites and higher for men 
than for women the cdc said 
those rates are comparable to national aids statistics dondero 
noted adding the data look right 
as of this week 59287 cases of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome itself have been reported in the united states according 
to the cdc the disease has so far killed 33060 or 56 percent of 
those patients 
the cdcs report summarized the agency quarterly presentation on 
aids to the domestic policy council last month the report also 
reviewed tests among prisoners and among childbearing women 
out of 29193 federal inmates tested by the us bureau of 
prisons since last june 843 or 29 percent have tested positive 
for aids virus infection that is little changed from a justice 
department announcement last fall when 3 percent of the first 
inmates tested were positive 
the cdc said it hopes to contract with the national institute of 
justice and with a major university for aids testing of 10000 
inmates at 10 state prisons beginning this june 
in 52326 tests of childbearing women in the state of new york 
researchers found an aids virus infection rate of 08 percent the 
cdc said in new york city one woman in 61 showed antibodies 
against the aids virus and 40 percent of those women passed the 
infections on to their newborn children the cdc added

earl clanton jr had pleaded for his life 
and even escaped once from death row but in the end he walked 
wideeyed and silent to his death in virginias electric chair for 
the 1980 killing of a librarian 
rebuffed by the us supreme court after his lawyers made a 
frantic plea clanton 33 was administered two jolts of 
electricity late thursday night and pronounced dead at 1107 pm 
outside the prison about 50 opponents of capital punishment 
conducted a vigil and prayer service they were interrupted by a 
single supporter of the death penalty who shouted pray for the 
woman that died 
clanton had been on death row since 1981 for the robbery and 
strangling of wilhemina smith a petersburg school librarian who 
lived in his apartment building 
on tuesday us district judge robert r merhige jr granted 
clanton a stay to review evidence of childhood abuse that the 
condemned man said he suffered attorneys for clanton said he had 
suppressed memories of the abuse and thus was incompetent to help 
his trial lawyer in offering mitigating evidence at the sentencing 
hearing 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
overturned merhige on thursday afternoon prompting a hurried 
effort by clantons lawyers to stop the execution 
the federal appeals court said that clantons case had been 
given least 10 reviews in state and federal courts and that his 
sentencing had been found constitutional 
on thursday night the us supreme court refused a stay in a 
72 decision with justices william brennan and thurgood marshall 
dissenting and gov gerald l baliles turned down a petition for 
clemency 
clanton was visited by his mother sister two aunts and his 
lawyers as the execution hour approached said c dwight perry the 
prisons operations officer 
he also was visited by jay north the 1960s child television 
star of dennis the menace north has been working on a movie 
about the 1984 escape of clanton and five other virginia death row 
inmates 
we became extremely close friends said north who opposes 
the death penalty weve been in contant communication wrote and 
called we became like brothers 
witnesses to the execution said clanton was wideeyed and 
impassive and appeared only a little nervous as he was led into the 
death chamber 
in an interview monday with the norfolk virginianpilot and the 
ledgerstar clanton complained about pressure being exerted by the 
state to have him executed at the scheduled time 
why kill me today and be wrong in just a few months later 
he said what is the urgency why such an urgency to take such a 
life 
in may 1984 clanton was one of six death row inmates who 
escaped from the mecklenburg correctional center he was recaptured 
the next day at a coin laundry in warrenton nc

people on lowcholesterol diets can reduce their 
bloodcholesterol level by eating oatbran daily instead of taking 
drugs which can cost three to six times as much researchers say 
but hold the milk 
the oat bran is not as effective as some of the pharmaceutical 
products in lowering cholesterol but its effective said dr 
john eisenberg one of two authors of a study published in todays 
journal of the american medical association 
adding a bran muffin or bowl of oatbran cereal to a daily diet 
can cost about 250 a year compared with some cholesterollowering 
drugs which can cost as much as 1450 a year he said 
the daily consumption of oat bran or other watersoluble fibers 
has the positive effect in people who maintain lowcholesterol 
diets eisenberg said in a telephone interview thursday from the 
university of pennsylvania in philadelphia 
researchers concluded that each 1 percent reduction in the 
cholesterol level translated into a 2 percent reduction in the risk 
of coronary problems such as heart attacks 
eisenberg and dr bruce kinosian of the university of 
marylandbaltimore performed a costbenefit analysis of three 
treatments oat bran and the drugs cholestyramine resin and 
colestipol being used for a clinical trial on 1900 middleaged 
men with elevated cholesterol levels the subjects had previously 
changed their diets to lower cholesterol intake 
daily consumption of oat bran or other watersoluble fibers have 
been shown to reduce the level of cholesterol by 13 percent to 19 
percent the range of most medications eisenberg said 
a few drugs lower cholesterol as much as 25 percent he said 
not all kinds of bran would work to lower cholesterol because 
many such as wheat bran are not water soluble eisenberg said 
cholesterol a form of fat contained in many foods is deposited 
in artery linings it can cause blockages and hardening of the 
arteries restricting blood flow and increasing the likelihood of 
heart problems 
for purposes of the trial an elevated level was considered to 
be at least 260 milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood serum 
over the sevenyear trial oat bran proved as effective as the 
two drugs in triggering cholesterol reductions but at a fraction 
of the cost the analysis indicated 
the maximum 19 percent reduction in cholesterol levels would 
lower the risk of coronary problems 38 percent 
including the cost of regular medical supervision a oneyear 
supply of cholestyramine taken daily was estimated at 1442 
colestipol at 879 and oat bran at 249 
if a person needs a certain type of prescription there is no 
way around that eisenberg said but as it turns out its 
probably more costeffective to start treating hypercholesterolemia 
with oat bran 
one note though if you use milk with the muffins or cereal 
remember that youre adding some cholesterol he said

as many as 25000 migrant workers have 
arrived in oregon more than a month before the strawberry crop is 
ready to pick and thousands are without food or shelter relief 
agencies say 
last year there werent enough workers to pick an early harvest 
of strawberries and 20 percent of the states crop rotted in the 
fields growers complained that mexican pickers were confused over 
the immigration reform act of 1986 and refused to cross the border 
this year social service agencies are stretching to help an 
estimated 18000 to 25000 early arrivals 
word got out that there were a lot of jobs and everybody was 
afraid there would be such a rush that when they showed up it would 
be too late said titus herman of the salvation army 
marta garcia who operates the house of zion emergency shelter 
in marion county said she often sees 50 or 60 people living in one 
room when they deliver food to migrant camps 
we have people in the backyard in tents we even have people 
staying in the camper of our pickup because theres no place else 
to go she said everywhere you see that they have no water 
no facilities many come here to take baths 
a washington county grower who asked not to be identified said 
many workers are asking farmers to sign papers saying they worked 
for them at least 90 days each year from 1984 to 1986 as required 
by the new law 
a lot of them cant get legalized but hope people will fill 
out the forms for them he said 
the illegal workers are just hoping and praying they wont get 
asked for papers that farmers will be lenient toward them mrs 
garcia said we bring it up to them all the time and they say 
its just the chance were taking 
david beebe district director of the us immigration and 
naturalization service said the law allows special agricultural 
workers to enter the country this year if they pay a 185 
application fee and promise to provide papers from former employers 
the law offers amnesty to illegal aliens who have been in the 
united states since before 1982 
the amnesty application deadline is may 4 a date that has 
confused some migrants the washington county grower said some 
workers arrived early because they believed they could not cross 
the border next month 
right now the strawberry crop looks very good but its 
still too early to say said the grower who is providing hoeing 
work for 15 to 20 people 
i think everyone in mexico now understands how the rules work 
they say theyre going to stay here were going to wait for 
the work i think they all realize that this is the last 
opportunity to harvest in the northwest

arab hijackers of a kuwait airways jumbo jet 
overlooked the us drivers license of an egyptianamerican who 
said he feared being harmed if his captors knew of his american 
citizenship 
on thursday more than 2000 kuwaitis attended the funeral of 
two countrymen killed by the hijackers many of the mourners said 
their country should never give in to the sky pirates demands that 
17 convicted terrorists imprisoned in kuwait be released 
ramadan ali a consulting engineer who travels widely and holds 
both egyptian and united states citizenship said he hid his us 
passport in his briefcase and showed only his egyptian documents 
one of them searched my wallet and there was my us 
drivers license ali said during an interview at the home of a 
relative in kuwait i was so lucky he didnt realize what it 
was 
he declined to give his american address because these guys 
they have long hands 
ali was one of 12 passengers freed tuesday night shortly before 
the hijackers of the boeing 747 flew from cyprus to algeria with 
more than 30 passengers and crew still aboard the kuwait airways 
plane was seized april 5 on a flight from bangkok 
ali who displayed bruises on his wrists said the hijackers put 
plastic handcuffs on the passengers while the plane was in mashhad 
iran where it first landed last week 
his eight days as a hostage left him nervous emotionally 
stunned and wary of flying ali said 
it became to me like a phobia he said it could happen 
again 
ali said the hijackers asked the branch of islam he belonged to 
sunni or shiite 
all of kuwaitis released so far have been shiites members of 
the branch that predominates in iran and southern lebanon but is a 
minority in the islamic world 
i was reading the koran all the time they noticed im a 
religious person he said speculating that might have helped his 
release 
on thursday a military honor guard escorted the flagdraped 
bodies of khalid ayyub bandar 20 and abdullah shibib alkhalidi 
24 into a graveyard in kuwait 
the two men were beaten shot and their bodies dumped on the 
tarmac at the larnaca cyprus airport where the plane sat for five 
days 
kuwaits crown prince sheik saad abdullah alsabah led the 
procession of mourners along a condolence line of more than 60 male 
relatives of the slain men 
even if they kill all the hostages there on the plane well 
never ever release the killers who are here in kuwait said one 
mourner faisal almarzouk chief editor of alanbaa newspaper 
like him many of the mourners supported kuwaits refusal to 
free the 17 proiranian terrorists who were convicted in a series 
of bombings in december 1983 at the us and french embassies in 
kuwait

both the us dollar and stock prices closed the 
week sharply lower in tokyo today following the announcement of 
worsethanexpected us trade figures for february 
the dollar closed at 12413 yen down 202 yen from its close on 
thursday but up slightly from its 12395yen opening level during 
the day it ranged between 12390 and 12422 yen in moderate 
trading 
dealers attributed the dollars fall to the 138 billion us 
trade deficit in february announced by the commerce department in 
washington on thursday 
the largerthanexpected us trade deficit prompted the 
dollarselling in early trading but the currency stabilized after 
reports of intervention by the bank of japan and due to 
profittaking by exportrelated industries said a trader at a 
major commercial bank who spoke on condition of anonymity 
kazuma takasugi of the bank of tokyo said the dollar had 
remained fairly stable during the day because participants were 
nervous about possible additional intervention by the bank of japan 
on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average of 225 
selected issues which closed at a record 2711135 points 
thursday lost 21778 points to end the day at 2689357 the 
decline came after four consecutive days of record highs for the 
nikkei index 
the overnight setback on wall street and the weaker dollar 
coupled with profit taking brought share prices sharply lower 
during early trading said taketomi kikuchi of sanyo securites 
toward the end of trading share prices eased mainly because 
of a waitandsee attitude toward the dollar and the coming 
weekend he said 
kikuchi said trading was calm with no concern among 
participants that the market had risen too far 
among the losers were exportrelated issues such as electricals 
and precision machineries some largecapital issues also moved 
lower 
volume on the markets first section was estimated at 1 billion 
shares down from 12 billion shares thursday declining issues 
outpaced advancers by 674 to 260 while 127 were unchanged

mail is a little musical out of place on a 
big broadway stage 
the show which opened thursday at the music box theater 
examines the anxieties of a sensitive 29yearold wouldbe 
novelist named alex who is having a midlife crisis 10 years too 
soon 
not exactly a novel idea for a musical but for much of the 
time the evening is fun in an obvious goodnatured sort of way 
seekers of sondheim significance and solemnity should look 
elsewhere 
the problem with mail is that the production relies on a 
gimmick to keep the story going and that gimmick falters during 
the second act no matter how busy director andrew cardiff keeps 
his actors and set designers 
the hook created by author jerry colker is simple an 
angstridden alex michael rupert disappears for four months and 
when he returns to his dingy new york apartment there is a pile of 
mail to open when he does the letters leap to life 
so does the complicated set designed by gerry hariton and vicki 
baral alexs letter writers jump out from behind doors walls and 
windows and pop out of the desk and bathtub one even makes an 
entrance through the refrigerator 
theres his bewildered girlfriend dana dumped just when she and 
alex were going to get married and franklin alexs best friend 
an idealist turned entrepreneur 
other correspondents include alexs gruff obnoxious father who 
wants his son to come back to the carburetor business in mineola 
long island and the writers vixenish literary agent who wants to 
get her client into bed before she gets him on the bestseller list 
their increasingly frantic missives are interrupted by overdue 
bills junk mail high school reunion letters and even sweepstakes 
announcements that sing and dance these interludes are among the 
best in the show its hard not to laugh when a contingent of con 
edison workers dressed in hard hats tshirts and short pants 
bully alex in time to a disco ditty called were gonna turn off 
your juice 
colker also wrote the lyrics for mail and rupert supplied 
the music with this large score nearly 30 numbers in all the 
duo makes good on the promise they demonstrated in 3 guys naked 
from the waist down an offbeat contemporary musical about the 
world of standup comics 
ruperts music for mail is eclectic ranging from pop to 
soul to ragtime to countrywestern the songs have a brash broadway 
sound the result of michael gibsons firstrate orchestrations at 
least one number a lament by the rejected girlfriend entitled 
its getting harder to love you would seem to have potential 
for a life outside of the show 
colkers amusing lyrics are more enticing than his slender 
story the tale starts to evaporate at the beginning of act 2 when 
alex has a momentous revelation he decides to see others as they 
see him that decision forces the letter writers to recapitulate 
their feelings about our hero its only a matter of time before 
alex neatly resolves his problems with each of them and with 
himself 
fortunately the show has been blessed with a fine cast rupert 
is a consumate hardworking musical comedy performer and he makes 
alex an ingratiating character we can care about 
mara getz as the lovesick dana possesses the shows best voice 
while brian mitchell the opportunistic best friend struts and 
swings with style only robert mandan as the insensitive father 
with problems of his own seems uncomfortable in the musical 
the show always seems to be in motion even when the story 
isnt most of the recent broadway musicals move but they dont 
dance grover dale has come up with some snappy if abbreviated 
dance routines recalling a style of musical comedy choreography 
that has gone out of fashion 
mail makes for a reasonably diverting entertainment 
especially if you dont think too hard about the wellworn message 
it delivers 
in other reviews 
howard kissel of the daily news writes this is a revue sketch 
idea that might have been amusing for 12 minutes the music is 
as facile and vapid as the characters who sing it 
but maybe someone should point out to young american writers 
that the world has many more appealing subjects than their not very 
interesting lives 
in the new york times frank rich asks is it possible that 
mail is a surreptitious advertisement for federal express

the mexican government rejected as meddling 
in its domestic affairs a us senate vote revoking president 
reagans certification that mexico was doing its part to combat 
drug trafficking 
the senate approved a resolution thursday that also would slap 
trade and economic aid sanctions against mexico but the measure 
stands little chance of passage in the us house of 
representatives and is almost certain to be vetoed by reagan 
in a brief statement thursday night mexicos foreign ministry 
rejected the us action as foreign interference in mexican 
affairs 
no power can claim for itself the right to certify the conduct 
of other societies or governments no one has the right to impose 
from abroad conduct ideas political or economic systems on other 
peoples the statement said 
under us law mexico would stand to lose american support in 
international lending institutions for new loans to the country if 
the resolution became binding 
the federal attorney generals office which is responsible for 
overseeing mexicos narcotics efforts to find and destroy drugs 
issued its own stronglyworded statement late thursday night 
insisting that mexico is undertaking a plain effort of 
international cooperation in the campaign against drug 
trafficking 
it expressed profound astonishment and its great displeasure 
with the resolution taken by the united states senate in that the 
senate does not recognize the enormous effort of the mexican 
people to combat a problem whose causes are not certainly 
attributable to mexico 
the statement cited the vast consumer market for drugs in a 
clear reference to us demand as sustaining the illicit narcotics 
trade 
mexico receives little economic aid from the united states but 
officials here are concerned about a requirement under 1986 law 
that us representatives in multilateral lending institutions must 
vote against future loans to countries whose certification is 
revoked 
mexico has a 105 billion foreign debt and depends heavily on 
its relationship with foreign lenders 
officials point out that about onequarter of mexicos 
100000member armed forces is permanently assigned to narcotics 
interdiction and eradication operations 
mexican officials also have insisted they could use more 
financial assistance from the united states in fighting drugs as 
recently as 1986 us antidrug assistance to mexico was about 
half that provided for eliminating the screwworm in mexican cattle 
more than 100 army troops and federal judicial policemen have 
been killed over the past 10 years during drug operations 
according to mexican army figures 
relations between the two countries have been soured by mutual 
accusations surrounding the feb 7 1985 kidnapping of us drug 
enforcement agent enrique camarena salazar 
the bodies of camarena and alfredo zavala avelar a mexican 
pilot who worked with him in antinarcotics programs from their 
base in guadalajara were found on march 5 1985 
american officials charged that mexican authorities were slow in 
seeking out and arresting several drug barons who allegedly ordered 
the killings 
attorney general sergio garcia ramirez has called for an end to 
mutual recriminations between mexico and the united states over 
their contributions to the fight against the drug trade 
we find it difficult to accept the opinion held in the united 
states of what really goes on in mexico garcia ramirez said 
the border is not a border between black and white good and 
evil it is a border between countries

hillside home and stood by while they murdered four people the los 
angeles times reported in thursdays editions 
ms holmes who divorced the actor in 1984 said in a recent 
interview with the newspaper that holmes confessed his role to her 
shortly after the slayings in july 1981 
however he said he didnt participate in the murders and never 
told her the names of the killers she said 
another woman who had a longtime intimate relationship with 
holmes and asked not to be identified said he made a similar 
admission to her the newspaper said she reported that admission 
to police in 1981 
together the womens stories corroborate the los angeles police 
departments theory of how the killings happened 
holmes who died march 13 at age 43 was tried and acquitted in 
a 1982 trial no one but holmes has ever been charged in the murder 
of ronald launius 37 william deverell 42 joy audrey miller 46

senators voted overwhelmingly to impose aid 
sanctions on mexico for its shortcomings in the war on drugs 
ignoring warnings that the move would damage relations with the 
united states thirdlargest trading partner 
this may be just the signal mexico needs to wake up before it 
is too late said sen alfonse damato rny a leader of the 
effort to slap penalties on drugproducing and transit countries 
that fall short in their enforcement efforts 
but in mexico city the foreign ministry released a statement 
condemning the senate vote as foreign interference 
in voting 6327 thursday for the sanctions the senate ignored 
vehement mexican objections and a plea from president reagan who 
had certified six weeks ago that the government there was fully 
cooperating with the us war on drugs and should receive all its 
normal us aid and trade benefits 
under a 1986 antidrug law countries identified as production 
or transit points for illegal drugs must lose half their us 
foreign aid and certain trade and lending rights unless the 
president certifies that they are fully cooperating with the 
war on drugs 
reagan in a letter to senate leaders warned that the impact of 
the decertification bill would almost certainly be an increase in 
the flow of drugs to the united states because it would insult 
mexico and make the government less inclined to cooperate 
in separate action the senate voted 5440 not to impose similar 
sanctions on the bahamas and approved a resolution adding haiti to 
the list of international drug producing and shipment points that 
are subject to close scrutiny and possible aid sanctions if their 
drug enforcement programs dont measure up 
legislation to slap aid sanctions on mexico and four other latin 
american countries also is pending in the house which would have 
to approve the mexico resolution before it could become law even 
supporters of the bill conceded the measure has little likelihood 
of clearing all the hurdles but said the symbolic value of the 
senate vote was enough 
its all rather academic said sen pete wilson rcalif 
the bills primary sponsor but by adopting this resolution we 
will be sending a message to the government of mexico 
the mexican government said the united states has no business 
sending that kind of a message 
no power can claim for itself the right to certify the conduct 
of other societies or governments no one has the right to impose 
from abroad conduct ideas political or economic systems on other 
peoples the foreign ministry statement said 
however sen dennis deconcini dariz said close to 40 
percent of the cocaine that enters the united states comes through 
mexico making the 1900mile border between the two countries the 
no 1 entry point for narcotics 
weve got to take off the gloves he said 
despite the remoteness of chances any real sanctions could be 
enacted mexico fought hard against the measure and was threatening 
privately to kick us drug enforcement personnel out of the 
country and tackle enforcement without outside help 
congressional aides familiar with the issue said mexico feared 
that any noconfidence vote from congress could erode its world 
standing and potentially harm the willingness of international 
business to invest in the cashstarved country 
to complaints that mexico would be offended by the bill damato 
said its about time we told them they should be offended 
because were offended citing increased drugrelated violence in 
his home state he added its not about business as usual at the 
state department 
but during a fivehour senate floor debate opponents suggested 
that lawmakers were pushing for the sanctions at least in part 
because of electionyear pressure to strike a blow against drug 
trafficking 
noting the comments of damato and wilson sen john mccain 
rariz suggested the united states itself falls short of the 
standards they seek to apply to mexico mccain said marijuana is 
californias largest cash crop and said new york streets are 
unsafe because of drugrelated crime 
i wonder if we shouldnt decertify those states and cut off 
federal aid mccain asked 
of particular concern to mexico was a requirement that if 
certification is lost us representatives to international 
development banks must vote against future loans to the affected 
country the united states has a weighted vote at the banks but 
not a majority loans from the banks have been crucial to mexico 
which is laboring under a mammoth foreign debt

the movie colors opens today in 425 
theaters across the country amid protests by the guardian angels 
and others who claim the streetgang drama will incite violence 
but dennis hopper the films director called the protesters 
irresponsible and said they were encouraging blood to flow in 
the streets 
the movie stars sean penn and robert duvall as gangfighting los 
angeles policemen the movie which used active los angelesarea 
gang members as extras and advisers portrays the world of the 
crips and the bloods rival gangs who use the colors blue and red 
respectively to distinguish themselves 
some theaters planned to increase security today as the film 
opened 
in chicago police supt leroy martin said extra police might be 
assigned to patrol near theaters where colors is playing he 
said the film might send a message that there is something clever 
and hip about being a gang member 
six guardian angels including curtis sliwa the founder of the 
volunteer crimefighting group were arrested thursday on charges 
of disorderly conduct when they tried to enter the new york city 
office of the films distributor orion pictures 
the movie glorifies street crack youth gangs sliwa 
declared during a rally in front of the midtown manhattan building 
the group had announced plans to take over the office 
sliwa said the film provides a virtual howto of street 
violence including the killing of a police officer and fosters 
negative stereotypes by depicting minority youths as violent toughs 
but hopper said the protesters are whipping up the probability 
and the possibility of violence the people who are saying 
blood is going to flow in the streets are asking for blood to flow 
in the streets 
charles o glenn executive vice president of orion pictures 
said the movie is a statement of conscience and could shock 
children into avoiding drugs and violence 
if there is anything this picture does not do it does not 
glorify gangs or gang violence glenn said we feel that 
colors is an honest and socially responsible portrayal of a 
problem that obviously exists in los angeles and in the streets of 
every other american city 
however wes mcbride president of the california gang 
investigators association said colors will leave dead bodies 
from one end of this town to the other 
in seattle the local guardian angels group threatened to seek a 
court injunction if seattle theaters show colors and said a 
protest would begin tonight at the ua cinema 150 in downtown 
seattle 
each one of us was horrified by what we saw on the screen 
said patti whitehead guardian angels chapter leader after she and 
others previewed the movie wednesday night the movie as we saw 
it was a simple recruitment for gang members

six irishmen serving life sentences for the worst 
terrorist attack in modern british history failed to win permission 
to appeal their convictions before britains highest court 
the defendants known as the birmingham six claimed they were 
beaten into confessing and were wrongly convicted on faulty 
forensic evidence for two irish republican army pub bombings that 
killed 21 people and injured 162 in the central england city of 
birmingham in 1974 
the three law lords of the house of lords members of the 
unelected upper legislative chamber who have expertise as judges 
rejected the mens bid to challenge their murder convictions 
thursday they did not give reasons for their decision 
the mens only option now would be to take their case to the 
european court of human rights 
at some stage a future home secretary is going to have to deal 
with the ongoing injustice to these men said gareth pierce a 
lawyer for the six the home secretary is the cabinet minister 
responsible for the administration of law and order 
they simply cant spend the rest of their lives in prison when 
they have committed no offense pierce said 
the men were not present at the 90minute preliminary hearing at 
which the law lords were deciding whether to hear the case in full 
in january after a fiveweek court battle the court of appeal 
upheld their convictions and sent them back to prison 
the irish government believes the six may have been convicted 
wrongly the failure of the appeal in january contributed to a 
severe strain in angloirish relations 
the bombs exploded minutes apart at two pubs in birmingham on 
nov 21 1974 within hours the six were rounded up among dozens 
of suspects 
four signed confessions and two were said to have made verbal 
admissions 
in 1975 a court imposed multiple life sentences on patrick 
hill hugh callaghan john walker richard mcilkenny gerry hunter 
and william power three of the men are in their 50s and three in 
their 40s 
the ira fighting british rule in northern ireland claimed 
responsibility for the bombings but said none of the six was 
involved 
the almost exclusively catholic irish republican army wants to 
join the protestantdominated province and set up an allireland 
socialist state

sandinista and contra commissions 
charged with defining nicaraguas ceasefire finished talks early 
today with both sides reporting progress 
highlevel government and rebel leaders meanwhile planned to 
meet later today in the capital of managua for the first time to 
further negotiations toward lasting peace 
the sandinista and contra commissions meeting in sapoa on the 
costa rican border said they achieved considerable progress 
and reconciled differences of the earlier meeting according to 
an official statement issued by both sides 
they remaining differences were not known but both sides said 
they would take them up in the highlevel meeting today 
the two sides held six technical meetings since march 28 and 
managed only to agree on seven zones in which the contra combatants 
are to gather they failed to define operating conditions within 
the areas affecting security and resupply 
the zones and the technical talks were outlined in the march 23 
ceasefire pact signed by the sovietsupplied sandinistas and the 
usbacked contras after three days of unprecedented direct 
negotiations at the sapoa border post 90 miles south of the 
capital 
the goal is to end more than six years of war that have killed 
more than 40000 nicaraguans 
the commissions were defining the mechanics of the ceasefire 
which formally went into effect april 1 
under the plan the contra evacuation into the zones was to have 
been completed by today in return the sandinistas were to have 
released 700 political prisoners allowed humanitarian aid for the 
rebels and permitted the insurgents to send representatives to take 
part in internal political discussions 
two points contained in a contra proposal had been termed 
nonnegotiable by the sandinistas it would allow the 
combatants to receive replacements of arms and ammunition inside 
the zones while prohibiting the government from accepting military 
aid which comes from the soviet bloc 
the ceasefire pact allows only humanitarian aid to be 
distributed by a neutral organization to the rebels it does not 
mention government supplies 
the contra delegation was to be headed by its miamibased 
directorate made up of adolfo calero aristides sanchez alfredo 
cesar maria azucena ferrey and pedro joaquin chamorro 
the governments delegation is headed by the nations highest 
military leader gen humberto ortega the brother of president 
daniel ortega 
agreement is needed on a new deadline for the contras to gather 
into zones and for the sandinistas to make their concessions such 
as the prisoner release the pact now calls for a 60day 
ceasefire which ends june 1 
the sandinistas and contras still stand far apart on the issue 
of laying down weapons which is not mentioned in the ceasefire 
plan they do agree the rebel combatants can enter the zones with 
their weapons 
the contras argue that they will never put down their arms until 
nicaragua is on the irreversible road to democracy the 
sandinistas contend that disarmament must occur before 
reintegration into civilian life

ethiopia said international relief 
agencies it expelled were helping separatist rebels in the 
droughtstricken north and that its own government relief program 
could handle the crisis 
but western officials said the sovietbacked government alone 
will not be able to feed the millions threatened with starvation 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
united states would consult with the soviet union about urging 
ethiopia to allow food aid to resume 
last week the marxist government ordered the expulsion of all 
foreign aid workers from the northern provinces of eritrea and 
tigre and said the situation was too dangerous for foreign relief 
personnel 
but an editorial by the staterun ethiopia news agency 
published on the front page of the ethiopian herald said thursday 
that the international committee of the red cross and other 
agencies were aiding insurgents 
the editorial accused unidentified relief agencies of committing 
serious crimes by transmitting false information to the world 
about the drought situation through sophisticated communication 
facilities which they had installed purportedly to ease relief 
operations 
the international committee of the red cross is at the 
forefront of these which have been directly or indirectly 
supporting separatist bandits it said 
rebels in eritrea have been battling the government for 27 years 
in africas longest civil war in neighboring tigre rebels have 
been fighting for 14 years 
a special un envoy arrived in addis ababa on wednesday to 
discuss the expulsions with government officials about 60 western 
relief workers were ordered out of northern ethiopia last week 
a spokesman for the genevabased organization vincent bernard 
refused comment 
the united nations also refused immediate comment it had been 
coordinating the huge northern relief operation that relies on food 
from western donors 
western aid officials speaking on condition of anonymity have 
said they fear the government expelled relief workers to remove 
witnesses from the war zone as it prepares for a major offensive 
against the rebels 
on tuesday the us state department accused the marxist 
government of sacrificing the interests of millions of its citizens 
in pursuit of military objectives ethiopia denied the charge 
an estimated 32 million people are facing starvation in the 
northern regions 
until peace comes all relief operations must be handled by the 
government relief and rehabilitation commission and other national 
organizations the editorial said 
refusal to go along with such an arrangement is tantamount 
to interfering in our domestic affairs it concluded 
berhanu jembere the chief ethiopian relief official has said 
western aid workers would be allowed back in the north only when 
the area had been cleansed of bandits 
the government says it will be able to feed most northern 
drought victims with help from ethiopian organizations but berhanu 
said the war effort took priority over relief operations and that 
there could be a temporary stoppage of food distribution in 
areas outside government control rebels now control most of tigre 
and much of eritrea 
western relief officials say that at most 1 million people could 
be fed from governmentheld distribution sites they fear mass 
migration of the hungry and have warned that deaths from starvation 
could begin within weeks

a bomb exploded today at a us air force 
radio relay station near a usspanish air base east of the 
spanish capital and caused slight damage but no injuries a us 
embassy spokesman said 
the spokesman bob meade said the bombing took place about 6 
am midnight thursday edt when a bomb planted near an air 
condition unit exploded at humosa a radio relay station about six 
miles east of the usspanish air base at torrejon 
torrejon is 12 miles northeast of madrid 
no group immediately claimed responsibility meade said and 
police gave no indication of what group could have carried it out 
the spanish national news agency efe cited an unidentified 
defense ministry source as saying the bomb attack on the us 
facility could be related to the second anniversary of the april 
15 1986 us air raids on libya 
president reagan ordered the air attack on libya in retaliation 
for alleged libyan involvement in the bombing of a nightclub in 
west berlin that killed two us servicemen and a turkish woman 
meade said the explosion caused slight damage to a maintenance 
building near the fenced perimeter of the station but did not 
interrupt us air force communications at torrejon which the 
station supports 
torrejon air base has served as the site of numerous protest 
marches against us bases and the north atlantic treaty 
organization in recent years 
in a march 1986 referendum called by the government of socialist 
prime minister felipe gonzalez spaniards overwhelmingly voted to 
keep spain in nato on condition spanish armed forces remain outside 
the nato command structure that us troops in spain be

a man who won a court order to prevent his 
18yearold girlfriend from ending her pregnancy believes 
fanatics who hold abortion above the law persuaded her to have 
the operation anyway his attorney says 
the wouldbe father will not seek a contempt citation against 
the woman but is concerned about the people who advised her 
they acted lawlessly attorney james bopp jr said thursday 
the womans attorneys said she made the decision to have the 
abortion 
bopp said he might try to find out who performed the abortion 
and who advised the woman to have an abortion those people could 
be targeted for further legal action he said 
meanwhile the appeal of the injunction in the case was assigned 
thursday to the indiana court of appeals while the woman shunned 
publicity 
she would just like to disappear said terre haute attorney 
samuel e beecher jr who represents the unmarried woman 
identified in court documents as vjh 
shes a very private person she never imagined that she would 
have had this publicity said beecher 
the womans attorneys said they cannot reveal when or where the 
abortion was performed but they said no one coerced the woman to 
have an abortion 
a whole lot went into her decisionmaking process and those 
are considerations of the utmost personal nature that dont have to 
be brought out in court or the media and she didnt said richard 
a waples of the indiana civil liberties union 
the womans attorneys announced on wednesday that she had 
undergone an abortion despite the permanent injunction granted 
monday in response to the request of a 24yearold terre haute 
deliverytruck driver who claimed to be the father of the unborn 
child 
attorneys for both sides asked for an expedited appeal to the 
state supreme court on thursday the justices rejected that 
request noting that the case no longer is an emergency and told 
the court of appeals to consider the issue 
the case hasnt yet been assigned to a threejudge panel in the 
court of appeals according to that courts administrative office 
because the case involves a paternity action the names of the 
man and the woman are not revealed in court documents the womans 
attorneys dispute the mans claim to be the father 
attorneys for both sides argued that despite the abortion the 
case isnt moot 
waples said the injunction issued by vigo circuit judge robert 
h brown represents a fundamental assault on a womens right to 
privacy 
if this order is allowed to go uncorrected other judges might 
be tempted to do the same he said 
bopp said he wants a higher court ruling on whether a fathers 
rights should be weighed against the mothers in cases where an 
abortion is in dispute 
unless we get this case on appeal and the supreme court 
upholds the fathers right we could have other cases of a father 
going to court and getting an injunction but the woman going ahead 
and getting an abortion said bopp who also represents the 
national right to life organization based in washington

who has vowed to continue his struggle against president corazon 
aquino 
there are other places to be raided templo said maybe 
before the night is over we will know if he honasan is here or 
not 
the raid took place as the military was on full alert to prevent 
a new coup attempt while mrs aquino paid a fourday visit to china 
and hong kong she left thursday 
before the raids the military announced the filing of the first 
mutiny charges against officers linked to honasans failed coup

formally charged before a court martial include two lieutenant 
colonels a major and two lieutenants their arraignment has been

during the coup attempt 
military lawyers said more charges were to be filed soon against 
more than 100 military officers and enlisted men jailed in 
connection with the coup attempt the most serious of half a dozen 
bids to unseat mrs aquino since she came to power in february 1986

us embassy and blocked a nearby march by militant moslems 
protesting the us bombing raids on libya two years ago

the moslems dispersed peacefully after a brief rally at an 
intersection where they chanted antiamerican slogans they also 
burned the us british and israeli flags as well as an effigy of 
president reagan

american soldiers and a turkish woman and injured more than 200 
people at a disco in west berlin libyan officials said 37 people

the graham family is seeking a corporate 
charter change to tighten its control of the washington post 
company a move aimed at preventing any outside takeover 
the proposal to be voted on by stockholders may 12 is a 
reaction to efforts to take control of media general inc based in 
richmond va by hollywood producer burt sugarman post officials 
said today 
the post has two classes of stock one controlled by the graham 
family and the other traded publicly 
the system was designed so that no takeover could occur without 
agreement of the family however the number of publicly traded 
shares is larger than the total owned by the family so if the two 
types of stock were voted together the graham family shares would 
be a minority 
no attempt to acquire the post has been made company officials 
said 
however sugarman is challenging a similar twoclass stock 
system in the media general case 
so post officials say they are proposing a charter amendment 
that will clearly state that any attempt to take over their company 
would have to have separate approval of a majority of each class of 
stock

prime minister yitzhak shamir is willing to 
invite soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze to israel if he 
can be sure the invitation will be accepted a shamir spokesman 
said today 
the statement came after the jerusalem post reported 
shevardnadze planned a visit to jordan syria and possibly egypt 
later this month officials at the soviet embassy in amman jordan 
confirmed that shevardnadze will visit the middle east in late 
april 
speaking in geneva thursday after signing accords on soviet 
troop withdrawal from afghanistan shevardnadze expressed optimism 
on prospects for middle east negotiations modeled on the afghan 
talks 
the signing of the geneva agreements certainly stimulates 
positive processes in the settlement of other regional issues 
including the middle east he told reporters 
although he declined to say if he would visit the region the 
soviet foreign minister seemed upbeat about the possibility of 
arranging talks 
fairly good prospects are now opening for a resolution of this 
most difficult problem he said 
officials close to shamir said israel would welcome a visit by 
shevardnadze either by himself or in the company of secretary of 
state george p shultz who is reportedly considering a return to 
the middle east 
the prime minister would very much like to welcome the soviet 
foreign minister to jerusalem for discussions said yossi 
ahimeir a shamir spokesman but shamir will not just throw out 
an invitation he needs to know the foreign minister will come 
some observers saw the prime ministrys statement which was 
also published in israeli newspapers as a trial balloon 
a visit by shevardnadze would signify a major thaw in 
israelisoviet relations diplomatic ties were severed by moscow to 
protest israels occupation of arab lands in 1967 
the visit could also spur ahead the stagnant middle east peace 
process israel and the united states have said the soviets must 
demonstrate a more balanced approach in the region if they want to 
play a role in the peace process 
among conditions shamir has set for soviet participation in 
peace talks are a resumption of diplomatic ties and freer 
emigration for about 380000 jews israel says want to leave the 
soviet union 
aides to shamir said a shevardnadze visit would not be linked to 
those conditions 
the soviet union supports the idea of an international 
conference on middle east peace a key element of shultzs recent 
peace initiative but shultz and shevardnadze have disagreed on the 
authority that forum would wield 
shultz envisions a conference as a ceremonial opening to direct 
talks whereas the soviets have visualized an ongoing conference 
actively involved in decisionmaking 
shamir of the rightwing likud bloc sharply opposes an 
international conference fearing it would be hostile to israel and 
lead to territorial concessions 
his coalition rival foreign minister shimon peres of the 
leftist labor party has advocated the conference as a launching 
pad for direct talks

extra units of israeli soldiers patrolled the 
occupied territories today on the moslem sabbath one of the 
calmest in more than four months of antioccupation violence 
the army clamped a curfew on the palestinian refugee camp of 
shati in the gaza strip and curfews remained in effect in the west 
bank camps of balata jelazoun and amari 
no violent disturbances were reported 
near the west bank town of beita the site of a clash 10 days 
ago between teenaged israeli hikers and arab villagers in which a 
15yearold israeli girl was killed dozens of jewish settlers held 
their own hike to show they would still circulate in the area 
the hike ended without violence but settlers complained about a 
heavy army presence israel army radio said 
a spokesman for the civil adminstration in the west bank said 
teachers in the territories had been given a threeweek mandatory 
holiday with half pay pending an army decision may 8 whether to 
reopen schools schools have been closed since early february in an 
effort to thwart student protests 
also friday military panels began hearing the appeals of five 
out of 12 palestinians ordered deported this week on charges of 
inciting recent unrest 
on thursday israeli troops shot and killed two palestinians 
after demonstrators pelted them with rocks and cinder blocks four 
palestinians were wounded in clashes in the west bank among them 
was a 12yearold boy who lost an eye 
the deaths brought to 146 the number of arabs killed since the 
unrest broke out dec 8 an israeli soldier and a 15yearold 
jewish settler also have died 
lt gen dan shomron the armys chief of staff said the number 
and scope of arab protests in the occupied lands is declining so 
that when soldiers fire on rioters those hit are usually 
ringleaders 
a general strike called thursday to protest the arrest of nearly 
5000 palestinians since december brought commerce to a virtual 
standstill in the west bank and gaza strip 
nevertheless shomron said arabs were tiring after 18 weeks of 
violence in the territories israel seized in the 1967 middle east 
war 
shomron said protests now involve only palestinian activists 
so when soldiers are forced to fire they usually hit the 
inciters themselves 
many people are simply not going out or dont have enough 
motivation to keep it up with the same energy shomron said 
you see it in the field 
the most serious clash thursday occurred in the narrow streets 
of the nablus central market where shops were shuttered because of 
the general strike 
hospital officials and arab reporters said youths on rooftops 
threw stones and cinder blocks at soldiers who opened fire and

because he has suffered from the irrationality of reagan and 
he would sort of make up for it 
gadhafi in a taped interview aired today on nbctvs today 
show said libyan relations with the united states could improve 
but with reagan it is impossible

in arabic through an interpreter 
he was then asked about the us presidential contest do you 
see a man there that you admire most and you would like to see to 
be president of the united states 
gadhafi responded i think that mr bush who has worked with 
reagan and who has suffered from the irrationality of reagan and 
foolishness and he was an eyewitness of the american damage and 
american loss in the period of reagan so he would be a better 
president because he has suffered with reagan and he would sort of 
make up for it

costa rican president oscar arias proposed 
today a new presidential election in panama and said us military 
intervention in the country would be a mistake 
arias responding to questions on abctvs good morning 
america said he believed panamanian military chief manuel 
antonio noriega would agree to an election 
arias who is on a us visit earlier urged a negotiated 
solution rather than increased us pressure to oust noriega who 
has been indicted on drug trafficking charges by a grand jury in 
florida 
let us negotiate a new election and let us allow the 
panamanian people to choose the next president through the ballot 
box said arias 
he said military intervention in the us effort to oust noriega 
would bring a negative reaction across latin america 
a panamanian presidential election is scheduled in may 1989 and 
noriega has said he might be willing to step down as military chief 
earlier if the opposition agrees to negotiations over panamas 
political future 
the united states recognizes eric arturo delvalle as panamas 
president the noriegacontrolled legislature fired delvalle and 
installed the education minister manuel solis palma as president 
delvalle remains in hiding apparently in panama 
the united states froze panamanian funds in the united states 
and took other steps to cut off the flow of dollars to noreiga 
after he was charged with drug trafficking by the grand jury 
members of the senate foreign relations committee said thursday 
that the reagan administration is running out of plans to oust 
noriega and is doing little to enlist the help of neighboring 
countries 
pentagon and state department officials briefed committee 
members on possible further economic sanctions against the country 
along with several topsecret noneconomic options committee 
members said 
arias told the american society of newspaper editors that the 
panamanian crisis can be resolved only through negotiations 
if the united states acts unilaterally in panama youll be 
isolated he told the editors 
you need to get support from the rest of central america he 
said if you want to punish noriega economic sanctions are not 
the best answer you are then punishing the panamanian people but 
not general noriega 
arias who won the nobel peace prize for his efforts to bring 
peace to central america previously urged panamanian roman 
catholic archbishop marcos g mcgrath to mediate between noriega 
and the opposition parties but mcgrath withdrew as mediator last 
week when he couldnt get the two sides together

an 8monthold navajo girl caught in a 
tugofwar of cultures and laws has been handed over to tribal 
authorities by the natural mother and the foster parents who cared 
for the infant since birth 
the baby named allyssa kristian screamed da da thursday 
and reached out for the only family shes ever known as she was 
taken away by an indian social worker 
patricia keetso the 21yearold unmarried natural mother who 
wanted her baby to be adopted by rick and cheryl pitts of san jose 
calif also cried as she and the couple gave up custody of allyssa 
keetso her mother and mrs pitts accompanied the social worker 
an indian attorney and the baby on the flight to arizona for a 
tribal court hearing 
pitts accused navajo authorities of reneging on an agreement to 
take a later flight when his family had reserved seats and trying 
to leave shortly after the exchange you lied to us he yelled 
at patrick guillery the navajo attorney 
guillery said he made no promise about when the flight would 
leave and told pitts he would be violating a court order if he 
didnt turn over the baby immediately 
after the group arrived in phoenix the social worker and navajo 
officials got into a van with the baby and left leaving keetso and 
mrs pitts behind they had expected to fly with the baby to 
flagstaff before driving to the reservation 
navajo tribal spokeswoman karen diakun said the infant was in 
the tribes custody and that the location would not be revealed 
the division of social welfare will make the appropriate 
placement until the court decides otherwise ms diakun said 
adding that no date had been set for a hearing on the case at tuba 
city judicial district childrens court 
the pittses have said they will continue to seek to adopt the 
hild 
ms keetso had met the pitts couple through an adoption attorney 
who advertised in a newspaper on the reservation 
the pittses both 33 and parents of an 8yearold boy brought 
ms keetso into their home when she was seven months pregnant they 
gave her 200 a month for spending money paid medical costs 
coached her through labor and brought allyssa home after her birth 
july 20 1987 
despite the wishes of the natural mother a santa clara county 
superior court judge ruled earlier this week that allyssa must be 
turned over to navajo authorities pending a tribal decision on 
custody 
violet ap lui an attorney for the tribal department of 
justice in window rock ariz said a custody hearing would be held 
soon she said she didnt know whether keetso or the pittses would 
be able to visit the baby 
the navajos citing the 1978 indian child welfare act filed a 
complaint in the santa clara county court in february to gain 
jurisdiction of the case and stop the pittses adoption petition 
san jose superior court judge leslie nichols ruled that keetso 
legally resided on the reservation in arizona and was under the 
jurisdiction of navajo authorities 
rather than appeal nichols ruling the pittses decided 
wednesday to drop their adoption petition and pursue the case 
through the tribal court

a faulty test for aids led dozens 
of west germans to believe they had the fatal disease including a 
woman who planned her funeral a newspaper reported 
this woman lived with the death sentence for 56 days the 
frankfurt abendpost newspaper said thursday it said she wrote a 
final testament requesting a white casket with gold lettering for 
her burial 
her doctor later determined the test was faulty and she didnt 
have aids the paper said 
another woman was ready to poison herself because an aids test 
had indicated her husband carried the deadly virus the newspaper 
said three days later the doctor said the diagnosis was wrong 
on tuesday the bavaria state parliament aids committee said up 
to 30 percent of aids test results in west germany are incorrect 
there are rheumatismrelated illnesses that at first glance 
react the same as aids antibodies committee member and state 
parliamentary deputy karl heinz mueller told reporters 
the committee based its report on recent aids test results in a 
section of bavaria state where 528 of 11824 patients tested as 
aidspositive 
in a second round of testing to confirm results only 359 of the 
528 again tested positive mueller said 
about 500 west germans a day are tested for the aids virus the 
abendpost newspaper said 
the committee said it was shocked about the results and called 
for uniform procedures in testing and informing patients 
social workers wednesday supported the committees appeal they 
also criticized doctors who prematurely or without psychological 
considerations inform patients they have the virus 
its pure terror one can only do that if one wants to 
encourage suicide eberhard zastrau of the deutsche aidshilfe 
german aids help selfhelp group told the associated press in 
munich 
the committee also said bavaria state should end its policy of 
testing civil service applicants foreigners applying for asylum 
and young men in military service 
bavaria state in 1987 introduced tough measures aimed at 
preventing the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
including mandatory testing of those groups 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer 
it is spread most often through sexual contact needles or 
syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood or blood products 
and from pregnant women to their offspring

ethical and legal questions are behind a 
decision to prohibit the national institutes of health from using 
tissue from intentionally aborted fetuses in genetic research 
administration officials said today 
the decision came last week in a letter from dr robert e 
windom assistant secretary of health at the department of health 
and human services to nih director james b wyngaarden 
this proposal raises a number of questions primarily ethical 
and legal that have not been satisfactorily addressed either 
within the public health service or within society windom wrote 
his letter was in reponse to a proposal from nih which is part 
of the public health service headed by windom to implant fetal 
tissue into patients with parkinsons disease 
phs spokesman jim brown noted today that windoms letter 
instructs wyngaarden to appoint an outside advisory committee to 
examine the ethical medical and legal implications of using tissue 
from intentionally aborted fetuses 
he also pointed out that the prohibition does not ban research 
on tissue from fetuses from miscarriages or stillbirths but 
acknowledged that it generally is not feasible to use that tissue 
in the kind of genetic research the nih proposal contemplated 
brown said windom anticipates that the advisory committee he has 
instructed nih to form will move quickly perhaps within a couple 
of months to make recommendations 
windom was out of town and could not be reached for elaboration 
his decision was reported initially by the washington post 
the morality and science are all mixed together the paper 
quoted windom as saying they need to be evaluated before we rush 
ahead we just cant afford to move too hastily on this 
thousands of aborted fetuses are used each year in research on 
parkinsons disease juvenile diabetes and leukemia researchers 
say the special composition of fresh tissue that is obtained 
quickly from inducted abortions holds promise for treatment of the 
diseases 
researchers contacted by the post expressed dismay at the 
decision 
nih sets the pace and this will cripple fetal research in the 
united states said dr bernard liebel professor of medicine at 
the university of toronto 
it is an extraordinarily valuable research tool with immense 
potential depriving research scientists of this material is a 
great disservice to humanity he said 
abortion opponents praised the decision 
if the parents were a part to the killing they have no right 
to assign organs to another person said dr john c willke 
president of the national righttolife committee that is 
desecration of a corpse 
researchers told the post however that proper planning is 
necessary to retrieve the tissue while it is useful and that it is 
rarely possible to use fetuses that have been aborted spontaneously

raconteur who really sang for his supper 
williams a bachelor once proclaimed he had never been in 
love and thought marriage was unnatural he lived alone in an 
apartment next door to his mother louisa

play serious roles

plenty of people who can play serious roles but there are not 
many who can be funny 
of life in general he said the shorter the better i think to 
go at 65 or 70 is fine why hang about

two hostages aboard a hijacked jumbo jet 
broadcast messages today saying they would be killed if the kuwaiti 
government did not bend to the demands of the arab gunmen holding 
the plane 
about 30 passengers were reported being held in grim conditions 
all handcuffed and forced to remain silent about four crew members 
also are believed to be aboard the jet 
the kuwait airways boeing 747 was hijacked april 5 on a flight 
from bangkok to kuwait with 112 people aboard it was forced to 
land at mashhad in northeastern iran where the hijackers freed 57 
hostages 
the plane then flew on to larnaca cyprus where 13 people were 
released and two kuwaitis were killed it arrived in algiers 
tuesday night 
the hijackers are demanding that kuwait release 17 jailed 
proiranian terrorists kuwaiti officials have refused 
the two recorded messages almost identical in wording were 
sent by radio from the plane to the control tower at houari 
boumedienne airport 
in the name of god the merciful i greet my family and my 
friends and i ask the kuwaiti authorities to free the 17 prisoners 
held in kuwaiti prisons said soleiman mohammed soleiman 
almashari in the event of refusal they are going to kill us 
in a second message a man identifying himself as mohammed ahmed 
alajem said i am one of the hostages from the boeing and i 
ask the kuwaiti authorities to free the prisoners held in the 
prisons without that the kidnappers have decided to kill us 
a passenger made a similar plea thursday 
the hijackers released one of their captives thursday during the 
second day of negotiations here with a kuwaiti delegation through 
algerian mediators 
the freed hostage djuma abdallah chatti of kuwait is a 
70yearold diabetic who doctors said urgently needed an insulin 
shot 
the gunmen issued a statement saying they would not budge in 
their demand that the 17 prisoners be released they said they 
stood by their demand even if the price we have to pay is very 
high 
we are not highway bandits they said in the statement 
radioed to the control tower in arabic and english we are men of 
principle 
according to a kuwaiti official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity chatti reported that the hostage worst affected was 
fadel alsabah 33 cousin of the emir of kuwait regarded as the 
hijackers most valuable captive alsabahs two sisters also are 
on board 
chatti was quoted as saying alsabah suffered from a severe 
nervous disorder even before he boarded the plane and the 
experience of the hijack seems to have put him over the brink 
alsabah had continuous violent shakes could not speak and 
just cries all the time he said 
chatti said there were eight hijackers other freed passengers 
have said there were between five and eight 
praise to god i am fine but they had me tied all the time 
and i am tired chatti told reporters in the airport lounge 
they are not good people they beat me 
chatti was examined on board thursday by an physician who told 
the hijackers the man would die unless freed 
the kuwaiti official quoted chatti as saying all hostages had 
their hands handcuffed behind their backs at all times and were not 
allowed to speak or move 
the official said chatti had deep bleeding cuts on both wrists 
from the handcuffs he said he was forced to wear since the plane 
was in mashhad 
the kuwaiti official quoted chatti as saying four bombs made of 
stick explosives connected by wires were attached to the four doors 
in the planes midsection 
in washington lawmakers on thursday urged secretary of state 
george p shultz to intervene because of reports that one of the 
hijackers might be responsible for kidnapping american journalist 
terry anderson in lebanon 
anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was seized march 16 1985 and is the longestheld of the 22 
foreign hostages in lebanon nine are americans 
kuwaits independent alqabas newspaper reported wednesday that 
the alleged kidnapper imad mughniyeh was believed to have boarded

a senior us state department official in tibet 
is investigating human rights issues in the remote mountain region 
authorities said today 
the us embassy in beijing said j stapleton roy deputy 
assistant secretary of state is visiting several cities in tibet 
with an officer from the american consulate in chengdu southwest 
china 
the main reason hes going is to see the situation for 
himself said press officer andew c koss 
a report on tibet regional radio said roy had met with mao 
rubai deputy secretary of the communist party in tibet the report 
said roy raised human rights questions among other issues 
mao told roy that the leftist errors of the past when 
tibetan religion and customs were oppressed had been rectified and 
defended chinas human rights record in tibet the radio said 
tibet has erupted in violence twice in the past six months with 
buddhist monks leading antichinese proindependence riots last 
fall and again on march 5 
the disturbances last september and october in the capital of 
lhasa which left an estimated 14 dead they caused a rift in 
uschinese relations with congress accusing china of human 
rights violations and china charging the united states with 
interference in chinas internal affairs 
the us government backs beijings contention that tibet is 
part of china but members of congress have expressed support for 
tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama who has been living in 
exile in india since 1959 
after last falls riots tibetan authorities closed the area to 
foreign journalists and diplomats and all but a few wellwatched 
tourist groups 
since late february the restrictions on foreign visitors have 
been eased somewhat although the march 5 riots in which as many 
as 24 people were killed and hundreds arrested prompted another 
clampdown on visits 
chinese officials continue to insist that tibet which has 
promoted tourism as a major source of revenue is open but they 
say the region can handle only a limited number of people at any 
one time 
roy leads the second us government delegation to tibet this 
spring following a group led by us rep sonny montgomery

the government today filed a formal 
diplomatic protest with the united states over what it called 
violations of panamas sovereignty by american troops 
the note said us troops closed a panamanian highway during a 
twohour firefight tuesday night between soldiers of the united 
states and an unknown group 
foreign minister jorge abadia called the act a flagrant 
violation of panamas sovereignty by us soldiers who violated 
panamanian territory in a visible form 
the highway was closed for three hours tuesday night when us 
officials said about 100 marines exchanged fire with 40 to 50 
uniformed intruders at a fuel dump near howard air force base 
outside panama city 
the us southern command said it consulted with the panama 
defense forces before closing the highway for security reasons 
the highway runs past the air base and connects the capital with 
the western part of the country 
copies of the protest note were sent to javier perez de cuellar 
secretary general of the united nations 
marines scouring rugged jungle at a fuel depot have found no 
evidence to back sentrys claims that uniformed intruders engaged 
them in a nighttime firefight the us military says 
still and despite panamanian ridicule the americans stood by 
their story 
the southern command said a marine was accidentally shot to 
death by another marine on monday night as they investigated what 
was described as a breakin by six to eight uniformed 
camouflaged intruders at the depot 
the next night the southern command said about 100 marines and 
40 to 50 intruders wearing dark uniforms engaged in a twohour 
firefight no injuries were reported 
bill ormsby a civilian spokesman for the us southern command 
said thursday that it would take at least another day for soldiers 
to complete their inspection of the 807acre arraijan tank farm 
asked if the southern command was still sticking to its accounts 
in the absence of concrete evidence ormsby replied yes sir we 
are 
on thursday staterun news media and panamas defense forces 
heaped scorn on the american story 
marines made fools of a headline in red ink said in the 
morning tabloid critica which is controlled by the government 
the story said the marines had shouted cries of fear 
desperation and terror during the reported skirmishes a cartoon 
showed a marine smoking marijuana against a backdrop of swaying 
palms 
the united states maintains about 10000 troops in panama as a 
permanent force to defend the panama canal about 1300 more us 
servicemen were sent to panama last week to increase security for 
the canal and us citizens there 
on tuesday a pentagon spokesman suggested monday nights 
intrusion had been made by members of the defense forces an 
assertion angrily denied by the panamanian government 
in describing the tuesday night incident southern command 
officials carefully avoided implicating the panamanian military 
saying the reported intruders could not be identified with any 
particular organization 
the defense forces are headed by gen manuel antonio noriega 
the power behind panamas civilian government 
noriega is under indictment in the united states on charges of 
drug trafficking and the reagan administration has been seeking 
his ouster for months 
last month in an attempt to force out noriega the reagan 
administration began freezing panamanian funds in the united 
states creating a cash shortage in the country

the university of michigan regents left 
their regular meeting under guard and went into closed session 
today for the second day in a row after they were disrupted by 
students protesting antidiscrimination policy 
there were scuffles between security guards and some of the 30 
protesters who attended the open meeting after the regents were led 
out but no injuries were reported at least three people were hurt 
during a similar confrontation thursday when protests also forced 
the regents into a closed meeting 
soon after the closed meeting began the protesters left the 
administration building shouting they would return with enough 
students to surround it waam radio reported 
corey dolgon chairman of the campus governance committee of the 
university of michigan student government said the students wanted 
to let the regents know how angry they are about a proposed 
antidiscrimination policy and about being shut out of the meeting 
the antidiscrimination policy was meant to counter racial and 
sexual harassment on campus 
the michigan student assembly and other opponents complain that 
interim president robben fleming drafted the policy without 
consulting students and that it targets student misconduct without 
addressing such action by the university and its administrators 
fleming has a history of neglecting student input and now 
hes trying to throw this code down the students throats jackie 
victor a former cochair of the student assemblys peace and 
justice committee said thursday 
protesters also demanded the dismissals of regent deane baker 
and peter steiner dean of the college of literature sciences and 
arts 
victor said baker has offended students for years with his 
attitudes about minorities and homosexuals and his support for 
military research at the university 
steiner has been under fire since january when students 
obtained a copy of his remarks during a closed faculty meeting in 
september when he warned against lowering university standards to 
recruit more black students he later apologized for phrasing of 
his remarks but denied they were racist 
on thursday about 35 students protested during a public board 
of regents session and demanded the dismissal of fleming and two 
other top officials said joseph owsley the schools director of 
news and information 
the regents adjourned and headed upstairs to a conference room 
to continue the meeting without spectators owsley said the 
protesters followed them and tried to enter the room while security 
guards held them back he said 
at least two school officials and one protester were slightly 
injured but none required hospital treatment

the guidedmissile frigate samuel b roberts 
encountered a mine field with numerous mines thursday morning 
before its hull was ripped open by one of the underwater 
explosives pentagon officials said today 
the frigate had come to an almost complete stop in the water at 
the time of the explosion after successfully maneuvering away from 
several mines spotted by lookouts the officials said 
the effort to maneuver out of the mine field was hampered by 
rough seas however and the mine the roberts eventually hit was 
probably moored to the bottom the officials said 
the defense officials who agreed to discuss the matter only if 
not identified said at least two mines had been spotted today by a 
reconnaissance helicopter dispatched by other navy ships in the 
area 
the sources said the navy now had four minesweeping ships 
closing in on the patch of water in the central gulf where the 
roberts was hit to begin a search 
ideally wed like to recover one of these mines said one 
source but we also want to do it safely the seas out there are 
still heavy it may take a while 
we might end up just blowing them the mines up but were 
pretty much convinced this is a new field that was just laid and 
we certainly suspect the iranians are behind it 
the sources also said today the frigate had suffered extensive 
damage 
at one point there was 12 feet of water inside the engine 
room said one official the crew just did a hell of a job she 
the ship took a really bad hit 
ten sailors were injured two of them critically with 
seconddegree burns when the roberts was ripped by the underwater 
explosion at 1010 am edt there were no fatalities 
the pentagon said it had been decided to tow the roberts to 
dubai instead of bahrain as earlier announced and a commercial 
tugboat the hunter was now en route with it the pentagon 
declined to estimate when the ship might arrive 
one source said that by towing the roberts to dubai the navy 
could move the ship immediately into a dry dock there for repairs 
while the navy uses bahrain as a base for its persian gulf forces 
there are no large dry dock facilities on that island 
the sources said the navy would not be able to tell the full 
extent of the damage or make any decisions about repairs until the 
ship was out of the water 
we know the damage is bad though said one theyre 
towing her only at about five knots because they dont think she 
can take any more

the bureau of land management today said it 
would curtail its practice of giving away large numbers of wild 
horses 
though the bureau did not mention it in the announcement it has 
previously admitted that instances of what appeared to be abuse of 
animals in north dakota and nebraska might help end its nofee 
adoptions 
since 1976 more than 86000 horses have been removed from the 
range in the west and placed with private owners and the bureau 
will continue to offer horses to individuals 
the bureau charges 125 per horse but has been waiving the 
charge for people willing to take 100 or more 
robert burford director of the bureau said in the announcement 
the bureau still would accept applications for waiver of the fee 
from nonprofit groups working to improve the adoptability of wild 
horses 
young horses find ready takers but older animals are harder to 
break and for that reason are in less demand 
burford said the bureau had great hopes for another concept 
being developed that of privately funded wild horse sanctuaries 
and also would step up its use of prison inmates to break horses

police said today that a member of japans 
red army terrorist group was the prime suspect in a car bomb 
explosion outside a us military club that killed an american 
servicewoman and four italians 
investigators said they were searching for junzo okudaira 39 
who is also suspected in rocket and bomb attacks on the us and 
british embassies in rome last june 
at least 17 people including four us sailors were hurt in 
the thursday night blast outside the united services organization 
club in downtown naples 
the pentagon identified the slain sailor as 21yearold angela 
simone santos a radioman 3rd class from ocala fla she had been 
stationed at the naval communications area major station in naples 
since march 1985 
a man called a french news agency office in rome today and 
claimed the attack in the name of a group calling itself the 
organization of jihad brigades 
the american imperialists must die today two years after 
their barbarous attack against the libyan arab state the caller 
said in accented english jihad means holy war in arabic 
at 2 am on april 15 1986 the united states bombed the libyan 
capital in retaliation for alleged libyan involvement in the 
bombing of a west berlin nightclub two us servicemen and a 
turkish woman died in the nightclub blast 
the libyan ambassador to italy abdulrahman shargam told the 
ansa news agency that attempts to link libya to the bombing were 
disinformation 
romano argenio of italys antiterrorist police said 
investigators believed okudaira had accomplices and that they were 
taking the claim seriously 
we do not think that the attack was organized by the red army 
alone said argenio who is leading the investigation we think 
he was working with other terrorist groups which we are still 
trying to identify 
argenio said okudaira is believed to have parked the rented car 
laden with explosives outside the club 
earlier ansa quoted an unidentified police official as saying 
the middle east connection seems most likely staterun rai 
television reported receiving a call today from a man who said 
justice has been done for the lebanese people 
the blast damaged the clubs interior wrecked cars and 
shattered windows along narrow san marco street 
the slain italians included a souvenir vendor who regularly sat 
outside the club and three passersby 
the bomb in a white car with milan license plates exploded at 
about 8 pm 2 pm edt navy spokesman lt david morris said 
most of the sailors in the club were from the frigates uss 
capodanno and uss paul which are anchored in naples 
us sailor john nichols from the uss paul was quoted in naples 
il mattino newspaper as saying he saw a man with dark hair and 
olive skin who didnt look like an italian put something 
inside the car and flee just before it exploded 
we were getting ready to lower the shutters when the world 
exploded around us we heard desperate shouts we ran out into the 
street said valaria spinetti 22 who works at a nearby store 
god what a terrible scene i saw three or for people 
transformed into torches who were crying for help she added i 
went back into the store to get a fire extinguisher when i went 
back into the street they were already burned beyond recognition 
one of the bodies was later drapped with an american flag 
okudaira was identified as having rented the car that blew up 
outside the us embassy in rome last june there were no injuries 
in either that attack of the one on the british embassy 
okudaira is also suspected of involvement in attacks on western 
embassie in europe in the 1970s 
he was arrested in jordan in 1976 on charges of possessing a 
false passport and deported to japan but was freed in 1977 when 
hijackers of a japan air lines jet in bangladesh demanded his 
release 
morris identified the wounded sailors as chief petty officer 
francisco a navalta 39 of castillejos zambales philippines 
petty officer 3rd class craig lee trent 22 of gaither md 
stanley lawson 27 3rd class electronics technician of maumee 
ohio and senior chief petty officer charles fifer roberts 38 of 
east st louis ill 
morris said they were in stable condition at the us navy 
hospital in agnano outside naples but he would not describe the 
injuries roberts was treated and released 
the navy has a major presence in naples which is headquarters 
for natos southern command and the support center for the us 6th 
fleet which has about 45 ships

secretary of state george p shultz and three 
other grimfaced diplomats who signed the afghan accords studiously 
avoided the word peace to describe what they had achieved 
the tragic reality behind what shultz called a historic 
agreement is that the killing will go on in afghanistan as it did 
in vietnam for two years after henry kissinger put his signature on 
a similar accord in 1973 
yes the soviets pledged to remove their 115000 troops from 
afghanistan by feb 15 1989 
yes shultz left geneva and the signing ceremony in the united 
nations palace of justice talking about worldwide efforts to help 
afghan refugees return to villages no longer threatened by soviet 
napalm and helicopter gunships 
yes the agreement signed thursday by the foreign ministers of 
the government in kabul pakistan the united states and the soviet 
union opens the way for what shultz called afghan control over 
afghanistan 
although the soviets have not stated their intentions publicly 
the sad expectation is that that the soviets will continue to arm 
the afghan government they have backed for a decade and the afghan 
mujahadeen supported by the united states will continue receiving 
weapons from a cia pipeline 
today however a high administration official speaking on 
condition he not be identified said the united states still hopes 
that the soviets may elect to end shipments to afghanistan and let 
that long war wind down 
the united states tried to get the soviets to agree to a mutual 
cutoff of weaponry but that effort failed so it is likely the 
afghan rivals will continue receiving the means to kill each 
others adherents 
the accords signed in geneva do not end the war they merely 
begin the end to soviet troop participation in it shultz 
acknowledged the agreement was not perfect but he and 
officials who traveled with him to geneva were clearly satisfied 
with what had been accomplished 
the united states its allies the islamic world and most of the 
rest of the world have been railing against the soviets for more 
than eight years for sending troops to afghanistan to bring that 
withdrawal about after the loss of an estimated million afghan 
lives was a major victory shultz said prompting him to proclaim 
history has been made today 
the agreement also will permit the united states to step back a 
bit from deep involvement in afghanistan affairs the officials 
said 
after all before the soviets turned afghanistan into a 
superpower sore point the united states had little interest in the 
incessant warfare within afghans tribal society 
the soviet decision to withdraw could lead to the restoration of 
afghanistan to that shelf of countries the united states need not 
worry about and the officials seemed pleased at that prospect 
there was a touch of irony to the signing ceremony in that it 
took place in the same chamber where the superpowers blessed a 1955 
indochina accord that eventually failed 
the parallels between afghanistan in the 1980s and vietnam 
particularly in the 1970s are inescapable 
a superpower bogged down in an unpopular war at home and abroad 
realizing its superior firepower cannot defeat a tenacious 
guerrilla force armed by another superpower signs an agreement 
permitting disengagement with honor 
in 1973 secretary of state kissinger set the stage in the paris 
accords for us troop withdrawal turning the struggle over to the 
wellstocked south vietnamese by april 1975 the north vietnamese 
had won 
on thursday soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who 
signed the troop withdrawal pledge said supplies to the 
legitimate government of afghan leader najib would continue 
shevardnadze sounding vaguely like the american officials of 
the 1970s tried to put the best face on what had happened 
how will soviet generals swallow their defeat he was asked at a 
news conference soviet generals dont think they lost the war 
he replied 
he feigned ignorance of a wellpublicized soviet academicians 
assertion that moscows initial decision in 1979 to send in the 
troops was a mistake 
the soviet union went into afghanistan to help a besieged 
legitimate government he said 
behind the gloss us officials said was a clear soviet 
determination to end its involvement a determination unthreatened 
by lastminute finagling over the continuation of superpower 
assistance 
asked if shevardnadzes condemnation of us assistance for the 
rebels could unravel the agreement one official laughed and 
declared they arent looking for a pretext to stay 
the accepted wisdom at the pentagon and the state department has 
the najib government collapsing eventually because it has little 
support among afghans 
yet there is no consensus in washington on how soon that could 
happen 
the most graceful transition to peace could come about through a 
further mediation effort by diego cordovez the united nations 
official who led the negotiations that resulted in thursdays 
accord 
cordovez has agreed to begin talks with the factions on creating 
an interim government to supplant the marxist najib regime 
in the meantime najib and his enemies the mujahadeen vow to 
continue the struggle and the killing will continue

condition 
the uss samuel b roberts was being towed to dubai navy 
officials said 
the ship is under control it is out of danger said us 
central command spokesman lt col john head the navy declined to 
give the exact location of the ship

that 13 civilians were killed and a number of others injured in 
overnight iraqi bombing raids on the western iranian cities of 
hamadan and bakhtaran 
pentagon officials said today that the roberts encountered a 
mine field with numerous mines before its hull was ripped open by 
one of the underwater explosives 
the frigate had come to an almost complete stop in the water at 
the time of the explosion after successfully maneuvering away from 
several mines spotted by lookouts the officials said 
the effort to maneuver out of the mine field was hampered by 
rough seas however and the mine the roberts eventually hit was 
probably moored to the bottom the officials said 
the navy said the 3700ton roberts was in no danger of sinking 
the explosion occurred about 55 miles northeast of the qatar 
peninsula while the roberts was on patrol 
four of the injured seamen were taken to bahrains salmaniya 
hospital head said two were suffering from seconddegree burns 
over 40 percent of their bodies and were in critical condition

combat store ship san jose head said they were listed in good 
condition 
the roberts was sailing southward on a return trip from kuwait 
after escorting one of 11 usreflagged kuwaiti tankers 
iran was blamed for a spate of mine blasts in the gulf last year 
i spillovers of its 7yearold war with iraq 
the roberts and wainwright are two of 14 navy ships assigned to 
the us force in the gulf to protect merchant vessels flying the 
us flag 
the roberts is based in newport ri and left there for gulf 
duty on jan 11 the navy said about 225 men were aboard 
officials said the type of mine suspected of causing the 
explosion was not immediately known 
the 400 million 445foot frigate was the second us warship 
hit in the gulf in the past 12 months the frigate uss stark the 
same type of guidedmissile frigate as the roberts was hit by an 
iraqi missile in the gulf last may 
iraq apologized for the attack which killed 37 sailors saying 
it mistook the stark for an iranian warship 
the bridgeton a kuwaiti tanker sailing under the us flag hit 
a mine near irans farsi island in july 1987 
the united states has six mine sweepers in the waterway but they 
have worked mainly in the northern gulf

last july in response to a request from kuwait whose oil tankers 
had been targeted by iran

the red army linked to a bomb attack in italy and 
an explosives arrest in new jersey is a radical japanese terrorist 
organization that has been relatively inactive in recent years 
the army is a splinter faction of the leftist general federation 
of japanese students which claimed support from 850000 of the 13 
million college students in japan in the 1960s 
the red army apparently has not been involved in many attacks 
recently although japanese police went on alert last november when 
osamu maruoka 37 a longsought army leader was arrested in tokyo 
and found to have a oneway ticket to seoul 
police theorized he had planned to disrupte south koreas 
presidential elections in december 
the red army was believed never to have grown beyond 300 
members police action and internal feuding climaxing with the 
killing of 14 members at a mountain hideout in 1971 sapped its 
strength 
the group advocates simultaneous world revolution and is 
believed to have members allied with propalestinian groups in 
lebanon

the turkish cypriot administration said 
friday it has started requiring cypriots to carry passports if they 
cross the green line that divides this mediterranean island 
the new requirement became known when opposition republican 
turkish party leader ozker ozgur was turned back from the 
checkpoint thursday by turkish cypriot officials for not carrying a 
passport 
rauf denktash the turkish cypriot leader said the decision was 
in response to greek cypriot president george vassilious statement 
that there are no borders in cyprus 
the decision is mainly symbolic since few people make the 
crossing through the checkpoint near the ledra palace hotel 
diplomats and united nations peacekeeping forces will be able to 
cross as in the past they said 
in the past cypriots making the crossing required only 
permission from both administrations 
greek cypriots carry passports issued by the republic of cyprus 
the only internationally recognized government on the island 
turkish cypriots have been issued turkish republic of northern 
cyprus passports by the turkish cypriot administration 
the turkish cypriots make up about 18 percent of the 650000 
population of the island divided since the turkish invasion of 
1974 into two zones

more than 150 supporters for letters he has received since being 
jailed after his guilty plea

lifestyles

comments in writing the sentencing was delayed for about an hour 
while bell read litmans response to the probation report

soviet troops begin pulling out of afghanistan in 
30 days under an international pact signed here to end their 
8yearold intervention in that warravaged country prospects for 
afghan peace remained dim however 
the soviet union united states pakistan and afghanistan signed 
the international accord during a brief ceremony thursday in 
genevas united nations building where unmediated peace talks 
began six years ago 
in moscow today the soviets accused the united states of trying 
to ruin the agreement by continuing to supply weapons to the moslem 
rebels fighting the kabul government 
washington is confirming its policy of neoglobalism a course 
of export of counterrevolution the tass news agency said in the 
first official soviet press commentary issued since the signing of 
the pact 
tass said the united states was insisting the soviet union stop 
its military aid to afghanistans marxist government 
the united states and soviet union both reserved the right to 
continue providing military assistance to the warring sides 
history has been made today us secretary of state george 
p shultz said at a news conference following the signing of the 
accords which go into effect may 15 
the deposed king of afghanistan mohammad zaher shah proposed 
convening a loya jitga or grand assembly of afghan tribal 
leaders to try to set up a transitional government 
zaher shah made the comment thursday in italy where he has 
lived since being dethroned in 1973 he has been mentioned by 
various parties as possibly returning to play a role in an interim 
government 
today the un high commissioner for refugees urged the safe 
and voluntary return of the more than 5 million afghan refugees who 
have fled to pakistan and iran 
the united nations expects to spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars supervising the return the largest repatriation effort 
ever un officials will present a detailed firstyear plan within 
10 days refugee commissioner jeanpierre hocke told a news 
conference 
in addition to providing for the soviet troop pullout the 
accord also pledges noninterference by pakistan and afghanistan in 
each others affairs 
shultz said the withdrawal of soviet forces from afghanistan 
where they have been supporting the marxist government of president 
najib against moslem rebels since december 1979 would remove the 
cause of the brutal war 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze told a separate news 
conference that the agreements put an end to outside interference 
in afghanistans affairs and make it possible for the afghan people 
to establish peace and harmony in their land 
others disagreed 
in islamabad pakistan president zia ulhaq said i see 
trouble and turmoil in afghanistan through the insurgency through 
the mujahedeen guerrillas trying to achieve their objective to 
overthrow this regime and establish their own authority 
he said that will mean more loss of life 
the guerrillas sevenparty alliance rejected the geneva accords 
and vowed to keep fighting to topple the kabul government no 
resistance members attended thursdays ceremony pakistan where 
the rebels are based represented them at negotiations 
shultz expressed some annoyance at a suggestion during his news 
conference that the accords were flawed because they didnt stop 
the fighting 
the agreements he said are not perfect everybody can find 
something wrong with them but were practical people trying to 
achieve important ends 
he also brushed aside comments by shevardnadze in his news 
conference that continued us aid to the resistance forces would 
violate international law 
it would surprise me if they challenged our right to 
resupply shultz told reporters aboard his air force jet on the 
return flight to washington 
he noted that a decision by the united states to keep helping 
the guerrillas and by the soviet union to continue aiding the kabul 
government had been thoroughly aired during the weeks before the 
signing 
under the pacts provisions the estimated 115000 soviet 
soldiers will be out in nine months with half leaving in the first 
three months after may 15 the soviets have indicated they may 
complete the pullout by the end of this year 
un mediator diego cordovez was given a mandate to continue 
promoting a political dialogue between the kabul government and the 
rebels 
the agreement does not deal with the question of afghanistans 
future government

washington today after inspecting the plane thursday afternoon and 
evening piedmont crews dispatched to charleston were given control 
of the plane today

could crawl through it one of the turbine blades came right 
through the bathroom were lucky no one was in it 
the plane lost cabin pressure and went into a dive oxygen masks 
dropped from the ceiling and flight attendants and adult passengers 
went through the aisles and assisted children passengers said 
but some didnt work and passengers moved to other seats after 
the plane landed safely several passengers later complained of 
headaches earaches and elevated blood pressure 
this could have easily been more serious than it was said 
dan huffman assistant airport manager 
most passengers were placed on a connecting flight but a 
handful rented cars and said they would continue the trip by ground 
piedmont spokesman don mcguire said he didnt know when the 
planes engines had been checked last the engine was manufactured 
by rolls royce 
computers are used to maintain parts aboard the plane including 
engines and oxygen masks he said the reported failures of the 
oxygen masks will be investigated he said

maximum of 72 passengers it also owns 20 1000 series craft which 
carry 62 it was the first serious problem reported with the 
dutchmade f28s in the four years piedmont has owned them mcguire 
said

injuryrelated accidents involving fokker f28s spokesman ted 
lopatkiewicz said one jet was involved in a minor taxiway 
collision at laguardia airport in new york on oct 24 1985 and on

a big jump in wholesale prices dealt another 
blow today to financial markets still reeling from an unexpected 
rise in the trade deficit pushing stocks down further after 
thursdays 100 billion selloff 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks was off 431 
points at 200133 at 1230 pm edt declining issues outnumbered 
advancing ones 7 to 2 on the new york stock exchange earlier in 
the session the average was down by more than 20 points 
the average took a 10146point plunge thursday which was 
triggered by a report from the commerce department that the us 
merchandise trade deficit rose to 138 billion in february 
the rise of 06 percent in wholesale prices in march reported by 
the labor department today was the biggest in 11 months and 
heightened concerns that the economy was becoming overheated 
its part of the whole inflationary thesis the weak dollar 
rising imports and strengthening prices all spell difficulty for 
the economy later on said michael metz an investment strategist 
at oppenheimer amp co 
but metz noting the big decline in the markets on thursday 
said i think that weve paid for this bad news in the last day 
and a half already longterm treasury bond prices also fell 
again today putting interest rates at a threemonth high but the 
dollar held about even today after falling sharply thursday 
overnight on the tokyo stock exchange the nikkei stock average 
of 225 selected issues lost 21778 points to end the day at 
2689357 a decline of less than 1 percent 
in london stock prices edged narrowly lower the financial

percent to 17786 it had been off 241 points at the opening 
in todays report the labor department said the march rise in 
wholesale prices of 06 percent followed a 02 percent drop in 
february 
many analysts had been looking for an increase in march on the 
order of a 02 percent rise if the march rate held for 12 months 
the fullyear wholesale inflation rate would be 7 percent compared 
with 22 percent for all of 1987 
in midday trading in new york today the dollar was bid at 1238 
japanese yen and 166 west german marks the benchmark 30year 
treasury bond was off about point or about 5 for every 1000 
in face value as its yield edged up to 893 percent from 886 
percent late thursday 
in foreign exchange thursday the dollar fell about 2 percent 
against the japanese yen and west german mark despite central bank 
purchases aimed at bolstering the dollar and bond market interest 
rates rose to their highest levels since january 
the trade report raised concerns that the dollar would remain 
under pressure despite a monthsold agreement by major 
industrialized nations to support it that agreement was reaffirmed 
wednesday by the united states japan west germany britain 
france canada and italy at a meeting in washington 
investors worried that the federal reserve might try to support 
the falling currency by pushing interest rates higher 
on wall street declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones 
nearly 11 to 1 in the worst day since the widelyfollowed dow jones 
average fell 14058 points on jan 8 
the dow industrials had climbed nearly 130 points from april 5 
through tuesday largely on anticipation that februarys trade news 
would be favorable

associates of santa monica calif 
in the bond market the yield on the treasury departments 
benchmark 30year treasury bond jumped to roughly 886 percent 
thursday the highest since january from 873 percent late 
wednesday 
the trade report also battered major foreign markets in london 
the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index fell 13 percent 
on thursday 
some economists called the markets fears an overreaction 
the quality precision of the numbers obviously leaves 
something to be desired said raymond worseck economist at ag 
edwards amp sons inc in st louis 
the trade report indicated consumers were continuing to spend 
strongly sucking up imports worseck said 
the trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of 176 
billion in october it was up from januarys 124 billion gap but 
was down from a deficit of 144 billion in february 1987 
its just one of those glitches that keep the financial 
markets interesting the trend is still for improvement in the 
trade deficit said james solloway director of economic research

the sun shines on rustling palms the 
airport bustles with the worlds business and on the isolated 
plane of martyrdom three dozen people wait for their captors to 
kill them or set them free 
the blueandwhite kuwait airlines boeing 747 hijacked april 5 
faces north toward the main terminal and control tower about 400 
yards away 
from the cockpit crew members talk with the tower about air 
conditioner maintenance delivery of food and other routine matters 
police presence is discreet four small armored cars encircle 
the plane but no soldiers are in sight 
algerian officials proud of their countrys ability to deal 
with both revolutionaries and conservative governments note 
repeatedly that the gunmen have promised to refrain from violence 
while here and say an assault on the plane is out of the question 
the hijackers killed two passengers during five days spent on 
the ground at larnaca cyprus 
at least 200 reporters and photographers patrol the sunbaked 
lawn between the terminal and the vip lounge and fight for the 
scarce unreliable telephones that were installed after the plane 
arrived early wednesday 
from the lawn shaded by tents erected wednesday night by 
blueuniformed soldiers journalists peer at the plane through 
binoculars and telephoto lenses 
now and then algerian officials climb the stairway and are 
allowed to enter the jumbo jet for 15 to 30 minutes of continuing 
but episodic negotiations with the hijackers 
talks between algerian mediators and a kuwaiti delegation take 
place elsewhere presumably in government offices downtown 
passenger jets land every 10 or 20 minutes and taxi past the 
hijacked plane to discharge passengers into the crowded terminal 
which is dusty from construction that has closed its selfservice 
restaurant 
airport workers and taxi drivers show intense interest and press 
journalists for information about the standoff with the hijackers 
who demand freedom for 17 proiran extremists convicted of bombing 
the us and french embassies in kuwait in 1983 
on wednesdy night the drama heightened 
two buses pulled up to the plane official cars raced across the 
tarmac the kuwaiti delegation stood expectantly in what looked 
like a receiving line and the moving stairway approached the 
planes front door 
the control tower radioed the cockpit to say an official was 
ready to enter the response we are praying 
an algerian official entered rumors flew he left the kuwaiti 
receiving line disbanded reformed then disappeared hours ticked 
away toward midnight and it seemed that whatever had been on was 
off there was no official explanation 
suddenly a hijacker was helping a hostage hobble down the 
stairs less than a minute later the kuwaiti businessman was being 
guided into a portion of the vip lounge barred to reporters his 
10day ordeal was over 
soon afterward radio scanners recorded a statement from the 
hijackers describing themselves as men of principle and 
restating their demand for the release of the 17 prisoners in 
kuwait even if the price we have to pay is very high

american companies here say theyre 
caught in the middle of president reagans new economic sanctions 
and may have to close if theyre not allowed to resume payments to 
panamas government 
eastman kodak co gave its workforce in panama a 15day paid 
furlough because of the problems in doing business a company 
spokesman said friday 
another company has given its employees collective vacations 
since reagan froze all us payments to the panamian government on 
april 8 in an attempt to force gen manuel antonio noriega to 
relinquish power 
a source familiar with the companys situation said it would not 
reopen until conditions are such that it can pay taxes in panama 
the us order prohibits direct or indirect payments including 
income taxes by americans and us corporations to the panamanian 
government it also applies to panamanian corporations owned or 
directed by americans violators can be sentenced to up to 10 years 
in prison and fined 50000 
companies have been told that until any exemptions are 
announced the order is being enforced to its fullest extent 
right down to the 30 departure tax charged at the airport to 
people leaving the country 
you cant move you cant do anything without breaking the 
law the head of one company said 
the executive order puts a gun against my head and the 
panamanian government has a gun against my head and im just 
ducking he said 
all the executives spoke on condition of anonymity 
several company representatives said they were complying with 
the order and continued to operate but they noted they did not yet 
have tax or other payments due the government 
commerce and industries minister mario rognoni has said the 
government will be flexible with us firms but if electricity 
water and telephone bills are not paid the utilities services run 
by the government will be cut off 
we werent ordered to close but it just doesnt make sense to 
stay open said kodak spokesman henry kaska in rochester ny 
we are not permitted to pay our utility bill we cant pay the 
phone bill 
one executive said the ability of american manufacturers to 
continue operating also would depend on whether they have enough 
raw materials in stock since importing also requires payments to 
the government 
were hoping there will exceptions for essential items a 
food company executive said 
we have tax payments to the government but cannot pay them 
he added were caught in the middle 
sooner or later the executive order is going to shut 
everybody down the executive order will totally kill us business 
in panama he said 
he said some companies paid high taxes the first three quarters 
but owed less for the year because of the economic crisis and now 
have credits allowing them to postpone a payment decision 
an american trade association representative said the law was 
hurting us companies more than its target noriega 
in essence its closing down us companies and sending 
americans home and not affecting mr noriega at all i expect some 
leeway will have to be allowed he said 
really youre a hostage here in panama he said referring 
to the airport tax 
panamanian residents also may not leave the country without 
showing what amounts to an income tax receipt 
american businesses are worried about the progressive penalties 
the panamanian government may charge if it decides to let the 
companies pay taxes late 
most executives said they would comply with the sanctions but a 
number were said to be looking for ways to get around it 
nicolas psychoyos said he and his father both american 
citizens have taken leaves of absence from the panamanianowned 
supermarket chain they headed 
nonamericans will run the company for a while from all they 
said this is all we can do he said i think most companies 
are evaluating now whether they want to be thrown in jail in panama 
or in the united states 
psychoyos said the supermarket chain will continue payments to 
the government 
weve got to abide by the laws weve been here 80 years and 
we hope to be another 80 he said 
under the order companies are to make their normal payments to 
an escrow account at the federal reserve bank of new york 
established for eric arturo delvalle who was ousted from the 
presidency by noriega on feb 26 after trying to fire the general

the smug orthodoxy of the scientists of his age said paul 
seiveking a coeditor 
fortean times published in london caters to readers who think 
there just might be something to the hollow earth theory crying 
statues and close encounters of any kind 
the odd little periodical keeps its subscribers up to date with 
the latest on human horns winged cats giant squids and of 
course ufos and the loch ness monster 
fortean times is a bulletin about what is peculiar in the 
world seiveking says 
its name and philosophy come from charles fort an iconoclastic 
american journalist who died in 1932 he spent his later years at 
the british museum library in london and the new york public 
library researching the inexplicable 
being a fortean means believing theres a continuum between 
subjective and objective experience between dream and hard fact 
seiveking said 
more importantly however it means conditional acceptance 
of things that orthodox explanation cant account for at 
least until further evidence comes along 
seiveking and coeditor bob rickard who founded fortean times 
15 years ago put the magazine together at home in their spare 
time and try their best to publish it quarterly 
their material comes from a dedicated fortean cadre of about 60 
correspondents mostly unpaid who scour the worlds newspapers and 
other media for weird and wonderful tales to fill the magazines 80 
or so pages 
every month the editors meet to classify the material their 
correspondents have gathered into about 35 main categories like 
phantom smells strange sounds lights stuff falling from the 
sky seiveking said 
theres a lot of laughter in what we do he admitted during 
a break from his regular job as an editor for a london reference 
book publisher 
but he said the job also has a serious side 
were trying to broaden peoples horizons we see ourselves as 
chroniclers as sort of scientists as well as being entertainers 
a recent issue featured purportedly new photographs of the yeti 
the mysterious abominable snowman of the himalayas as well as 
items about giant whirlpools in the seas off norway and fireballs 
in jerusalem and a reincarnation roundup 
finding a fortean times subscriber may be only a little easier 
than tracking down the yeti just 2500 of them are scattered in 36 
countries including 500 in the united states at 3 a copy the 
magazine just about breaks even 
regular readers said seiveking include little old ladies who 
are spiritualists people in the united nations professors 
science fiction writers journalists in obscure little countries 
who like to keep up with this kind of thing 
theyre a small but faithful band who dont let a few facts get 
in the way of a good time 
while the real nature of the cottingly fairy photographs is 
now apparent one australian reader recently wrote in a letter to 
the editor surely the fortean reaction will be that they are 
only relative fakes for in the spectrum of bogusgenuine there 
must somewhere in this or another world exist photographs of real 
fairies 
not quite believing while not quite disbelieving always gives 
forteans an out it allowed the author of a recent piece on the 
luminous magnetic cloud supposedly encountered by a british 
steamship in 1904 to conclude although i remain disturbed by the 
suspicious aspects of the story i am slightly inclined to think 
that the story is true 
as long as there are mysterious lights in the sky and things 
that go bump in the night seiveking and rickard hope to keep 
publishing their journal of strange phenomena

an ancient mummy found in a pawnshop is 
likely the body of a man who died at the age of 35 and would have 
had a longer and more comfortable life in the age of antibiotics 
university scientists say 
memphis state university paid a detroit pawnbroker 40000 for 
the 2300yearold mummy two years ago and asked the university of 
tennessee memphis to run a battery of tests 
the medical school set up a mummy team in 1985 to conduct 
similar tests on an ancient head acquired by memphis states 
institute of egyptian art and archaeology 
the team tested tissue and hair samples and took hundreds of 
xrays and announced thursday that the egyptian apparently died of 
a brain abscess caused by an ear infection 
hugh berryman a forensic anthropologist said the man was 5 
feet tall probably righthanded and had thinning brown hair and 
also suffered from serious tooth infections 
james langston a radiologist with the medical school said the 
egyptian had an infection that ate through a bone near his left 
inner ear and may have led to a fatal brain abscess 
thats a reasonable cause of death he said we only have 
the bone for speculation because we dont have the brain 
rita freed an egyptologist from memphis state said the mummy 
was named iretirew according to inscriptions on its coffin 
the mummy was brought to the united states in the 1920s it was 
kept at a museum in chicago until 1976 when it was sold to an 
antique dealer it eventually was bought by the pawnbroker who 
later sold it to memphis state ms freed said

sparkling crescent moon in the next few days offering skywatchers 
a special sight 
the dazzling white point of light that marks the planet venus 
will shine near the emerging moon astronomers report 
itll be a particularly nice scene and folks will notice 
it said gail cleere of the us naval observatory here 
the peak will come on tuesday night just after twilight but the 
celestial couple will also shine together on sunday and monday 
nights reports sky amp telescope magazine 
the moon will be just three days old on tuesday so it will be a 
pretty crescent cleere said we gets hundreds of calls when 
instances like this occur 
the new moon occurs on saturday meaning that the earths 
natural satellite will be invisible but on the following days 
light will begin to brighten the edge creating the familier 
crescent moon 
venus meanwhile will be located in almost the same part of the 
sky and will be the brightest object visible other than the moon 
while venus and the moon will appear close together in the sky 
thats only because they are located along the same line of sight 
venus is about 54 million miles away 225 times farther than the 
moon

democrat michael dukakis blasted president 
reagan and vice president george bush today for having supported a 
dopepeddling dictator in panama republican bush said one 
reason panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega has lasted so 
long is that he has been getting money from libya 
all three democratic candidates campaigned in new york today 
four days before the states primary with jesse jackson ridiculing 
his rivals as latecomers in the fight against illegal drugs and 
albert gore jr saying troubles at eastern airlines reflected 
handsoff greedpromoting values encouraged by the reagan 
administration 
new polls confirmed dukakis lead among new york democrats with 
jackson running second and gore a poor third 
bush speaking in washington to the american society of 
newspaper editors said noriega should go and noriega will go 
he said he did not know about noriegas alleged involvement in 
drug trafficking until the panamanian leader was indicted in this 
country citing several reliable sources he said noriega has 
been able to stay in power despite us sanctions at least partly 
because he has been receiving millions of dollars from libya 
speaking before the same forum former television evangelist pat 
robertson said he still hoped his supporters could play a key role 
in the republican convention in august but he ackowledged 
george bush will probably have things his own way 
massachusetts gov dukakis made strong antidrug remarks to 
students today at a junior high school in brooklyn 
he spoke informally rather than giving the prepared remarks that 
aides had distributed to reporters in those remarks he asked 
rhetorically mr president and mr vice president what is going 
on 
why do we have the money for star wars but not for the war 
against drugs and why did you pay 200000 a year to a 
dopepeddling gunrunning panamanian dictator a reference to 
former us support of noriega 
gore spoke to about two dozen members of pilots mechanics and 
flight attendants unions at eastern airlines early today saying 
mismanagement of eastern and continental et cetera stands as a 
symbol of the kind of approach ronald reagan and george bush 
encourage with their policies of hands off let em have whatever 
kind of labor relations they want promote greed as the principal 
guiding value for corporate america 
cuomo has refused to endorse any of the three democratic 
contenders saying he will wait until after the last primaries on 
june 7 
earlier in the week jackson met with cuomo and the governor was 
generous in his praise of the former civil rights activist 
on thursday however cuomo said jacksons lack of experience in 
elective office could hurt him if he won the nomination 
i could make a better case for him if he had been a public 
official cuomo said 
before cuomo decided to hold off any endorsement dukakis had 
been considered the oddson favorite to win the governors backing 
the massachusetts governor also had hoped to get the support of 
koch but the new york city mayor surprised many observers by 
announcing his backing of gore whom he described as a man of 
intellect courage and integrity 
koch said that on the issue of support of israel gore was 
head and shoulders above the other two democrats 
the mayor said jackson was never in contention for his 
endorsement but that he would back him if he became the party 
nominee 
he added however that his support of jackson would be based 
not because of his positions but because he would be less 
destructive of the country than george bush 
gore needed all the help he could get in new york which holds 
its primary next tuesday with 255 delegates at stake 
dukakis led jackson by 45 percent to 28 percent in a cbs news 
poll 46 percent to 34 percent in a marist college poll and 49 
percent to 34 percent in an abc newswashington post poll gore had 
only 8 percent support in two polls and 7 percent in the third 
gores numbers are flat across the board said marist 
pollster lee miringoff while things can change before tuesdays 
vote certainly nothing much moved this week except for solidity 
to the frontrunners 
i only believe polls that show me way in front gore 
commented after the debate 
the latest confrontation offered no sign of a breakthrough 
gore pressed dukakis once again on his statement to the new york 
daily news that he would consider use of nuclear weapons in the 
event of a soviet invasion of europe 
this is a serious mistake said gore referring to the 
dukakis statement 
when gore raised the issue again later in the debate dukakis 
said dont pick up the morning newspaper and then have a press 
conference give me a buzz and ill tell you exactly what i said 
and therell be much less confusion 
when gore first took dukakis to task dukakis said gore 
misrepresented what dukakis had told the newspaper dukakis said he 
was simply restating longstanding us and nato policy 
jackson however said there was a real danger in those of us 
who may very well lead our country to get trapped into a 
hypothetical situation on who will shoot your gun first and destroy 
the whole world to prove that you got macho 
dukakis widened his delegate lead over jackson to 112 when 26 
house members supporting him were nominated to be among the 
socalled super delegates to the democratic national convention 
jackson picked up 15 delegates in congress while gore got 11 a 
total of 251 members of the house and senate will be delegates to 
the convention

cracks are appearing in the underground 
palestinian leadership over how to wage a campaign of resistance 
against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
the divisions are emerging at a time when the frequency and size 
of street clashes is diminishing and the nature of the 
confrontation is changing into more of an economic test of wills 
there are two basic splits in palestinian ranks 
the islamic resistance movement is at odds with the mainstream 
palestine liberation organization factions on the issue of 
convening an international conference to negotiate peace 
the communists in a dispute over tactics have pulled out of 
the ploaffiliated underground command the united national 
leadership of the uprising 
the underground has announced weekly action programs in a series 
of leaflets but starting in early march there have been multiple 
versions some making conflicting demands on the 15 million 
residents of the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
in the latest handbill no 13 one version calls for three days 
of general strikes to mark prisoners day while another 
version apparently communist called for sitins at the red cross 
offices and other locations 
there are differences on how to act on tactics conceded 
mohammed manasra a journalist with the daily communist newspaper 
al taalia 
as an example manasra cited the repeated calls for general 
strikes which he said kept workers away from jobs at a time when 
israel was using economic measures in an effort to put an end to 
the uprising 
if israel is putting economic pressure on people and we also 
put pressure on people then we are doing what israel wants said 
manasra who added workers would ignore strike calls if they became 
excessive 
instead of general strikes that hurt lowincome palestinians 
manasra said the communists supported a boycott of israeli products 
according to the ministry of labors government employment 
service about half the 110000 arabs who hold jobs in israel went 
to work in february and march oficials claim the onthejob figure 
has risen recently although statistics were not available 
after palestinians stopped paying taxes israeli authorities 
imposed financial and trade restrictions and put the west banks 
8000 teachers on halfpay for three weeks the army has also 
ordered stores closed when plo leaflets said they should be open 
food is very expensive people are feeling the seriousness of 
the economic strikes farah elaraj the projordanian mayor of 
beit jallah said on israel radio 
a second split is between the plo factions and the islamic 
resistance movement a coalition of fundamentalist groups that has 
a large following in the gaza strip 
to counter the increasing islamic influence the ploaffiliated 
factions the communist party and the islamic jihad formed a 
coalition in early january called the united national leadership 
of the uprising it has followed the policies of plo chairman 
yasser arafat in seeking an international peace conference and in 
not escalating clashes by using guns and knives 
the fundmentalists however oppose negotiations with israel and 
seek creation of a panislamic rather than palestinian state 
the first phase of the uprising is winding down and they 
palestinians disagree about the second phase about where to go 
from here said col renaan gissin deputy army spokesman 
there are feelings of fatigue the people want to see some 
results he added 
gissin said another split threatening the unity of the 
underground was islamic jihads desire to wage armed struggle a 
policy opposed by plo groups 
despite the disputes manasra said the resistance would continue 
because local committees rather than the leaflet writers had the 
final say on whether to observe calls for strikes and protests 
for example he said he doubted whether local committees would 
heed the call in the latest leaflet to throw firebombs on april 21 
the socalled day of the palestinian molotov 
the army spokesman said the overall level of violence had 
dropped markedly in recent weeks even though the bloodshed had not 
ceased altogether 
the intensity of the clashes is still high but there are 
fewer confrontations and the size of demonstrations is smaller a 
hundred or so instead of thousands said gissin 
there have been 7000 clashes between soldiers and demonstrators 
since dec 8 killing 146 arabs and two israelis more than 1000 
arabs have been wounded by gunfire 
i think we are now in an ebbing phase of the uprising weve 
already reached the peak but when it finally subsides i dont 
think it will go back to the same level it started at four months 
ago said sari nusseibah a philosophy professor at the bir zeit 
university in the west bank

prime minister margaret thatchers controversial 
social welfare legislation is stirring the fiercest opposition she 
has encountered since her reelection last june 
the resistance is coming not just from the opposition but from 
rankandfile lawmakers within her own conservative party who on 
thursday night staged their biggest backbench revolt since june 
twentyeight of the 376 tories in parliament voted against the 
governments decision to end free dental checkups and eye 
examinations 
the sums involved 560 for the dental checkup are small 
but they matter to the poor and they come in the same month as the 
top income tax rate is being slashed from 60 to 40 percent 
and while the number of rebels looks relatively small any 
revolt is significant given mrs thatchers strongwilled style of 
leadership customarily a lawmaker voting against his government 
almost automatiucally destroys his chances of winning government 
office 
the social welfare moves and a controversial reform of property 
taxes another thatcher brainchild have combined to arouse deep 
unease among sections of the parliamentary rankandfile about her 
radical third term program 
at the heart of the debate is a fear that the very welloff 
make substantial gains which are wholly financed by the less 
welloff said conservative legislator sir george young a 
leading rebel 
playing around with rebates for the poor in no way tackles 
that fundamental inequity 
mrs thatcher remains determined to wean britons off what she 
calls the dependency culture and encourage private enterprise 
she points to the economic revival her rigorous policies have 
wrought including the fastest growth rate in western europe and 
the countrys first budget surplus in nearly two decades 
but there are signs of defensiveness on thursday night the 
62yearold prime minister made a comparatively rare foray into the 
house of commons tea room to rally support for the new property 
tax popularly called the poll tax 
and the government announced an extension of rebates costing 
about 245 million and affecting 1 million people in a move to 
blunt another rebellion when the poll tax comes up for a key vote 
monday 
that concession appeared aimed at heading off a major revolt 
monday in the 650member commons where the conservatives hefty 
102seat majority was whittled to 81 and 74 in thursdays votes 
under the poll tax families will be rated according to how many 
adults are living in the home estimates are that the tax on some 
homes will more than double hitting modest earners hardest 
it will manifestly be perceived to be unfair complained 
another tory legislator michael mates who hopes to get about 50 
colleagues to back an amendment that would base the tax on income 
instead of a flat charge 
like changes in housing subsidies which force everyone 
including public housing tenants to pay at least onefifth of the 
property taxes on their homes the poll tax is fundamental to a 
thatcher onslaught on local councils 
the local councils which run local government are dominated by 
britains leftwing 
they levy and spend property taxes and most of the bigger 
councils are run by the socialist labor party 
the guardian newspaper the nations foremost liberal daily 
argued that tory legislators with narrowly held seats are 
frightened by mrs thatchers measures 
where damaging policy changes were unable to provoke a revolt 
political survival has succeeded it said 
a straw poll among 100 rankandfile tory legislators by another 
daily the independent found nearly twothirds expressing alarm at 
the social security changes 
the government says it is merely refocusing the 86 billion 
welfare budget on the most needy but opposition and welfare groups 
estimate that twothirds of the 86 million welfare claimants will 
lose funds the government acknowledges 43 percent will receive 
less 
polls show the conservative government is losing support 
gallups march poll showed the conservatives 55 points ahead of 
labor down from 10 the previous month twothirds of the 1094 
voters questioned said they thought the taxcutting budget 
announced march 15 was not fair 
the conservatives received 42 percent support enough for 
another victory with labor getting 365 percent and the rest split 
among two center parties and minority regional parties

production at the nations factories mines 
and utilities edged up a sluggish 01 percent in march the 
government said friday somewhat counterbalancing signs that 
inflation is reheating 
the federal reserve board said gains in production of autos and 
business equipment offset declines in construction supplies and 
consumer goods other than cars 
the slight march advance followed no change in february and 
according to economists is an indication that the pickup in 
wholesale prices may not be sustainable 
it isnt the type of boom production environment that would 
support rapid gains in inflation said maury harris chief 
economist at painewebber in new york 
the labor department in a separate report friday said 
wholesale inflation was running at a 7 percent annual rate in 
march that news sent jitters through the financial markets and 
pushed interest rates higher 
ironically a fairly low growth rate in industrial production 
is good in one sense it may actually allay suspicions that the 
economy may be on the verge of overheating said gordon richards 
an economist with the national association of manufacturers 
before february production had been increasing at a steady 
pace 05 percent in november and december and 04 percent in 
january the last decline was in september when production fell 
02 percent production had shot up 11 percent in october 
despite two months of lackluster growth production levels in 
march were a strong 56 percent above levels a year ago 
the march rise included a 02 percent jump in production at 
manufacturing plants after a flat performance in february that 
included a 26 percent increase in auto production which followed 
a 08 percent drop in february and a 06 percent boost in 
production of equipment used by businesses the fourth consecutive 
gain 
factories making durable goods items expected to last three or 
more years saw output rise 03 percent last month output at 
plants making nondurable goods was unchanged for the second month 
in a row 
mining output increased 04 percent after a 10 percent drop in 
february output at utilities dropped 12 percent after a 05 
percent increase 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc a lexington 
mass forecasting firm said the drop at utility companies was 
caused by warmerthanusual weather in march 
he predicted that industrial production overall would pick up in 
coming months 
we ought to see auto production coming up inventories are 
now down to nearnormal levels the drop in utilities should be 
over wyss said 
the various changes left industrial production at 1346 percent 
of its 1977 base of 100

lawrence buzalsky stopped at the horse 
around bar to buy a frozen pizza but he got a taste of history and 
a gander at the us constitution before heading home with his 
dinner 
who built that buzalsky asked circling a traveling exhibit 
the state put together to celebrate the 200th birthday of the us 
constitution theres a lot of reading 
the horse around bar one of two businesses in this prairie 
ranching town is playing host to the foursided display through 
monday because there is no other place for it in the county 
the wooden exhibit was too large to fit through the doors of 
either the nearby slope county courthouse or the school and a 
church that could accommodate it was already booked 
galan hanson who moved to amidon from wisconsin four years ago 
to open the horse around bar said he gladly volunteered a large 
garage and storage room attached to his saloon for the exhibit 
nine people had signed a guest book ratifying the 
constitution by thursday afternoon 
some spend quite a lot of time back there reading the stuff 
and some just look it over in and out hanson said sitting near 
rows of liquor bottles sipping coffee in a lot of ways it is 
the conversation piece of the bar but i really dont think it 
will bring me any extra business 
the north dakota constitution celebration committee headed by a 
state supreme court justice and the state department of public 
instruction created the exhibit and intend to display it in each of 
the states 53 counties 
its a minimuseum featuring old pictures newspaper stories and 
brief narratives about segments of north dakotas history that 
relate to individual freedoms and government powers 
amidon is in the southwest corner of north dakota about 125 
miles west of bismarck and boasts that its the smallest county 
seat in the country 
you can say 25 to 30 people live here slope county sheriff 
pat lorge said it depends on what day it is 
judy bender one of two teachers at the elementary school said 
all 20 students would go see the historical display friday 
it didnt make any difference that the field trip essentially 
meant visiting a saloon she said the kids are used to it they 
frequent it quite often with their parents for supper she said 
the sheriff whose office just is across us highway 85 
examined the exhibit wednesday night 
they have an old slope county homestead on it said lorge 
whose grandfather was sheriff for 18 years im not so sure its 
not the old day place 
hanson moved his pickup from the garage which used to be a 
repair shop for a farm supply store to make way for the display 
an old horse harness hangs on pegs on one wall not far from a 
saddle a woodenwheeled wagon that hanson hitches to his 
clydesdales sits nearby hanson claims the wagon is at least 75 
years old 
buzalsky a rancher circled the constitutional exhibit with its 
red white and blue ribbons a couple of times before leaning into a 
chest freezer to pick out a pizza 
he didnt have time to read all the history on the display 
i have to get the pizza going he said the women folks 
sent me to town to get it

the tragedies of multiple suicides by young 
people can provide lessons for other communities to follow in the 
future according to a new report by the national centers for 
disease control 
on march 11 1987 in bergenfield nj two young men 18 and 
19 and two young women 16 and 17 committed suicide by locking 
themselves in a garage and sitting inside a car with the motor 
running 
within days school officials identified other students they 
felt might be at risk counseling was provided to young people and 
a local suicide hotline and a walkin counseling center were 
started 
the cdc report as is the agencys custom did not name the new 
jersey town where the four young people died on that date but 
bergenfield has been identified in numerous news reports about the 
deaths 
after an investigation the cdc noted in its weekly report 
thursday that when a suicide cluster does occur an extraordinary 
amount of community effort and resources is temporarily devoted to 
suicide prevention 
such a response is appropriate the atlantabased health 
agency said it is prudent for a community faced with a suicide 
cluster to make every effort to anticipate and prevent additional 
suicides among susceptible individuals 
the cdc said communities should consider contingency plans for 
suicide clusters and may want to consider implementing a suicide 
response plan before a cluster has begun many suicide clusters 
the agency said have followed one or more deaths due to injuries 
among young people 
planning ahead can keep communities from reinventing the 
wheel during their own tragedies said dr patrick ocarroll of 
the cdc 
theres no reason for every single community that runs into 
this to try to start from scratch theres experience they can try 
to take advantage of ocarroll said 
bergenfield a suburban community six miles west of new york 
had an annual suicide rate of seven per 100000 during 198084 
significantly lower than the national rate of 12 per 100000 cdc 
researchers found 
but in that town and in others where people have died in 
apparent suicide pacts there have been similarities the cdc said 
other young people had died unnaturally before the suicides and 
the suicides may have had a contagious effect prompting others 
to try to kill themselves 
the young bergenfield men had both been friends of an 
18yearold who died in a fall from a cliff six months earlier and 
after the four teenagers killed themselves two other young people 
a 20yearold and a 17yearold attempted suicide together in 
the same garage

presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater denied 
friday that the reagan administrations resistance to a 
laborbacked plantclosing provision in a new trade bill 
constitutes an antiworker stance 
while renewing president reagans threat to veto the legislation 
if the plant shutdown notification requirement remained intact 
fitzwater said were trying to keep peoples jobs 
we want a trade bill that doesnt eliminate jobs through 
foreign competition he said 
we want a bill that maximizes the opportunities for companies 
to stay in business and people can keep their jobs fitzwater 
told reporters and thats what youre going to hear from us if 
we have to veto this bill 
but during his daily white house news briefing the spokesman 
acknowledged that administration negotiators on the sweeping trade 
bill are stymied in attempts to talk lawmakers into discarding the 
plant notification provision 
i think theres still some opportunity for talk he said 
but he said reagan would not accept any version of the trade bill 
that contained provisions which are injurious to a dynamic 
economy 
fitzwater reiterated reagans veto intentions in the wake of a 
further deterioration of americas trade deficit and as house and 
senate members wrangled over the language to be kept in the final 
version of the 1000page trade bill 
conferees are trying to iron out differences between competing 
house and senate versions of the bill the plantclosings 
provision which was approved by the senate but not the house 
would require companies with at least 100 employees to give 60day 
notice of plant closings or layoffs involving at least 150 
positions if that represented onethird of the work force 
all layoffs of 500 or more would have to be accompanied by 
notice regardless of whether they represented a third of the work 
force 
business groups oppose the provision arguing that it could lead 
to other steps to strip away the prerogatives of company managers 
the aflcio and other organizations in the labor movement maintain 
the measure is necessary to prepare workers for the need to find 
new employment 
the congress made good progress in moving toward such a 
bill fitzwater said friday but he said the white house is 
displeased that the plantclosing provision remains in the bill 
our negotiators were encouraged to believe the plant 
closing provision would be eliminated fitzwater said later 
however we were told that after certain consultations took place 
they could not remove that provision the labor unions apparently 
would sacrifice the entire trade bill for this provision 
while the administration would be willing to accept a positive 
trade bill we cannot accept one that includes seriously flawed 
elements that will hurt americas competitiveness the spokesman 
said 
if the bill reaches the president in its present form the 
president will veto it fitzwater said 
the democratic leadership had seemed close to dropping the 
plantclosings plan on wednesday but overnight lobbying by 
organized labor led to a chorus of protests thursday in the house 
democratic caucus said sources who spoke only if not quoted by 
name 
top democrats announced their support for the plan at 
midafternoon thursday they said new figures from the commerce 
department showing a widening us trade deficit and an 
accompanying 101point drop in the stock market called for a strong 
legislative response

the idea is something out of star trek a 
handheld device that a doctor or nurse can point at a patient to 
register heart and respiration rates 
but the vital signs monitor which a new company hopes to put on 
the market in 18 months is expected to look more like a pocket 
calculator than the sleek cylinders used by dr leonard bones 
mccoy on the enterpirse 
and the device was inspired not by science fiction but by a 
military need to help medics in the battlefield 
a prototype somewhat bigger than a briefcase has been delivered 
to the military by georgia tech researchers the university has 
licensed health techniques of georgia inc a company formed last 
august to sell the technology to civilian health care providers 
we think it has particular application for patients who are 
severely burned where no contact with the skin is possible or 
looked for and also with patients who may have a contagious 
disease or patients who have compromised immune systems and have to 
be isolated from contact with other people said doug robinson 
chief operating officer of health techniques 
robinson said the device would weigh 1 to 2 pounds and would 
have a top range of six feet to 10 feet he said the comparison to 
the chirping medical scanners on star trek is inevitable 
ive heard that more times than you can imagine its really 
very close to that he said 
stephen bonasera a research engineer on the tech team which is 
developing the monitor said the device depends on microwave 
transmissions bounced off the patients body phase changes in 
the waves show the hearts movements he said 
in addition to the heart and respiratory rate functions health 
techniques hopes the device can be refined to also measure body 
temperature 
bonasera said the monitor also can reveal information about the 
mechanical workings of the heart something an electrocardiogram 
or ekg cannot do the researcher said more work is needed on 
interpreting the returning microwave signals to do that 
techs work began in 1984 with navy funding the air force later 
contributed funding and bonasera said the army also is interested 
theyre imagining say a chemical battlefield in europe that 
you have medics going around and picking up patients for trage and 
you want to limit the exposure of the medics they want a device 
you could point at a patient to find out yes or no is he alive 
he said 
dr david erwin of the air force school of aerospace medicine at 
brooks air force base texas said other battlefield casualties 
also would benefit 
in the military we have situations where people are in all 
types of clothing it makes it very difficult to put on a 
stethoscope or blood pressure test he said

a day after his conviction on charges of 
killing three patients was overturned navy heart surgeon donal m 
billig was allowed today to leave fort leavenworth kan where he 
had been held prisoner for two years 
the us navymarine corps court of military review on thursday 
overturned billigs conviction because the court said the 
evidence was simply not sufficient 
billig held at the fort since 1986 was released from the 
prison itself thursday but was held overnite in the bases 
bachelor officers quarters while administrative paperwork was 
completed 
billig automatically returns to active duty with his previous 
rank of commander and is eligible for 120000 in back pay but he 
cannot practice medicine said navy spokeswoman lt janet mescus 
she said billig would probably be assigned to a navymarine 
corps reserve center in kansas city while the navy makes a decision 
on appealing the verdict the service has 20 days to make that 
decision 
the courts 20page opinion said prosecutors had failed to 
establish billigs guilt beyond a reasonable doubt 
the appeals court said the prosecutors at billigs 1986 court 
martial lost sight of the fact that coronary artery bypass 
surgery is an inherently risky business 
the prosecutors argued that billig used questionable surgical 
techniques the court said but never really produced the evidence 
or testimony to demonstrate that billigs work in the operating 
room was so out of line as to constitute criminal conduct 
we shall set aside all findings of guilty based on this 
factual insufficiency of the evidence the court said 
the navy has 20 days to file a formal motion with the appeals 
court asking it to reconsider the matter the service said thursday 
it had made no decision yet on pursuing an appeal 
billig 57 was the former chief heart surgeon at the navys 
flagship bethesda md naval hospital and held the military rank 
of commander 
he was convicted in early 1986 of two counts of involuntary 
manslaughter and one count of negligent homicide in the deaths of 
three patients he also was convicted on 18 of 24 counts of 
dereliction of duty stemming from other operations he was 
sentenced on march 3 1986 to four years in prison last summer 
he was rebuffed in his first bid for parole 
billigs case attracted great public attention in part because 
of the sensational nature of some of the charges it also prompted 
congressional reviews of military health care in general and 
several large monetary settlements between the government and 
relatives of billigs patients 
prosecutors described billig as an egocentric man nearly blind 
in one eye who hid his visual handicap and continued performing 
complex heart operations despite numerous warnings that he was 
killing patients 
the appeals court in its opinion said it was troubled by 
billigs conviction because his courtmartial had involved criminal 
charges as opposed to civil claims for damages based on negligence 
the court quoted from a new jersey supreme court ruling that 
stated the question is not whether a defendant should absorb the 
dollar loss of his victim but whether his conduct justifies 
stamping him a criminal and sending him to state prison 
in billigs case the military court said it appeared the 
prosecutors lost sight of the fact that coronary artery bypass 
surgery is an inherently risky business and that those patients 
who agree to this elective surgery are quite ill in the first place 
 
given the critical nature of the work and its complexity 
these surgeons face a difficult enough task without having to worry 
about the spectre of the criminal prosecutor waiting to reduce to 
a charge sheet honest mistakes which fall far short of the gross 
wanton and deliberate misconduct that truly deserves punishment 
we are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the deaths 
that formed the basis of the appellants conviction were due to any 
negligence simple or otherwise on his part 
the court also faulted the presiding military judge at the 
courtmartial for allowing the prosecution to conduct a smear 
campaign against billig 
the appellant was forced not only to defend against the 
charges but also to explain and account for virtually all of his 
mistakes professional setbacks or surgical misadventures during 
the previous 20 years this bad surgeon theory permeated the 
trial proceedings and undoubtedly influenced the court members 
decisions

dozens of israeli settlers guarded by as many 
soldiers marched friday near the arab town where 15yearold 
settler tirza porat and two palestinians were killed in an exchange 
of gunfire and rocks last week 
their purpose was to demonstrate that jews could walk freely in 
the occupied west bank army radio said they objected to the large 
army guard for the mass reenactment of the hike by miss porat and 
a group of friends 
israeli troops wounded two palestinians in scattered violence 
friday after midday prayers on the moslem sabbath hospital 
officials reported the army deployed hundreds of soldiers and 
surrounded major mosques to keep order in the occupied west bank 
and gaza strip 
violence after friday prayers has become a ritual since violence 
began dec 8 in the occupied west bank and gaza which israel 
captured from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east war at 
least 146 palestinians have been killed in the 18 weeks along with 
miss porat and an israeli soldier 
prime minister yitzhak shamir said he was ready to invite eduard 
a shevardnadze to israel if he could be certain the invitation 
would be accepted a spokesman said the soviet foreign minister is 
to visit jordan syria and possibly egypt later this month 
israeli soldiers surrounded mosques in the west bank cities of 
hebron and qalqilya and imposed a curfew friday in the downtown 
district of khan yunis in the gaza strip arab reports said 
soldiers and palestinians clashed at several mosques in gaza and 
two palestinians were reported wounded officials at shifa hospital 
said a 13yearold boy from nearby beit hanoun in critical 
condition with a bullet wound in the stomach 
they said an 18yearold in jabaliya was was shot in the leg 
the officials said 
the army confirmed clashes at jabaliya but said soldiers used 
only rubber bullets and said the beit hanoun incident was being 
investigated 
an army helicopter flew surveillance over jerusalems two main 
mosques as thousands of moslem worshipers gathered to pray 
after prayers 250 youths circled al aqsa mosque waving a 
palestinian flag they shouted allahu akbar god is great 
and threw rocks and empty bottles at police

the bullet has not been found 
maj gen amram mitzna military commander of the west bank 
visited aldubi on friday at jerusalems hadassah hospital brushing 
past members of the mans family who angrily asked him to go away 
i dont welcome the visit said aldubis brother yanir 29 
romam is lying here because of the way mitzna reacted to the arab 
violence a strong army should be feared not only when its in the 
area but also when it is not there 
yossi ahimeir a spokesman for shamir said the prime minister 
would very much like to welcome the soviet foreign minister to 
jerusalem for discussions but shamir will not just throw out an 
invitation he needs to know the foreign minister will come 
shevardnadze said thursday after signing an accord on withdrawal 
of soviet troops from afghanistan that it could open the way for a 
middle east peace settlement 
the signing of the geneva agreements certainly stimulates 
positive processes in the settlement of other regional issues 
including the middle east he told reporters in geneva 
shamir opposes the kremlin proposal for an international 
conference including the palestine liberation organization and the 
five permanent members of the un security council the united 
states soviet union china britain and france 
under the soviet plan participants in the conference would play 
active roles in peace talks 
the prime minister suggests that the united states and soviet 
union invite israel and jordan to a meeting and then leave the two 
adversaries to negotiate directly 
he also says moscow must allow soviet jews to emigrate and must 
renew diplomatic relations severed during the 1967 war before it 
can have a part in middle east negotiations

polish authorities on friday warned 
organizers of an unsanctioned ceremony to mark the 45th anniversary 
of the warsaw jewish ghetto uprising that the gathering would be 
considered illegal an organizer said 
the warning came on the second day of a weeklong official 
anniversary to honor the victims of the nazi holocaust during world 
war ii it is the largest such event ever organized in poland 
on friday meanwhile a polish scholar told a scientific 
conference that she is ashamed of antisemitic behavior in poland 
in 1968 and asked why more polish officials including some 
conference organizers have not come forward to accept 
responsibility 
about 4500 people from around the world including 2000 from 
israel including israeli deputy prime minister itzhak navon have 
come to poland for the ghetto uprising anniversary honoring the 
fighters who resisted the final nazi onslaught against the ghetto 
for three weeks in april and may of 1943 
in addition to the official observances a group of 46 
intellectuals and opposition activists has called for an unofficial 
ceremony sunday in front of the warsaw ghetto fighters monument 
and in the old jewish cemetery 
the group is led by marek edelman a longtime opposition 
activist who is the last surviving commander of the uprising 
remaining in poland edelman says he is boycotting the official 
observances because he considers them a cynical attempt by the 
government to win favor in the west 
jacek kuron an organizer of the unsanctioned ceremony and an 
adviser to the outlawed trade union solidarity said he was taken 
to a warsaw prosecutors office for the warning talk by 
plainclothed police 
i was told that the event which i am coorganizing on sunday 
is illegal so the authorities cannot assure protection and 
the organizing committee will be morally and legally responsible 
for any possible provocations which might take place kuron said 
kuron said the committee intends to proceed with the observances 
anyway including a wreathlaying ceremony at the ghetto fighters 
monument and the dedication of a memorial in the jewish cemetery to 
two polishjewish socialists executed by the soviet union during 
world war ii 
the alternative observances have come under heavy attack in the 
official media which has charged the organizers with being 
antisoviet hyenas trying to take advantage of the anniversary 
to call attention to themselves 
meanwhile on the second day of a twoday historical and 
scientific conference on the struggle of jews and poles under the 
nazi occupation irena maciejewska drew applause at the conference 
when she referred to the politically inspired antisemitic purge 
that took place in poland in 1968 
mrs maciejewska who was delivering a paper on the warsaw 
ghetto uprising in literature said that when she cooperates with 
one official institution cosponsoring the conference the jewish 
historical institute she finds herself in the company of people 
who injured the good name of poland in 1968 
to applause from the audience of several hundred people she 
added as a university person i painfully remember that time and 
as a pole i should be ashamed of it 
the polish united workers communist party in a newspaper 
article last month said antisemitism played a role in 1968 in 
political purges that caused thousands of jews to lose jobs in 
government journalism the army and academia 
opposition activists criticized the statement as being too mild 
and for not identifying individuals involved some of whom they 
charged still hold prominent positions in poland

united nations the united states today vetoed a security 
council resolution urging israel to halt deportations of 
palestinians from the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the us envoy said the measure was unbalanced the vote was 
141 
the palestine liberation organization envoy zehdi l terzi 
condemned the us veto as shielding israel from international 
criticism 
the united states has chosen to single itself out he said 
theres always a rotten apple in the box 
us ambassador herbert s okun cast the veto and said the 
resolutions broad and sweeping condemnation of israel contains 
not a scintilla of balance it contains no appeal or request for 
calm 
okun said the resolution neither contributes to easing 
tensions in the occupied territories nor promotes the cause of 
peace 
the us envoy said it was the fifth time since december that 
the council considered the middle east situation we do not 
regard this recurrent recourse to the security council as befitting 
its authority and prestige he said 
he said the united states was engaged in a major diplomatic 
effort with the parties directly concerned to bring about direct 
negotiations between israel and her arab neighbors 
the meeting of the 15member council was prompted by israels 
deportation of eight palestinian civilians this week 
since antioccupation unrest broke out dec 8 146 arabs have 
been killed in the territories israel captured in the 1967 middle 
east war 
the resolution originally toughly worded had been watered down 
in an unsuccessful effort to avert a veto by the united states 
which often kills resolutions critical of its ally 
the vetoed resolution supported by britain france west 
germany and all other council members urged israel to halt 
deportations and condemned violations of human rights in the 
occupied territories 
it called for a unsponsored settlement of the middle east 
problem 
soviet ambassador alexander m belonogov reflected new 
flexibility by his government on a middle east solution diplomats 
said 
in his speech criticism of israel was not as strident as in 
earlier speeches and he emphasized the importance of balance of 
interests of all parties concerned both arabs including the 
palestinian people as well as israel 
he said a unsponsored international conference is the most 
effective machinery to achieve a political settlement he 
indicated that interim arrangements could be acceptable and 
said that a conference on the middle east could be conducted on 
both a bilateral and multilateral basis 
israel and the united states have opposed an international 
conference that would impose a settlement upon israel and are 
opposed to participation by the plo they have emphasized the 
importance of bilateral negotiations between israel and her 
neighbors

about half of lebanons businesses closed 
friday in the first day of a national strike called by a union 
demanding a 300 percent wage increase 
the government of this chaosridden nation which faces a severe 
economic crisis has offered an increase of about 75 percent 
police said 50 percent of both moslem and christian areas were 
closed in response to the strike call issued thursday by the 
general confederation of labor unions or gclu 
some banks schools restaurants movie theaters gas stations 
and other businesses closed in beiruts moslem and christian 
sectors as well as in other major cities and towns a police 
statement said 
however a variety of businesses defied the 300000member union 
and maintained normal activity 
the union called for the twoday strike after rejecting as 
insufficient the 75 percent increase in private and publicsector 
wages announced by acting prime minister salim hoss 
some employers are clearly defying the gclus decision they 
called their employees to work and strangely these employees 
reported to duty a police spokesman said 
gclu teams are touring beirut and other cities in an effort to 
convince violators to abide by the strike said the spokesman 
a government source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the 75 percent increase is the highest the state treasury and 
private businesses can afford 
the employees realize this thats why they are hesitant in 
abiding by the strike he said 
ahmed srouji who runs a readymade clothes factory in moslem 
west beirut said even a 75 percent raise would be difficult to 
meet 
we will have to raise our prices in this case the unions 
will start nagging again and demand another pay raise srouji 
said at his factory which stayed open friday 
if the unions insist on a 300 percent raise i will close 
he threatened closing will strip my 70 employees from their 
income is this what the gclu wants 
some of his employees also appeared convinced that the size of 
the raise demand was not in their interest 
the boss will definitely fire most of us if the 300 percent 
increase was decided said elie abu issa who works at a 
hairdressing salon in christian east beirut 
there would be less clients if the raise was decided because 
the fees would be brought up sharply in such a case the boss and 
an assistant will be enough to handle the job and most of us will 
be fired abu issa said 
i dont want to be unemployed especially when prices are 
soaring he added 
the lebanese pound slipped against foreign currencies following 
hoss 75 percent pay increase announcement thursday and closed at 
400 to the dollar it opened at 380 to the dollar early in the day 
lebanons economy once the most flourishing in the middle east 
has been hit hard by 13 years of violence 
the pound which rated 25 to the dollar before the outbreak of 
the civil war in 1975 has declined sharply against foreign 
currencies pushing prices sky high in a nation that imports more 
than 85 percent of its needs

the government on friday blamed the united 
states for lack of progress in negotiations for a new us bases 
agreement to replace an accord that expires in december 
the american side doesnt seem disposed to accept certain 
points and thats the reason why the discussions are essentially

greekturkish disputes over the aegean sea and the divided 
mediterranean island of cyprus

the state department said friday it was 
deeply distressed over a resolution approved by the danish 
parliament which closes a loophole in a government ban on ships 
carrying nuclear weapons into danish ports 
the resolution approved thursday by a 7558 vote requires the 
government to inform visiting naval vessels of denmarks 
antinuclear policy denmark has a nuclear ban policy but has not 
been asking such vessels if they are carrying nuclear weapons 
state department spokesman charles redman said implementation of 
the danish resolution in a way which is inconsistent with the us 
policy of not discussing which ships carry nuclear weapons would 
undercut nato security the united states has a longstanding 
policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of nuclear 
weapons aboard its ships 
this policy is central to the us ability to fulfill its nato 
commitments redman said we are not going to change it 
it would have extremely serious consequences for usdanish 
defense cooperation he said adding that the impact of this 
issue extends beyond bilateral relations 
it goes to the very heart of the meaning and interlocking 
nature of our mutual commitments within the nato alliance he 
said 
redman said the policy of withholding information about the 
presence of nuclear weapons is aimed at keeping terrorists and 
saboteurs in the dark and makes effective attacks on us forces 
more difficult 
redman added that the united states will review together with 
the danish government and other nato allies the implications of the 
resolution for the nato alliance and continued defense cooperation 
with denmark

the us military on friday reversed an earlier 
decision to lay off 271 japanese employees at its bases on okinawa 
hiroo takakura head of the labor division of japans defense 
facilities administration agency said the us decision followed 
talks since last year between japanese and us officials 
the us military forces in japan had planned the layoffs 
because the yens recent rise against the dollar made it more 
expensive to maintain employees 
us officials notified the japanese government of the decision 
friday takakura said 
japan agreed last month to assume a larger share of the costs of 
running us military bases in japan under the agreement japans 
share of allowances for japanese base workers will be boosted from 
the current 50 percent to 100 percent or about 162 million in 
1991 
the united states pays the salaries of the japanese workers but 
all other benefits and allowances including transportation 
housing and retirement expenses will be covered by japan 
there are about 21000 japanese employees at us military 
facilities across japan where more than 60000 us military 
personnel are stationed

army soldiers on friday captured 10 
followers of the fugitive leader of a bloody coup attempt in raids 
the military said foiled a plot to attack the presidential palace 
the military went on nationwide alert this week to guard against 
any coup attempt while president corazon aquino was visitin china 
chief military spokesman col oscar florendo said those arrested 
included eight navy guards who helped former lt col gregorio 
gringo honasan escape his prison ship 13 days ago honasan led 
the attempted coup last aug 28

palace by rubber boats traveling down a nearby stream which flows 
into the pasig river the presidential palace is on the banks of 
the pasig in the heart of manila 
templo did not say when the attack was to have been carried out

destabilization plan which was to have been launched friday night 
mrs aquino left thursday for a fourday visit to china and hong 
kong it was her first trip abroad since visiting japan in november 
1986 
florendo said mrs aquino was notified of the raids by telephone 
in beijing and she was delighted with what happened 
mrs aquino met friday with chinese premier li peng and 
president yang shangkun mrs aquino and li agreed that their rival 
claims to the spratly islands should be settled peacefully a

chinas large trade surplus with the philippines according to 
teodoro benigno mrs aquinos spokesman 
brig gen rodolfo biazon commander of the national capital 
regional defense command said three marine companies and 30 police 
and soldiers carried out the raids in the swank blue ridge district 
of suburban quezon city 
he said the raid on the house where the 10 men were found lasted 
only 15 minutes and there was no resistance florendo said up to 
eight houses were raided but all those arrested were found in one 
dwelling 
they included lt gerardo mojica commander of the security 
force aboard the ship from which honasan escaped two of those 
arrested were civilians biazon said 
troops seized 16 m14 rifles four m16s one light machine gun 
five israelimade uzi machine guns five radio sets a grenade 
launcher several grenades and ammunition 
florendo told reporters that the 10 denied planning any attacks 
last week honasan said in a statement that he was withdrawing a 
pledge made a month before his arrest that he would refrain from 
hostile acts against the aquino government 
earlier friday the military announced the filing of the first 
mutiny charges against officers linked to honasans failed coup 
military spokesman lt anselmo cabingan said those formally 
charged included two lieutenant colonels a major and two 
lieutenants they were to be arraigned before a military court

divers have discovered a nazi uboat 
submerged inside a partially destroyed submarine pen near kiel 
city officials said friday 
several months ago longtime residents told city officials they 
recalled there had been a submarine inside the giant concrete 
uboat bunker and divers were hired to search for the vessel 
earlier this month 
allied warplanes heavily bombed uboat pens in northern germany 
during world war ii 
the submarine pen on the east side of the baltic sea inlet 
where kiel is located was originally 198 feet wide and 561 feet 
long city officials say 
some people want the pen preserved as a memorial but city 
planners want to clear the area to develop the harbor

the state department said friday a senate vote 
to impose sanctions on mexico for not doing enough to curb illicit 
drug flows could actually lead to an increase in such traffic 
far from serving as a catalyst for action this vote 
castigates a friend for less than perfect behavior department 
spokesman charles redman said 
he added that the resolution approved thursday night fails to 
recognize mexicos substantial antidrug efforts and the 
extremely positive response of president miguel de la madrid to 
president reagans call for enhanced cooperation 
the senate voted 6327 to overturn a finding made by reagan six 
weeks ago that mexico was fully cooperating with the united 
states in the war on drugs 
redman said that if congress reverses reagans certification 
this would jeopardize further usmexico cooperation and could 
lead to greater drug flows into the united states 
it could in addition seriously damage important us 
economic and political interests in mexico he said 
if adopted by the congress the resolution could deprive mexico 
of certain trade benefits and would require us representatives in 
international lending institutions to vote against mexican loan 
applications 
in a brief statement thursday night mexicos foreign ministry 
rejected the us action as foreign interference in mexican 
affairs 
no power can claim for itself the right to certify the conduct 
of other societies or governments no one has the right to impose 
from abroad conduct ideas political or economic systems on other 
peoples the statement said 
legislation to slap aid sanctions on mexico and four other latin 
american countries also is pending in the house which would have 
to approve the mexico resolution before it could become law even 
supporters of the bill conceded the measure has little likelihood 
of clearing all the hurdles but said the symbolic value of the 
senate vote was enough 
its all rather academic said sen pete wilson rcalif 
the bills primary sponsor but by adopting this resolution we 
will be sending a message to the government of mexico 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said close to 40 percent of the 
cocaine that enters the united states comes through mexico making 
the 1900mile border between the two countries the no 1 entry 
point for narcotics 
weve got to take off the gloves he said

the state department rejecting senate 
criticism said friday a proposed 450 million military sale to 
saudi arabia is required to continue the close relationship the two 
contries have in operating awacs radar aircraft 
department spokesman charles redman made that comment in 
response to an appeal by 58 senators that the administration 
reconsider the proposed sale because of the secret saudi purchase 
of chinese missiles 
this is not a sale of a new item or system or even spare 
parts redman said it is strictly a support program an 
operations and maintenance contract for the previously approved and 
already delivered awacs 
the support program is important in continuing the close 
cooperative working relationship we have in awacs operations with 
the saudis

sen albert gore jrs attacks on his rivals 
have brought him more animosity than votes in new york leaving his 
campaign seemingly stalled in the last days before tuesdays 
primary poll analysts say 
gores democratic opponents have solidified their support 
surveys this week indicate with massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
retaining a comfortable lead over jesse jackson gore is a poor 
third 
one poll indicated dukakis may have overcome the weakness of 
support that plagued him in early contests it said 67 percent of 
his support was strong 9 points better than walter mondales in 
1984 when mondale won the state 
jackson maintained his powerful support among blacks who make 
up about onequarter of the democratic primary vote but was 
drawing only about 17 percent of the white vote and was splitting 
the hispanic vote with dukakis 
i think its a twoperson race i dont believe to date that 
gore has made a mark said meyer s frucher a leading state 
political strategist a lot of people feel turned off by gores 
campaign style he said 
two new york polls by the marist college institute for public 
opinion appeared to support that view one done april 56 said gore 
was viewed unfavorably by 29 percent one week of campaigning 
later that was up to 36 
part of gores problem is an overwhelmingly negative reaction 
on the part of the black community said lee miringoff the 
marist pollster nine percent of blacks rated gore favorably 50 
percent unfavorably he said 
the marist poll also indicated gore was not drawing jews from 
dukakis despite his aggressive effort to portray himself as more 
staunchly proisrael 
the problem with the gore strategy among the jews is that he 
was appealing to conservative jewish democrats and those are 
called republicans in new york miringoff said dukakis had 70 
percent of the jewish vote in the marist poll gore 12 percent 
unchanged from the week before dukakiss favorableunfavorable 
rating among jews was 877 gores 4923 
the marist poll was conducted monday and tuesday before gore 
launched a sharp midweek attack on dukakis nuclear policy 
frucher a close adviser to gov mario cuomo said he expected 
gores newer moves to miss the mark negative works dont get me 
wrong but it only works if you have a positive image he said 
and that just hasnt been created 
for jackson widespread support among whites remained elusive a 
new york post poll friday put his white support at 17 percent 
marist said 16 percent 
voters who are supporting jackson are doing so solidly 82 
percent in the marist poll said they backed him strongly that 
would help him in a light turnout when only the most committed 
voters show up at the polls 
the marist poll found 67 percent of dukakis supporters were 
strongly behind him a survey by abc news and the washington post 
found less strength for both dukakis and jackson it said half 
dukakis supporters were strong compared to twothirds of 
jacksons 
the abc newspost poll was done wednesday night among 176 likely 
democratic voters and had a margin of error of 8 points the marist 
poll was done monday and tuesday among 359 democrats and had a 
5point error margin 
the strength of gores support was flat 40 percent in the 
april 56 marist poll 41 percent in this weeks survey 
the marist poll said 13 percent of likely democratic voters were 
undecided or uncommitted a cbs news poll said 19 percent were 
uncommitted or undecided 
the cbs poll which was done monday through wednesday and had a 
4point error margin had dukakis with 45 percent support jackson 
28 and gore 8 abc had it as dukakis 49 jackson 34 gore 8 the 
marist poll said dukakis had 46 percent jackson 34 and gore 7 the 
new york post poll done monday and tuesday and with a 4point 
error margin had dukakis at 50 percent jackson 33 gore 9

time to make revisions in its courtapproved bankruptcy 
reorganization plan 
possible revisions to the plan include the sale of 3 million to 
4 million of undeveloped land this year ptl trustee david clark 
said other assets including the heritage grand hotel could be 
sold as a last resort he said 
ptl must try to keep the television show on the air even without 
other nonessential assets such as the theme park he said

on a government motion to delay the may 2 implementation of ptls

jim and tammy bakker 
the us government appealed the ptl reorganization plan on dec

the third fullscale test firing of 
the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket will be conducted 
wednesday morton thiokol inc announced 
morton thiokol spokesman rocky raab said the 1 pm horizontal 
firing of the 126footlong rocket will last two minutes the 
booster 12 feet in diameter contains 11 million pounds of 
propellant 
during the second fullscale firing on dec 23 the rockets 
nasadesigned nozzle boot ring broke apart the boot ring about 
two inches thick protects a flexible bearing that allows the 
nozzle to swivel and steer the rocket 
company officials said the test will incorporate the nozzle boot 
ring designed by morton thiokol which performed successfully during 
the first fullscale test last august 
wednesdays firing although the third of its kind at the 
wasatch operations test site is the first of three required to 
qualify the new booster for flight subsequent tests are scheduled 
june 3 and july 6 
the august and december tests evaluated primary and alternate 
elements of solid rocket motor design raab said 
he said the center field joint on the motor to be tested next 
week has been assembled with an intentional manufacturingtype 
flaw in the bonded insulations jseal 
this defect may allow hot gases to penetrate the bonded 
insulation and reach an oring barrier but raab added that 
shortduration test firings with similar defects have shown that 
such defects tend to seal under motor pressure preventing the 
release of gases 
the escape of such superhot gases from a morton thiokol booster 
was blamed for the jan 28 1986 explosion of the shuttle 
challenger and deaths of its seven crew members 
the resumption of shuttle missions is tentatively scheduled for 
aug 4 although nasa officials have said technical problems could 
further delay the launch

the designer of a monument to 300000 jews 
who were sent to their deaths during world war ii says an adjoining 
gas station should be closed because it is insulting to the victims 
the filling station abuts the sparkling new marbleandstone 
memorial at umschlagplatz the railroad siding which bordered the 
walled jewish ghetto during the war 
the monument is being dedicated monday as part of elaborately 
planned observances marking the 45th anniversary of the doomed 
warsaw ghetto uprising in which some of the last 70000 
inhabitants took up arms against the final nazi eradication drive 
on april 19 1943 
workmen were busily trying to complete the 20yardby6yard 
memorial this week but whether the gas station next door will 
reopen in a few weeks remained unclear and a source of controversy 
foreign ministry spokesman stefan staniszewski said thursday 
that official plans always have been to close down the the station 
once the monument was built 
but roman slawinski director of the warsaw branch of the state 
gasoline monopoly cpn said the station will reopen after the 
anniversary ceremonies 
he did not elaborate but an official source demanding anonymity 
said the station will start operations again until another 
location is decided upon and another station is built at the 
expense of those building the monument 
according to the designer of the monument hanna szmalenberg 
that is blackmail 
it shouldnt be there she said no other important 
monument has a gas station nearby it is insulting to the memory 
she said the station should never have been constructed at the 
site and charged that putting it there in the first place was a 
political decision which stemmed from an antisemitic purge 
which took place in poland in 1968 
even though an israeli donor has offered to pay for construction 
of a replacement gas station she said cpn has been holding out 
for more money 
ms szmalenberg interviewed in the gas station lot wednesday 
said she designed the 252000 monument as an enclosed rectangle in 
part because of the stations proximity 
there often are long lines of cars at polish gas stations and 
idling vehicles just a few feet from the monument could be expected 
to disturb visitors she said 
in her design she said visitors will be able to step inside to 
partially avoid the fumes and the traffic noise 
visitors will enter under a sculpted arch inscribed on the 
walls inside are about 400 names representing some of the victims 
who passed through umschlagplatz previously a small tablet marked 
the site 
about 450000 jews from the city and the surrounding countryside 
were crowded into the warsaw ghetto after the 1939 nazi occupation 
the nazis enclosed the quarter with a barbedwiredlined brick wall 
the railroad siding at the tightly guarded square of 
umschlagplatz german for deportation point was the only 
exit for 300000 jews who there were loaded onto boxcars bound for 
the treblinka and majdanek death camps 
ms szmalenberg said she was skeptical of official promises that 
the station later would be shut down for good 
the pumps have been taken down but the office has not been 
touched standing only about a dozen yards from the monument 
even the warsaw authorities are not strong enough to get the 
gasoline people to change their mind she said 
government spokesman jerzy urban asked about it on tuesday 
said i really dont understand and you must pardon me for this 
what the problem is because it concerns some technical details 
if the filling station poses an obstacle to the monument itself 
then it goes without saying that it will be closed down for 
good he said but if the station is just an impediment to the 
ceremonies it is a different matter

less than 24 hours after the signing of the geneva 
accords on afghanistan tass accused the united states on friday of 
trying to ruin the agreement by continuing to supply weapons to the 
moslem insurgents 
washington is confirming its policy of neoglobalism a course 
of export of counterrevolution the news agency said in the 
first official soviet press commentary issued since the signing of 
the pact in the swiss city 
tass said private and public figures from various countries had 
hailed the agreement which paves the way for the may 15 start of 
the withdrawal of the estimated 115000 soviet troops now in 
afghanistan 
but tass said the us government has been reacting in a 
typical washington manner 
it said the us government was interfering in afghansoviet 
relations by insisting the soviet union stop its military aid to 
afghanistans marxist government in kabul 
us officials have said they will continue aiding the 
guerrillas as long as soviet military supplies to the regime of 
president najib continue 
similar american interference continues in other regional 
conflicts in the middle east central america and africa where the 
united states is using illegal unclean practices to bring 
about a situation favorable to itself tass said 
the soviet union and united states signed agreements in geneva 
on thursday pledging to guarantee pakistani and afghan observance 
of the settlement of the 10yearold afghan conflict 
it said that if pakistan and afghanistan strictly observe the 
geneva agreements prohibition against interference in each others 
affairs washingtons military support of the guerrillas funneled 
through pakistan will not have a decisive influence 
however a separate tass commentary expressed concern about 
pakistans position as stated by president mohammed zia ulhaq 
the ink hadnt dried on the geneva agreements in which the 
sides obliged not to offer their territory for hostile actions 
against other countries when the pakistani president undertook to 
aid the mujahadeen in the struggle for the armed overthrow of the 
kabul administration tass said 
it called the pakistani position irresponsible 
the mujahadeen guerrillas based in pakistan have rejected the 
geneva agreements and vowed to drive the kabul government from 
power 
the soviets sent troops into afghanistan in december 1979 to 
preside over the replacement of one marxist leader by another they 
stayed to help combat a nationwide insurgency 
also friday a soviet foreign ministry spokesman said the number 
of soviet soldiers killed and injured in afghanistan will be 
disclosed during the troop withdrawal 
spokesman vadim perfiliev told reporters at a regular news 
briefing that foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze had promised 
disclosure of the figures while in geneva for the signing of the 
afghan agreement 
perfiliev was asked at the briefing whether he believes soviet 
citizens who have never been informed of casualties during the 
soviet involvement in afghanistan have the right to know the full 
costs of the war 
of course he replied as far as concrete figures are 
concerned as the foreign minister mentioned yesterday in geneva 
the number of soviet troops in afghanistan and other figures on 
that score casualties will be published simultaneously with the 
process of withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan 
western officials estimate that at least 10000 soviets have 
been killed in the war and about 25000 wounded

vice president george bush said friday that 
millions of dollars from libya is helping panamanian strongman 
antonio manuel noriega resist us efforts to force him out of the 
country 
still bush told the american society of newspaper editors 
noriega should go and noriega will go 
bush cited several reliable sources for his information but 
did not elaborate state department spokesman charles redman 
indicated he had no further information on bushs allegation 
the vice president labeled democratic charges that the 
administration had propped up noriega as demagogic statements 
and declared it is this administration that has brought noriega 
to justice or at least taken the first step 
meanwhile pat robertson bushs only remaining rival for the 
republican presidential nomination told the same audience that 
bushs popularity stemmed almost entirely from his association with 
president reagan 
george bush was regarded as reagan the second robertson 
said he acknowledged there was no way to deny bush the gop 
nomination 
it is obvious from the delegate count that has come out that 
george bush is going to be the nominee of the republican party 
absent any unexpected eventuality the former television minister 
said 
about his own camapign robertson said i really dont think 
looking now at the results that anything made any difference 
george bush ran a superb campaign and i had no conception that he 
had adopted the reagan mantle in so total a way 
still robertson indicated he was not ready to abandon his 
effort saying he hoped to energize the people who support me 
to play a role in the gop convention in august however he said he 
would support the party nominee in november 
meanwhile sen bob dole who withdrew from the race earlier 
this month said he was ready to help bush before the convention 
bush and dole had lunch in the capitol friday with republican 
senators and former senators including white house chief of staff 
howard baker 
in a unity meeting staged for television cameras and reporters 
dole and bush stood sidebyside behind doles desk and said they 
were ready to work together 
yes we had differences some would say shades of 
differences dole said but were ready to go to work for 
george bush 
bush in turn said nobody possibly could have been more 
gracious than bob dole 
bush also planned a private meeting later in the day at his 
residence with former president richard nixon 
the vice president opened his speech by greeting the editors 
of the nations finest newspapers and also those who publish 
doonesbury a lighthearted reference to the syndicated comic 
strip by gb trudeau that frequently has poked fun at bush 
in a speech that focused on foreign policy bush cited the 
administrations efforts to protect civilian rule in panama 
against noriega 
so far he has stood up to the considerable economic pressures 
we have applied and i can tell you one reason why bush said 
several reliable sources indicate that he is receiving millions 
of dollars in support from libya 
later at a state department briefing spokesman redman was 
asked about bushs allegations he shrugged his shoulders 
indicating that he had no information on the matter 
however last month it was reported that a panamanian defense 
force major who defected told us officials that he had been sent 
to cuba in early march to pick up a 50 million payment for noriega 
from libya but that the funds were never transferred 
bush also reiterated his contention that he did not know about 
noriegas involvement in drugs until the panamanian leaders 
indictment in the united states in march in terms of noriega 
those are the facts he said 
in response to a question bush also said that the 
administration is purusing every lead going down every rabbit 
trail running into dead ends in efforts to free hostages being 
held in lebanon including terry anderson the associated press 
middle east correspondent 
there arent any easy answers he said suggesting that poor 
intelligencegathering in the middle east is making it difficult 
even to find where these people are

contra rebel leaders returning to 
managua on friday some after years in exile can expect to find 
considerably more misery but not many tangible changes in their 
capital 
the trip by the directorate of the miamibased nicaraguan 
resistance was to further work started last month to reach a 
lasting ceasefire and end more than six years of civil war 
just a few months back such a visit seemed impossible 
but haggling and compromise on both sides coupled with a need 
to end the grueling war made the trip a necessity 
the contras 45member delegation will find that the leftist 
sandinistas still maintain a firm control on the daytoday 
workings of the government although their popularity has slipped 
the capital still is dusty and hot this time of year though 
increased poverty and population are evident 
vast open lots left barren since the 1972 earthquake have not 
been filled the walls of homes and buildings bear prosandinista 
and marxist grafitti a steep hillside bears the initials of the 
sandinista party 
a large black iron statue in a downtown plaza shows a fighter 
with one fist in the air the other arm raised and holding a 
sovietdesigned ak47 rifle redandblack sandinista flags fly 
everywhere 
thousands of people most from the rural north flooded into the 
capital and its environs to escape the ravages of war managua is 
home to about a third of the nations population of 3 million 
wooden shacks sit in dusty lots 
water has been rationed for the past few years some 
neighborhoods do without for as little as two days a week while 
others receive water only a few hours per week 
there are shortages of everything from spare parts for cars to 
the basics of rice and beans 
discontent was on the rise earlier this year because of the 
economic conditions the scarcities and the mandatory draft but 
attitudes changed last month when the ceasefire talks made it seem 
that peace could be a reality 
the mood in the capital has been one of guarded hope with most 
residents acknowledging there never has been a point so close to 
ending the war 
the contra delegation was headed by the resistances board made 
up of adolfo calero aristides sanchez alfredo cesar pedro 
joaquin chamorro and maria azucena ferrey 
all of the directorate members except for ms ferrey come from 
upper crust nicaraguan families 
calero went into exile in 1982 and was the political head of the 
largest contra group the nicaraguan democratic force based in 
honduras he holds a law degree and headed the cocacola co of 
nicaragua 
he opposed the former government of dictator anastasio somoza 
ousted by the sandinistas in 1979 but he later called the ruling 
sandinista national liberation front a group of marxists 
sanchez left nicaragua for honduras where he was responsible 
for contra logistics he is considered a stauch nationalist and a 
pragmatic and sensible negotiator 
cesar joined the sandinistas in 1978 and after the revolution 
became executive director of the international construction fund 
he also served as head of the central bank 
he left nicaragua in 1982 saying the sandinistas were marxists 
and moved to costa rica he worked with the government there and 
later joined the contras operating on the southern front 
chamorro whose family owns the opposition newspaper la prensa 
went into exile in 1984 his brother carlos fernando is editor of 
the sandinista newspaper barricada one of his sisters is the 
ambassador to costa rica 
ms ferrey was the latest to join the directorate having stayed 
in nicaragua until last year she was staunchly opposed to somoza 
and reportedly aided some of the sandinistas during their guerrilla 
campaign against him 
a member of the social christian party she comes from a 
middleclass family and became a vocal internal sandinista critic

businesses plan to increase capital spending 
by 8 percent this year the government reported friday raising 
hopes that manufacturers will expand factory capacity enough to 
ease longterm inflation pressures 
the commerce department said us companies expect to spend 
4199 billion after adjustments for inflation on expansion and 
modernization this year if realized that would be the best gain 
since a 96 percent rise in 1985 
businesses spent 3887 billion last year a 17 percent 
increase over 1986 
the new estimate for 1988 based on a survey completed in march 
represented an increase over a survey finished in november when 
businesses said they planned to spend 73 percent more 
thats good for inflation in the longer term said maury 
harris chief economist of painewebber in new york that added 
capacity helps meet demand if they werent increasing their 
capital spending id worry 
a separate report by the labor department on friday showing 
wholesale prices advancing at a 7 percent annual rate renewed 
inflation fears among investors 
adding to the concern is the fact that the operating rate at 
factories at 824 percent of capacity in february is the highest 
in eight years the federal reserve plans to release data for march 
on monday 
lawrence chimerine president of the wefa group a 
philadelphiaarea forecasting firm said if businesses follow 
through on their plans they will be able to produce more 
most of the capital spending that companies are involved in is 
for equipment a lot of it for replacing older lessefficient 
equipment that they had been using for years in the long run 
its very positive for improving productivity chimerine said 
the capital spending survey also eases fears running in the 
other direction that dampened consumer demand would lead to a 
recession this year 
economists are looking to manufacturing for export and capital 
spending to keep the economy growing the cheaper dollar is

an elderly widow has won the first round in her 
legal battle against a bank and the government to cash in 127000 
worth of halfcenturyold bonds issued by the republic of cuba 
the ruling led the womans lawyer to wonder what happened to the 
millions of dollars that should have been in a bank account to back 
the 1000facevalue bonds it also has fueled speculation in the 
bonds 
the 1937 85 million bond issue matured in 1977 
manufacturers hanover trust of new york was an indentured 
trustee for part of the bond issue meaning the cuban government 
contracted to pay a set amount to manufacturers hanover which 
would pay the bondholders the government of fidel castro stopped 
making payments in 1960 
when margarita rosa de cuellar 77 of virginia gardens in dade 
county applied to manufacturers hanover in early 1987 to redeem 
the bonds which she inherited from her mother the bank refused 
the federal office of foreign assets control told her the bank 
was correct in refusing to redeem the bonds because they were 
considered frozen under the trading with the enemy act 
mrs de cuellar filed suit in september and us district judge 
c clyde atkins ruled march 13 that she was entitled to the money 
because the united states unreasonably considered all the bonds 
even those held by us residents as frozen assets 
an american resident shouldnt be stopped from seeking payment 
from an american institution the judge decreed 
this court recognizes the importance of providing the 
president with flexibility in his negotiations with the cuban 
government however the united states may only use those assets 
that are not property of american residents he wrote in his 
order 
attorneys for the government and manufacturers hanover trust 
asked to delay payment to mrs de cuellar pending a decision on 
whether to appeal her lawyer alex arandia filed a counter motion 
asking that they pay immediately no court date has been set on the 
motions 
theres many unidentified holders of these bonds we dont 
know who they are julian kroeger an attorney for the bank told 
the judge 
estimating there are 44 million in bonds in circulation in this 
country the bank says there is only about 15 million in the fund 
to pay off bondholders 
arandia mrs de cuellars lawyer said he wants a full 
accounting of the bond fund arguing that according to the payment 
schedule the bank should have received 40 million by 1960 
although the bond issue was to mature in 1977 arandia said that 
as far as he can determine his client appears to be the first to 
ever try to redeem any of the bonds meaning the question of 
whether they could be redeemed had never been asked before 
its very strange he said friday of the entire case 
the federal office of foreign assets control was not happy with 
the judges ruling the courts decision could become a vehicle 
enabling cuba to obtain us dollars said agency spokesman r 
richard newcombe 
in the meantime speculators have been snapping up the old bonds 
and trading them on the new york stock exchange with hopes of a 
thaw in relations between cuba and the united states 
before atkins ruling the bonds traded for 200 but a week 
later they traded for 450

the artistic freedom fostered by mikhail s 
gorbachev brought the work of spanish surrealist salvador dali out 
of a zone of silence to soviets for the first time friday the 
head of the host museum said 
irina a antonova the director of the pushkin museum of fine 
arts said dalis nightmarish style in sculpture painting and 
graphics had been off limits in the soviet union 
the creative work of the surrealists including dali to some 
extent belonged to a zone of silence of such themes of art that 
were closed until recent times said antonova 
gorbachevs glasnost policy of more openness has encouraged 
intellectuals and artists to explore previously forbidden themes in 
their work and antonova said the display of dalis work represents 
a break from conservative policies of soviet museums 
very many blank spots in literature art and cinematography 
are being opened for our audiences she said and i would 
assume that the work of dali now should be placed in that context 
before gorbachev soviet media blasted dali as decadent and 
degenerate and did not publish any reproductions of his work 
the pushkin museum kicked off its display of 160 dali graphics 
and a few sculptures from the collection of frenchman pierre 
argillet with private showings for soviet and foreign journalists 
and for invited dignitaries such as government officials 
the onemonth exhibition opens to the public saturday but 
people began lining up friday during a snowstorm in hopes of 
getting into the museum a few blocks from the kremlin they were 
told tickets wont go on sale until saturday 
long lines are common at most cultural events involving foreign 
artists antonova bristled when asked if it would be difficult for 
people to get tickets 
they will get tickets just like everywhere as in paris new 
york or munich people will stand at the cashiers booth buy 
tickets and go to the exhibit she said declining to say how 
many people would be allowed to view the exhibit daily 
argillet 78 said soviet officials became interested in his 
collection of dalis sketches after musicians from the soviet 
conservatory and dancers from the kirov and bolshoi ballets saw the 
works in the frenchmans home the chateau de vaux le penil in 
melun 24 miles southeast of paris he signed a contract for the 
pushkin exhibition in october with the soviet culture ministry 
argillet a publisher of dalis works said the 84yearold 
artist is in poor health in spain and couldnt attend the moscow 
showing but would be pleased it was taking place 
some soviets said they regretted that the exhibition was limited 
to dalis etchings and drawings from the 1960s and did not include 
his betterknown and more colorful paintings

return to the majorette group said gail moore a parent 
i feel ive been treated unfairly said miss ruise the only 
black to try out for the 198889 squad she said she was touched 
when she saw that parents and students gathered at the fence to

the percentage of adults who say they are going 
out less because of economic concerns has doubled in the last five 
months but consumers are spending more on gourmet food to enjoy 
their evenings in according to a nationwide survey 
thirtytwo percent of 500 adults around the country questioned 
last week by a consulting company said they are staying home more 
since last fall because of the economy decision research corps 
first poll of 3500 people in november and december found only 16 
percent staying home more often 
many people are focusing on their own household and their 
personal finances said carol hess a research consultant at the 
lexingtonbased firm but also the level of concern about the 
overall economy has not dropped off 
on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 indicating most concern an 
average of 638 was registered in april among respondents asked 
about the state of the national economy compared with 623 last 
fall concern for the global economy ranked 573 in the recent 
survey and 579 last fall 
parents under 40 years old earning less than 40000 annually 
were most likely to stay at home only 7 percent of older 
respondents with yearly incomes over 40000 indicated they are 
staying home more she said 
having made the point that the anxiety level about the economy 
has not diminished people are also stating clearly that they have 
changed their behavior patterns hess said 
the drc survey launched several weeks after the oct 19 1987 
stock market collapse has spanned a period in which real estate 
markets softened in some areas and several economists offered 
predictions of a return to inflation or recession 
while 9 percent of respondents last year said they had changed 
plans regarding major expenditures such as homes and vacations 
because of economic worries the number rose to 17 percent in drcs 
april survey 
hess said drc undertook the study on its own and sells results 
to manufacturers and marketing firms interested in gauging consumer 
trends 
i think the people particularly interested is the leisure and 
home food industry said hess there seems to be an impact in 
fancy foods and takeout food it fits in with the couch potato 
trend but if people are going to stay at home they dont want to 
just vegetate 
they want fun things to do it seems there will be a 
significant impact in home entertainment kids games books 
a drc report issued last month indicated only 12 percent of 
1000 adults questioned said watching television was their 
principal evening activity most told drc pollsters they combine 
television viewing with other activities such as cooking cleaning 
and doing crafts said hess 
in the april survey twothirds of respondents reported that 
their spending habits have changed since last fall 
items being purchased more include gourmet food and home 
improvement gadgets on the decline are clothing standard food and 
even 2 percent said they were cutting back on necessity items 
said hess 
it seems to be that people are saying well if im going to 
be staying home im going to have fancier food or more enjoyable 
things to do she said

for 50 years people have wondered did rhett 
butler and scarlett ohara ever get back together or was it all 
over for the tempestuous lovers of gone with the wind when 
rhett walked out the door 
margaret mitchell never told and now the answer is up to 
alexandra ripley a virginia author chosen by miss mitchells 
estate to write the sequel to the civil warera epic 
ms ripley isnt saying what shell do but her novel appears 
certain to be a multimilliondollar production that the 
luxuryloving scarlett would have appreciated 
officials of the william morris agency in new york which is 
handling the book for the mitchell estate said publishers are 
reading the first two chapters this week and next and will bid on 
the book at an auction in a week to 10 days it is to be published 
in 1990 
i just cant talk price because we just dont know said 
robert gottlieb of the morris agency who represents ms ripley 
but he said the auction price was sure to be in a substantial 
multiple of millions life magazine predicted it could hit 6 
million 
ms ripley told life which has contracted to run excerpts of 
the sequel that she will take about 18 months to write the 
1000page stilluntitled book 
this one will never be mine she said its a foster 
mother kind of thing i am trying to prepare myself for a universal 
hatred of what im going to do yes margaret mitchell writes 
better than i do but shes dead 
miss mitchell who was killed by an atlanta taxi in 1949 
refused to write a sequel to her 1936 novel saying the story had 
reached its natural and proper ending 
but her estate announced last year that it had begun work on an 
authorized novel continuing the tale of scarlett and rhett 
t hal clarke an attorney for the estate said stephens 
mitchell the authors brother reluctantly agreed before his death 
in 1983 that the family must proceed with the book to prevent a 
flood of unauthorized sequels when the gone with the wind 
copyright expires in 2011 
clarke said friday that he was pleased with the selection of ms 
ripley from a dozen authors 
of course were prejudiced down here in atlanta about 
margaret mitchell he said and i think alexandra herself 
realizes she may not measure up indeed she said so but having 
said that in our day and time i think she is an extremely talented 
lady and will do the most credible sequel that we could come out 
with 
clarke said the family will give ms ripley a free hand 
although the estate set broad guidelines for the book and has a 
right to refuse her manuscript if she steps outside those 
parameters 
we didnt want any hilariously raw sex he said 
ms ripley a charleston sc native who wants to keep her 
current hometown in virginia a secret promised there wont be any 
she told life she will write more openly about sex than miss 
mitchell did but i dont do graphic descriptions of what people 
do to one another it makes me snicker 
she said she also will not imitate the thick slave dialect of 
the original because i find it hard to read and black people 
find it demeaning 
although ms ripley is keeping her plot secret she suggested 
charleston rhetts hometown would figure in the sequel 
can you imagine scarlett in old charleston she asked in an 
interview with the charleston news and courier can you see her 
and rhett going to the st cecilia ball hmmmmmm oh fiddlededee 
who is that strange person i just dont see how i can resist 
having a little touch of charleston in the book 
ms ripley 54 grew up in charleston as alexandra braid and 
attended vassar college on a scholarship from the united daughters 
of the confederacy she has written four historical novels 
charleston on leaving charleston new orleans legacy and 
the time returns

participant in the largest escape of condemned prisoners in us 
history leaves three of the six inmates who fled the mecklenburg 
correctional center in 1984 still on death row 
clanton 33 was put to death late thursday night after final 
appeals to the us supreme court for a stay and to gov gerald l 
baliles for clemency were turned down 
clanton who said he lived a troubled childhood that included 
beatings by his father and sexual abuse by his stepmother was 
sentenced to die for robbing and killing a neighbor wilhelmina 
smith in november 1980 the 38yearold victim a petersburg 
school librarian was strangled stabbed and robbed of 8 
before he died clanton expressed remorse for the murder said 
ignacio carrion a washingtonbased reporter for spanish television 
who interviewed clanton just hours before the execution 
he said he felt sorry for strangling the woman said 
carrion he was very articulate he showed no fear of dying but 
he felt apprehensive obviously 
during the trial clanton had denied killing the woman saying 
he got blood on his clothing because he had tried to help defend 
her against two intruders 
clanton and five other death row inmates staged a daring escape 
from prison on may 31 1984 all six were recaptured within a 
month with clanton being one of the first two caught as they were

two of the escapees brothers linwood and james briley were 
executed before clanton the other three willie leroy jones 
derick l peterson and lem tuggle are still on death row

crowds of death penalty supporters who yelled epithets at prayer 
vigil groups opposed to capital punishment but the scene thursday 
night was subdued 
about 75 death penalty foes held a candlelight vigil and sang 
we shall overcome larry pagnoni who spoke to the group 
suggested that virginias use of executions was racist 
when we use the death penalty virginia is in a state of 
apartheid like in south africa said pagnoni director of a 
richmond shelter for the homeless 
since 1982 seven death sentences have been carried out in the 
state all of the condemned were men five of the seven were black 
including clanton

mexico reacted angrily friday to the us 
senates decision to impose trade and economic sanctions on mexico 
for not doing enough to fight the drug trade 
however mexican officials expressed confidence that president 
reagan will veto the sanctions if they are passed by the house of 
representatives 
the foreign ministry called the us senate vote an 
intervention and said in a formal protest no power can claim 
for itself the right to certify the conduct of other societies or 
governments no one has the right to impose from abroad conduct 
ideas political or economic systems on other peoples 
on friday in washington the us state department warned that 
the senate vote to impose sanctions on mexico actually could lead 
to an increase in such traffic 
far from serving as a catalyst for action this vote 
castigates a friend for less than perfect behavior department 
spokesman charles redman said 
the mexican government places the fight against the drug trade 
under the joint command of the defense department and the federal 
attorney generals office it also cooperates with the us drug 
enforcement administration which maintains an office and agents 
here 
the senate decision did not surprise mexican officials but many 
said they were disappointed 
mexican officials have often been singled out in the united 
states by politicians and news media as corrupt and accused of 
participating in or permitting drug traffic 
the attorney generals office which says it has lost more than 
30 agents in battles with drug traffickers in the past three years 
issued a stronger statement saying the sacrifice of those who lost 
their lives does not appear to interest those who condemn an 
effort they are ignorant of or prefer to remain ignorant of 
it said thousands of mexicans risk their lives fighting the drug 
trade and added all of this is not understood by those who 
should recognize the work that our country has undertaken to 
protect the lives and health of our own population and of other 
communities particularly in the united states 
mexican officials have tried in the past to avoid direct 
confrontation and the exchange of recriminations about who does 
more in the fight against drug trafficking 
mexicans believe that us politicians and congressmen often use 
the drug traffic issue and mexico as a way to grab the spotlight 
and gain publicity 
juan enriquez spokesman for carlos salinas de gortari the man 
virtually certain to succeed president miguel de la madrid in 
december said friday we are convinced that we must use all of 
the power of the mexican state to fight against production and 
transport of drugs not only because this hurts some people in the 
united states but because of the damages it can a cause in mexico 
but fighting drugs requires the closest collaboration and 
should not be an used for political oportunism or grandstanding 
he said 
salinas de gortari has said during his campaign that he 
considers the fight against drugs a national priority 
but he also said recently no country has the political moral 
or judicial authority to grant certificates of good or bad conduct 
to other countries 
two months ago reagan told de la madrid at their meeting in the 
pacific resort of mazatlan that he had strived for an atmosphere 
of cordiality and mutual respect between the two countries 
reagan also praised mexicos efforts in the war against drug 
traffic and he listened to de la madrids reminder of the 
pervasive mexican view that drug consumption in the united states 
is as much a part of the problem as production supply and 
trafficking in illicit narcotics 
this final link consumption in the united states continues 
to have a determining influence in the criminal chain de la 
madrid told reagan at their meeting

most textbooks are lifeless and boring because 
state regulations force publishers to cram elementary and secondary 
books with testoriented trivia pedagogical faddism and 
inconsistent social messages an education group charged friday 
the council for basic education said states should stop issuing 
lengthy list of what textbooks must cover and publishers should 
have textbooks written by gifted writers instead of committee 
in a study called a conspiracy of good intentions americas 
textbook fiasco the nonprofit council said the textbook 
selection system is perfectly designed to produce textbooks that 
confuse mislead and profoundly bore students 
authors and editors do not willingly chop and flatten 
sentences nor do they thoughtlessly mangle storylines it said 
the source of the writing problem is not in the publishing house 
but in the public agency legislators educational policymakers and 
administrative regulators have unintentionally drained the life out 
of childrens textbooks 
it cited one book that rendered the fable of the hare and the 
tortoise this way 
rabbit said i can run i can run fast you cant run fast 
turtle said look rabbit see the park you and i will run 
well run to the park 
rabbit said i want to stop ill stop here i can run but 
turtle cant 
i can get to the park fast turtle said i cant run fast 
but i will not stop rabbit cant see me ill get to the park 
in another instance noted in a recent article in atlantic 
monthly magazine a passage from hans christian andersons the 
emperors new clothes was reduced from the original 
magnificent excellent prodigious went from mouth to 
mouth and everyone was exceedingly pleased 
to this 
how marvelous they echoed the emperor how beautiful 
the council said the entire market is hostage to the textbook 
adoption method that 22 states use to decide which books their 
public schools can buy most southern and western states including 
texas and california have such adoption policies 
states churn out undisciplined lists of particulars that 
publishers must include in the textbooks since publishers must 
sell in as many jurisdictions as possible in order to turn a 
profit their books must incorporate this melange of testoriented 
trivia pedagogical faddism and inconsistent social messages the 
study said 
the harder they try to regulate the content of textbooks the 
less useful textbooks become for their own students and students 
elsewhere in the united states said the study 
the author harriet tysonbernstein said readability 
formulas used to judge whether a text is too far over childrens 
heads are partly to blame for the poor prose 
another pervasive textbook sin is mentioning textbook 
prose that fits from fact to fact statement to statement and 
topic to topic without giving the reader the context that would 
make sense of the factual information the study said 
the study recommended adoption states stop issuing detailed 
skilloriented bid specifications to publishers abandon the 
readability formulas and stop demanding a recent publication date 
which forces publishers into hasty revisions 
it recommended publishers hire authors who have demonstrated 
their ability to write clear and engaging text for mass 
audiences and that they pay scholars not public school teachers 
or education professors to get the textbooks 
tysonbernstein at a briefing for reporters here on wednesday 
said textbooks are too condensed and too compressed they are 
useful to teachers now but not very useful to students teachers 
rely heavily on the textbooks in preparing instruction she said 
she discussed her findings friday in new orleans at a meeting of 
the education writers association 
the average public school district spent 4000 per child in 
1980 but only 3417 on instructional materials according to the 
american association of publishers 
the council is a threedecadeold group that advocates a liberal 
arts curriculum for all students in elementary and secondary 
schools

eighty young people boarded buses friday to 
escape at least for the 10 days of their mountain retreat the 
turfs of the gangs that bring violence and drugs to their urban 
neighborhoods 
the thing i want to get out of this is to better my life 
15yearold michael williams said as he waited to board one of the 
three buses going to the pocono mountains in northeastern 
pennsylvania 
nearly all the 15 to 20yearolds taking part in the youth at 
risk program have been suspended from school at some point and 
about 30 are serious gang members said clinton terrell director 
of community outreach and enrollment for the program 
on thursday the pennsylvania crime commission issued a report 
that said gang violence will soon make organized crime family 
activities seem tame 
the retreat at a camp near bushwick will included hikes along 
with individual and group counseling 
some of the young people said they hoped to learn to control 
their tempers or do better in school 
i want to keep from getting locked up said 16yearold 
ronald bouie 
david fisher has run the youth at risk for breakthrough 
foundation in san francisco for eight years and said its programs 
have been succesful in new york chicago los angeles detroit and 
other cities this is the first time the program has been offered 
in philadelphia 
were going to demand everything youve got and when you 
think youre out of gas were going to demand more fisher 
warned friday morning 
he asked the youths to refrain from venting their anger with 
violence 
you are in a room full of people with short fuses he said 
this is going to be 10 days of peace its called growing 
up 
fisher said the youths were required to turn in any drugs 
weapons radios and snack food before they can participate 
what im telling you is put down your arms put down your 
anger put down your hatred he said 
the youths appeared upset by only two of the rules no snacking 
between meals and no music except when the staff provides radios 
bennie swans jr executive director of crisis intervention 
network said the programs goal was to relieve tension and despair 
among philadelphias youths caused by high unemployment and an 
increased high school dropout rate 
swans said the same type of hopelessness caused gang violence 
resulting in a death a week during gang wars in the late 1960s and 
early 1970s 
all the problems we had to deal with 20 years ago we still 
have to deal with said swans himself a veteran of the citys 
gang wars 
hazel floyd said her 18yearold son curtis came to her with 
the idea of participating in the retreat he just felt like he 
wants to get away and sit down and think about what he wants to do 
in the future she said 
terrell said about 300000 was raised for the program which 
will have 100 volunteers at the site in the poconos and hold 
monthly meetings for a year after the retreat 
ben johnson 19 of oakland calif took the course in 1986 
when he was a junior in high school and selling cocaine 
some guys wanted to get me my money wasnt coming straight 
my parents wanted to throw me out of the house i was flunking out 
my life wasnt working johnson told the group 
after the course johnson said he took a job and finished high

wheat has been sold to the soviet union at subsidized prices the 
agriculture department said friday 
the sale equal to about 119 million bushels was handled by 
mitsubishi international corp 25000 tons cargill inc 100000 
artfer inc 50000 garnac grain co inc 50000 and continental 
grain co 100000 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said the grain was sold under terms 
of the longterm grain agreement between the united states and the 
soviet union 
sims said the subsidies averaged 2470 per ton or about 67 
cents per bushel of wheat 
no selling prices were announced but wheat has been averaging 
about 284 per bushel recently according to the usda that could 
mean a farm value of about 50 million 
the ussoviet pact which expires sept 30 calls on moscow to 
buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually and specifies that 
the purchases include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and 
corn the soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million 
tons as wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting 
as two tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
if more than 12 million tons are wanted in a year the soviets 
are required to seek us approval the soviets were given approval 
to exceed the 12 million tons in the final year 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat or soybeans 
so far the soviets have bought more than 88 million tons of 
subsidized wheat for delivery in the fifth year as well as 41 
million tons of nonsubsidized corn 818400 tons of us soybeans 
and 13 million tons of soybean meal 
subsidies are provided under the departments export enhancement 
program or eep private exporters are given surplus commodities 
owned by the departments commodity credit corp so they can sell a 
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive 
world prices 
the subsidies or bonuses have run between less than 20 to 
more than 40 per ton roughly 54 cents to 109 per bushel 
sims said the soviets have more than 185000 tons remaining in 
their current eep authorization an additional 1 million tons were 
announced on april 4 plus some left over from earlier

a czechoslovak human rights group has 
called on its government to release all political prisoners and 
allow free travel abroad before a governmentproposed zone of 
trust is created in central europe 
if trust is not to remain a mere propagandistic slogan 
certain basic preconditions must be fulfilled for it to emerge 
said the appeal from the charter 77 group a text was released 
friday through the londonbased palach press newsletter 
the document was signed by three charter 77 spokesmen and issued 
in prague on april 11 it welcomed a czechoslovak government 
proposal to set up a zone of trust and good neighborly relations 
along the dividing lines of the warsaw pact and nato countries in 
central europe 
czechoslovak communist party leader milos jakes made the 
proposal in february but no details have been made public 
prague officials said the buffer zone to include such countries 
as west and east germany czechoslovakia and austria would cover 
cultural military ecological and human relations issues 
the charter 77 appeal calls on the czechoslovak government to 
prove its trustworthiness and credibility by respecting the 
fundamental rights and liberties of its citizens while submitting 
itself to open and public scrutiny 
a copy was sent to jakes and to the helsinki followup 
conference on security and cooperation in europe in vienna 
as reported by palach press signatories milos hajek stanislav 
devaty and bohumir janat specifically demanded the immediate 
release of jiri wolf who is serving a sixyear sentence for 
publishing information on conditions in czechoslovak prisons he 
was jailed in 1983 
they also demanded that priest stefan javorsky sentenced to 
eight months in jail last year for celebrating mass without 
official permission be set free 
the appeal also demanded freedom to travel abroad in particular 
to the couuntries included in the proposed trust zone an end to 
discrimination against nonconformist citizens and a halt to 
persecuting human rights groups 
if the government does not take decisive steps in the spirit 
of the abovementioned points its peace proposal will remain a 
mere empty gesture the signatories of the appeal said according 
to palach press

cosmetic surgery is as common as palm trees in 
movieland but one blemished star on the walk of fame took 28 years 
to fix 
mauritz stiller the late swedish director whose main claim to 
fame was bringing greta garbo to hollywood suffered the indignity 
of having not just one name misspelled on the famed starwalk but 
both 
city officials corrected the error thursday replacing a star 
plaque reading maurice diller with one honoring mauritz stiller 
in 1960 when the first 1550 bronze plaques were implanted in 
the sidewalks of hollywoods shopping and theater district to 
create the hallowed walk of fame someone taking the name over the 
telephone misheard the caller said bill welsh president of the 
hollywood chamber of commerce 
well we got 1549 stars out of 1550 correct welsh said 
i just hope our swedish friends will forgive us for taking so 
long to correct the error 
the local swedish consulate had asked hollywood to correct the 
misspelling because king carl xvi gustav and queen silvia who are 
touring the united states will be visiting california soon said 
spokesman claes jernaeus 
stiller was lured to hollywood in 1925 by mgms louis b mayer 
and came only on condition that he could bring miss garbo she went 
on to become a star but stiller contracted pleurisy and returned 
to sweden where he died in 1928 
he directed such films as sir arnes treasure and the 
atonement of gosta berling which starred miss garbo 
attending the ceremonies were swedish notables lasse hallstrom 
the oscarnominated director of my life as a dog and actress 
signe hasso miss garbo had been invited to attend but shes 
very private as you know and shes over 80 now said ake 
sandler a local swedishborn professor

tree and left it there but nature is responsible for a hybrid 1928 
ford coupe and a chinese elm tree in ermal and james wilsons field 
mrs wilson of inavale bought the used ford in 1944 for 125 
she was working as a waitress for 4 a week she married wilson in 
1945 and three years later he gave her a 1948 studebaker thats 
when the ford got the shaft 
we built a new garage for the studebaker to go in and i drove 
it the ford out there in the field she said it wasnt 
long before a tree grew up in the middle of it the transmission is 
in the tree 
the roof was still on it but of course the tree pushed it 
off mrs wilson said natures hold was final when another tree 
grew behind the cars rear axle 
it was in perfect shape when i parked it there she said 
if i had any brains as they say now i should have parked it in 
the garage and parked the new studebaker outside

american rice farmers may benefit in the early 
months of the 198889 season from a shortage of exportable crops in 
competing nations an agriculture department report said friday 
world rice production from the 198788 harvests is forecast at 
304 million metric tons milled equivalent down 4 percent from 
last year the departments economic research service said weak 
monsoons left asian producers with limited supplies 
meanwhile global rice consumption is expected to increase 3 
percent leaving world stockpiles at their lowest level relative to 
use since 1974 
the us rice supply also has tightened reflecting a 6 percent 
reduction in last years harvest 
but the departments planting survey in early march indicated 
american producers intend to boost 1988 rice plantings by 19 
percent to 28 million acres that could boost this years output 
sharply 
us farmers will harvest rice crops at least four months 
ahead of their asian competitors the report said since the 
united states will be the major source of supply during those 
months some increased export opportunities may exist towards the 
end of 1988 
however analysts cautioned that some foreign importers if 
possible may choose to wait until the beginning of 1989 when 
prices are likely to decline during the asian harvest

michael dukakis has expanded his delegate lead 
to 112 over jesse jackson with the help of support from members of 
congress elected as delegates to the democratic national convention 
most of the 237 senators and representatives picked so far to 
have votes at the convention have not announced their choices 
however dukakis was the early leader friday in the battle for 
support from congressional super delegates 
in congress so far 
twentysix of the house democrats nominated to be delegates are 
backing the massachusetts governor while 15 are supporting 
jackson according to a survey by the associated press sen albert 
gore jr of tennessee has 12 in his corner and illinois sen paul 
simon who has suspended active campaigning has 10 
nine of the 32 senators picked so far as delegates have 
endorsed dukakis gore has 5 senatordelegates and simon 2 
including themselves jackson has none 
dukakis whose campaign strategy is pegged on putting at least 
250 delegates between himself and secondplace jackson in the next 
few weeks already has gained 100 toward that goal during the past 
week 
on wednesday he won the endorsement of puerto ricos governor 
who delivered himself and 51 other previously uncommitted delegates 
as a bloc 
for sheer size the congressional caucuses rank behind only 
california and new york in terms of the number of delegates being 
sent to the convention the two houses next week complete the 
selection of 251 senators and representatives as delegates 
in both houses the delegate nominations are supervised by the 
democratic leadership and next weeks party caucuses are expected 
to be little more than ceremonial but the delegates choices are 
still generally unknown 
overall dukakis has 84215 delegates some 100 of whom are 
super delegates the party leaders and politicians including 
members of congress who are being sent as delegates to the 
convention because of offices they hold or held in all 644 of 
these delegates who are free to make or dissolve their commitments 
to presidential candidates as they see fit are to attend the 
convention 
dukakis gore and simon are super delegates as is missouri rep 
richard gephardt who dropped out of the presidental race last 
month 
the remaining 85 percent of the delegates to the convention 
3518 are getting there through the primaries or caucuses in 
which they are required to pledge themselves to support a 
presidential candidate or declare that they are uncommitted 
although dukakis delegate lead is becoming formidable his 
total represents just 40 percent of the 2082 delegates needed to 
win the partys presidential nomination 
jackson whose landslide victory in michigan on march 26 
momentarily pushed him into the lead in delegates now has 7301 
delegates in the ap count that includes 45 super delegates 
gore has 41155 delegates including 41 super delegates and 
simon has 1835 delegates overall including 285 super delegates 
more than 600 delegates are uncommitted including about 400 
from the ranks of the partys political professionals

lawyers on friday filed an 
application seeking to reopen the trial of six blacks who were 
sentenced to hang in a case that drew worldwide protests 
the court action came a day after six other blacks were hung at 
pretoria central prison raising to 50 the number of executions in 
south africa this year 
the application on behalf of the socalled sharpeville six was 
filed in pretoria supreme court it is not known how soon a 
decision on the request will be made 
the five men and one women were convicted of complicity in the 
mob killing of a black town councilor during antiapartheid riots 
that broke out in sharpeville south of johannesburg in september 
1984 the violence touched off two years of nationwide unrest 
the six were scheduled to die on march 18 but a stay of 
execution was granted to allow time for defense lawyers to request 
the case be reopened 
the stay was decreed because of evidence that a state witness 
committed perjury during the original trial 
president pw botha had previously rejected international 
appeals to grant clemency to the six saying he did not want to 
interfere in the judicial process 
the six were not accused of contributing physically to the death 
of sharpeville councilor kuzwayo dhlamini they were convicted 
under the doctrine of common purpose which held them 
responsible because they were part of the mob that killed the man 
the government has argued that the sharpville six are being 
falsely portrayed abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law 
authorities say evidence in the trial showed that each played an 
active part in the killing through such alleged actions as making 
firebombs to burn dhlaminis house or slapping a woman who pleaded 
for the councilors life 
the six men hung thursday included two blacks in their 20s 
described by authorities as comrades a term commonly used to 
describe antiapartheid militants they were convicted of killing 
two other black men by setting fire to oilsoaked tires placed 
around the victims necks 
one of the executed men was convicted of killing a mixedrace 
man while the other three were hung for murdering elderly whites 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

cbs says it came in second in the television 
ratings for the season according to the ratings company agb 
although nielsen results used by all three networks have cbs 
finishing third for the first time ever 
no matter whose figures are used the end of season ratings 
released by cbs friday show that viewers are no longer enchanted by 
its new shows and are turning instead to vcrs cable and 
independent stations and perhaps even books conversation or 
exercise 
cbs apparently suffered most except for beauty and the 
beast it could count no new shows as successes even though 
franks place wiseguy and tour of duty received 
critical praise 
we are not as some people would expect going to fall on our 
swords in defeat said david poltrack cbs vice president for 
marketing who briefed reporters on the endofseason results we 
are not defeatists 
the networks primetime season doesnt officially end until 
sunday but the last weeks results arent expected to change the 
picture 
abc entertainment president brandon stoddard is to have a 
session with reporters monday and nbc which will win its third 
season in a row is holding an endofseason briefing tuesday 
cbs held its briefing early perhaps because it is already 
conceding it will come in third for the first time in the networks 
history according to the ac nielsen co the ratings service of 
record since the 1950s 
last year cbs signed up with nielsen competitor agb media 
research a british company although agb numbers are not bought by 
the other networks nor are they used in the real business of 
television ratings negotiating advertising rates cbs uses agb 
to back its contention that nielsens new peoplemeter audience 
measurement system is inaccurate 
poltrack estimates that the networks will lose a combined 50 
million in advertising revenues because of the lower numbers 
produced by people meters 
nbc and abc agree that nielsens new system is not accurate 
enough but they havent been hurt as much as cbs in fact abc has 
prospered 
poltrack wouldnt say how much of the 50 million loss was cbs 
according to nielsen the network averages after 29 weeks of the 
30week season were nbc 161 abc 137 and cbs 135 the rating is 
a percentage of an estimated 886 million us homes equipped with 
television 
cbs said agb figures gave nbc 162 cbs 139 and abc 132 
poltrack conceded that cbs has little hope of getting advertisers 
and the other networks to switch to agb in lieu of nielsen 
despite the ratings system squabble a general erosion in 
network audiences is uncontested poltrack said although the 
extent of it is unknown 
according to nielsen the threenetwork average rating dropped 9 
percent from 198687 to 198788 the previous year there was a 3 
percent drop 
poltrack estimates that roughly half of the percentage drop is 
real and half is a function of the people meter a more complex 
measurement device that requires particiants to actively punch in 
and punch out when they watch television the old system was a 
handsoff attachment on the set 
historically networks have lost audiences to increasing cable 
availability but this season the numbers show all cable channels 
combined gaining only 12 percent in the ratings 
the biggest drop in network audiences was in the realm of 
theatrical movies indicating increased use of cable or 
videocassettes however audiences are also rejecting new network 
programming 
the highestrated new show of the season was nbcs a different 
world which with an average rating of 251 is the only new 
show to qualify as a bona fide hit but it has never been tested 
away from its timeslot that follows the no 1rated the cosby 
show of which it is a spinoff 
otherwise new shows performed miserably of the 47 this season 
only eight exceeded the a 144 rating the average for all network 
primetime programming

stepping over splintered glass and twisted 
metal libyan officials led foreign visitors through col moammar 
gadhafis former home friday to mark the second anniversary of the 
us bombing of tripoli 
the tour began at 2 am the time that f111 fighter bombers 
attacked the libyan capital and the coastal city of benghazi on 
april 15 1986 
president reagan said he ordered the raid in retaliation for 
alleged libyan involvement in the bombing of a west german 
nightclub which left two us soldiers and a turkish woman dead 
two bomb explosions in the last two days one near madrid and 
one in naples italy which killed a us navy woman may have 
been linked to the anniversary 
libyan officials promised gadhafi would appear early friday at 
the house which was hit in the us raid but after an hour the 
visitors were escorted back from the fortified barracks compound on

i am carrying the banner of peace in the mediterranean and 
would like peace for my country as much as for the other countries

tennessee sen albert gore jr has taken 
out 100000 in new loans from banks in his home state plunging 
his campaign for the democratic presidential nomination 16 
million into debt 
gore was able to obtain the loans even though his prospects for 
winning his partys nomination appear to be dimming 
polls indicate that his support in next tuesdays new york 
primary and the contest a week later in pennsylvania is mired in 
the single digits he has not won an event since finishing first in 
six of the 21 super tuesday contests on march 8 
gore has spent at least 700000 on new york television 
advertising of his two rivals jesse jackson has purchased 
550000 worth of ads and massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
reportedly will spend as much as 15 million 
campaign officials said the most recent loans for 50000 each 
were from the volunteer state bank of portland tenn on april 11 
and the bank of putnam county in cookeville tenn the following 
day 
campaign manager fred martin said the campaign has no plans to 
take out any more loans before the new york primary but he would 
not rule out additional loans after that 
the campaign had acknowledged a 50000 loan from union planters 
bank in memphis tenn on april 5 
one problem gore might face in repaying the loans is that the 
federal matching funds he has been receiving may soon be dwindling 
federal assistance to campaigns is diminished if a candidate 
fails to receive 10 percent of the vote in two successive primaries 
which gore has already done and then fails to achieve 20 
percent support thereafter

the seat being vacated by republican sen paul trible

standing up for our freedom thats why we need to show col north

a federal advisory panel issued updated 
guidelines on treating high blood pressure friday citing the 
potential value of new classes of drugs but emphasizing the need to 
prescribe the lowest effective dose of any medication 
intended primarily for physicians the recommendations were 
described by the chairman of the national institutes of health 
panel as a sort of bible or gospel of treatment 
abram v chobanian incoming dean of the boston university 
school of medicine added that the suggestions were based on an 
eightmonth review of latest research to update the guidelines last 
issued four years ago 
he noted that two new classes of drugs socalled calcium 
antagonists and enzyme inhibitors have been approved for treating 
high blood pressure since the last report 
for many patients they may cause fewer symptomatic and 
biochemical side effects than diuretics and beta blockers he 
said referring to the only high blood pressure drugs on the market 
in 1984 
but chobanian emphasized that the updated guidelines call for 
lower initial doses for most drugs than we did in 1984 
the point here is that smaller doses mean fewer side 
effects he said at a news conference this a critical 
advantage because the side effects of traditional antihypertensive 
drugs have been a major stumbling block to keeping patients on 
their treatment 
among other things the widely used diuretics can cause 
impotence and excessive loss of potassium in some patients 
we recommend that some patients especially those with mild 
hypertension start with nondrug treatments said chobanian by 
that i mean reducing weight limiting sodium and alcohol stopping 
smoking exercising and perhaps using biofeedback and relaxation 
techniques 
the report urges physicians to carefully monitor those patients 
who do need drug treatment with an eye to reducing the dosage or 
perhaps eliminating such medication 
the updated guidelines also say people with high blood pressure 
should drink no more than the equivalent of two beers a day down 
from three in the 1984 report and emphasizes that lowering blood 
pressure alone is not a major reducer of heart attacks if the 
patient does not also control other risk factors especially 
smoking and high blood cholesterol levels

the senate on friday passed legislation 
designed to foster use of alternative motor fuels in order to 
reduce us dependency on foreign petroleum and tap vast us 
supplies of coal natural gas and grain 
the bill passed on a voice vote over warnings by republicans on 
the environment committee that it could lead to increased emissions 
of the greenhouse gases that some scientists say are 
overheating the earths atmosphere 
the senate action all but ensures that congress will enact 
alternative fuels legislation in 1988 a similar proposal was 
passed overwhelmingly by the house earlier this year the bills 
differences will have to be resolved by negotiators from both 
chambers 
both proposals are geared toward encouraging the automobile 
industry to massproduce vehicles that can operate on fuels such as 
methanol ethanol and compressed natural gas 
methanol which powers indianapolis 500type race cars at 200 
miles an hour can be manufactured from coal or natural gas 
ethanol is made from grains like corn the legislation has broad 
support from coal and agricultural state lawmakers 
the proposals would break an impasse that now prevents any 
widespread switchover from gasoline to alternative fuels according 
to sen john danforth rmo a principal sponsor along with sen 
jay rockefeller dwva 
automakers are unwilling to produce alternative fuel cars 
for which there is no current demand danforth said consumers 
are unwilling to purchase cars for which there is no readily 
available fuel supply and service stations are unwilling to 
provide fuel for cars that are not on the road 
rockefeller said that besides lessening the growing us need 
for imported oil a conversion of just 10 percent of the us 
vehicle fleet to coalbased methanol would mean jobs for 20000 
miners in the depressed coal industry 
the sponsors said automakers would be encouraged to massproduce 
vehicles using alternative fuels because the legislation would make 
it easier to meet the federal requirement that their fleets have an 
average fuel economy of at least 26 miles per gallon 
under the bills formula a 25 mpg vehicle that uses a blend of 
85 percent methanol and 15 percent gasoline would get a fuel 
economy rating of 165 mpg according to danforth a 25 mpg vehicle 
using a 5050 blend would be rated at 40 mpg he said 
the higher credits for alternative fuels would begin with the 
vehicle 1993 model year 
danforth and rockefellers argument that methanol and ethanol 
would cause fewer environmental and health problems than gasoline 
was disputed by environment committee members robert stafford 
rvt and john chafee rri 
stafford said coalderived methanol would double emissions of 
carbon dioxide a major contributor to the greenhouse effect and 
bring a tenfold increase in tailpipe emissions of formaldehyde a 
cancercausing chemical 
he urged the senate to proceed cautiously because many 
scientists warn that the production of greenhouse gases is 
overloading the atmosphere trapping heat around the earth and 
threatening major climate changes 
once we commit to a program like this it will be too late 
said stafford who unsuccessfully tried to add amendments to 
require alternative vehicles to meet the same emissions standards 
as gasoline vehicles 
chafee succeeded in adding language putting the senate on record 
as saying that coalbased methanol would boost carbon dioxide 
levels contribute to global overheating and should not be used 
until emissions controls are developed to control carbon dioxide

piedmont airlines maintenance crews 
friday began making temporary repairs to a crippled jetliner 
replacing an engine that exploded in midair and patching holes that 
ripped through both sides of the cabin 
the fokker f28 4000 a dutchmade jet carrying 56 passengers 
and a crew of four was forced to land at charleston on thursday 
after it lost cabin pressure and plunged partway toward the ground 
as passengers screamed and fainted 
after the workers replace the engine and cover the holes the 
plane is to be flown saturday to a piedmont maintenance facility at 
greensboro nc for further study and repair said jeff bubar 
manager of yeager airport 
the engine mounted on the right side of the fuselage exploded 
thursday morning as the plane was at 31000 feet en route from 
charlotte nc to columbus ohio it was a halfhour out of 
columbus and about 40 miles south of charleston when the 
explosion occurred 
a turbine blade and other engine parts cut through the planes 
right rear bathroom and a flight attendant work area no one was 
hit by the debris but two flight attendants suffered bumps and 
bruises as the plane plunged 
the explosion was the first significant trouble reported with 
the engines of a fokker f28 national transportation safety board 
statistics show rollsroyce manufactured the engine that exploded 
thursday 
piedmont flies 25 fokker f28 4000s which carry 72 people and 
20 fokker f28 1000s which carry 62 theyve used the fokker 
planes for about four years but the model has been in use 
elsewhere for about 20 years 
the ntsb said it was too early to tell whether safety checks 
will be required for the f28s in piedmonts fleet 
the damage that took place is very apparent said dennis 
jones who handled the ntsbs initial investigation of the 
incident what we have is engine failure and the side of the 
airplane was breached 
there was only limited work we could to there in 
charleston he said from his washington dc office our 
work doesnt really begin until we can get the engine and the plane 
elsewhere 
jones said that despite the relatively safe history of the 
fokker model the investigation would be needed to check whether 
the problem could be found in other fokker planes 
right now were going to look at that particular aircraft and 
that model of aircraft jones said during the course of the 
investigation that will all be looked at but we cant make that 
determination now 
we want to look at the problem it poses for the future the 
ntsb in general is set up to investigate accidents and prevent 
similar occurrences 
the ntsbs office of safety programs has only two injury 
accidents involving fokker f28s in the us since the early 1980s 
one when there was a minor collision on an airport taxiway and the 
other when a person fell off the boarding stairs when a guardrail 
gave way said spokesman ted lopatkiewicz 
piedmont spokesman don mcguire contended that with such a 
record grounding the airlines other fokkers would not be 
necessary 
well take a judicious approach to what the next step will 
be mcguire said 
the airline based in winstonsalem nc owns 25 fokker f28 
4000 planes and 20 of the f28 1000 series

the producer of the new smothers brothers 
comedy hour said friday that approval of an independent contract 
with striking scriptwriters came in the nick of time for the show 
and its stars 
we made the point that it would be financially and 
careerwise disastrous for tom and dick if the show ended 
producer ken kragen said in a telephone interview 
the writers guild of america whose members are concluding the 
fifth week of their strike against producers and studios voted 
thursday to reject independent contracts that would have allowed 
work to resume at selected companies with two exceptions the 
smothers show and ivan reitman productions which has produced 
such movies as ghostbusters and animal house 
guild leaders had recommended against allowing the separate 
contracts because it could lead to divisiveness and destruction 
of morale among members said cheryl rhoden a wga spokeswoman 
she added however that the exceptions were granted because of 
unspecified legal considerations and because negotiations with the 
two producers were more advanced 
while the contract agreement with the 9000member union forbids 
discussion of terms kragen said he believed the smothers support 
of the strike on their show as well as their reputation among 
writers won the day 
there are a lot of writers who got their start in the business 
with the smothers and went on to win emmys and now some of them 
are on the writers guild board of directors said kragen 
he also said the three unionwritten scripts for the show which 
ran out with wednesday nights 8 pm broadcast on cbstv were 
kept untainted by nonunion revisions 
they laid out guidelines for us we strained mightily but we 
stayed within those guidelines and i think that impressed them 
kragen said 
also friday abctv made official what moonlighting producer 
glenn caron announced four weeks ago the muchpublicized 3d 
version of the popular program for the may ratings sweeps period 
has been scrubbed 
after exhausting all of our options we have concluded that to 
go forward without an original script would not be in the best 
interests of moonlighting our viewers or cocacola a promoter 
of the episode ted harbert abcs vice president for primetime 
entertainment said in new york 
meanwhile federal mediator leonard farrell scheduled a meeting 
monday morning between the wga and representatives from the 
alliance of motion picture and television producers 
writers on both coasts went on strike march 7 the walkout 
shortened the season for some primetime tv shows and stalled the 
start of a few new series there have been no formal negotiations 
since mediated talks broke off march 10 
producers spokesman herb steinberg said he had little hope for 
the monday session adding that alliance negotiators will attend 
because the law requires them to he declined comment on the 
contract waiver deals 
disputed issues include how much writers are paid for foreign 
broadcasts of their material and for reruns on domestic television 
how much creative input they have over their work is also an issue

the soviet withdrawal agreement 
brought no accord to afghanistan on friday president najib asked 
the guerrillas to join a coalition government and they demanded he 
be tried by a moslem religious court 
in moscow the official news agency tass accused the united 
states of trying to ruin the agreement by continuing to supply arms 
to the moslem insurgents washington is confirming its policy of 
neoglobalism a course of export of counterrevolution it said 
the guerrillas were not invited to the geneva negotiations and 
have said they will continue fighting 
najib who uses only one name also sent a message to president 
reagan thanking him for his efforts leading to the agreement signed 
thursday under which the red army will begin may 15 to withdraw 
the 115000 soldiers in afghanistan 
in a statement broadcast by by kabul radio najib invited the 
guerrillas to accept his policy of national reconcilittion we 
are prepared to cooperate with those who are still fighting this 
honorable policy he said 
we stress our willingness to meet the leaders of the 
opposition in order to reach a decision on peace for the happiness 
of afflicted people for the future of the countrys children 
we are waiting for the naming of your candidates for the national 
assembly and the senate 
elections for the parliament ended thursday the guerrillas who 
have been fighting since a communist coup in april 1978 were 
offered seats but dismissed the election as a farce 
najib said 15 million people voted showing their confidence 
needs and views about 5 million afghans onethird of the 
population have left the country since soviet soldiers arrived in 
december 1979 
another step has been taken toward ending war and 
brotherkilling deepening political dialogue the expansion of 
democracy the establishment of a coalition government with the 
participation of all forces which represent the afghan society 
najib declared 
gulbaddin hekmatyar chairman of the sevenparty guerrilla 
alliance based in peshawar a border city in pakistan said najib 
and all members of the ruling communist party must be tried in 
absentia by religious courts 
he said soviet soldiers held by the guerrillas would be 
exchanged for afghan army soldiers and all those pows will be 
kept until the najib regime is toppled and is replaced by an 
islamic government so all those criminals who flee with the red 
army could be brought back for trial in exchange for the 
prisoners 
in my view all members of the central committee including 
najib the puppet must be tried in absentia so that after the 
withdrawal of the russian forces such criminals be dealt with in 
accordance with islamic laws and those who have been misled and 
played off against their nation by these criminals be pardoned 
hekmatyar said 
the insurgents have said they will not share power with 
communists in a future government but had not called for trials 
they have predicted that najib would follow the soviet soldiers to 
moscow 
guerrilla leaders have not said how many soviet prisoners they 
have but last month hekmatyars hezbiislami party said an 
agreement had been reached to exchange a soviet soldier for 25 
guerrilla prisoners the exchange has not occurred

larry speakes the former mississippi weekly 
newspaper editor who rose to be a presidential spokesman and wall 
street executive often boasted that he never lied to the press 
during his years at the white house 
but in his new book speakes admitted that he fabricated quotes 
and attributed them to president reagan he resigned friday as vice 
president for communications of merrill lynch and co saying it 
was the best course of action in the wake of that admission 
at the white house speakes successor marlin fitzwater would 
say only im sorry for him personally earlier he had called 
speakes practice an outrage said it reflected on the integrity of 
the white house press office he promised that he would never do 
anything similar 
speakes 48 became the chief white house spokesman after 
reagans press secretary james brady was wounded during an 
assassination attempt on the president on march 30 1981 brady has 
continued to hold the title of press secretary although he has been 
unable to return to his duties 
fitzwater who served two years as a deputy to speakes and then 
became press secretary to vice president george bush has been the 
chief white house spokesman since speakes left the post 14 months 
ago 
speakes grew up in merigold miss which he describes in his 
book speaking out as middle america the heartland norman 
rockwells america 
the words are similar to those reagan has often used in speaking 
of his own home town dixon ill 
in fact speakes said that when he told reagan of his decision 
to leave the white house and accept the offer from merrill lynch 
he told him as a kid growing up in a town in mississippi of 700 
i never expected to meet a president much less work with one 
he said reagan replied well what do you think of a kid 
growing up in a small town in illinois 
speakes attended the university of mississipi for four years 
but did not receive a degree because he had not completed his 
second year of french while in summer school trying to complete 
the work he accepted an offer to be editor of the oxford miss 
eagle a weekly with a circulation of about 4000 
for a young married man whose wife was expecting their first 
child the salary of 85 a week was too good in 1961 to turn down 
later he held editorial posts at other mississippi weeklies and 
became coowner of four such newspapers 
in 1968 he came to washington as press secretary to 
mississippis democratic sen james o eastland he was an honorary 
pallbearer at eastlands funeral in 1986 and said in his book 
not a day goes by even now that i dont remember him and tell 
another eastland story 
speakes first entered the white house in 1974 as an assistant to 
president nixons press secretary ron ziegler nixon resigned a 
few months later and speakes stayed on to serve as an assistant in 
president fords press office 
in the 1976 election he was press secretary to fords running 
mate sen bob dole of kansas after ford lost to jimmy carter 
speakes went to work for the public relations firm of hill amp 
knowlton in washington 
saying that he found the public relations business neither as 
interesting nor as much fun as i had expected it to be he went 
to work for the reagan campaign in 1980 and then returned to the 
white house as a deputy press secretary 
after he took over the chief spokesmans job his relations with 
the white house press corps were often contentious with speakes 
accusing reporters of being out to get the president and the 
reporters accusing speakes of not being candid 
speakes often said his credibility was his most precious 
possession and he would not risk losing it by lying to the press 
in his book however he says that at reagans 1985 summit 
meeting with mikhail gorbachev in geneva he had an aide draft 
some quotes for the president polished them and then told 
reporters that they were what the president said to the soviet 
leader 
in restrospect it was clearly wrong to take such liberties 
he said in his book but he added i had been able to spruce up 
the presidents image by taking a bit of liberty with my pr mans 
license

this fort lauderdale suburb is 2for2 when 
it comes to electing mayors 
the first elected mayor was indicted four times before he was 
convicted of fraud and extortion conspiracy the second and current 
elected mayor larry hoffman turned himself in friday the day 
after he was indicted on theft charges by a broward county grand 
jury 
he was booked at the county jail and released on a 2000 bond 
said dave casey a spokesman for the state attorneys office an 
arraignment date was not set 
the grand theft count a felony punishable by up to five years 
in prison and a 5000 fine charges that hoffman last year 
illegally obtained a cityowned chain saw worth at least 300 
casey said

federal investigators said friday they have 
broken up a chinese herointrafficking ring arresting 11 people in 
hong kong and nine in the united states while seizing 137 pounds of 
heroin worth over 100 million 
five of those arrested in new york were charged with conspiring 
to supply 1000 m16 military rifles to undercover federal agents 
and to provide false documents so the rifles could be shipped to 
libya 
the breakup of the asian ring was the culmination of a twoyear 
investigation called operation bamboo dragon that was launched when 
federal agents learned that a restaurant owner in the chinatown 
section of washington was buying stolen firearms and distributing 
cocaine 
the fbi the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms the drug 
enforcement administration and the us customs service conducted 
the investigation and law enforcement officials announced the 
arrests at a news conference in washington 
drugimporting asian criminal gangs are moving in to fill the 
void left by the successful prosecution of sicilian mafia members 
in the united states fbi director william sessions said in a 
statement 
this gang was capable of putting enormous firepower into the 
hands of terrorists and drug smugglers customs commissioner 
william von raab said in a statement federal officials said the 
ring had supplied 600 handguns mostly to chinese gangs 
the fbi and atf inserted undercover operatives into the ring 
including a chinesespeaking agent who portrayed himself as a drug 
dealer 
the cantonesespeaking federal agent frederick yau met with 
gang members in washington and hong kong to negotiate the purchase 
of heroin from asia 
the heroin came from burma and china and was transported to san 
francisco and new york citys chinatown it also was distributed to 
newark nj alexandria va and washington 
us members of the ring were selling hundreds of stolen or 
illegally obtained hand and machine guns and rifles on the streets 
of new york city usually to chinese gangs 
many of the firearms were obtained with fraudulent 
identification documents from gun shops in fort worth dallas and 
houston texas the officials said 
the chinese gangs were buying ar15 semiautomatic rifles the 
civilian version of the armys m16 rifle and converting them 
into fully automatic m16s 
customs and atf undercover agents bought 10 weapons from the 
five people charged in new york city and ordered 1000 more m16s 
that were to be delivered to libya such shipments would have 
violated the arms export control act which sets up federal 
licensing procedures for the sale of weapons to foreign countries

a soviet newspaper said friday that it made a 
mistake by printing a letter that criticized mikhail s gorbachevs 
reforms and defended josef v stalin 
the letter from a leningrad teacher published march 13 said 
stalins accomplishments were being ignored and his crimes 
overemphasized it criticized gorbachevs perestroika program 
of restructuring soviet society 
sovietskaya rossiya the organ of the russian republics 
communist party and government said in an editors note friday 
that it used poor judgement in printing the letter 
the editors said they had not demonstrated enough 
responsiblity a sufficiently balanced approach and the 
understanding that the letter leads one away from the 
revolutionary renewal of society through democracy and glasnost 
glasnost is gorbachevs policy of greater openness in selected 
topics 
the editors note was accompanied by 10 readers letters 
condemning the teachers comments 
some observers believe the offending letter indicated the 
newspaper fell under the influence of conservatives led by yegor k 
ligachev considered the second most powerful official in the 
kremlin after gorbachev 
ligachev a member of the ruling politburo has suggested that 
glasnost has gone too far in uncovering past soviet mistakes 
pravda the communist party daily said in an editorial april 5 
that sovietskaya rossiyas editors had been irresponsible in 
publishing the teachers letter and warned that the soviet press is 
not a private shop where opponents of party decisions can voice 
their opinions 
sovietskaya rossiya reprinted the pravda article without comment 
on april 6 gorbachev praised pravda for setting the record 
straight 
sovietskaya rossiya discussed the letter again in fridays 
editions on a page bearing the headline the party is going to 
the lead of perestroika it said it had been swamped with letters 
about the dispute and claimed all supported gorbachevs reform 
program 
however the editors said they would not shy away from 
controversial articles 
direct frank talking to readers has been is and will remain 
the main genre of our party newspaper they wrote 
in an accompanying article historian l ryansky defended the 
medias uncovering of stalins crimes and rehabilitation of his 
victims he said the writing proved that the truth no matter how 
concealed sooner or later will triumph

the judge in the irancontra trial warned 
friday against the unauthorized disclosure of some 300000 
classified documents expected to be turned over to the defense by 
prosecutor lawrence e walsh 
in an order detailing procedures for handling the documents by 
the defense us district judge gerhard a gesell warned that 
unauthorized disclosure of classified information may constitute 
violations of united states criminal laws 
persons subject to this order are advised that direct or 
indirect unauthorized disclosure retention or negligent handling 
of classified documents or information could cause serious damage 
and in some cases exceptionally grave damage to the national 
security of the united states or may be used to the advantage of a 
foreign nation against the interests of the united states the 
judge said 
the ninepage order requires that the defendants their lawyers 
and any witnesses must obtain approval of the courtdesignated 
security officer before gaining access to classified documents 
access will be granted on a needtoknow basis and the 
defendants their lawyers and witnesses must sign an agreement not 
to make unauthorized disclosures of the information contained in 
the documents gesell said 
any violation of the terms of this order shall be immediately 
brought to the attention of the court and may result in a charge of 
contempt of court and possible reference for criminal 
prosecution gesell said 
marine lt col oliver l north and former national security 
adviser john m poindexter are accused of conspiring with arms 
dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen richard v 
secord to divert profits illegally from the usiran arms sales to 
the nicaraguan contra rebels 
at a hearing tuesday independent counsel walsh said that as 
many as 300000 classified documents are being reviewed by an 
interagency government task force walsh said he expected that 
50000 documents relevant to the case will be ready for defense 
review by months end 
gesell ordered that the defense is entitled to review the rest 
of the material to determine if it is relevant to their case when 
the matter goes to trial 
the order requires that lawyers can only work with the documents 
or discuss them with each other or witnesses in the special 
security facility that is being constructed by the court security 
officer 
gesell prescribed a type of word processing equipment which is 
apparently resistant to electronic eavesdropping to be used by the 
defense for preparing court pleadings based on the materials 
all pleadings dealing with classified information must be 
prepared in the facility and filed under seal with the court 
security officer who will delete classified references before the 
briefs are placed in the public file gesell ordered 
before any classified document is introduced into evidence at 
the trial it must be declassified by the government agencies that 
produced it 
if the government refuses to declassify a document the 
classified information procedures act empowers the court to 
substitute a statement of facts that the material would prove 
the court could also agreed to delete certain classified 
markings that reveal intelligence methods but were not pertinent to 
the case 
gesell gave the defense until april 29 to file a challenge to 
the application fo the classified information statute to the case 
the defense complained that the law requires procedures that 
inhibit their ability to prepare their case

democratic presidential candidate michael 
dukakis won praise but no endorsement friday from new york gov 
mario cuomo who said all the contenders were singularly 
important democrats 
cuomo said at a state capitol news conference that dukakis the 
frontrunner in polls preceding tuesdays new york primary was a 
singularly important democratic leader 
two days earlier the governor had told jackson he was 
singularly important democrat 
questioned by reporters cuomo said all the democratic 
candidates including tennessee sen albert gore jr were 
singularly important no matter where they finish 
recent polls show dukakis leading jackson with gore far behind 
in the battle for the 255 delegates at stake in the primary the 
biggest delegate prize of the campaign season so far 
cuomo hasnt met with gore since march 21 and is not scheduled 
to 
on friday the governor scrapped plans to make campaign stops 
with all three candidates in the new york city area over the next 
few days his aides cited the press of state business 
earlier friday dukakis spoke with students at a junior high 
school in brooklyn warning against using illegal drugs and 
engaging in an exchange with students on how widespread the problem 
is 
he met privately with some students and said they told him 25 
percent to 50 percent of schoolage kids were using drugs 
then he walked around the crowded school auditorium asking 
students how many of their peers used drugs regularly 
crack can kill you right who was killed by crack lenny 
bias right in about four minutes that young mans life was 
snuffed out he said referring to the former university of 
maryland basketball star 
at one point he asked students what should be done to students 
who use drugs should we suspend them he asked eliciting a 
chorus of no from the students why not theyre breaking 
the law arent they he said 
later at a rally in albany after his appearance with cuomo 
dukakis criticized the reagan administration for not doing more in 
the fight against illegal drugs 
why do we have money for star wars and not money for a war 
against drugs he asked the greatest threat in this hemisphere 
is not the sandinistas its the avalanche of drugs 
cuomo during his news conference with dukakis said all three 
candidates had grown during the campaign but he declared that is 
particularly true of governor dukakis 
if governor dukakis becomes the candidate of the democratic 
party he will be a superb representative of the democrats he 
said i believe he will be a winner in november and i believe he 
would go on to be a great president 
during their news conference dukakis was asked if he had any 
fear that when you get to the convention you may be facing him 
cuomo as a competitor 
should i have joked dukakis to cuomo the new york governor 
said no 
while cuomo declared more than a year ago that he wouldnt seek 
the democratic presidential nomination it was only in the past few 
days that he has indicated he wouldnt accept a draft at a 
deadlocked convention 
when the questioning turned to whether the massachusetts 
governor would want cuomo to serve in a dukakis administration 
dukakis said it was not the time to be thinking about who should 
be in your administration 
can we fix a time asked cuomo 
but his mother always wanted him to serve on the supreme 
court said dukakis

child care is a new urgency for americas 
working parents and increasingly an issue that employers must 
face a labor department report said friday 
labor secretary ann mclaughlin said the issue was a national 
concern 
lets start with a key fact over half of the countrys women 
with preschool or schoolage children work she said at a news 
conference noting that each group of children from infants to 
latchkey children required a different programmatic response 
the departments 12member task force on child care composed of 
senior labor department officials has reviewed proposed 
legislation major articles surveys and studies on the issue to 
determine the severity of the problem 
the panels report found the child care issue to be a matter 
of new urgency for americas working parents one that by simple 
arithmetic is of considerable magnitude 
the task force said that there was widespread public concern 
that a crisis exists in the ability of americas parents to 
find child care but the panel stopped short of describing the 
problem as a crisis 
we dont see it as a national crisis but we see it as a 
terrific national concern mclaughlin said 
the report entitled child care a workforce issue said the 
federal government is already addressing the child care issue with 
more than 69 billion spent on head start and other child care 
programs it said state and local governments have shown commitment 
to funding for child care training providers referral systems and 
defining standards for providers 
but although many employers have realized the economic benefits 
of responding to employee child care needs others have yet to 
grasp the impact of inadequate child care on worker performance and 
absenteeism the report said 
mclaughlin said the labor department would conduct a 
comprehensive review of all departmental laws and regulations to 
evaluate their impact on work and family recognize employers and 
unions who develop new approaches to child care and publish and 
promote examples provide technical assistance and information to 
labor and management and increase the availability of child care 
options in the job corps and the job training partnership act 
mclaughlin said departments day care center would be expanded 
as an employer model as would the availability of assistance to 
department employees

america on friday vetoed a security 
council resolution that urged israel to stop deporting palestinians 
from the occupied territories saying the measure lacked balance 
arab diplomats denounced the action and said it hurt the latest 
us initiative to promote middle east peace talks 
fourteen of the councils 15 members voted for the resolution 
and britain made an unusually harsh speech against israels policy 
of deporting palestinians allegedly linked to disturbances in the 
occupied west bank of the jordan river and gaza strip 
british ambassador john birch called the deportations brutal 
and often indiscriminate actions and said they are immoral 
illegal and politically selfdefeating 
world opinion has been shocked and disgusted rightly so by 
the widespread suffering of the civilian population of all ages and 
both sexes in the territories he said 
arab league spokesman clovis maksoud said the veto mortally 
wounded the us peace initiative and would encourage israel to 
mistreat the 15 million palestinians living under israeli 
occupation 
the veto today ratifies that level of permissiveness that has 
emboldened israel to defy the international community maksoud 
told a news conference after the council meeting 
zehdi l terzi envoy of the palestine liberation organization 
that has observer status at the united nations told the council 
the united states had isolated itself by killing the resolution 
theres always a rotten apple in the box he said 
in casting the veto us ambassador herbert s okun said the 
resolutions broad and sweeping condemnation of israel contains 
not a scintilla of balance it contains no appeal or request for 
calm 
the measure urged israel to halt deportations condemned human 
rights violations in the occupied territories and called for a 
unsponsored settlement of the arabisraeli conflict 
israel deported eight palestinian civilians earlier this week 
and issued deportation orders for 12 others as part of its effort 
to quell four months of violence in the west bank and gaza that has 
claimed more than 140 arab lives two israelis have died 
okun told the council the united states is engaged in a major 
diplomatic effort to bring about direct negotiations between israel 
and its arab neighbors 
the soviet union and most arab nations want a peace conference 
under un auspices that would include the plo and the five 
permanent members of the security council the united states 
soviet union china britain and france permanent members have 
veto power 
other members of the council are algeria argentina brazil 
italy japan nepal senegal west germany yugoslavia and zambia 
israel refuses to talk with the plo which it considers a 
terrorist organization and prime minister yitzhak shamir has 
opposed an international peace conference saying it might try to 
force concessions that would jeopardize israels security 
despite its veto the united states has been critical of 
israels handling of violence in the occupied territories 
on jan 5 it cast a rare vote against israeli joining the rest 
of the security council in approving a resolution urging the jewish 
state to refrain from an earlier round of deportations 
israel defied the resolution and deported four palestinian 
activists to lebanon 
the united states on jan 14 declined to use its veto to protect 
israel and abstained as the council passed a resolution urging 
israel to let the deportees return 
okun said friday the latest resolution was redundant

the former police chief of marlow was 
charged friday with seconddegree murder a month after authorities 
dug up the remains of his wifes first husband in his yard after 
his father made a deathbed confession 
robert chambers 36 appeared relaxed but said nothing as he 
surrendered at the state police station in keene and sat through 
two court appearances in the 1978 killing of russell bean a close 
friend unable to post the 200000 bail he was taken to the 
cheshire county jail 
chambers was not handcuffed during his arraignment in keene 
district court and bail hearing in superior court he entered no 
plea but his attorney mark sisti said his client will plead 
innocent to the charge which he called a mistake 
bean was 25 when was last seen in 1978 his wife sylvia moved 
in with chambers and married him soon after her husband 
disappeared after beans remains were found last month she and 
chambers separated 
chambers sister melissa came forward march 10 the day after 
her father died she said in affidavits that clifton chambers 61 
told her that his son came to him 10 years ago and said he 
accidentally killed bean in a fight and that the father helped his 
son bury the body with a backhoe 
authorities dug for three days in a spot that once was a pig pen 
before finding beans remains 25 feet down chambers resigned as 
the towns parttime chief 
he also took a leave of absence from his job as parttime chief 
of nearby gilsum and was suspended without pay as a trainee with 
the winchester police department 
attorney general stephen merrill announced the arrest at a news 
conference in concord he said chambers was not charged with 
firstdegree murder because there was no evidence of premeditation 
merrill said further charges related to concealment of a corpse 
may be filed but that he anticipates no other arrests 
if convicted chambers could be sentenced to 30 years in prison 
without parole merrill said 
while chambers is held at the county jail he would be separated 
from other inmates to protect him from prisoners he might have 
arrested as a police officer said the attorney general 
merrill said he expects the defense to challenge the elder 
chambers dying declaration as inadmissible hearsay and 
anticipates having the issue settled by the state supreme court 
new hampshire law allows socalled dying declarations to be 
admitted as evidence in certain cases 
although acknowledging that without the dying declaration beans 
body may never have been found merrill said investigators have 
enough evidence after interviewing 15 to 20 people to convict 
chambers even if his fathers declaration is not allowed in court 
an autopsy showed bean had been beaten with a blunt instrument 
merrill declined to say whether a weapon had been recovered what 
physical evidence there was or whether there had been witnesses 
maj donal anderson who headed the investigation said beans 
disappearance had not been treated as a crime in 1978 he said his 
investigation showed that bean and chambers had an altercation 
which indicates there was bad blood

a us air force radiorelay station causing slight damage and no 
injuries us embassy spokesman bob meade reported 
he said the bomb had been placed near an air conditioning unit 
at the humosa relay station six miles east of the usspanish air 
base at torrejon the air base is 12 miles northeast of madrid 
the spanish news agency efe quoted an unidentified defense 
ministry source as saying the bombing could be related to the 
second anniversary of the april 15 1986 us air raids on libya

of a uso club in naples italy killing five people including a 
us navy servicewoman italian police said they believed a member

for the us bombing of libya 
meade said no group or individual asserted responsibility for 
the attack near madrid he said the blast damaged a maintenance 
building but did not interrupt air force communications at torrejon

that was part of a new eightyear pact on american military units 
in spain that will replace a fiveyear accord which expires may 14

a university of washington business 
student whose dismissal and subsequent reinstatement in a womens 
studies class has sparked a controversy says he was intimidated by 
what he called malebashing in the course 
i felt about as welcome in the class as a black at a klan 
meeting peter schaub told a meeting of the state senate law and 
justice committee on friday 
schaub became the focus of a controversy after a dean james 
nason banned him from an introductory women studies course during 
the winter quarter for alleged disruptive and threatening behavior 
the dean later reinstated him and schaub was given credit for 
the course although he had missed nearly half of the classes the 
class is ungraded one either passes or fails 
the controversy has sparked several emotional campus 
demonstrations and schaub has even been approached by television 
producers seeking rights to his story 
class instructors and some students had charged that schaubs 
reinstatement was an attack on feminism and as violation of their 
academic freedom 
i believe it was a violation of the rights of women in the 
classroom not to know why he was reinstated said elizabeth 
daugherty who was a fellow student she also claimed that she was 
verbally attacked by the 6foot2 inch 220pound schaub 
schaub and his supporters believe the instructors and their 
assistants were hostile and vehemently antimale 
there was male bashing during which all white males were 
described as child rapists and women abusers said schaub i 
had the feeling that if i were black or homosexual i wouldnt have 
been discriminated against 
schaub an amateur bodybuilder who likes to refer to himself as 
peter schwarzenegger after the bodybuilder turned actor denied 
charges he is antifeminist antihomosexual or racist 
i just think that this particular class hurts everyone they 
say that everything is racist and sexist he said they twist 
it so far out of proportion that someone will not even listen to 
them 
committee chairman kent pullen said the meeting was a 
factfinding hearing and that he didnt believe it was the 
committees job to delve into course content 
i am confident the university of washington administration can 
resolve this issue but i have a personal interest in freedom of 
speech the states equal rights amendment and the use of public 
funds for political purposes said pullen 
asked why schaub had been given credit for the course even 
though he didnt complete it joe norman dean of the college of 
arts and sciences said it was an unsual situation and a review of 
schaubs work indicated he would pass the course if he completed it 
as for charges that individual rights had been violated norman 
said our conclusion after exhaustive review is that the record 
for winter quarter 1988 contains too much conflicting information 
to warrant student disciplinary action 
testimony before the committee also was conflicting 
i found womens studies 200 a stimulating exciting course and 
it did not engage in malebashing or racism said ms daugherty 
but mary seward another of schaubs fellow students said 
when i asked a question about where a guest lecturer got her 
information on indians in mexico i was told that i was a racist i 
was told that all white people are racists and those who say they 
arent are practicing denial 
john zehnder another fellow student said he did not find 
schaub either disruptive or disrespectful in class the problem 
arose because he was perceived as a threat to unusual teaching 
techniques 
the instructors presented erroneous or misleading statistics 
and personal opinions as fact zehnder asserted 
he also said he was told by an instructor that he would be 
flunked if he ever used the words lady or girl in written work

michael dukakis slammed the reagan administration friday for 
putting drugpeddling panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noriega on the us payroll but vice president george bush 
retorted that it is libya that has been propping up noriega with 
millions of dollars 
jesse jackson made fun of efforts by fellow democrats dukakis 
and sen albert gore jr to claim leadership in the fight against 
drugs saying they are captains and lieutenants while im the 
general in this war 
as the presidential campaign moved into the final weekend before 
the pivotal new york primary on tuesday the rhetoric was tamed 
for republicans it was a day for unity 
democrats aimed their fire mostly at the reagan administration 
drug pushers and the owners of eastern airlines not at each other 
democratic frontrunner dukakis talked to brooklyn junior high 
school students about drug abuse using wife kittys 26year 
dependence on diet pills as an example the massachusetts governor 
used the lowkey approach of a talkshow host in discussing drug 
abuse such as crack the potent cocaine derivative 
crack can kill you right who was killed by crack lenny 
bias right dukakis said of the former university of maryland 
basketball star in about four minutes that young mans life was 
snuffed out 
dukakis tossed aside a prepared speech on drugs in which he 
criticized the reagan administration for paying noriega money 
through the central intelligence agency before he was indicted for 
drugrunning 
why do we have the money for star wars but not for the war 
against drugs and why did you pay 200000 a year to a 
dopepeddling gunrunning panamanian dictator dukakis speech 
said 
dukakis flew to albany to meet with new york gov mario cuomo 
who fell back on an old phrase to describe dukakis as a 
singularly important democratic leader cuomo who is not 
endorsing anyone before tuesday had used almost the same words to 
describe jackson after a meeting wednesday 
for his part jackson continued his attack on drugs at the south 
jamaica housing project in queens where he compared drug dealers 
to members of the ku klux klan who harassed and killed blacks 
while wearing white hoods 
ropes sheets and hoods represent death jackson told a 
cheering crowd we never lost as many lives to southern rope as 
to drugs 
the dope pusher does not wear sheets and hoods the dope 
pusher is the hood who lives in the neighborhood said jackson 
bush in a speech before the american society of newspaper 
editors said democratic charges that the administration had 
propped up noriega are demagogic statements 
it is this administration that has brought noreiga to justice 
or at least taken the first step bush said noriega should go 
and noriega will go 
bush added that noriega has resisted the us economic pressure 
because of outside help 
several reliable sources indicate that he is receiving 
millions of dollars in support from libya bush said he did not 
elaborate on his sources 
otherwise the republican nomineetobe talked of pulling the 
party together for the fall general election 
bush had lunch with vanquished rival sen bob dole in his 
capitol office standing together for the cameras as dole 
proclaimed were ready to go to work for george bush 
bushs remaining rival for the nomination former television 
evangelist pat robertson admitted the gop race is over and said 
he would campaign for the nominee 
it is obvious from the delegate countthat george bush is 
going to be the nominee of the republican party absent any 
unexpected eventuality robertson told the american society of 
newspaper editors 
but he vowed to continue his minimalist campaign saying he 
hoped to energize the people who support me to play a role in 
the gop convention in august 
bush also planned a private meeting with former president 
richard nixon 
gore running a dismal third in the polls temporarily dropped 
his constant attacks on dukakis and jackson and took on eastern 
airlines 
early friday he spoke to about two dozen members of employee 
unions at the airlines currently embroiled in a bitter labor 
dispute and under close government scrutiny 
the mismanagement of eastern and continental stands as a 
symbol of the kind of approach ronald reagan and george bush 
encourage with their policies of handsoff let em have whatever 
kind of labor relations they want promote greed as the principal 
guiding value for corporate america gore said 
abc newswashington post tracking poll released friday evening 
had dukakis with 44 percent jackson at 37 percent and gore at 10 
percent the poll was conducted wednesday and thursday among 268 
likely democratic voters in new york with a margin of error of 7 
percentage points 
on thursday the abcpost poll had dukakis at 49 percent 
jackson 34 percentand gore 8 percent that poll consisted of the 
wednesday interviews of 176 likely democratic voters and had a 
margin of error of 9 percentage points 
gore speaking in buffalo ny dismissed the poll results 
saying the polls have consistently been wrong and said the 
undecided vote was beginning to go decidedly in his favor 
gores campaign is now 16 million in debt after 100000 in 
new loans to finance new york ads 
dukakis clearly tired of gores criticism in recent days did 
not resist a swipe at the tennessee senator 
ive got a competitor who is desperate to get in this race 
he told reporters 
dukakis holds a widening leader in the fight for national 
convention delegates according to the ap count the massachusetts 
governor has 84215 votes to 7301 for jackson gore has 41655 
while uncommitted delegates have 61775 delegate voters

a jury recommended friday that a 
southwestern missouri dairy farmer be put to death for killing his 
wife and two nephews including a teenager whom he had originally 
blamed for the killings 
the jury which convicted james e schnick of elkland of three 
counts of firstdegree murder had the alternative of recommending 
life in prison if a judge accepts the jurys recommendation 
schnick would become the 57th person on death row at the missouri 
state penitentiary where there has not been an execution since 
1965 
the webster county jury thursday found schnick guilty in the 
deaths of his wife julie and two nephews kirk buckner 14 and 
michael buckner 2 on friday they recommended the death penalty 
on all three counts 
schnick also is accused but was not tried in the deaths of his 
brotherinlaw steve buckner buckners wife jeannette and the 
buckners two other sons dennis 8 and timmy 6 buckner and mrs 
schnick were brother and sister 
all the victims died in an early morning shooting spree sept 25 
at the buckner and schnick families dairy farms in nearby elkland 
the schnicks two young children were not injured 
schnick originally blamed the slayings on his nephew kirk and 
claimed he killed the boy in selfdefense the allegation shocked 
members of the community who knew the teenager who was described 
as quiet and hardworking 
within days however schnick himself was charged in connection 
with the seven deaths police said he confessed during questioning 
but he claimed during the trial that the confession was not freely 
given 
webster county prosecutor donald cheever said the crimes were 
aggravated by the fact that schnick may have killed his wife in 
order to collect life insurance the number of victims and the 
youth of many of them also prompted cheever to seek the death 
penalty 
its difficult to imagine anything more defenseless and more 
helpless in this world than a 2yearold asleep in his bed 
cheever said in his closing arguments anyone who would kill an 
infant in those circumstances deserves the most severe punishment 
possible under the law 
schnicks attorney pleaded for her clients life on behalf she 
said of his two surviving children 
no one is minimizing the terribleness or the horror of what 
has occurred susan chapman said healing comes with time 
and love and compassion its not going to come with vengence 
ms chapman had called schnicks friends and family members to 
attest that he had been a helpful neighbor and caring father she 
said their testimony proved that there is the possibility of 
redemption 
daniel foster chief of psychology at the federal medical center 
at rochester minn testified that after evaluating schnick and 
interviewing many of his friends he concluded that schnick strove 
all his life to please others and was frustrated by his inability 
to satisfy those closest to him when he lost control sept 25 
the acting out that he did is very unlikely ever to be 
repeated foster said 
the defense contended during the trial that schicks confession 
was gained under pressure and that he had been under the influence 
of medication on the day of the shootings 
schnicks longtime physician dr jc presley said he 
examined schnick oct 2 three days before his confession and 
prescribed a painkiller 
it dulls the awareness presley said it tends tp make a 
patient sleepy and impair his intellectual function 
but county coroner dr jd blinn called as a rebuttal witness 
said he prescribed the same painkiller often during his 41 years as 
a general practitioner and rarely noted that his patients reacted 
with drowsiness

president reagan will veto 
the omnibus trade bill before congress because democratic leaders 
insist on plant closure safeguards us trade representative 
clayton yeutter said friday 
he said the dispute could delay and possibly jeopardize 
congressional approval of the historic uscanada fee trade 
agreement 
the labor unions got their way yeutter told the vancouver 
board of trade in a luncheon speech prior to a weekend meeting with 
the trade ministers of canada japan and the european community 
he credited congress with the almost unprecedented deletion 
of dozens of protectionist portions of the trade bill to the point 
where reagan might be able to sign it 
but he said the democratic leadership informed the 
administration on thursday that they would not discard a section 
requiring owners to give substantive notice before any plant 
closures 
that legislation is objected to vigorously by the american 
business community and the administration yeutter said 
therefore the trade bill is going to be vetoed we believe we 
can sustain the veto which means were back to ground zero after 
two or three years work on a trade bill 
that could have implications for the free trade agreement 
he said at the very least the trade bill battle will delay 
consideration of the trade accord for about 30 days and bruised 
feelings in congress could erode support for it 
the trade deal was negotiated with prime minister brian 
mulroneys conservative government last year and is set to go in 
effect in january if ratified by congress and canadas parliament 
it would eliminate all tariffs in the worlds biggest trading 
partnership over a 10year period and loosen nontariff and 
investment barriers 
yeutter said he remains confident the trade pact will be passed 
this year but said the vote could come after labor day instead of 
prior to the summer recess as reagan hoped 
he said it is possible that congressional leaders will amend the 
us trade bill before a final vote next thursday or friday or 
revise it quickly after a presidential veto 
i certainly wouldnt reach the conclusion the free trade 
agreement is in mortal danger he told a news conference 
mulroney faces reelection in the next year and had hoped to 
have the trade agreement approved in time for a possible early 
election this fall 
yeutter joined newly appointed canadian trade minister john 
crosbie japanese trade minister hajime tamura and trade 
commissioner willy de clerq of the 12nation european community for 
a weekend retreat on isolated quadra island near vancouver 
the regularly scheduled meeting was expected to focus on 
progress in the uruguay round of talks to revamp the 95country 
general agreement on tariffs and trade 
for the first time yeutter said gatt is discussing world 
trading rules for services such as insurance and computer software 
washington also seeks more protection for patents trademarks and 
copyrights as well as structural reform to improve the monitoring 
of trade practices 
he said he also looked for progress with japan over higher 
quotas for us beef and citrus products otherwise yeutter said 
the united states will press its complaints before gatt

a 15yearold suspected crack user accused of 
torching a home that his gang used as a hangout may have been 
seeking revenge against a resident who had complained to police a 
detective said friday 
the residents 12yearold son was killed and six others injured 
in the fire early thursday 
antione montgomery was accused of using a blowtorch to set fire 
to a couch and a blanket in the house he was arrested and charged 
as an adult with murder arson and assault thursday 
queens chief of detectives joseph borrelli said the 15yearold 
and as many as nine other youths had taken over a mans firstfloor 
apartment in the building about six weeks ago for fun and games 
and to package crack 
another resident eyvonne perkins 31 called police wednesday 
night to complain that two gang members were throwing rocks at her 
secondfloor windows they were gone by the time a patrol car came 
by police said 
montgomery returned at 545 am and started the fire police 
said 
it would appear the way they were comfortable in this 
residence was going to come to an end and they would probably have 
to leave borrelli said in speculating that revenge was the 
motive 
the detective said the man in the firstfloor apartment moved to 
another part of the house because he was intimidated and 
fearful 
the house is just a few blocks from where a rookie police 
officer was shot to death at pointblank range in february while 
guarding the home of a man who had complained of drug dealing in 
the neighborhood 
the tactical narcotics team has made 560 arrests 467 of them 
for narcotics since designating the neighborhood a target area 
march 4 
in addition to the death of michael perkins three family 
members and three firefighters were injured said 
investigators are looking for the other youths ranging in age 
from 15 to 20 borrelli said

former white house spokesman larry speakes quit 
as chief spokesman for merrill lynch amp co on friday days after he 
created an uproar by admitting he twice concocted quotes for 
president reagan 
speakes said in a statement that his resignation was the best 
course of action for merrill lynch and for me personally merrill 
lynch is a great firm and the industry leader and ive enjoyed 
being part of it 
the announcement reflected intense pressure on speakes to resign 
as head of communications at the wall street investment giant 
because of his disclosures in a book about his tenure as white 
house spokesman he said in the book that he had attributed to 
reagan comments the president never made 
merrill lynch said in a statement we accept larry speakes 
resignation with regret larry has made a signficant contribution 
to our firm during his time here and we wish him well in every 
regard 
however a source familiar with speakes decision who spoke on 
condition he not be identified said senior merrill lynch 
management wanted him to quit because the phonyquote disclosures 
raised serious questions about his credibility and by extension the 
credibility of the company 
merrill lynch spokesman fred yager declined to elaborate on 
speakes resignation i think the statement speaks for itself 
im not going to veer from the statement he said 
william clark another merrill lynch spokesman said speakes was 
not in the companys new york offices and his whereabouts were 
unclear 
sources at the firm said speakes asked for a meeting earlier 
this week with daniel p tully merrill lynchs president and chief 
operating officer to discuss the controversy they said the 
credibility issue was raised by speakes 
we took the attitude that he being the communicator knew 
very well what this torrent of publicity was doing to him as our 
chief spokesman and the image of merrill lynch as its chief 
spokesman one source said 
speakes joined merrill lynch with much fanfare 14 months ago 
sources inside the firm said he earned between 200000 and 
250000 a year about triple his 77400 salary at the white house 
he oversaw a staff of about 70 people with responsibility over 
merrill lynchs press relations corporate advertising and inhouse 
communications 
reagan leaving washington for a weekend at camp david md 
declined to answer reporters questions about speakes saying only 
no comment just before he stepped into his helicopter 
the resignation was announced after speakes scrapped plans to 
attend a white house correspondents association dinner in 
washington next week as guest of the washington post earlier he 
canceled an appearance at denison university in granville ohio 
because of what school officials called the controversy over his 
new book titled speaking out 
speakes admitted in the book that on two occasions he attributed 
to reagan quotes that the president never said earlier this week 
speakes claimed he told reagan about the quotes later but reagan 
denied that 
in his book speakes says he quoted reagan as saying after the 
downing of a korean air lines passenger jet in 1983 by the soviet 
union that the incident posed a problem not between the soviet 
union and the united states but a soviet versus the world 
problem 
he said that comment really came from secretary of state george 
shultz 
speakes said he also credited reagan with some suggestions for 
possible retaliatory measures which also had been made by shultz 
in the other instance speakes says he quoted reagan as telling 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev during their geneva summit 
meeting there is much that divides us but i believe the world 
breathes easier because we are talking here together 
he said in the book that he and a press aide mark weinberg 
concocted this quotation 
the disclosures created an uproar among the present white house 
press office staff and was criticized by a broad range of 
professionals in the public relations business who said it damaged 
his credibility 
pamela talbot manager of the chicago office of the public 
relations firm daniel j edelman inc said friday that speakes 
probably would be able to find a job in public relations but that 
it would be at a lower level and for less pay 
he is still a major name in the business with powerful 
connections who made a mistake she said 
howard j rubenstein president of a large new yorkbased firm 
that bears his name said speakes is doing penance now hes been 
very severely damaged but hes an intelligent person and im sure 
someone would forgive him 
speakes successor marlin fitzwater who had excoriated speakes 
earlier in the week for the fabricated quotes told reporters 
friday im sorry for him personally 
fitzwater said he would comment no further 
on tuesday fitzwater who succeeded speakes as reagans chief 
spokesman had labeled his predecessors conduct a damn outrage

a bankruptcy judge granted ptl an 
extension friday to devise its reorganization plan while the 
ministrys courtappointed trustee said ptl would not be able to 
make a 57 million payment due may 2 
the trustee david clark also said the ministry would lay off 
an additional 125 people 
ptl had been scheduled to make its first major payment may 2 to 
start repaying the more than 60 million in debts accumulated by 
former ptl leaders jim and tammy bakker however federal 
bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds gave the ministry until may 15 a 
month from friday to modify its reorganization plan to include 
possible sale of assests to pay the debt 
reynolds warned clark that ptl should be prepared to sell 
property not related to the church or its television program to pay 
its debts assets the ministry had hoped to avoid parting with by 
holding a monthlong telethon in march on its evangelical television 
show however only 22 million was raised 
i visualize an orderly liquidation reynolds said 
whatevers left of the property would go to the ministry 
clark said the reorganization plan might be revised to include 
the sale of 3 million to 4 million of undeveloped land this year 
other assets including the heritage grand hotel could be sold as 
a last move he said 
david west ptls director of public relations echoed if we 
made a list of priorities of assets that could be sold the hotel 
would be the last 
linda ivey a spokeswoman for the ptl in fort mill sc said 
although the may 2 payment of 57 million was scheduled to be the 
first payment under the reorganization plan the ministry has 
managed to pay some creditors bills that they knew would come up 
under that process 
for that reason and because of mounting legal and 
administrative costs of the bankruptcy the amount due creditors in 
the may 2 payment has fluctuated ptl administrators had estimated 
last month they would owe about 42 million however as of friday 
the amount had risen to 57 million she said in a telephone 
interview 
reynolds gave ptl the extension after a hearing on a government 
motion to delay the may 2 implementation of ptls courtapproved 
plan 
in the motion filed in federal bankruptcy court in columbia 
sc justice department attorneys argued that ptl remains on shaky 
ground with the internal revenue service which is seeking more 
than 55 million in back taxes 
the us government appealed the ptl reorganization plan on dec 
29 and still opposes it 
the reorganization plan anticipates that ptl will qualify as 
taxexempt but so far the irs hasnt agreed to ptls request and 
has warned that ptl may lose its taxexempt status

navy heart surgeon donal m billig was 
freed friday from fort leavenworth where he had been held for two 
years after his conviction in the deaths of three patients was 
overturned on appeal 
the us navymarine court of military review ruled thursday 
that the evidence was simply not sufficient 
billig 57 was released about 11 am according lt col john 
gerlinger who said no other information about billigs plans would 
be released at his request billig told military authorities that 
he would not meet with reporters 
the navy has 20 days to ask the appeals court to reconsider 
billig who automatically returns to active duty with his 
previous rank of commander probably will be assigned to a reserve 
center in kansas city while the navy decides to appeal said navy 
spokeswoman lt janet mescus 
billig is also eligible for 120000 in back pay 
billig was chief heart surgeon at the navys bethesda naval 
hospital in maryland he was convicted in 1986 of two counts of 
involuntary manslaughter and one count of negligent homicide in the 
deaths of three patients 
he also was convicted on 18 of 24 counts of dereliction of duty 
in other operations and was sentenced to four years in prison 
the appeals court said prosecutors lost sight of the fact that 
coronary artery bypass surgery is an inherently risky business 
prosecutors had argued that billig used questionable surgical 
techniques but they never produced evidence or testimony to 
demonstrate his work constituted criminal conduct the appeals 
court said 
we shall set aside all findings of guilty based on this 
factual insufficiency of the evidence the court said 
prosecutors described billig as an egocentric man who hid the 
fact that he was nearly blind in one eye and continued performing 
complex operations despite warnings that he was killing patients 
the appeals court said it was troubled by billigs conviction 
because his courtmartial involved criminal charges as opposed to 
civil claims for damages based on negligence 
we are not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the deaths 
that formed the basis of the appellants conviction were due to any 
negligence simple or otherwise on his part the appeals court 
said

federal agents seized more than a 
ton of cocaine hidden in frozen fruit pulp imported from ecuador 
us customs officials said friday 
suspicious customs agents wednesday had opened several plastic 
containers of the pulp that arrived april 7 finding a 10pound 
packet of cocaine inside one said agency spokesman cliff stallings 
the shipment was put under surveillance and on thursday two men 
spotted unloading the containers were arrested on smuggling 
charges stallings said the pulp was thawed out and found to

as many as 100 americans will be 
asked to testify at the trial of suspected twa hijacker mohammed 
ali hamadi court officials said friday 
hamadi jailed in frankfurt is charged with air piracy and the 
slaying of of an american sailor in the 1985 hijacking of a 
jetliner on a flight from athens to rome the hijackers held 39 
americans hostage in beirut for 17 days 
a spokesman for hesse state court judge thomas kehren told a 
news conference the west german government will pay expenses of 
americans who appear in court 
maybe 100 american citizens will be asked to travel from the 
united states to testify at the trial he said 
those who dont want to travel can give sworn depositions he 
added 
the news conference was called to clarify why the hamadi case 
was turned over to a juvenile court by the adult state court in 
frankfurt earlier this week 
court officials also used the news conference to indirectly 
criticize us officials who are calling on west germany to try 
hamadi as an adult 
the juvenile court will determine whether to deal with hamadi as 
a juvenile adolescent or adult kehren said 
if the court treats the suspect as an adult it could sentence 
him to life in prison upon conviction hamadi could receive a 
maximum 10year jail sentence if tried as a juvenile and 10 to 15 
years if tried as an adolescent kehren said 
west german law defines a juvenile as anyone under 18 years of 
age an adolescent as 18 to 21 years old and an adult as 21 or over 
the hamadi case was turned over to the juvenile court because 
there is doubt about whether he was 21 at the time he began the 
process of committing the crimes he is charged with the 
spokesman said 
the trial was to begin next month but court officials now say 
it will have to be put off for several months as the juvenile court 
studies the case and arranges for witnesses to testify 
the hijacking began june 14 1985 a day after hamadis 21st 
birthday but officials say planning of the crime likely began 
before he became a legal adult hamadi was arrested at frankfurt 
airport on jan 13 1987 and charged with carrying liquid 
explosives 
the courts president judge karl stephan said the case was 
given to the juvenile court to prevent the suspect from appealing a 
decision by a state adult court on the issue of his age 
in washington earlier this week state department spokesman 
charles redman said we expect and hope that hamadi will be 
tried and sentenced as an adult 
but stephan told reporters no outside comments will be 
allowed to influence the case 
judge horstguenter haas another official attending the news 
conference said it is dangerous for a court if there is even a 
mere appearance that outside considerations would be included in 
its decision 
west german officials last year rejected a request that hamadi 
be extradited to stand trial in the united states for the slaying 
of navy diver robert stethem during the hijacking the decision 
came after two west germans were kidnapped in beirut

an american sailor who was aboard the uss 
samuel b roberts when it hit a mine in the persian gulf said 
friday he heard a thunderous blast and feared he would drown as the 
sea rushed in around him 
a hole was blasted in the side of the missile frigate and it was 
being towed to dubai for repairs ten sailors remained hospitalized 
after the thursday incident and two were in critical condition 
defense department officials in washington said the frigate ran 
into a virtual mine field in the central gulf department sources 
said the navy had dispatched four minesweeping ships to the area 
to search for more explosives 
department spokesman lt col keith schneider said later that 
two mines were spotted by the crew of a reconnaissance helicopter 
and the devices were destroyed by a navy team he said the mines 
were moored by cables to the bottom of the gulf but were visible 
from the air 
the navy will resume the search for more mines at daylight 
saturday he added 
crewman alex perez of san antonio texas suffered a fracture of 
the lumbar region and lay moaning in his bed at bahrains salmaniya 
hospital 
one minute i was sitting at the console and the next it was 
all dark and i was down below he said 
perez 38 told the associated press that a lookout on duty had 
spotted what looked like a mine and the ship had already been on 
general quarters alert for about five minutes before there was a 
big sound 
the ship jumped up about four feet and there was water coming 
in the whole place just went dark perez remembered 
it happened so quickly i thought i was lost it was all 
dark and all i could see was the fire from the burning engine 
recalled perez i was in water i thought i was going to drown 
finally someone saw me and pulled me out of the water 
the incident about 55 miles off qatar revived fears of the 
mine threat in the waterway where iran and iraq have been at war 
for 7 years us warships escort americanflagged kuwaiti tankers 
through the waterway to protect them from iranian attacks 
on july 21 during one of the escort convoys the tanker 
bridgeton hit a mine in the gulf 
defense department officials said the samuel b roberts 
successfully maneuvered away from several mines and had come to 
nearly a complete stop when the explosion occurred 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
field had numerous mines and that the seas were rough 
at one point there was 12 feet of water inside the engine 
room said one official the crew just did a hell of a job she 
the ship took a really bad hit 
it wasnt known who planted the mines but one defense 
department source said they appeared to have been newly laid and 
added we certainly suspect the iranians are behind it 
salmaniya hospital officials said two of the injured were in 
critical condition with second degree burns to 40 percent of their 
bodies another was suffering from second degree burns to 15 
percent of his body 
the other injured sailors were suffering from shock and were 
under observation aboard the navy combat stores ship san jose 
other navy warships rushed to aid the samuel b roberts 
together with the crew of the stricken frigate these warships

the environmental protection agency does not 
plan to adopt air quality standards that would protect asthmatics 
around power plants and other sources from brief bursts of sulfur 
dioxide 
epa insisted it made the decision solely because it considered 
health gains to be marginal and did not consider at all the huge 
costs that such a standard would impose on the utility industry 
the agency estimated that 100000 asthmatics live within 12 
miles of a coalburning power plant and might be exposed for one 
hour per year to a burst of sulfur dioxide and only about a 
quarter of those would show any reaction it had no estimate of the 
number of people living near other potential sources such as 
industrial boilers 
craig potter assistant administrator for air programs said the 
agency decided not to act because of the reversible transitory 
effects involved for a fairly small number of individuals who 
if sensitive to these kinds of exposures are likely sensitive to 
other kinds of exposures and have medication that would protect 
them 
nonetheless the agency asked for public comment on whether it 
should adopt a onehour sulfur dioxide standard of 04 parts per 
million 
environmentalists denounced the decision which michael 
mccloskey chairman of the sierra club said starkly emphasizes 
the reagan administrations preference for protecting the 
polluters profits rather than public health 
from industry joe mullan environmental specialist for the 
national coal association said medical people coming to us are 
finding that there is adequate control under current standards 
outdoor concentration standards aimed at protecting health are 
by statute required to be set without considering costs 
asked what criteria the agency was using to make what potter 
admitted was a tough call bruce jordan of the office of air 
quality planning and standards said a new standard would disrupt 
an ongoing regulatory program and potter said the agency had to 
consider the best use of its own resources 
when you compare it a shortterm sulfur dioxide standard 
with other problems with ozone there is no comparison potter 
said 
potter said excessive ozone damages the lung structures 
irreversibly something sulfur dioxide does not do in brief 
exposures 
a onehour standard of 04 ppm to 05 ppm would probably require 
fossilfueled utilities to reduce annual emissions of sulfur 
dioxide by 6 million tons and a 02 ppm to 03 ppm standard would 
require reductions of 10 million tons to 11 million tons potter 
said 
the larger figure is roughly half the current national total and 
about the reductions called for in some bills being considered by 
congress to control the precursors of acid rain of which sulfur 
dioxide is an important one 
the edison electric institute has estimated that a 02 ppm 
onehour standard would cost the industry 5 billion a year but a 
08 ppm standard might be accommodated without major disruption 
the other sulfur dioxide standards are not expected to be 
changed the agency said in announcing that it would take comment 
from the public for 120 days before a formal decision

fbi spokesman ray mcelhaney said the agency has offered italian 
authorities its cooperation but he refused to confirm that an fbi 
team had been dispatched 
in december okudaira was charged in italy with bomb and rocket 
attacks on the us and british embassies in rome in june during 
the annual summit of western leaders in venice several people were 
wounded 
he is believed responsible for similar attacks on western 
embassies in madrid in 1986 the us embassy in jakarta in 1985 
the us embassy in kuala lumpur in 1975 and the french embassy in 
the hague in 1974 
argenio told reporters okudaira is believed to be the man who 
parked the explosivesladen car in front of the uso club 
it detonated during a party attended by sailors from the paul 
and uss capodanno lt david morris a navy spokesman in naples 
said the party was in the basement which made casualties lower

the number of eastern airlines planes grounded by 
safety violations grew to at least 15 friday as a federal crackdown 
found problems including a fuel leak a missing maintenance log and 
a cracked wing flap the machinists union said 
the airline and the federal aviation administration refused to 
confirm the number saying they will detail no violations until the 
inspection is complete as of thursday the faa had put the number 
of planes grounded at six 
they didnt want to see a running box score faa spokesman 
john leyden said of his agencys policy change after two days 
the unprecedented inspection of all eastern planes began after 
the faa slapped the company with a 823000 fine for safety 
violations us transportation secretary jim burnley said 
officials have been unsatisfied with easterns performance since 
its 1986 takeover by texas air corp which also will undergo a 
30day inspection of its operating practices 
eight planes were found to have safety violations friday 
according to reports from union members around the country said a 
union spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of 
company retaliation 
the latest groundings were in kansas city mo boston st 
louis tallahassee and atlanta the union spokesman said planes 
grounded by safety violations can be returned to service once they 
are repaired 
in addition union officials said a 757 in atlanta was grounded 
on wednesday and its passengers ordered off minutes before the

colors the much criticized movie about 
los angeles outofcontrol street gangs opened nationwide friday 
at 425 theaters amid protests and tight security following 
predictions of audience violence 
it also drew mixed reviews 
about 15 theaters nationwide dropped plans to show the film 
according to reports and at some southern california theaters 
police frisked young people as they entered 
afternoon showings went off without incident at the busy 
hollywood pacific theater it has just been business as usual 
said manager michael schnell 
the theater added security guards for the films opening but 
that was more in anticipation of the crowds than out of fear of 
violence schnell said the line for an afternoon show snaked a 
block down hollywood boulevard 
in the los angeles suburb of huntington park police said they 
planned to assign at least a dozen officers to the pacific warner 
theater huntington park is just a few miles from watts home area 
of several gangs 
there could be some fights inside the theater said 
huntington park police lt stan ramsey were taking this 
seriously well have officers inside the theater and officers 
outside 
there will be gang members there ramsey said definitely 
no doubt about it 
between jan 1 and april 4 there were 89 gangrelated deaths in 
los angeles county last year there were 387 gangrelated deaths 
in the area 
the management of the laemmle grand theater near the sheraton 
grand hotel just a short distance from gang turf decided not to 
show the film after staffers pleaded for their safety 
a united artists spokesman who asked not to be identified told 
the pomona progressbulletin a decision was made several weeks ago 
to pull the movie from some ua theaters including one in 
montclair where police in the past two years have staged two major 
raids against drugs and gangs 
two real los angeles gangs the crips and bloods and their 
respective colors of blue and red are depicted in the movie that 
stars sean penn and robert duvall as two officers assigned to fight 
the gangs 
the orion movie was directed by dennis hopper who spent the 
week defending the film against critics such as the 
hollywoodbeverly hills chapter of the naacp and los angeles city 
councilman nate holden who suggested it should not be shown 
anywhere 
im showing you a real problem that exists hopper said 
friday on nbcs today show when you show a real problem that 
exists you dont go to the city council and try to get the movie 
dismissed 
hoppers home in the venice area was picketed during the week by 
the guardian angels the new yorkbased civilian crimefighting 
organization 
the guardian angels also handed out pamphlets friday to 
theatergoers at the ua coronet in the fashionable westwood section 
of los angeles said the angels west coast director scott mckeown 
we are not going to stop anyone from seeing the movie but we 
are going to be exercising our constitutional right to protest 
it he said 
the angels also set up a picket line in new york city outside 
the large loews astor plaza theater just off times square 
in chicago the founder of a group called mothers against gangs 
praised and criticized colors saying adults should see the 
film 
a movie has appeared that makes us all witnesses to the daily 
horrors of gang wars frances sandoval said at a news conference 
the film has done what hundreds of pleading crying and angry 
voices of mothers of victims of gang violence could not it has 
drawn national attention to the brutal reality facing our youth 
however she criticized the film for not showing the 
aftereffects of gang violence when a child is murdered it is 
not all over she said it is the beginning of a living 
nightmare for the family for the mothers 
late thursday a chicago police gang crimes unit patrolman said 
all 14 unit officers assigned to the south side would be instructed 
to stick close to a theater showing the movie and would be on 
radio alert ready to help out if any violence were to occur 
the patrolman would not identify himself 
in florida dade county and city of miami special units were on 
alert but did not expect violence our gang unit is going to go 
to the theater to see the movie then hang out to identify more 
gang members said police spokesman david rivero but i dont 
think they are going to have any incidents 
reviews were mixed with many critics focusing not on the 
violence but on the timeworn oldcop youngcop conflict 
between duvalls and penns character 
the most shocking thing about the film is not that the movie 
glorifies gang violence it doesnt but that its about as 
conventional as an adam12 episode los angeles herald examiner 
film critic peter rainer wrote 
but the new york times janet maslin said hopper has a superb 
eye for the poisonous flower of gang culture amid ghetto life 
and noted also that while the movie was accused of glorifying gang 
violence its sense of frustration is much too strong to support 
that claim 
los angeles times critic sheila benson called it a 
disappointingly superficial movie

a psychologist was indicted friday on charges 
of submitting false data to win a 200000 federal research grant 
a federal prosecutor said the charges were the first of their kind 
in the nation 
stephen e breuning 35 was charged in connection with a grant 
received in 1982 from the national institute of mental health in 
bethesda while he was a faculty member at the university of 
pittsburgh medical school 
the money already has been repaid by the university us 
attorney breckinridge willcox said in a statement 
breuning now director of psychological services and behavorial 
treatment at the polk center in polk pa submitted a 1981 grant 
request for a study titled stimulant drug use with mentally 
retarded children while at the university from 1982 to 1984 the 
statement said 
the indictment said breunings applications cited the results of 
seven studies of hyperactive mentally retarded children 
breuning knew the studies had not been completed at the 
university of pittsburgh as described and that the studies 
that were ongoing were not obtaining the results as described 
the indictment said 
willcox said that the indictment is believed to be first time 
criminal charges have been brought against an individual in 
connection with falsified research 
we have addressed a problem that i suspect is more 
widespread than we think fraudulent research data in the medical 
field willcox said let this investigation send a clear 
message to doctors and researchers who play fast and loose with 
their research that they will have to deal with the criminal 
justice system in addition to their peer review panels 
in addition to two counts of making false statements breuning 
was charged with obstructing a national institute of mental health 
investigation by falsely testifying at a 1985 hearing that he had 
submitted a corrected version of his grant request 
we vehemently deny the allegations and think theyre patently 
untrue breuning said by telephone from his pittsburgh home 
friday night 
if convicted breuning who holds a doctorate in psychology from 
the illinois institute of technology could receive up to 10 years 
in prison and 20000 in fines on the false statement counts and 
five years and 250000 in fines on the obstruction count 
officials said 
george huber a spokesman for the university of pittsburgh was 
not available for comment a university employee said friday night

heritage through film and assurances that the film company would 
use fire prevention measures the paper said 
the director of the national historical preservation bureau lu

in light of the contract being signed first and moreover a 
letter from officials of the italian communist party requesting 
help and cooperation we decided to make this a special case 
some congressional delegates complained that the treatment of 
the foreign film makers was an affront to chinas attempts to 
develop a modern legal system and establish rule by law 
in the final analysis did the contract obey the law or 
overturn it hebei province delegate li zhuang was quoted as 
asking 
the debate was triggered when producers of an allchinese film 
crew making a television series also entitled the last 
emperor wrote a letter to a government advisory body in march 
complaining that they had been denied access to palace buildings 
is law greater in china or is power do foreigners have to 
obey our laws or not the letter asked 
the letter appealed to the chinese peoples political 
consultative conference to criticize and halt unhealthy 
tendencies and to reaffirm the integrity of chinese lawmaking 
according to the beijing evening news report ying ruocheng and 
his colleagues promised that film or television crews would not be 
given special privileges again 
the delegates ended their annual session on wednesday 
the chinese media has reported with little comment the awarding 
of nine academy awards including best picture to the last 
emperor

she never went to acting school but sonia 
braga has managed to convey highvoltage excitement in such films 
as dona flora and her two husbands and kiss of the spider 
woman now shes doing the same in robert redfords the milagro 
beanfield war 
braga plays ruby a tenacious garage owner who organizes a civic 
revolt against the land marauders of a new mexico village its 
another remarkable performance for the actress who began her career 
in brazilian soap operas 
here for the opening of the milagro beanfield war braga 
recently talked about her career in an interview that covered a 
wide range of subjects usually in brief bursts of conversation 
her english is amazingly good considering her recent acquaintance 
with the language 
i started learning english about four years ago she said 
i went to visit a friend in new york and since i wasnt doing 
anything at the time i decided to stay and learn the language 
im glad that i did that language can be a big barrier between 
people if you want to know a people you have to learn the 
language 
the actress first heard about milagro while she was serving 
on the jury of the cannes film festival three years ago her agent 
told her that robert redford wanted to talk with her about a role 
in the film on her way home to brazil she stopped in new york 
i read the script and i really really loved it she said 
then i met robert and we talked i was too excited about the 
character to be nervous i was very very touched that someone 
would want to make a movie about milagro 
then i made a screen test three times i had three or four 
more interviews with the producers and the director then i went to 
new mexico 
in the movie a new mexico hamlet is being squeezed to death by 
a resort developer with the help of the state governor and his 
venal staff the officials even send a hatchet man to terrorize the 
residents mostly hispanic when they grow restive under the rape 
of their land 
the reluctant leader of the revolt is a small landowner who 
inadvertently diverts the land barons water into his beanfield he 
becomes defiant and others strive to make it a crusade especially 
braga 
whats it like to be directed by robert redford 
hes very sensitive braga said i think thats not only 
because hes an actor and he understands the problems of actors 
thats the quality that some people have he is very into certain 
important things like the environment 
he is totally open to suggestion if youre doing well hell 
just let you go for instance ruben blades who plays sheriff 
montoya is a natural actor he was so much the character that 
robert just watched him do it but when he sees that you are going 
the wrong way he leads you back to the right way for the movie if 
you have any suggestions about the character he will listen to you 
and make some changes 
the darkhaired beauty has been working since she was 14 after 
playing children she did a production of hair for two years 
then i started doing soap operas she said one of the 
soap operas gabriella was written by jorge amada who also 
wrote dona flor 
the film brought her international acclaim as did kiss of the 
spider woman her first film in english 
she welcomes more opportunities abroad since the brazilian film 
industry has been ailing because of the countrys financial woes 
the countrys major filmmakers have abandoned brazil for hollywood 
making movies in english instead of portuguese hector babenco 
kiss of the spider woman shot ironweed with meryl streep 
and jack nicholson in albany ny

a new kind of community theater is 
drawing attention to rios shantytown slums where residents are 
telling the story of their grim reality through plays 
slum theater is a sharp break from the mainly white 
europeaninfluenced fare of rios theaters its supporters hope it 
will bring greater artistic recognition for popular culture which 
in the past has meant little more than carnival samba 
popular theater has become the most important movement within 
brazilian theater its exciting to see a hidden people expressing 
themselves said antonio pedro the citys secretary of culture 
in an interview 
in the past three years the city government has helped to start 
theater groups in most of greater rios 434 slums which are home 
to an estimated 4 million of the metropolitan areas 103 million 
residents 
one group is in the manguinhos slum or favela in 
portuguese brazils language like other favelas manguinhos is a 
jumble of slappedtogether wood or tin shanties inhabited mostly 
by blacks earning close to the official minimum wage of about 50 a 
month 
three times a week 26 residents meet for a twohour rehearsal 
in a newly built community center 
the characters in the play are a common slum family a mother 
who takes in washing to support the family an unemployed father 
who drinks and gambles away the meager income a son wanted by the 
police a daughter who is raped by the landlord when the family 
cannot pay the rent on its tworoom shack 
in the play the familys luck changes when the father wins the 
lottery and becomes a slumlord himself he buys up shacks expels 
former friends builds a mansion in the slum and finally moves out 
to the fashionable copacabana beach district cutting ties with the 
favela 
although most of the actors have fulltime jobs and many study 
at night few miss rehearsals 
i go crazy on nights when there is no rehearsal said 
antonio rodrigues 29 who plays the landlord 
the play later was to enter an amateur theater competition and 
travel for performances in neighboring slums 
jesus chediak is a pioneer in the popular theater movement he 
has helped to form some 200 groups in favelas around rio 
the first obstacle to starting a group he said is to convince 
the community he is not with the police another challenge is 
coping with interruptions such as gang wars police raids and 
weddings 
we try to give people a sense of their own value and teach 
them to respect their community through theather chediak said in 
an interview 
the plays often start as personal recollections or stories about 
slum life which then are woven in to drama chediak trains his 
students to collect these oral histories 
one of his pupils is yvete rodrigues a 25yearold drama school 
graduate who is starting a group in the cascatinha or little 
waterfall slum 
rodrigues recorded seven full tapes of interviews with the 
slums older residents the tapes later became the basis for a play 
of several sketches telling the story of the community 
people are creative but closed after years of repression of 
popular culture my job is to pull this creativity out of them 
she said 
some see slum theater as a step toward independence from outside 
influences especially from europe which has overshadowed theater 
here ever since spanish jesuit missionaries first used morality 
plays to evangelize native indians more than 400 years ago 
popular theater is more brazilian than anything weve seen 
said luiz mendonca who has directed slum theater groups as well as 
conventional plays 
in the 19th and early 20th centuries visting european troupes 
set the model for brazilian drama during world war ii a wave of 
talented european directors came to this country to flee the 
turmoil 
in the 1950s some young groups tried to turn brazilian theater 
toward national themes but a 1964 rightwing military coup imposed 
sweeping censorship and was especially harsh on community theater 
which was considered subversive the military regime ended in 1985 
slum theater also is a forum for discussing community action 
projects 
maria da costa a 24yearold actress in the cascatinha group 
said residents often use the rehearsals to discuss how to obtain 
electricity running water paved streets and other services the 
government has not provided for poor areas

a tv program called women behind bars sounds 
like some cheap attempt to boost ratings but its an nbc news 
documentary that turns out to be a sophisticated examination of a 
growing social problem 
unlike the stereotypes of tough tootsies that exploitation 
movies foster correspondent maria shriver reports in the onehour 
documentary tuesday night that most women in prison are there for 
economic crimes like hotcheck writing or welfare fraud and that 
most are single mothers with children under age 3 
once in prison the only job training they are likely to get 
will prepare them for lowpaying jobs as cosmetologists domestics 
or food servers in the meantime their families are uprooted and 
their children put in foster homes 
for women behind bars nbc went to dwight correctional 
institution in illinois and talked to inmates who in fact are 
rarely behind bars at first glance shriver notes the institution 
looks like the campus of an allgirls college inmates stay in 
rooms not cells though they are locked in at night 
the time you do here is mental time says one inmate 
the inmate says shes seen the prisons population triple in the 
seven years shes been there equal opportunity has brought women 
the equal opportunity to go to jail says shriver 
the institutions lag behind society in enlightened views of 
womens roles and appropriate behavior 
a warden notes that female inmates are more likely to be 
reported for minor misbehavior such as insolence than are men 
because women are expected to be ladies 
instead of preparing women for the challenge of returning to 
their communities getting jobs and taking charge of their lives 
womens prisons tend to make female inmates more dependent as 
opposed to mens prisons where inmates are likely to become more 
violent 
shriver asks one women who has been imprisoned several times why 
anyone take a chance that could send them back 
back home without support says the inmate youre going to 
do something to survive no matter what the consequences 
the biggest problem for women in prison is the separation from 
their children sometimes they dont even know who is raising them 
as interviews with weeping inmates attest women in jail care just 
as much about their children as women anywhere 
one young woman has just arrived to begin serving a 13month 
sentence for burglary she is five months pregnant and has two 
children in a foster home when the baby is born it too will go 
to the foster home 
theyll be too young to remember i hope says the woman 
if they get to visit mom in jail children can be further 
traumatized the cameras show a 3yearold boy being searched by a 
prison guard another small boy when asked wheres mama 
points to the foster mother who brought him not the real mother 
who is sitting next to him children wail when they are again 
wrenched from their mothers at the end of visiting hours 
of the one in five women who are serving long sentences for 
violent crimes many were battered wives who killed their husbands 
shriver says again contrary to stereotype they are unthreatening 
and stay in lowersecurity blocks statistics show most are 
middleclass and unlikely to commit another crime once released in 
prison they do their time quietly 
maximum security shriver reports is occupied mostly by younger 
inmates with long criminal records even if the individual crimes 
are not especially severe repeat offenders are more likely to be 
rebellious 
violent inmates are put in segregation left alone in a 
room one tough inmate spends her time in solitary writing poignant 
essays about prison life 
prison is a place she writes where you learn nobody 
needs you and the world goes on without you

unless you obtained an extension your income 
tax returns are now behind you leaving time to dwell upon the 
myriad thoughts that had entered your mind and then fled because of 
deadline stress 
such as didnt congress pass what it called a tax cut werent 
the returns supposed to have been simplified is it really possible 
for anyone to file a numberperfect return that is without 
paying too much or too little 
and if those people who are trained by the internal revenue 
service to interpret the tax code cannot reach agreement among 
themselves how can justice be dispensed and if it cannot how can 
faith in the system be maintained 
but these questions dont even deal with the problem having 
perhaps the greatest economic significance of all how can the 
nation tolerate the lost time the lost creativity and energy the 
lost productivity of it all 
americas 100 million taxpayers have spent at least 2 billion 
hours preparing for and making out their state and federal tax 
returns according to estimates by a university of michigan 
professor 
joel b slemrod director of the schools office of tax policy 
research estimates the bill for complying with state and federal 
tax laws totals as much as 27 billion this year it averages about 
275 a household 
it might be noted that this effort no matter how measured 
wasnt expended on making a better production line inventing a 
product improving health teaching a student aiding the needy 
building a house or exporting a product 
essentially although perhaps not totally it was 
nonproductive and maybe regressive as well slemrod found that 
the lowest income class had relatively higher compliance costs than 
the highest income group 
however the tax reform legislation did drop 6 million 
lowincome individuals off the tax rolls by increasing the standard 
deduction and personal exemption 
while slemrods numbers might seem high most likely they are 
not his research was conducted on a group of minnesota residents 
who filed state and federal income tax returns for 1982 well 
before the tax reform act of 1986 
he found that back then it took a taxpayer 217 hours a year to 
complete taxes twothirds of that time being devoted to 
recordkeeping onetenth to research and onefifth to filling in 
the blanks on the form 
he did not it seems take into account the amount of time that 
some of these people might subsequently have spent in defending 
their returns during audits nor the average cost of maintaining 
storage and work space in the home 
the lost productivity involved in such activities might make any 
other dollar figures from such studies seem minor true a lot of 
people would have used the time sleeping but conceivably that made 
them more productive the following day certainly more so than the 
worker who spent the night on taxes 
the route to resolving this annual dilemma isnt easy in fact 
it might involve as many dead ends and reverse turns as the 
ordinary taxpayer faces in getting to the bottom line the line 
where he or she finds the taxable income 
for example simpler isnt necessarily better says the 
professor simply because simpler can be unfair to be fair and 
effective there must be a certain amount of complication he 
says 
the level of frustration might be read on a blood pressure gauge 
when you realize that simply to change to a simpler system might 
only compound the problem since everyone would have to learn the 
brandnew system 
but in the name of economic productivity millions of americans 
today might agree that there must be a better route to the bottom 
line on the tax form

cbs announces its fall schedule next month and 
wiseguy producer stephen j cannell is asking viewers to write 
to the network to make sure the undercover agent drama isnt left 
off the list 
cbs is finishing last this season for the first time so major 
changes are in store for next fall now is the time for viewers to 
speak out says cannell viewer campaigns have saved other shows 
notably cagney amp lacey and designing women 
youve got a network under a certain amount of pressure right 
now to perform and were trying to convince them that some of the 
shows they have this one included can do the job for them said 
cannell in a telephone interview from his los angeles office which 
he said was stacked with almost 2000 pieces of mail 
ive never had a show that drew mail like this one and it 
isnt stuff written in crayola said cannell who has produced 
and written such hits as the rockford files and the ateam 
cannell is sending the letters to cbs entertainment president 
kim lemasters and appealing to viewers to write lemasters directly 
kim and all the people at cbs really love the show so its 
not a matter of them saying we dont see it said cannell 
theyre sort of scratching their heads too and saying how can 
we make this thing happen i just want to make sure wiseguy 
doesnt fall through the cracks as management screening starts 
wiseguy is among the best dramas on network television and 
one of cbs best shows but in its premiere season it got low 
ratings because of continuing plotlines but especially because of 
time slots 
it started out thursday nights opposite nbcs toprated comedy 
lineup then moved to monday nights where it was frequently up 
against miniseries and movies on the two other networks or 
preempted by miniseries on cbs 
the premise of the show is daring ken wahl stars as vinnie 
terranova a government agent who goes deep undercover into crime 
organizations such investigations take years in real life on 
wiseguy they take several weeks an eternity on network 
television where viewers are likely to be put off by a continuing 
storyline figuring if they missed the first few episodes they 
wont be able to catch up 
cannell would solve that problem next season by bringing viewers 
up to date before each episode 
this season the first eight episodes featured ray sharkey as 
new jersey crime boss sonny steelgrave a villain so likable vinnie 
flirted occasionally with crossing the line between cop and

fred silvermans famed golden gut 
instinct as a television programmer still seems to be in working 
order 
silverman former network wunderkind now an independent 
producer got cbs to move his faltering series jake and the 
fatman to wednesdays in the most recent ratings period the show 
had jumped to 21st place up from 43rd the week before 
the show also won the time period beating nbcs a year in the 
life and abcs hooperman and just in time 
if you have a show with inherent strength its to everyones 
advantage to try to save it silverman said in an interview 
the time period can be as important as the show itself jake 
and the fatman had been on on tuesdays where it was up against 
abcs moonlighting and later nbcs hunter it was tough 
competition and we had no leadin to speak of 
the leadin for hunter is another silverman show 
matlock and if jake stayed on tuesday nights its 
competition would be a third silverman series in the heat of the 
night on nbc 
silverman was head of programming at cbs when it was no 1 in 
the ratings in the 1970s he moved to abc as entertainment 
president in 1975 and abc was soon the ratings winner for the 
first time the golden gut tag came from his acknowledged 
decisionmaking on gut reaction 
in 1978 he became president of nbc but in three years was 
unable to budge the network out of third place 
after silverman left nbc he started his own production company 
besides the three network series his company also produces the 
highly successful perry mason movies for nbc he also plans to 
bring back burkes law the 196366 abc series starring gene 
barry as a series of tv movies he is working on a movie series 
for home box office about a former cop who becomes a lawyer a role 
he says would be good for charles bronson 
my area of greatest expertise at the networks was the 
halfhour comedies said silverman i want to get into 
comedies most of the shows in syndication are comedies that i 
developed at the networks 
in jake and the fatman william conrad stars as jl 
fatman mccabe a tough district attorney joe penny is jake 
styles his smooth and mysterious special investigator the show 
made its debut last september 
my feeling is that when you change a show to a new day and 
time it takes about a month to settle in said silverman the 
history of television has shown that sometimes you can save a 
failing show by moving it to a new time period its more than just 
wishful thinking bonanza was on saturday against perry mason 
its first two years it barely survived but rca wanted to keep it 
on because it was in color and was helping to sell color sets 
then nbc moved it to sunday nights at 9 oclock after that it 
was in first place or near first for the next 10 years the dick 
van dyke show floundered its first year on tuesdays it was a 
procter amp gamble show and they insisted it get a shot in another 
time period it became a hit on wednesdays 
all in the family mash hawaii five0 and 
cannon were also shows that benefited by a time change 
all in the family started on tuesday nights between hee 
haw and the cbs news hour said silverman i dont think 
anybody had any great faith in it but we were having trouble with 
a show on saturday night and moved all in the family it just 
exploded 
mash just died on sunday night then it was moved to 
saturday behind all in the family it became second in the 
ratings hawaii five0 didnt do well until cbs switched it with 
the jonathan winters show cannon started at 930 pm tuesday 
where it was up against the abc movie and marcus welby md the 
next year we moved it to wednesday and it became a hit

actor peter ustinov whose roles have ranged from 
babar the elephant to romes mad emperor nero is now playing 
beethovens ghost before packed houses in west berlin 
the play beethovens tenth was written by ustinov and has 
been performed in the united states and in britain however its 
west berlin debut at the schiller theater marks the first time 
ustinov has delivered his lines in german 
ustinov who turned 67 on april 16 admits that speaking german 
is his biggest challenge in the performance 
for me every night at the schiller is a premiere he said 
in a recent interview german is a difficult language it forces 
me to attempt linguistic acrobatics with my mouth that im not used 
too im constantly in danger of getting stuck 
for the interview ustinov made his remarks in nearly fluent but 
cautiously enunciated german 
the play opened in west berlin in january and has been sold out 
ever since more than 40000 people are expected to see the 
production before its scheduled april 30 closing gisela huwe a 
theater spokeswoman said 
beethovens tenth is one of the greatest successes in the 
40year history of the schiller huwe said of the twoact play 
written by ustinov 
much of the plays action concentrates on efforts by a fictional 
london music critic named stephen winter to imagine how beethovens 
10th symphony might have sounded it also focuses on his often 
stormy relations with his son pascal who composes modern 
symphonies which winter has no use for 
a viennese aupair girl named irmgard who loves beethoven and 
pascal manages to wake the composer from the dead the composer 
rings the doorbell and strides with long hair flowing across the 
stage 
with the help of a hearing aid provided by the family doctor 
the old deaf master is able to hear his symphonies for the first 
time 
ludwig van beethovens last completed symphony is his ninth 
the choral music researchers however say they have discovered 
sketches for an unfinished symphony possibly a 10th dated after 
completion of his ninth symphony and before his death in 1827 
in ustinovs play the audience never learns how the 10th 
symphony really sounded but the resurrected genius helps bring the 
feuding winter family closer together 
critics say ustinovs often deliberate german delivery adds to 
the performance increasing audience empathy to the character of 
beethoven who makes a grumpy visit to the 20th century in a 
rumpled coat and wig after 160 years in the grave 
ustinov said he especially enjoys playing on the west berlin 
stage 
the actor is in direct contact with the audience here he 
said the people are very warmhearted 
ustinov is internationally known for his versatility as a stage 
and screen actor and in recent years has become best known for his 
portrayal of agatha christies belgian sleuth hercule poirot 
he has written several other plays a collection of short 
stories and a novel 
in film he gained prominence for his portrayal of nero in 
mervyn le roys 1951 hollywood epic quo vadis he is also 
known as the voice of babar the elephant a popular childrens book 
character created by the late french author jean de brunhoff

there once was a time when people could sit 
in the bar of the old hotel del prado and enjoy looking at diego 
riveras mural dream of a sunday afternoon in alameda park 
the once elegant hotel is now an earthquakedamaged hulk waiting 
to be demolished and the mural is in its own museum pavilion 
across the street 
the delicate transfer of the mural has been completed it 
escaped damage in the sept 19 1985 earthquake that killed 
thousands and devastated large parts of the city 
the famous mural is open to the public again like a window 
opened on mexicos rich history it shows figures from the mexican 
political and art worlds and from daily life all on parade in the 
park 
an explanation at the entrance to the new museum says the 
decision was made to transfer the mural from the hotel after the 
extent of the damage there became clear 
it should be linked to the alameda for having been painted on 
that theme and for the place itself the plaque from the national 
fine arts institute says 
the alameda the downtown park across the street and down a 
block from the murals old home also was expanded through 
earthquake reconstruction programs a solidarity garden 
recalling the victims of the 1985 disaster was built on the site of 
the cleared adjoining block that once held a department store and 
the hotel regis 
the murals pavilion is built on the site of the hotels parking 
garage which was badly damaged and demolished after the quake 
the fine arts institute said that no room could be found in any 
of its buildings close to the alameda because of the colossal 
dimensions of the work thats why it was decided to take 
advantage of the possibility of constructing an appropriate 
building 
in place of the old hotels comfortable cocktail lounge viewers 
now can sit on three simple benches placed in front of the mural or 
just stand for a while in the large but sparsely decorated room 
diagrams with keyed numbers on the outline of each figure tell 
who 73 of the people shown in the mural are 
among the figures is a fat boy with large eyes and a round face 
a selfportrait something rivera often put in his works 
in the foreground is spanish conqueror hernando cortes on a 
park bench an elderly man dreams of president antonio lopez de 
santa anna giving american gen william scott the keys to texas 
new mexico arizona california nevada and other lands that once 
belonged to mexico 
farther back a former military man now poor dreams of the 
emperors maximilian and carlota a drunken tramp next to an old 
woman dreams with his mouth open of miltiary glories at the side 
of benito juarez who holds the reform laws he put into effect as 
mexicos great 19th century president 
near the center is dictator porfirio diaz and his wife carmen 
romero rubio diaz appears full of his fame and power with a chest 
full of ribbons on his uniform 
at the right a street vendor offers typical mexican food to a 
middleclass youth and three students who dream of gen victoriano 
huerta official history says huerta had francisco i madero who 
started the 191021 mexican revolution killed 
rivera completed the 49 foot by 13 foot painting for the then 
fashionable del prado in 1948 
along with david alfaro siqueiros and jose clemente orozco 
rivera was one of mexicos three great muralists and one of the 
most important latin american painters in the art world he died in 
1957 
among his other best known murals are those in the national 
palace of the spanish conquest the mexican revolution and other 
events from the countrys history 
the composition is memories of my life of my childhood and my 
youth from 1895 to 1910 rivera wrote after finishing the mural 
i do not believe that this work has alarmed or can alarm anyone 
the contemporary figures in the fresco as figures in dreams are 
not portraits 
it was an apparent reference to the phrase god does not 
exist a quote attributed to juarez adviser ignacio ramirez and 
written on a piece of paper by ramirez in the mural 
eight years after the mural was completed rivera changed the 
paper to read conference in the academy of letran the year 
1836 the phrase refers to the date and place where ramirez made 
his controversial comment

many analysts who are still skittish about the 
investment outlook these days point to the uninspired behavior 
lately of utility stocks 
last week while the dow jones average of 30 industrials briefly 
touched a new high since the october crash dow joness average of 
15 utilities lagged behind 
when it dipped below 170 late last week the utility average 
stood more than 10 percent below where it was on jan 29 
the performance of utility stocks as a group is a good gauge 
of the interestrate environment said anthony sorrentino an 
analyst at standard amp poors corp in the firms weekly advisory 
publication the outlook 
it is also he added often a leading indicator of stock 
prices in general 
utility stocks tend to respond quickly to changing expectations 
about the interestrate outlook for a couple of wellknown reasons 
for one thing since utilities are heavy borrowers to finance 
their capital needs interest rates are an important element of 
their costs of doing business 
besides that most investors in utility stocks are very 
yieldconscious and thus tend to push the stocks prices up and 
down in close alignment with fluctuations in the bond market 
in the great bull market the dow jones utility average was the 
first of the widely recognized indicators to peak out at 22783 on 
jan 22 1987 
any investors who used that as a sell signal missed out on 
the dramatic gains in industrial stock prices that continued 
through august of last year 
but they also would have been safely out of the way when 
interest rates surged upward last spring and when stock prices 
crashed in the fall 
the recent weakness in utilities sorrentino says is reason 
for concern as it suggests that investors believe interest rates 
are headed higher 
of course interestrate expectations can change sometimes very 
quickly the merrill lynch market letter maintains that utility 
stocks generally appear to be oversold we think they could do 
better in the months ahead 
even if utilities do not come on strong argues greg smith an 
analyst at prudentialbache securities they are not an infallible 
guide to what the rest of the market might do 
utilities fell in 1977 he points out and then industrial 
stocks rose for the next three years 
the poor performance of the utility averages signals bad 
problems for the overall stock market to many investors especially 
since the divergence developed prior to the crash of last year 
he said 
theyre waiting for another shoe to fall i think its a 
mistake to look for a matching shoe 
to mix metaphors a little i would point out that the same 
lightning rarely strikes the stock market twice in a row 
in smiths view the markets early1988 rally drew its force 
not from value considerations based on such things as interest 
rates but rather from strong corporate earnings 
utilities wont work but not because another crisis is in the 
making he said they wont work because this isnt a 
valuationdriven market anymore 
the bottom in interest rates is very well established now as 
a result the industrial averages the utility averages and 
interest rates are no longer going to move together 
this is a more advanced stage of the stock market cycle and i 
dont know of any reliable tool to predict its duration

jesse jackson would freeze pentagon spending 
and raise taxes on the rich michael dukakis would shoot down the 
midgetman missile and hire more tax collectors albert gore jr 
would consider a tax on luxuries but supports some weapons his 
rivals oppose 
the budget and defense policy are not the only areas in which 
the three surviving challengers for the democratic presidential 
nomination differ among the others abortion education taxes and 
the middle east 
the middle east particularly has been a topic of considerable 
concern as the candidates head into tuesdays new york primary in 
1984 jews cast 23 percent of the votes in that contest 
jackson the civil rights activist has taken the most 
consistently liberal stands on foreign and domestic issues and has 
offered more specifics on how he would grapple with the federal 
budget deficit 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts also has embraced many 
liberal social ideas including universal health insurance but has 
suggested that taxpayer costs can be minimized by forging 
partnerships with the private sector 
gore has staked out the more conservative stances on military 
and foreign policy issues and has been the most outspoken 
supporter of israel and opponent of a palestinian state he has 
gained expertise on arms control during 12 years in congress where 
he has compiled a liberal voting record on labor environment and 
health issues 
here is a look at where the democrats stand on key issues 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
jackson would make the wealthiest 600000 taxpayers pay at a 
rate of 385 percent instead of the current top of 28 to 33 
percent he also would boost corporate taxes back to 1970s levels 
dukakis says no serious candidate for president can rule out 
the possibility of new taxes but he says the first step is to 
hire more internal revenue service agents and collect every 
dollar we can of that 110 billion thats not being paid today 
gore has favored a top marginal tax rate of 33 percent for those 
making more than 200000 a year if we are driven as a last 
resort to new taxes i will fight to ensure that we turn first to 
those who can afford it says gore who has suggested raising 
nearly 1 billion with a 5 percent tax on luxury items 10 billion 
by keeping corporate taxes at their current level and 5 billion by 
taxing the sale of inherited stocks on the basis of their original 
value 
jackson supports an oil import fee gore has not ruled one out 
dukakis is a vociferous opponent of such a tariff 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
jackson claims he could reduce the deficit by 100 billion 
annually by 1993 by freezing pentagon spending for five years and 
by his tax increases on the wealthy but he has also proposed major 
increases in social spending 
dukakis would scale back star wars research and save 50 billion 
by scrapping the midgetman missile he says he would trim federal 
programs and squeeze out waste but cautions were not going to 
get major cuts out of the domestic side of the budget its been 
savaged over the past seven years 
gore says he would convene a summit of our nations leaders on 
economics to forge a national consensus on how best to tackle our 
budget deficit he proposed eliminating subsidies for junk mail 
cutting corporate farm subsidies and eliminating the 40 billion 
of unnecessary medical diagnostics that the government pays for 
each year 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
all three candidates oppose the strategic defense initiative 
dukakis and gore would scale back basic research in the field to 
prestar wars levels 
jackson proposes saving 40 billion by not building two new 
aircraft carrier task forces and tens of billions of dollars 
by negotiating further arms reductions with the soviets he opposes 
building the midgetman missile the stealth bomber the trident d5 
missile or any more mx missiles 
dukakis opposes the midgetman he contends that until the united 
states and soviets can agree on reducing conventional forces 
savings on strategic weapons must be invested in strengthening us 
nonnuclear forces 
gore is a stalwart supporter of the singlewarhead midgetman 
missile and helped win congressional approval for it in exchange 
for limiting production of the multiwarhead mx missile to 50 
like his rivals gore opposed military aid to the contras but 
has voted in the past for humanitarian aid for the nicaraguan 
rebels gore fought reagan administration efforts to revive the b1 
bomber then voted to limit production to 100

gore does not support creation of a palestinian state dukakis 
has refused to rule it out jackson supports an independent 
homeland for palestians all three say the arab nations must 
recognize israels right to exist 
jackson who once met with palestinian liberation organization 
leader yasser arafat now says he would not do it again but he 
calls current us policy fatally flawed and favors an 
international conference on the middle east involving all the 
parties concerned including the chosen representatives of the 
palestinian people 
dukakis has said arab leaders refusal to negotiate with israel 
is to blame for the current palestinian strife he says israel 
should not be forced to relinquish all the land won in the 1967 war 
gore refused to join 30 senate colleagues in sending a letter of 
protest to the israel government on its handling of the unrest 
dukakis has said he would have signed the letter

jackson promises a national health care program covering all 
americans no matter what their income it would cover nursing 
home costs and be funded by earmarked health taxes and general 
revenues 
dukakis has promised to make universal health insurance a basic 
right but proposes to do it without creating a big new 
bureaucratic program or spending a dime by requiring most 
employers to offer health insurance as a fringe benefit 
massachusetts has just become the first state to move in that 
direction and similar legislation is already pending in congress 
the massachusetts plan which exempts firms with five or fewer 
employees will cost that state 550 million or more through 1992 
gore has been instrumental in legislation creating an organ 
transplant network and tougher regulation of companies that make 
infant formula he says we must provide compassionate 
affordable health care so that hospital costs are not driven to 
unbearable levels by the need to care for individuals who cannot 
pay

six months after the stock market crash of 1987 
a sense of shock and confusion still pervades wall street 
although stock prices have recovered some of their losses of 
black monday oct 19 the crash weighs heavily on just about any 
financial decision or economic forecast these days 
despite the economys resilience the 500 billion collapse has 
severely dampened the enthusiasm of both professional money 
managers and the american public for stock investments 
and its aftershocks remain very much in evidence as they were 
thursday when the dow jones industrial average dropped 10146 
points in response to a government report showing an unexpected 
widening of the nations trade deficit 
trading volume in all the major stock markets so far in 1988 is 
running behind the pace it set a year ago through early april 
volume was down 41 percent at the new york stock stock exchange 
and 167 percent in the overthecounter market 
the nyse decline would be much bigger were it not for heavy 
trading in stocks of companies targeted for takeovers and 
highyielding issues with impending dividend payments 
veteran observers caution that it will take still more time to 
assess the crashs ultimate effects even with the advantage of 
hindsight it is clear that the crash was many different things to 
many different people 
at one extreme some analysts will tell you black monday was 
just the first stage of a severe bear market that will usher in a 
recession or worse in the nations economy 
at the other some insist it was nothing more than an 
exaggerated correction that drove excessive enthusiasm out of 
the marketplace setting the stage for new rallies in stock prices 
and helping to prevent a recession that might otherwise be in 
progress today 
while there isnt yet and may never be a widely accepted 
consensus on what precisely caused the crash a good many analysts 
have come to agree that it stemmed in large measure from a change 
in the credit policies of the federal reserve and central banks of 
other prominent industrialized countries 
in this view these powerful institutions created a financial 
boom in the mid1980s by fostering the growth of a vast pool of 
liquidity or money looking for a place to go to work 
starting in early 1987 they began to shut off the flow 
prompted by fears of inflation and a long decline in the value of 
the dollar against leading foreign currencies 
economist albert wojnilower a managing director at the wall 
street firm of first boston corp said in a recent appraisal 
as 1987 wore on it became more and more evident so that 
ultimately even the stock markets had to accept the fact that 
us monetary policy was on a course leading to an eventual 
recession 
that recession didnt arrive on schedule wojnilower added 
because restrictive monetary policies were immediately abandoned in 
the aftermath of the crash 
he says a business slump is still in the offing probably in 
1989 but it need not be severe the end of the world is not at 
hand 
with all the studies investigations and reports by blueribbon 
panels that have been done since the crash major steps to reform 
and fortify the markets have come slowly or not at all 
the presidential commission headed by nicholas f brady of 
dillon read amp co promoted the idea that the nations financial 
markets the stock market and the futures market where contracts 
on stock indexes are traded could be set up and managed as one 
market 
the brady plan called for coordinating the regulation of the 
markets and installing circuit breakers that would prevent a 
crisis from erupting in one market and spreading to the other 
those who blame computerdriven program trading for contributing 
to the october debacle point out that such techniques are triggered 
by discrepancies in the prices of stock index futures and the 
underlying equities but the two markets have long operated under 
significantly different rules and have resisted regulatory changes 
that might threaten their franchises 
bradys superregulatory proposal has been bogged down by 
haggling over who would be the super regulator although the brady 
panel favored the federal reserve the central bank appears 
reluctant to take on the job 
the securities and exchange commission is more willing to fill 
the void but regulators of the futures markets have resisted the 
idea of turning over a measure of their authority to the sec 
to help sort out the competing interests the white house has 
appointed yet another committee comprised of representatives of 
the various regulatory agencies which is expected to report still 
more recommendations later this spring 
the new york stock exchange has adopted one notable new rule a 
constraint known as a collar that bars use of its main 
orderprocessing system for one method of program trading should 
the dow jones industrial average rise or fall on any given day by 
as much as 50 points 
in addition the nyse has announced a sharp increase in the 
amount of capital that must be held by its specialists the brokers 
who act as meeting points for buy and sell orders on the trading 
floor 
separately the national association of securities dealers has 
moved to try to strengthen the overthecounter market for unlisted 
stocks which it oversees 
by summer nasd procedures are scheduled to be in effect to 
decrease the markets dependency on voice communication by 
telephone and to punish dealers who back away from fastmoving 
markets without a specialcase excuse 
the aim of such measures is to increase the markets strength 
and accessibility in times of stress so that the machinery doesnt 
break down altogether and turn an already bad situation into a 
disaster 
still many regulators and securities industry officials say it 
would be pointless and quite possibly dangerous to attempt to 
legislate away the threat of any future crashes 
if the fed were standing by with its enormous resources as a 
buyer of last resort in times of crisis presumably the stock 
market would be less susceptible if not immune to panics but 
something like that would also cost the market what joseph 
hardiman president of the nasd calls the discipline of risk 
if investors believed they could rely indefinitely on an 
institution like the fed to support the market they might well go 
on a speculative binge that would create stresses not even the fed 
could deal with 
under this line of reasoning the quickest way to set the stage 
for the next market crash would be to create a system to assure 
everybody that it could never happen again

in what was billed as the series ender 
magnum pi concluded last season with our hero getting gunned 
down and walking off into an ethereal landscape that looked 
suspiciously like heaven 
but star tom selleck agreed to do 13 more episodes and magnums 
walk through the clouds was explained as an outofbody experience 
on sunday magnum ends its eightyear run on cbs with a 
special twohour episode this time there will be no catch no 
reincarnation no next season 
after this episode the audience would have a very hard time 
figuring out how we could ever do a reunion show said selleck on 
a break in filming theres a finality to this show we wanted to 
do something that would threaten the franchise 
chas floyd johnson the shows coexecutive producer wouldnt 
give away the ending but did say the finale will answer some 
questions 
it will touch on the issue of whether jonathan is really robin 
masters it will deal with every one of the characters in at least 
looking at what their lives will be like after magnum he said 
selleck plays thomas magnum a former naval intelligence officer 
turned private eye perpetually on the brink of poverty but living 
in high style thanks to the largesse of neverseen wealthy mystery 
writer robin masters 
john hillerman plays jonathan quayle higgins the british major 
domo who runs masters estate and antagonizes magnum even as he 
comes to his aid larry manetti and roger e mosley are magnums 
vietnam buddies rick and tc 
set against the exotic backdrop of the islands magnum pi 
plots ran from silly to deadly serious the show made selleck an 
international star 
in its early years the cbs series consistently landed in the 
top 10 of the nielsen ratings but in 1984 it was scheduled 
against nbcs the cosby show and its ratings sagged after some 
juggling by cbs magnum moved to wednesday night and regained 
much of its audience 
its important to me that we go out while people still want 
us selleck said this show is too special to me to let it die 
a natural death no matter what the rest of my films did or even 
the success of three men and a baby it all came to me by way of 
this show and ive always tried to take care of magnum 
three men and a baby marked sellecks first major screen 
success after several starring roles 
sellecks reputation as an actor was initially overshadowed by 
his image as a pinup but he eventually won an emmy award as best 
actor in a dramatic series working in hawaii he said protected 
him from the buffeting of sudden fame 
ive been lucky over here ive been sheltered from a lot of 
the stuff tht goes on on the mainland selleck said its great 
to be chosen favorite this or that but a whole lot of baggage goes 
with all those titles and then what happens when youre not at the 
top of the opinion polls thats why even though i appreciate it 
i try not to buy into that stuff and being in hawaii has just made 
that easier plus i love it here 
he said he will maintain his ties to the islands he has formed 
a production company with johnson and magnum supervising 
producer chris abbott and hopes to produce a new series here 
though without selleck as star 
sellecks dual role of producing and starring in magnum the 
past two years resulting in an unnatural existence he said 
it just takes up too large a part of my life which is all my 
waking hours and in the long run i just dont think thats very 
healthy physically or emotionally said selleck who last year 
married actress jillie mack 
he planned to begin working in july on her alibi a romantic 
comedy directed by bruce beresford until then he said hell 
relax 
i asked for the time off because i just dont know how im 
gonna feel after magnum ends selleck said i think i really 
need to take the time off to just see what happens thats why i 
really have very few kinds of goals or direction right now 
saying goodbye wont be easy selleck said 
theres a huge part of me that would love magnum to go on 
forever he said i really do believe that itll be about the 
best job ill ever have

stock market tumbled after the commerce department reported a 
widening trade deficit in february 
others said the market was driven partly by rumors that the

with the backing of its own shareholders 
secured bank of new york co now turns its full attention to 
convincing irving bank corp stockowners that its hostile 1 
billionplus takeover bid is a good deal 
chairman j carter bacot said he had met privately with some of 
irvings biggest stockholders and that bank officials would 
continue soliciting others via telephone and mail until irvings 
annual meeting next thursday 
its a unique fit bacot told bank of new york shareholders 
at their yearly gathering thursday virtually all their 
businesses blend well into ours we believe no other merger could 
make as much sense 
bank of new york is offering 15 in cash and 1575 of its common 
shares for each of irvings roughly 181 million common shares 
outstanding a proposal irving has rejected as inadequate during 
their extended and bitter takeover fight 
at bank of new yorks annual meeting bacot said preliminary 
tabulations showed shareholders solidly backed the company by 
granting it permission to issue as many additional common shares 
and convertible securities as needed to complete the irving 
acquisition 
the exact result of the vote on the stock question is to be 
released april 22 
bank of new york which holds a 49 percent stake in irving is 
seeking to gain control of that companys board of directors and 
has nominated a slate of 16 nominees 
analysts said they could not predict whether bank of new york 
could succeed 
i cant take bets on that one though im sure bank of new 
york is feeling very bullish following thursdays meeting said 
rosemarie conforte a banking analyst with moodys investors 
service 
i think thats a very close call said stephen berman a 
banking analyst with county securities usa i think they irving 
shareholders may be persuaded but its a coin flip almost 
many analysts agree that a combination of the two would not be 
such a bad idea because both new york banks operate in a similar 
marketplace and offer similar services such as securities 
processing 
but irving repeatedly has spurned the companys takeover offers 
which began about seven months ago maintaining it wants to remain 
independent 
irving representatives had urged bank of new york shareholders 
thursday to ask management to abandon all efforts to merge the two 
banks irving argued that combining the two would dilute the value 
of bank of new york stock hurting earnings and dividends 
we are convinced that the cost of integrating the two 
companies would create a further drain on earnings and that any 
benefits of combining the two firms would not be recognized for 
three to five years said robert a falise an executive vice 
president for legal affairs at irving 
but bacot maintained dilution was not a problem he also said a 
takeover would not reduce bank of new yorks dividends which have 
increased annually for the past 11 years 
bank of new york began its current tender offer last month after 
receiving regulatory approval 
both the federal reserve board and the new york state banking 
board said a merger wouldnt hurt competition in the nations 
biggest financial center irving has asked the federal courts to 
overturn the feds decision 
irving has taken a number of other steps to tryto defeat bank of 
new yorks advances including instituting an antitakeover 
poison pill defense that is designed to make any hostile buyout 
prohibitively expensive 
hostile takeover efforts are rare in the banking industry a 
merger between new york bank and irving would create one of the 
nations 15 largest bank holding companies with combined assets of 
more than 40 billion 
bank of new york began its takeover efforts six months ago with 
an offer of 14 billion or 80 in cash and securities it revised 
the offer to 68 in cash and securities following octobers stock 
market crash and lowered the bid a second time in late january

investors remain cautious about the nations 
economic outlook today after a report of a rising us trade gap 
knocked them for a loop and sparked a 100 billion selloff on wall 
street 
the commerce departments report thursday that the trade deficit 
rose to 138 billion in february sparked a 10146point decline to 
200564 in the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
in foreign exchange the dollar fell about 2 percent against the 
japanese yen and west german mark despite central bank purchases 
aimed at bolstering the dollar and bond market interest rates rose 
to their highest levels since january 
the trade report raised concerns that the dollar would remain 
under pressure despite a monthsold agreement by major 
industrialized nations to support it that agreement was reaffirmed 
wednesday by the united states japan west germany britain 
france canada and italy at a meeting in washington 
investors worried that the federal reserve might try to support 
the falling currency by pushing interest rates higher 
on wall street declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones 
nearly 11 to 1 in the worst day since the widelyfollowed dow jones 
average fell 14058 points on jan 8 
the dow industrials had climbed nearly 130 points from april 5 
through tuesday largely on anticipation that februarys trade news 
would be favorable 
the value of us stocks fell by 997 billion in thursdays 
plunge according to a 5000stock index measured by wilshire 
associates of santa monica calif 
in the bond market the yield on the treasury departments 
benchmark 30year treasury bond jumped to roughly 886 percent 
thursday the highest since january from 873 percent late 
wednesday 
the trade report also battered major foreign markets in london 
the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index fell 13 percent 
on thursday 
in tokyo stocks fell sharply at todays opening but later 
recovered much of their losses the key nikkei stock average of 225 
issues down more than 250 points at one time finished the morning 
session at 2696783 down 14352 from thursdays record close 
the dollar opened a sharp 17 percent lower against the japanese 
yen in tokyo but later stabilized on reports of heavy dollarbuying 
by the bank of japan 
some economists called the markets fears an overreaction 
the quality precision of the numbers obviously leaves 
something to be desired said raymond worseck economist at ag 
edwards amp sons inc in st louis 
the trade report indicated consumers were continuing to spend 
strongly sucking up imports worseck said 
the trade deficit was the highest since the record gap of 176 
billion in october it was up from januarys 124 billion gap but 
was down from a deficit of 144 billion in february 1987 
its just one of those glitches that keep the financial 
markets interesting the trend is still for improvement in the 
trade deficit said james solloway director of economic research

rebuilding confidence in the stock market after 
the crash last october is proving to be an elusive and 
timeconsuming mission 
the markets latest bid to rally collapsed on thursday when the 
dow jones average of 30 industrials the best known measure of 
market trends fell 10146 points to 200564 for its 
fifthlargest loss ever 
from april 5 through tuesday of this week the dow industrials 
had climbed nearly 130 points largely on anticipation of a 
continuing flow of favorable news on the nations trade balance and 
the outlook for the dollar in foreign exchange 
but the word from the commerce department on thursday morning 
was that the trade deficit widened in february with imports 
exceeding exports by 1383 against 1244 billion the month before 
in effect that wiped out with a single stroke the basic premise 
behind the recent rally 
stock market analysts said persistent strength in imports in 
particular raised fears that the federal reserve soon might feel 
the need to tighten credit to restrain the economy as well as to 
support the dollar 
you got a nasty bit of news said larry wachtel at 
prudentialbache securities the market is saying that the 
economy is too strong 
wachtel also said the withdrawal from the market since last fall 
of many investors frightened away by the crash had left stocks in a 
fragile position vulnerable to volatile swings 
its really a daytraders market he said when we were 
rallying there wasnt a lot of volume 
and when the market started to come down there were no 
buffers on the downside no small investors no pension managers 
no foreign investors 
that leaves wall street in a paradoxical plight investors large 
and small seem inclined to stay clear of the stock market until it 
shows signs of greater stability 
but it looks as though those investors presence may be needed 
if that stability is going to be attained 
in the meantime market analysts and professional money managers 
still are groping for some indication of where the market ought to 
settle out and of what level of stock prices makes sense in 
the aftermath of the crash 
as jay donnaruma an analyst at first albany corp in albany 
ny put it in his latest market commentary in the current 
environment all the normal road signs that usually provide one 
with direction appear to have been stolen by vandals

the first major test of wall streets 
computerized trading collar in braking a big fall in stock 
prices is getting mixed reviews with some calling the limit 
helpful and others saying it may have worsened the drop 
the collar has got some holes in it leigh stevens a 
painewebber inc strategist said thursday after the dow jones 
average tumbled 10146 points its fifthworst daily decline ever 
the slide represented more than double the 50point swing 
necessary to activate the collar which when triggered bans the use 
of new york stock exchange computers for socalled index arbitrage 
program trading for the rest of the day 
the drop marked the first time since the nyse imposed the 
restriction on feb 4 that a decline activated the 50point 
trigger the collar took effect once before on april 6 when the 
average rose 6416 points 
at the present time its not working peter j dapuzzo 
head of retail equities at shearson lehman hutton inc said as 
selling swept the market even once the collar took effect at about 
155 pm edt 
the limit is part of an nyse effort to restore stability to a 
market still suffering aftereffects of the epic crash nearly six 
months ago some crash studies have suggested program trading 
aggravated the october plunge and the big board has expressed 
concern that the practice is undermining investor and regulator 
confidence 
its really premature to assess whether the collar works 
said nyse spokeswoman sharon gamsin it wasnt designed to stop 
the dow average from moving we only have evidence of two days 
when we get more data well analyze it if its necessary to take 
further action we might 
some traders said they believed the collar lessened the impact 
of what would have been a heavy selloff under any circumstances 
investors rushed to dump stocks largely because of economic worries 
linked to the governments report of a widerthanexpected trade 
deficit for february 
but others said the braking effects of the collar were 
overwhelmed by big brokerage houses that executed sell orders 
manually or used forms of program trading not covered by the 
restraint a few traders said they believed the collar actually 
worsened the drop because it only left sellers in the market 
once this thing goes below 50 nobody shows up to do any 
buying said joseph barthel a technical strategist at butcher amp 
singer inc 
in index arbitrage brokers use computers to buy or sell massive 
amounts of stocks in new york and the equivalent stockindex 
futures in chicago in order to profit from price disparities 
although many brokerages have applauded the nyses limit on the 
technique others have been critical because they say it severs an 
important relationship between the stock and futures markets 
studies of the stock crash have concluded the relationship 
between financial markets was an important element in the october 
crash a presidential panels crash study for example suggested 
that a system of circuit breakers applying simultaneously to 
all markets trading stocks or stockindex futures would help 
prevent another crisis 
i have a couple of problems with the whole collar concept 
said howard schneider a futuresmarket expert and securities 
lawyer who is critical of the nyses postcrash strategy 
clearly you cant disconnect the stock exchange from the 
futures market theyre all one big ball of wax schneider said 
if you have only the stock exchange with a circuit breaker it 
doesnt do a damn thing

a new kind of corn bread that combines 
downhome color and flavor with a firmness that stands up to 
slicing could help shrink the nations corn surplus if it goes over 
well with consumers government researchers say 
this is not oldfashioned corn bread that crumbles into the ham 
and beans this firm new loaf made from flour thats half wheat 
and half finely ground corn can be sliced buttered toasted and 
used for sandwiches 
it gives people a new bread product and it could enable 
farmers to sell more of their corn at a higher price said us 
department of agriculture food technologist kathleen warner 
the bread was developed at the usda laboratory in peoria warner 
said the goal was to develop a bread that used as much corn flour 
as possible so it would make a big impact on using up surplus 
corn supplies 
as it turned out the ideal flour formulation was half corn and 
half wheat with extra wheat gluten to improve its structure the 
dough is leavened with yeast 
traditional corn bread is made mainly from coarser cornmeal and 
baking powder 
warner said the new corn bread resembles a homebaked or 
specialty bakery loaf rather than typical supermarket sandwich 
bread but she said wholesale bakers could modify the formula to 
make it lighter and fluffier if that is the kind of loaf their 
customers want 
the next step is to encourage industry to try this and find a 
market for it warner said 
the 16 billionayear wholesale bread and cakebaking industry 
uses about 100 million pounds of flour annually according to 
gordon davidson editor of the milling and baking news 
i cant even predict what consumer interest would be for the 
new corn bread said william hoover president of the american 
institute of baking i like corn bread so if it has that flavor 
it might appeal to some of the public 
hoover noted that sales of a new product usually reflect the 
amount of money spent on marketing and advertising bakers would 
have to believe the new corn bread is delightfully good tasting 
to make a major investment in promoting it he said 
during the 1970s purity baking co of decatur marketed a 
product called country corn bread using a smaller percentage of 
corn flour president chuck webb said that version had a rich 
golden color and because corn flour holds moisture well it also 
stayed fresh longer 
it is just one of those items that was very successful at the 
time but tastes change and it eventually was replaced said webb 
people today are searching for new varieties and this could 
be a good time to offer a new kind of corn bread he said 
a popular new corn bread also could help the nations dry 
millers who use about 2 percent of the us corn crop said betsy 
faga president of the american corn millers federation 
the industry certainly is looking for new uses for dry milled 
corn every possible outlet said faga this certainly could 
be a new one for them

societe generale de belgique sa 
shareholders have dealt carlo de benedetti a setback in his 
attempted takeover of the giant holding company but the italian 
financier still wields some clout over the enterprise 
at a 12hour special shareholders meeting on thursday 
shareholders spurned the bid by de benedetti and two allies to win 
seats on the societe generale board of directors the trio got 
votes from only 445 percent of the shares registered and needed 
51 percent to win election to the board 
but because he commands a huge block of shares de benedetti 
retains much clout within the company and may win yet a board seat 
todays votes will not be for the long term de benedetti 
told the more than 1150 shareholders before the vote which was 
taken at a meeting held in a tent next to societe generales head 
office 
in one week one month six months or one year we will play a 
major role in societe generale without meno stable management 
of societe generale is possible 
management of societe generale belgiums biggest holding 
company was relieved after the marathon meeting 
we fought it out there was a winner and a loser said 
director etienne davignon 
shareholders added 12 members all rivals of de benedetti to 
the board of directors with a majority of 55 percent of the vote 
the previous board had 11 directors 
right up through the start of the meeting de benedetti had met 
with his rivals to seek a compromise but the talks failed when de 
benedetti continued insisting on control over daytoday management 
of the venerable 166yearold societe generale which has stakes 
in some 1300 companies worldwide 
de benedetti who sparked the heated takeover battle for societe 
generale three months ago had sought election along with two 
allies including andre leysen chairman of belgiums gevaert nv 
societe generale nominated the remaining 12 candidates allies 
of frances cie financiere de suez and groupe ag the two 
companies heading an alliance of smaller belgian french 
luxembourg and swiss interests led the fight against de benedetti 
the vote indicated how many shares each faction controls 
under belgian law shareholders are not required to disclose the 
amount of their holdings leaving only speculation over which group 
holds a majority 
de benedetti who spent some 17 billion to raise his societe 
generale holdings claims he and his allies control 48 percent of 
the company 
suez and groupe ag say they hold 507 percent after spending 
about 850 million to beef up their stake 
at thursdays meeting a de benedetti aide made an official 
statement complaining about irregularities in the voting 
including extensive delays in tallying the vote caused by computer 
malfunctions 
analysts said the protest may have been made to allow de 
benedetti to protest the vote in court although there were no 
immediate threats of legal action 
de benedetti also is fighting a legal battle over societe 
generales issuance of 12 million new shares in an attempt to 
dilute his stake the stock was issued jan 18 the day de 
benedetti launched his hostile bid 
de benedetti the chairman of italys olivetti spa wants to 
turn societe generale which has interests in mining engineering 
manufacturing chemicals banking and other areas into a 
paneuropean holding company before 1992 that year the european 
economic community is to remove regulatory curbs on the free 
movement of goods and services

the squad of federal investigators probing texas 
air corp faces the task of unraveling a labyrinthine corporate 
structure adopted by the nations biggest airline company 
the department of transportation on wednesday charged 25 
accountants auditors economists and financial analysts with 
delving into a complex structure that has steeped the ailing 
carrier in controversy and made it the target of labor union 
hostility 
houstonbased texas air which commands 20 percent of the us 
market is the parent company of major carriers eastern airlines 
and continental airlines 
a key figure in the governments probe will be texas air 
chairman frank lorenzo who aggressively built the company from a 
small intrastate carrier into an airline empire unions and other 
critics have accused lorenzo of siphoning off eastern and 
continental assets into the parent company 
recent texas air filings with the securities and exchange 
commission indicated that both eastern and continental are under 
substantial increasing financial pressure transportation 
secretary jim burnley said in announcing the investigation 
documents indicate for example that texas airs cash reserves 
were drained last year at a rate of more than 1 million a day and 
that the company has around 7 billion in liabilities related to 
leasing planes 
the governments financial probe will examine the corporations 
management and business practices and the relationships between the 
parent eastern and continental said dot general counsel b wayne 
vance the departments deputy general counsel rosalind knapp 
will head the investigation 
while texas air controls eastern and continental houstonbased 
continental itself is the parent of other lorenzo acquisitions 
frontier airlines people express and new york air all three have 
ceased operating frontier is in bankruptcy but continental has 
absorbed their assets 
texas air also operates several commuter carriers rocky 
mountain airways britt airways bar harbor airlines and 
provincetownboston airlines 
together the texas air carriers have a huge debt of around 54 
billion but lorenzo has set up a corporate structure that 
insulates the parent itself from most of the burden the parent 
company sustained record losses of 466 million last year 
the wall street journal recently likened the complex corporate 
architecture to a house of many rooms every room has a paying 
tenant and a bank can foreclose on an individual room but not on 
the whole house the landlord has many partners but no one can 
challenge his management of the property 
the setup allows cash to move upstream from lossmaking texas 
air units to the parent in the form of management fees rents on 
planes and airport gates commissions on fuel purchases and others 
in its order for an investigation the dot said a number of 
financial transactions between the parent and eastern and 
continental raise questions concerning whether substantial funds 
and other resources are being diverted from the air carrier 
subsidiaries 
the department questioned for example 
texas air shifting easterns profitable computer reservation 
system into a separate subsidiary in exchange for a note which 
may be less than the systems fair market value 
eastern paying substantial fees for management services 
fuel purchases and other activities provided by the parent company 
eastern accepting a nointerest note instead of cash for 16 
million in reimbursements owed to the airline as part of its 
acquisition by texas air 
texas air borrowing 25 million from eastern in march 1987 in 
exchange for an unsecured note at a time when eastern was having 
cash flow problems 
texas air recently proposed to spin off easterns profitable 
northeast shuttle service in exchange for an infusion of 225 
million in cash and securities for the strapped airline but that 
attempt has been blocked by federal courts 
while the dot looks into the financial condition of texas air 
eastern and continental the federal aviation administration is 
undertaking a stringent safety investigation of miamibased 
eastern the faa on wednesday fined eastern 823000 because of 
recurring trends of violations of safety regulations and on 
thursday temporarily grounded five eastern planes for minor safety 
violations

mercedesbenz of north america wants you to 
have a nice vacation in europe 
so the luxury automaker is offering free plane tickets on one 
condition that the trip include the purchase of a mercedes in west 
germany 
since march 30 mercedes has been giving two roundtrip economy 
plane tickets or one businessclass ticket on pan am or lufthansa 
flights to customers who purchase and pick up autos from its 
factory near stuttgart 
as under most european pickup programs the company pays for 
shipment of the car back to the united states and for a 25 percent 
import duty 
the net savings according to spokesman ab schuman at 
mercedes us headquarters in montvale is about 8 percent off the 
retail price 
schuman said the free offer caters to overseas buyers who 
frequently combine a european tour with their auto purchase which 
in turn saves the cost of renting an automobile 
european delivery has been part of luxurycar marketing since 
the early 1960s schuman said and mercedes current gimmick is 
part of a longterm marketing strategy 
mercedes sold 2090 cars to americans in west germany last year 
out of a total 89900 purchased for use in the united states 
in an increasingly competitive luxury car market mercedes 
ticket offer has more to do with gaining a competitive edge than 
with boosting european delivery sales said spokesman thomas o 
mcgurn at rival bmw of north america in montvale 
schuman said it was too early to tell the results of the 
mercedes program but a sales manager at the nations largest 
mercedes dealership said he was pleased 
its done the job here said jerry carter at downtown la 
motors in los angeles four buyers lured by the ticket offer made 
deals on wednesday and one called last weekend when advertisements 
for the program began appearing carter said 
the ticket offer is one example of how luxury car makers are 
competing for buyers who have become reluctant because of 
confusion over the new tax laws that went into effect in 1987 the 
october stock market crash and the continuing decline of the 
dollar which has boosted foreign car prices said bmws mcgurn 
bmw for instance has boosted its advertising and is offering a 
lower percentage financing on leasing rates 
of 87800 domestic sales 1610 bmws were picked up in europe 
mcgurn said 
saabscania of america inc based in orange conn reported 
741 european deliveries for 1987 from four european locations said 
spokesman jim ventrilio

the hard rain that fell on national 
semiconductor corp ceremonies honoring silicon valley pioneer 
fairchild semiconductor corp has been practically the only thing 
to dampen the recent merger of the two companies 
the union of the two chipmakers has come off much more smoothly 
than many analysts and rivals thought it would without the 
bloodbath of personnel cuts and violent organizational disruptions 
predicted by some 
national acquired struggling fairchild on oct 1 for 122 
million after political pressure nixed a 200 million buyout by 
japans fujitsu ltd and found a silicon treasure trove according 
to national boss charles e sporck 
there were layoffs as the combined companies trimmed from 38000 
to 36000 workers and there were ruffled feathers sporck 
admits as employees made adjustments and in some cases switched 
jobs 
but he says that a dynamic company has emerged from the merger 
with a broad range of products solid research departments and 
worldwide clout 
im unaware of any other combination of two companies where a 
mergers been pulled off so well in such a short period of time 
sporck said thursday in his first interview on the merger since 
last fall 
sporck said national will post revenue of about 25 billion 
when its 1988 fiscal year ends may 31 enabling the company to leap 
from 11th to fifth among world chip companies 
he also estimated national would surpass the 12 percent growth 
rate he thinks the industry will post over the next year as it 
continues its recovery from a severe slump 
the sum of the two companies is exceeding the parts 
involved said michael boss analyst for san josebased market 
research firm dataquest inc 
it wasnt apparent from the figures for 1987 boss said 
but we really expect this to be a very good year for national we 
see some very good blending together of technologies and markets 
sporck said national got more than it bargained for 
our estimates were conservative both in terms of the 
financial impact and technology he said there was a 
perception on our part as well as the industrys that fairchild 
had a somewhat empty basket in terms of product it wasnt until 
after we truly started looking seriously that we realized that was 
a misconception 
sporck said he particularly is impressed with fairchilds high 
speed and custom chips used for supercomputers and military 
applications added to nationals other lines of chips the 
combined company can offer customers a wide range of technologies 
there is a trend among customers to reduce the number of 
suppliers he said it saves money dealing with fewer people 
and they realize as we do that more profitable relations occur 
when the two engineering organizations work closely together 
its a benefit we really didnt understand when we first 
started the fairchild involvement 
huddled under golf umbrellas fairchilds eight founders 
gathered among about 2000 guests thursday as sporck praised it as 
the granddaddy of all semiconductor companies and dedicated the 
new 75 million fairchild research center 
it was nationals way of preserving the name and spirit of the 
company that spawned silicon valleys biggest chipmakers including 
intel advanced micro devices and national 
fairchild had tremendously talented people and an unusual 
freeswinging environment said sporck who joined fairchild as a 
production manager and rose to head of the semiconductor division 
before he left to join national in 1967 
they were prepared to accept unusual behavior from people 
given they have talent he said one of the negatives of that 
of course is we bred a lot of entrepreneurs and they went out and 
started a lot of companies which wasnt necessarily in the best 
interests of fairchild but all of us have a tinge of nostalgia for 
fairchild

steel imports declined in february to the 
target set by the reagan administration for its quota program 
except for metal imported by us companies for rolling on their 
own mills 
but american producers said thursday that the 19 million tons 
imported in february in both categories represented the highest 
singlemonth level since november 1986 
increasing volume of semifinished steel imports badly needed 
by domestic rolling mills themselves continues a trend evident 
since the beginning of 1988 said erwin l klein president of 
the new yorkbased american institute for imported steel 
the aiis is composed largely of european steelmakers who sell 
products in the united states the washingtonbased american iron 
and steel institute represents domestic companies both intepret 
us commerce department data separately 
the importers said february steel imports excluding 284900 
tons of semifinished metal headed for us mills totaled 16 
million tons or 188 percent of the domestic market they said 
thats close to the 185 percent goal set by president reagan in 
launching the quota program in late 1984 
including semifinished steel february imports represented 221 
percent of the us market that was up from 218 percent in 
january when 18 million tons entered the country but down from 
25 percent in february 1987 when 18 million tons entered a 
smaller domestic market the aiis said thursday 
the us producers calculate the administrations goal as 202 
percent of the market including semifinished steel 
the importers said semifinished steel represented 15 percent of 
februarys total imports 
even these sharply increased semifinished steel imports are 
still unable to satisfy demand as indicated by escalating 
petitions of american rolling mills to the us commerce department 
for shortsupply allocation said klein vice chairman of the 
import firm steelinter usa inc 
the short supply petitions are requests for permission to import 
steel in excess of the quotas which the administration negotiated 
at the request of the domestic producers unless extended the 
quotas will expire in september 1989

safety violations discovered in six eastern 
airlines planes during an unprecedented federal inspection involved 
mechanical problems that occur daily a spokeswoman for the company 
said 
the federal aviation administration forced eastern to take the 
planes out of service thursday the second day of an inspection of 
the companys 267 aircraft 
an faa spokesman characterized the safety flaws as minor 
violations 
we have 1400 flights a day and every day youre going to 
have so many mechanical problems company spokeswoman paula musto 
said 
they would have been found on this day or another day and 
more than likely they would have been found by easterns own 
mechanics but we have people looking over our shoulder now 
in minneapolis an atlantabound flight filled with passengers 
was unloaded because of a fuel leak eastern had cleared the plane 
for takeoff but faa inspectors refused to let it fly nbc news 
reported 
two other planes were also taken out of service because of minor 
fuel leaks said bob buckhorn faa spokesman in washington one 
plane was sidelined by cut tires and another by a problem with 
emergency escape path markings in the cabin buckhorn said 
youre talking minor violations he said 
late thursday a sixth plane was taken out of service when an 
inchlong crack was discovered in the skin of a plane in st louis 
said faa spokesman john leyden he said it was not a serious 
problem 
the airline can return the planes to service as soon as the 
problems are corrected 
if inspectors find any irregularities they bring them to 
the attention of the airline who then takes the planes out of 
service until they fix them properly said faa spokesman jack 
barker in atlanta 
barker said 54 other planes that had been checked as part of the 
inspection program were ruled safe for flying ms musto said she 
didnt know whether the planes cited for violations had been 
repaired 
the 30day inspection of all eastern planes began wednesday 
after the faa fined the company 823000 for safety violations 
us transportation secretary jim burnley said officials have been 
unsatisfied with easterns performance since its takeover in 1986 
by texas air corp which will undergo a 30day inspection of its 
operating practices 
texas air which commands a fifth of the nations air travel 
market also owns continental airlines which has recently absorbed 
frontier airlines people express and new york air 
the governments financial probe will examine the corporations 
management and business practices and the relationships between the 
parent and the two airlines said b wayne vance general counsel 
for the department of transportation 
around easterns miami home base passengers and travel agents 
said the inspection and new fines were worrisome 
some of my customers already dont want to fly on eastern 
anymore said isabel chalen owner of the four corners travel 
agency in miami beach 
however eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak said there has been 
no drop in bookings 
the faa said its unprecedented inspection of eastern planes will 
include ramp checks of all of the carriers aircraft 
its a visual inspection of the aircraft while its parked at 
the gate the inspectors also will look at the log book to make 
sure the entries are correctly entered they will check the 
emergency equipment and thats basically what were looking at

billionaire real estate baron harry helmsley and 
his hotel queen wife leona underwent fingerprinting and mug 
shots then quietly sat with other alleged wrongdoers before 
pleading innocent to charges in a 188count state tax evasion 
indictment 
less than an hour later a federal tax evasion indictment was 
announced against the helmsleys one of the worlds wealthiest 
couples who own the empire state building and new york citys 
helmsley palace hotel and are estimated to be worth at least 14 
billion 
they were arraigned thursday on state charges that they hid 
about 4 million in renovations to their greenwich conn mansion 
including a pool enclosure with a rooftop marble dance floor and 
a 45000 clock in the shape of one of their buildings as 
business expenses and took bogus tax deductions 
not guilty both replied in strong voices before state 
supreme court justice carol berkman who rejected a prosecution 
request for 1 million bails and released them on their own 
recognizance 
helmsley 79 and his 67yearold wife had waited in the front 
row of the courtroom while alleged drug dealers and thieves were 
arraigned ahead of them mrs helmsley appeared depressed and at 
one point her eyes welled with tears smudging her mascara 
the fact is they did not pay millions of dollars in income 
tax us attorney rudolph giuliani said 45 minutes later in 
announcing a 47count federal tax evasion indictment against the 
helmsleys on similar charges 
as many as 30 past and current helmsley employees reportedly 
were given immunity from prosecution in return for testimony before 
state and federal grand juries 
its the only palace in the world where the queen stands 
guard says ads for the helmsley palace but employees say that 
royal appellation is matched by a volatile queensize temper 
she comes on as extremely forthright but that sometimes turns 
into brutality said one former employee advertising executive 
jane maas shes icy without compassion she is remorseless and 
pitiless 
mrs helmsley recently turned down a deal from prosecutors who 
said they would not seek the indictment of her ailing husband if 
she pleaded guilty to fraud a source said 
helmsley attorney stephen kaufman in a twopage statement said 
the couple had never evaded taxes and actually pay more than nearly 
anyone else in the nation 
the indictments were the result of an 18month state and federal 
probe officials said 
prior to their arraignment the helmsleys were booked and 
fingerprinted at police headquarters like anybody else said 
state attorney general robert abrams they received no special 
treatment whatsoever 
the helmsleys greeted reporters when they arrived at the 
attorney generals office in a gray limousine followed by a second 
limousine with their security guards 
according to the indictments the helmsleys spent about 4 
million to refurbish their mansion with an enclosure for one of the 
estates two pools a breakfast room and marble dance floor on the 
roof of that enclosure an elaborate indooroutdoor stereo system 
more than 370000 in landscaping and an assortment of furniture 
and paintings 
in addition a 45000 birthday present for helmsley a clock 
in the shape of the helmsley building on park avenue was billed 
to the park lane hotel in december 1984 it said the charges also 
said four jade art objects worth 500000 were paid for by four new 
york city hotels as furniture purchases in 1984 
their greenwich estate consists of a 28room tudor mansion on 29 
acres they also have a duplex atop the park lane hotel in 
manhattan and a condominium in palm beach fla 
also pleading innocent to the state charges were frank turco 
45 of lutz fla mrs helmsleys former top aide and joseph 
licari 51 of oyster bay cove ny the couples former financial 
manager 
both were also named in the federal indictment mrs helmsley 
the advertised queen of the couples hotel chain and turco 
face an additional federal charge of extortion conspiracy for 
allegedly accepting kickbacks from helmsley suppliers and employees 
each state felony count carries with it up to four years in 
prison and a 500000 fine the federal counts carry sentences of 
up to five years in prison and fines of up to 250000 
the extortion conspiracy count however can bring up to 20 
years in prison and a 250000 fine 
state prosecutors requested 100000 bail for the helmsleys 
aides but all four were released on their own recognizance pending 
a june 1 court date 
they are due in us district court on april 21 for arraignment 
on the federal charges

two men squabble 
but in announcing the preliminary agreement thursday griffin 
denied he and trump had ever been at odds 
i made my offer he refused it there was a lot of posturing 
and a lot of public statements made griffin said calling the 
dealmaking of the past several weeks a great tennis game 
the agreement calls for griffin to purchase resorts class a 
shares for 36 a share or a total of about 206 million and to 
buy trumps more powerful class b shares at an undisclosed price 
well above the 101 million that trump paid last year 
although the agreement remains to be finalized on paper the 
biggest speculation is how much trump will receive for his class b 
stock all griffin would say thursday was that trump was paid a 
lot i couldnt let him off easy right we dont want donald 
to take a loss on the b stock 
harold vogel a gambling industry analyst with merrill lynch in 
new york also speculated that mr trump wouldnt make a deal if 
it wasnt good for him 
trump now controls resorts by owning 95 percent of the companys 
outstanding class b shares and had tried since february to take 
the company private offering 22 for each of the companys 57 
million outstanding shares of class a stock 
marvin b roffman an analyst with the investment firm janney 
montgomery scott inc in philadelphia said the deal allows 
atlantic city to have another casino operating while the taj is 
operating 
roffman referred to the state casino control commissions 
earlier decision allowing trump to close resorts casino in order 
to open the taj mahal 
under state law no one may own more than three casinos trump 
already owns trump plaza and trumps castle casino hotels in 
atlantic city and opening the taj mahal would put him at the limit 
roffman said griffin is certainly happy because hell have one 
of the finest collections of real estate parcels in america 
roffman said he would not be surprised if griffin sold off 
resorts paradise island property to his california neighbor 
marvin davis last year the oilman offered to buy the bahamas 
operation for up to 260 million 
for 23 years griffin served as host of the popular merv 
griffin show one of televisions longestrunning series winning 
10 emmy awards he parlayed his entertainment fortune into a 
business empire that includes radio stations a major 
closedcircuit television operation widely used at racetracks and 
extensive real estate holdings in california 
as part of the agreement with griffin trump says he will buy 
the 1250room taj mahal and the nearby steel pier from resorts for 
an undisclosed price the gaming hall with an estimated completion 
cost of 9385 million is under construction next door to the 
resorts existing boardwalk casino 
william klein a new york attorney representing the owners of 
about 800000 shares of class a stock said he doubts his clients 
will be unhappy with the tentative agreement 
the 36a share offer he said is nearly double trumps offer 
its a lot better than 22 a share i think this is an 
extraordinary solution of a very difficult problem because of the 
personalities involved and the complexities of the deal

the stock market suffered another broad setback 
today extending thursdays steep slide amid increased inflation 
worries 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials down 10146 points on 
thursday fell 2189 to 198375 by 11 am today on wall street 
declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 2 in the 
overall tally of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 293 
up 1038 down and 404 unchanged 
volume on the big board came to 8980 million shares at 
midmorning 
analysts said bluechip stocks attracted some early buying by 
traders looking for bargains after the big drop on thursday 
but they also noted that stocks faced some formidable obstacles 
in any bid to rebound 
the labor department reported this morning that the producer 
price index of finished goods rose 06 percent in march that put 
added emphasis on recent worries about a possible revival of 
inflationary pressures 
at the same time interest rates rose in the credit markets 
pushing yields on longterm treasury bonds close to the 895 
percent level 
brokers said the bond and stock markets were still feeling the 
ill effects of the unexpected news thursday that the nations trade 
deficit widened in february

the chairmen of the new york stock exchange 
and the chicago mercantile exchange say they expect agreement soon 
on a plan to halt trading in stocks and stockindex futures when 
the markets rise or fall 200 to 300 points in one day 
the heads of the two fiercely competitive exchanges new york 
for stocks and chicago for futures on thursday told a house panel 
examining the october stock market collapse that they hoped to 
agree on the plan within the next month 
however leo melamed chairman of the chicago exchanges 
executive committee and john j phelan chairman and chief 
executive officer of the new york stock exchange differed on just 
how far the markets should move before trading is interrupted 
phelan said the trading should not be halted until the dow jones 
industrial average moves 250 to 300 points while melamed said the 
limits should be in the range of 200 to 250 points 
melamed and phelan said since october they have met several 
times in an effort to achieve greater coordination congressional 
leaders particularly senate banking committee chairman william 
proxmire dwis and house finance subcommittee chairman edward j 
markey dmass had been complaining about the lack of progress 
in talks among the exchanges and among federal regulatory agencies 
youve got to let the market seek its own level but there 
comes a time when a systematic halt a safety net that is known 
in advance is helpful phelan said 
in the futures market we are not uncomfortable with price 
limits we already have them melamed said it just depends on 
where you draw the line he said short halts in trading are a 
necessary evil perhaps but something we could live with 
phelan said the purpose of the halts would be to allow the 
market to stop and take a look at itself he said they should 
be more than 30 minutes but should not last all day 
both chairmen told the house finance subcommittee that president 
reagans new working group on the markets has indicated a 
circuitbreaker plan is a high priority 
currently the big board limits a form of computerized trading 
known as index arbitrage which links the new york stock markets 
with the chicago futures markets once the dow moves 50 points 
either up or down 
the chicago exchange has set daily price limits on its standard 
amp poors 500 stock index future which is based on stocks traded on 
the big board there is an opening price limit that restricts any 
move during the first l0 minutes of trading to the equivalent of 
roughly 40 points on the dow and a daily price limit equivalent to 
between 120 and 150 dow points 
but such circuit breakers are not coordinated between new york 
and chicago 
melamed also said regulation of the nations financial markets 
by a single federal agency would do a great disservice to the 
marketplace and that it is neither warranted nor wise 
currently the commodities futures trading commission oversees 
the nations futures markets and the securities and exchange 
commission regulates securities trading 
phelan said he believes one regulator should eventually be in 
charge of all the markets 
we believe that ultimately there should be a unified 
regulator for all equityrelated products phelan testified 
but more immediately it is much more important that we 
strengthen the clearing and settlement process as well as put in 
place an allmarket circuit breaker in the event of a major market 
decline 
melamed said the roles of the cftc and the sec are so different 
that they should not be combined 
the number of true intermarket issues are few and limited in 
scope melamed told the panel moreover they must be resolved 
now not when the next crisis occurs

eastman kodak co has given its workforce 
in panama a 15day paid furlough because of the extreme difficulty 
in doing business there a company spokesman said today 
the catalyst for the shutdown of kodaks marketing facility 
retail film and camera shops and minilab processing centers was 
last fridays economic sanctions imposed by president reagan said 
kodak spokesman henry kaska 
we werent ordered to close but it just doesnt make sense to 
stay open kaska said we are not permitted to pay our utility 
bill we cant pay the phone bill we were also concerned about the 
security of our people traveling in that country 
the sanctions were ordered april 8 by reagan in an effort to 
force military leader manuel antonio noriega to surrender his hold 
on the central american country 
they include prohibiting payments to the noriega regime by all 
us citizens and organizations in panama freezing the us assets 
of the panamanian government and prohibiting any person or company 
in the united states from making any payments to the regime 
kaska said he didnt have an exact figure on the number of kodak 
employees but estimated it was less than 1000 he said the 
furlough went into effect tuesday 
after the 15 days well reevaluate and reassess and determine 
whether there should be another furlough kaska said we hope 
the situation will stabilize within a month 
he said kodak would continue to service its copiers in the 
panama canal zone and will keep its photo processing minilabs open

the worlds top financial leaders did their 
best to reassure jittery financial markets today amid signs that 
their multimilliondollar effort to stabilize the value of the 
dollar was working 
the finance leaders wrapping up the spring meeting of the 
151nation international monetary fund issued an optimistic 
communique that predicted continued global economic growth despite 
the turmoil on financial markets 
dutch finance minister h onno ruding said the sharp selloff of 
the dollar thursday had not changed the view that growth prospects 
this year remain bright 
members were aware of the developments in the markets during 
their deliberations thursday but it has not changed dramatically 
the actions of our meetings because we are trying to improve the 
system regardless of the vagaries of the market from day to day 
ruding told reporters 
still the rout of the dollar on world currency markets thursday 
represented a major embarrassment for the finance leaders coming as 
it did only 18 hours after they had issued a glowing assessment of 
the global economy 
the worlds seven largest economies the united states japan 
west germany britain france canada and italy had bragged in 
their joint statement on wednesday of the success they had had in 
the last four months in keeping the dollar from falling further 
the socalled group of seven renewed their pledge to cooperate 
closely in coming months to keep the dollar stable 
that commitment was tested dramatically on thursday as the 
dollar suffered its worst decline since late last year as nervous 
investors dumped the greenback following a disappointing increase 
in the us trade deficit for february 
the dollar traded in a narrow range today after dropping about 2 
percent on thursday against such currencies as the japanese yen 
west german mark and british pound central banks continued to prop 
up the dollar by buying dollars with other currencies on the open 
market 
administration sources who spoke on condition that they not be 
identified said that treasury secretary james a baker iii held a 
hasty 10minute discussion with his counterparts from other nations 
thursday in the midst of the dollars decline 
these sources said the finance ministers discussed their joint 
efforts to intervene to break the dollars fall by government 
purchases of the greenback 
currency traders estimated that the amount of government 
intervention may have totaled as much as 700 million on thursday 
alone 
sources at the imf meeting confirmed that there was further 
intervention taking place today those efforts seemed to be working 
as the dollar edged up slightly in early trading in new york amid 
reports that the federal reserve the west german central bank and 
the bank of england were buying dollars 
finance ministers could only hope that the latest turmoil in 
foreign exchange markets would not lead to a prolonged test of 
their commitments to spend the resources of their treasuries or 
trigger renewed turmoil on stock exchanges and on the bond market 
even after thursdays market turmoil the finance ministers were 
looking for a silver lining noting that the massive intervention 
while costing substantial sums had kept the dollar from going into 
a free fall 
the group of seven is not daunted by this said canadian 
finance minister michael wilson late thursday 
german finance minister gerhard stoltenberg said the hectic 
dollar trading was not threatening as the economic leaders let 
it be known they stood ready to spend more sums if necessary to 
stabilize the dollar 
i think what you see today is a very good example of 
international cooperation because there has been concerted 
intervention in support of the dollar involving a very large number 
of countries nigel lawson the british chancellor of the 
exchequer told reporters 
baker the prime architect of the threeyear effort to manage 
the dollar said the markets were wrong to read so much into one 
months adverse trade report 
he said the overall trend was toward a lower us trade deficit 
and this development was being aided by the efforts of japan and 
west germany to stimulate their domestic demand something the 
administration has long urged 
monthly trade figures are by their nature erratic what is 
important is that we are continuing along the general path of 
reduced imbalances baker said thursday in a speech to the 
finance ministers 
the administration is counting on improvements in the american 
trade deficit to supply fully half of us economic growth this 
year one of the reasons that markets react so negatively if the 
monthly trade figures dont show improvement 
the 138 billion february trade imbalance was up 11 percent 
from the january deficit and was the worst showing since last 
octobers record 176 billion deficit the problem in february was 
that a surge in imports swamped further improvement in exports 
the nations trade problems are severe and far from over 
said rudy oswald the aflcios chief economist while exports 
are up by 10 billion from a year ago so are imports leaving 
america no further along the path towards reducing the 
jobsdestroying deficit 
baker has been struggling with the trade problem ever since he 
took over as treasury secretary at the start of president reagans 
second term in 1985 
baker switched administration policy in september 1985 from a 
handsoff approach concerning the dollar to a coordinated effort 
with other countries to drive the dollar lower as a way of curbing 
americans appetite for foreign goods and boosting the 
competitiveness of us products overseas 
after the dollar had fallen substantially throughout 1986 baker 
reversed course again in february 1987 when the group of seven 
countries declared that the dollar had fallen enough they served 
notice that the seven nations would begin intervening to support 
the dollars value 
that declaration proved ineffective for much of 1987 as the 
dollar came under renewed selling pressure but a new 
dollarstabilization pact reached dec 22 had appeared to be 
working until thursdays selloff

wholesale prices jumped 06 percent in march 
the biggest increase in 11 months the government said today in a 
report that added to jitters on financial markets about inflation 
and the health of the economy 
the march increase more than erased a 02 percent drop in 
feburaryif the march rate held for 12 months the fullyear 
wholesale inflation rate would be 7 percent compared with 22 
percent for all of 1987 
the dow jones industrial average of 30 bluechip industrial 
stocks which staged its fifth biggest loss and dropped more than 
101 points thursday in reaction to disappointing trade figures 
fell 22 points to 198375 in the first 90 minutes of trading today 
the labor department said in todays report on wholesale price 
activity that energy prices which had been falling at an annual 
rate of 17 percent rose 09 percent last month their first 
increase since august 
food prices after dropping 11 percent in february advanced by 
07 percent last month for the first three months of the year 
beef and veal prices climbed 436 percent 
overall wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 31 percent 
from january through march 
the widespread nature of these price changes suggests that 
inflation pressures may be intensifying said donald ratajczak a 
georgia state university economist who specializes in wholesale 
price trends 
ratajczak and other economists anticiated that todays price 
report would add to the havoc evident thursday following the 
governments announcement that the nations trade deficit worsened 
significantly in february 
yesterdays news and the flailings of the lemmings on wall 
street combined with todays price numbers are going to create a 
volatile climate for a while said dirk van dongen president of 
the national association of wholesalers again they were a 
surprise and above the predictions of all the experts 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the reagan 
administration was disappointed with the increase in wholesale 
prices today as well as the trade figures thursday 
we think the market has overreacted to a onetime report and 
we hope this thing will stabilize fitzwater said 
reflecting the broad nature of marchs price gains the labor 
department said that its index of wholesale prices for consumer 
goods other than food and energy rose 04 percent compared with a 
03 percent increase in february 
because food and energy prices can fluctuate greatly from month 
to month analysts look to the calculation that excludes them as 
providing a good underlying indication of inflationary pressures 
for the first three months of 1988 wholesale prices for goods 
other than food and energy rose at an annual rate of 57 percent 
automobile prices were up 1 percent last month restoring them 
to the level they had been at in november before manufacturers 
began offering dealers rebates and other incentives 
prescription drug prices rose 13 percent and overthecounter 
drug costs advanced 2 percent in march newspaper prices rose 14 
percent 
wholesale gasoline prices rose 15 percent after dropping about 
9 percent since november home heating oil prices jumped 26 
percent 
costs rose for a variety of food products that had dropped in 
price in february among them were eggs fresh fruits coffee 
poultry fish and pasta products 
other goods showing 1 percent or greater price increases one 
step short of the retail level included carpeting draperies and 
jewelry 
capital equipment prices rose 04 percent double the increases 
of january and february the biggest price gains above 1 percent 
were in metalcutting machine tools and office and store 
equipment 
prices dropped slightly however for other goods including 
womens clothing shoes cosmetics glassware and home electronic 
equipment 
marchs overall gain brought the wholesale price index to 1062 
that means a selection of good costing 100 at the wholesale level 
in 1982 would have cost 10620 last month or 30 cents more than 
in february 
wholesale prices rose only 22 percent for all of 1987 the 
index however does not include two categories where price 
increases have been more pronounced in recent months services and 
imports 
those two categories are included in the consumer price index 
which rose 44 percent last year 
consumer prices for the first two months of 1988 were running at 
an annual rate of 32 percent figures on retail price activity in 
march will not be out until later this month

the economy is now at a stage where too much 
good news could have bad effects in much the same way an extra 
helping of dessert can ruin the digestion 
it is a tricky situation for the economy to be in and it is 
being watched closely by everyone on wall street the federal 
reserve board the white house and the forecasting fraternity 
the reason is that the economy is now in critical balance the 
capacity of plants and factories may be nearing the maximum for 
example so you dont want a lot of additional activity that might 
spur inflation 
it could mean a big demand for more workers too and since the 
jobless rate is now at a sevenyear low of 56 percent any pressure 
there could upset the wage contentment that has existed for several 
years 
a production spurt could mean higher interest rates as well and 
that of course could be bad for securities homebuying and 
creditcard borrowing not to mention spending by business to 
alleviate the condition with added capacity 
albert sommers consultant to the conference board puts its 
this way the us operating level is too high for strong 
economic news to be good for either the bond market or the equity 
market 
therefore he and many of his forecasting brethren are looking 
for a slow but steady pace of economic expansion something in the 
area of 2 percent or less if that happens they say equilibrium 
elsewhere might be maintained 
but seldom have economists needed their limbs more than today 
because almost every look into the future is conditioned by on 
the other hand and just a slight economic change might require 
immediate use of that hand 
as you might expect there is still some disagreement on how 
near the manufacturing segment is to full production the official 
rate as of february was 825 percent or 3 points higher than the 
average for 19701988 
many analysts view the current level as close to maximum beyond 
which there would be an increasing likelihood of production 
strains resulting in the hiring of less skilled workers falling 
productivity and rising prices 
but wright investors service recognized for its skill with 
statistics has another viewpoint 
it points out that from 1950 through 1959 inflation was at a 
minimum while plant utilization rose as high as 917 percent and 
at one point in the relatively calm 1960s the rate was almost as 
high 
it would take at least two years of robust growth before the 
nations overall factory operating rates would exceed 85 percent 
says wright and even then there would be a question of whether 
concerns were legitimate 
that view seems not to be the most widely accepted one however 
and so a great deal of tension exists among investors and the 
federal reserve about the possibility of good news strong 
production being bad news 
it explains to some extent the inability of the securities 
markets to make pronounced moves in either direction it explains 
why slow rather than fast economic growth is in 
considering what the country has been through the extremes of 
inflation high interest rates and recession within the span of a 
decade it isnt the worst of situations

economic indicators but dealers said central bank intervention 
tempered its fall 
the pound rose strongly as investors again moved in to take

gold prices moved up around the globe 
the dollar was hurt by news that us producer prices increased 
a largerthanexpected 06 percent during march and that industrial 
output climbed 01 percent less than expected during the month 
however any further fall in the dollar was tempered by reported

communications satellite corp on friday 
reported a 68 percent jump in its first quarter profit over a year 
ago 
net income for the three months ended march 31 totaled 143 
million or 77 cents a share compared with earnings of 85 
million or 44 cents in 1987 
revenue totaled 841 million vs 807 million operating 
income however fell from 229 million to 184 million the 
company said 
the jump in revenue was attributed largely to the acquisition of 
full ownership in comsat video enterprises inc which was added to 
the company in the second quarter of last year 
this was partially offset though by a decline in revenue from 
intelsat satellite services while international business was up 
revenue declined because of rate reductions to customers under 
longterm contracts comsat reported 
comsat provides international domestic and maritime 
communications facilities via satellite and researches 
communications techniques

the bond market got an earful of economic news 
this past week and didnt like a lot of what it heard 
it was a week of surprises all of them negative said 
william griggs of the financial consulting firm griggs amp santow 
inc in new york 
the reports on march retail sales and wholesale prices and the 
february trade deficit indicated the economy is growing faster than 
poststock market crash pessimists had expected and that inflation 
may be accelerating 
faster economic growth and rising prices are the enemy in the 
bond market and prices slumped on the news pushing longterm 
yields toward their highest levels since they exceeded 9 percent in 
midjanuary 
by midafternoon friday the prices of some longterm treasury 
bonds were priced to yield 893 percent up from 868 percent at 
the end of the previous week and from 83 percent in early february 
the government reported wednesday that retail sales rose 08 
percent in march stronger than most analysts had expected it 
was another indication that the consumer has the ability to spend 
and is doing it griggs said 
more disconcerting was news the next day that the nations trade 
deficit had widened to 138 billion in february most analysts had 
expected a contraction in the deficit to the 11 billion to 12 
billion range 
continued strength in imports raised the possibility that 
inflation would accelerate possibly prompting the federal reserve 
board to tighten credit conditions in an effort to ward off higher 
prices 
adding to inflation concerns was fridays report that wholesale 
prices rose 06 percent in march or about twice as fast as most 
analysts had expected 
that was one more bit of bad news that the market could have 
done without said elliott platt research director for 
donaldson lufkin amp jenrette securities corp in new york 
he said next months wholesale price figure could be even worse 
if oil prices continue their recent rise 
most economists caution against reading too much into any single 
economic report noting that they are often subject to revision 
but robert chandross chief economist for lloyds bank plc in new 
york said the rise in wholesale prices nonetheless indicates 
something is going on on the inflation front that is pretty 
negative 
i had thought april was going to be difficult and this raises 
the likelihood that the fed will have to tighten further he 
said they may not do it right away but if we get some strong 
employment figures for april it would leave them no alternative 
sun won sohn chief economist for norwest corp in minneapolis 
said the series of economic reports was extremely disappointing 
because the consensus estimates were wrong in each case 
sohn said he had expected longterm rates would decline in may 
but said the latest reports prompted him to delay that projection 
he is now looking for longterm rates to edge up to 9 percent and 
not begin falling until july or august he expects longterm rates 
will be as low as 83 percent by november 
dljs platt expects longterm rates will rise as high as 925 
percent by the end of the month but then decline as low as 8 
percent by early summer 
but griggs is decidedly more pessimistic he said the gyrations 
in the dollar have introduced a new element of risk for foreign 
buyers of us securities and that rates will rise to compensate 
them for that 
combined with the federal governments continuing strong 
borrowing demands and an expected acceleration of inflation griggs 
said he expects longterm rates will rise to 10 percent or more by 
the end of the year 
chandross is looking for longterm rates to stay in a narrow 
range rising to 9 percent before slipping to 875 percent during 
may 
there is enough skittishness in the economy right now that 
there is a selfcorrecting mechanism at work under which rising 
rates dampen certain kinds of economic activity and that leads 
rates to fall he said

soybean futures prices fell sharply friday on the 
chicago board of trade amid heavy liquidation by speculative 
investment funds the grains also closed lower 
analysts said chicagobased campd commodities the largest 
speculative firm on the floor led the decline by selling large 
numbers of contracts for soybeans and soybean products that it had 
purchased in recent weeks 
the funds were reacting to a number of factors including good 
harvest weather for the south american soybean crop disappointing 
export sales last week and relatively high cash prices for soybeans 
and soybean products said richard loewy senior grain and oilseed 
analyst for prudentialbache securities inc in new york

houstonbased first city with the help of 970 million from the

texaco inc announced friday it will resume 
paying a quarterly dividend and will sell off an additional 2 
billion in assets as part of its restructuring 
at its first meeting since texaco emerged from chapter 11 
federal bankruptcy court reorganization on april 7 the oil giants 
board of directors authorized a 75cent quarterly dividend a move 
analysts said is intended to bolster shareholder support for the 
current management team 
in closing trading on the new york stock exchange texaco jumped 
162 to 4875 
texaco had been barred from paying dividends after it filed for 
bankruptcy protection on april 12 1987 in the wake of its epic 
legal battle with pennzoil co the dividend will be paid june 10 to 
shareholders of record may 3 
in addition to authorizing the dividend directors said they 
planned to sell off 5 billion in assets to help reduce the 
companys debt load 
texaco said in its 1987 annual report that it hoped to raise at 
least 3 billion through the sale of assets but fridays action 
increased that amount by 2 billion 
james w kinnear texacos president and chief executive 
officer said in a statement that the resumption of dividends at 
a substantial rate demonstrates texacos confidence that this 
expanded restructuring will enable us to build a more profitable 
company on a solid core of our most productive assets 
while texaco can afford the roughly 726 million a year in 
dividend payments experts noted that the extra expense will eat up 
nearly 100 percent of the companys projected earnings for the year 
the 3ashare annual dividend is not justified by texacos 
current earnings prospects said bruce lazier vice president for 
energy investments at prescott ball amp turben inc they probably 
will not earn much more than the 3 a share rate 
lazier called the dividend decision a defensive move 
designed to offer shareholders an incentive to ride along with 
current management rather than side with corporate raider carl c 
icahn texacos largest shareholder and sharpest critic 
for shareholders hoping for liquidation this is a nail in 
that coffin lazier said referring to rumors that texaco would 
have been dismembered if icahn won control he unsuccessfully 
sought a board seat 
speculation had been brewing in recent weeks that texaco would 
take some action to boost the value of its stock so fridays 
announcement was not a complete surprise 
i think the dividend will quell a lot of shareholder 
dissent said james van alen an oil analyst at janney montgomery 
scott in philadelphia 
as part of its asset sale texaco said it would dispose of 
unidentified producing manufacturing and marketing assets both 
domestic and overseas 
last week texaco confirmed it is negotiating to sell its 
deutsche texaco ag subsidiary which operates 1903 gas stations in 
west germany officials said the operation could fetch as much as 
17 billion 
texaco previously announced plans to sell 60 million barrels of 
us oil and natural gas reserves 
kinnear said in a statement issued from texacos headquarters in 
white plains ny that the asset sales would serve to 
deemphasize our presence in manufacturing and marketing 
he said the company also would pursue rigorous programs to 
streamline management and to set and achieve strict operating and 
financial objectives 
under a reorganization plan approved march 23 by a federal 
bankruptcy court judge texaco transferred 3 billion to pennzoil 
on april 7 to settle its 4year legal battle with the houstonbased 
company 
texaco had filed for protection from its creditors under chapter 
11 of federal bankruptcy laws to avoid having to post a potentially 
ruinous multibilliondollar security bond while appealing a 10 
billion damage judgment awarded to pennzoil by a houston jury in 
november 1985 the award stemmed from texacos acquisition of getty 
oil co after getty had agreed to sell part of its assets to 
pennzoil 
also at the board meeting former ppg industries inc chairman 
l stanton williams was elected to the board of directors to 
replace elvis mason who resigned mason is the managing partner of

the dollar closed mixed against major foreign 
currencies friday amid speculation that interest rates would soon 
rise 
gold prices increased republic national bank of new york quoted 
a bid of 45525 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 pm edt up from 
45265 late thursday 
the governments announcement of a 06 percent increase in 
wholesale prices for march was viewed as mildly bullish and had a 
stabilizing influence on the dollar said dan holland a trader at 
discount corp 
traders believed the federal reserve might be moved to tighten 
credit thereby raising interest rates to counter a surge in 
inflation 
higher interest rates would have a calming effect on the dollar 
which fell sharply on thursday after the government released 
disappointing balance of trade figures 
another government report friday of a 01 percent in industrial 
production produced market speculation that companies were buying 
foreign machinery to increase their output holland said traders 
believe higher output would lead to increased exports and 
eventually a shrinkage in the nations trade deficit 
the commerce department said thursday the deficit widened to 
138 billion in february financial markets had expected the gap 
to narrow 
holland described trading friday as quiet 
in europe the dollar fell but central bank intervention 
tempered its slide dealers said 
while american markets interpreted fridays economic figures as 
positive for the dollar overseas traders saw them in a negative 
light and sold dollars the wholesale price figure was larger than 
expected and the industrial output number was lower than 
anticipated 
in tokyo where trading ended before the figures were released 
the dollar fell 202 yen to a closing 12413 later in london it 
was quoted at 12390 yen and in new york it rose to 12380 yen

the nation got its first big dose of inflation 
this year as wholesale prices rose at an annual rate of 7 percent 
in march the government said friday the report sent new tremors 
through financial markets already shaken by a worsening us trade 
deficit 
the labor departments producer price index rose 06 percent 
last month marking the biggest increase since april 1987 and more 
than erasing a 02 percent decline in february 
falling energy and food prices that had been keeping a lid on 
inflationary pressures shot upwards in march as did wholesale 
prices for a wide marketbasket of other consumer goods and capital 
equipment 
the price data provided the followup blow in a onetwo punch 
that government statisticians delivered on the state of the economy 
on thursday the commerce department reported that the nations 
trade deficit expanded by 14 billion or 11 percent to 138 
billion in february when all predictions had called for it to 
narrow 
the dow jones industrial average of 30 bluechip stocks dropped 
101 points on the news thursday its fifth biggest decline in 
history but the market stabilized friday and the dow closed up 
829 points 
i dont know that the markets are going to digest two doses of 
really quite bad medicine too quickly said donald straszheim 
chief economist for merrill lynch brokerage 
the trade number is easier to explain away because it bounces 
up and down but not the price figures straszheim said the 2 
percent and 3 percent inflation we have been enjoying we probably 
will no longer 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
was disappointed by the increase in wholesale prices and the trade 
deficit 
we think the market has overreacted to a onetime report and 
we hope this thing will stabilize he said 
but analysts said upward pressure on prices is only going to 
worsen in the months ahead stirring speculation that the federal 
reserve board might tighten credit to both prevent the dollar from 
losing further value and dampen inflation 
the fed last raised the discount rate it charges for loans to 
banks in september 1987 a month later the stock market collapsed 
with the dow industrials dropping 518 points partly in reaction to 
higher interest rates from the credit tightening 
lawrence hunter an economist for the us chamber of commerce 
expressed fears friday that the fed will overreact to perceived 
inflationary pressures that some see in the recent data and 
stymie economic growth 
oversteering in the face of monthly price swings can only feed 
fears of inflation hunter said referring to figures that show 
the annual wholesale price increases of just 31 percent when 
averaged over the past three months 
however donald ratajczak a georgia state university economist 
who specializes in wholesale price trends said increases in april 
will match if not exceed those in march 
this isnt a onemonth aberration ratajczak said strong 
increases in raw material prices that have been going on for six 
months are widening and spreading its not runaway inflation but 
its a little worrying 
wholesale energy prices which had dropped at an annual rate of 
17 percent since last august shot up 09 percent in march 
gasoline prices climbed 15 percent last month after dropping about 
9 percent since november and home heating oil prices jumped 26 
percent 
food prices after dropping 11 percent in february advanced by 
07 percent in march for the first three months of the year beef 
and veal prices have climbed 436 percent 
reflecting the broad nature of marchs price gains the labor 
department said its index of wholesale prices for consumer goods 
other than food and energy rose 04 percent compared with a 03 
percent increase in february 
for the first three months of 1988 those nonenergy nonfood 
wholesale prices are up at an annual rate of 57 percent 
automobile prices were up 1 percent last month restoring them 
to the level they had been at in november before manufacturers 
began offering rebates and other incentives 
prescription drug prices rose 13 percent overthecounter 
drugs were up 2 percent and the price of newspapers climbed 14 
percent in march other goods showing 1 percent or greater price 
increases one step short of the retail level included carpeting 
draperies and jewelry 
capital equipment prices rose 04 percent double the increases 
of january and february the biggest price gains above 1 percent 
were in metalcutting machine tools and office and store 
equipment 
in a related report the commerce department said friday that 
businesses planning to increase their capital spending by 8 percent 
this year after raising it by only 17 percent in 1987 
the commerce report reflected increasing optimistism about the 
economy among businessman who when last surveyed in december said 
they planned to increase their capital spending by 73 percent this 
year 
meanwhile the federal reserve reported that industrial 
production edged up just 01 percent in march analysts said that 
report was the only indication that the economy is not overheating 
following a long string of data suggesting that it is 
as for wholesale prices the march gain brought the producer 
price index to 1062 that means a selection of good costing 100 
at the wholesale level in 1982 would have cost 10620 last month 
or 30 cents more than in february 
wholesale prices rose only 22 percent for all of 1987 the 
index however does not include two categories where price 
increases have been more pronounced in recent months services and 
imports 
those two categories are included in the consumer price index 
which rose 44 percent last year 
consumer prices for the first two months of 1988 were running at 
an annual rate of 32 percent figures on retail price activity in 
march will be released later this month

sheet and towel giant jp stevens amp co said 
friday its board has backed a 122 billion buyout bid from a new 
york investment firm spurning a lower offer from rival fabric 
maker west pointpepperell inc 
in the continuing takeover battle for the textile giant odyssey 
partners was offering 6850 a share in cash for stevens 
outstanding shares under a tender offer due to expire april 22 
the company sweetened its offer to that level in a frenzied 
auction monday just hours after pepperell boosted its own tender 
offer to 67 a share in cash or about 119 billion the current 
bids represent the third time each company has sweetened its bid 
for stevens 
stevens fell 50 cents a share to close at 6762 friday in new 
york stock exchange composite trading 
in recommending that shareholders tender to odyssey stevens 
said its board had considered and rejected pepperells competing 
offer 
joseph l lanier jr pepperells chairman and chief executive 
officer had said in an interview he considered pepperells current 
bid fair but he did not rule out another round of bidding 
a spokesman for pepperell had no comment on what action the 
company might take 
the boards decision to spurn pepperell came after the west 
point ga company was able to remove major antitrust concerns by 
agreeing with the federal trade commission to sell certain stevens 
assets if its offer succeeds 
pepperell said earlier in the week that the ftc agreed to permit 
pepperells previously announced plans to sell half of stevens 
bath lines and 20 percent of its sheet lines for about 170 million 
to ntc group parent of the textile manufacturer bibb co 
the ftc also waived waiting requirements under federal 
disclosure laws but could require pepperell to sell a sheeting 
mill a yarn plant certain designer licenses and a brand name if 
the deal were consummated pepperell said 
the ftc would have six months to decide whether pepperell must 
divest those stevens assets 
among the top brand names in stevens towel and sheet arsenal are 
ralph lauren laura ashley gloria vanderbilt perry ellis pierre 
cardin and givenchy among others pepperells brands include 
arrow martex lady pepperell and burberry 
bidding for stevens began after it received a leveraged buyout 
offer earlier this year from a group led by its own senior 
management including chairman whitney stevens a fifthgeneration 
member of the family that founded the company in 1813 
pepperell launched a 6250ashare tender offer last month 
after stevens agreed to a buyout by odyssey at 6150 a share 
odyssey subsequently sweetened its offer to 64 
on monday pepperell increased its tender offer to 67 a share 
but odyssey topped that by 150 a share just hours before its own 
tender was about to expire

price index of finished goods rose 06 percent in march that put 
added emphasis on recent worries about a possible revival of 
inflationary pressures 
at the same time interest rates rose in the credit markets

percent level 
brokers said the bond and stock markets were still feeling the 
ill effects of the unexpected news thursday that the nations trade 
deficit widened in february

the biggest rise in wholesale prices in 11 
months sent new inflation jitters through the financial markets 
friday but stock prices stabilized a day after a 100 billion drop 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 829 points to 
201393 after plunging 10146 points on thursday stocks also 
dipped in foreign markets and interest rates rose but the dollar 
stabilized 
in spite of the dow jones increase declining issues outnumbered 
advancing ones by about 9 to 5 on the new york stock exchange 
the labor department raised inflation worries with its report 
that the producer price index of finished goods rose 06 percent in 
march an annual rate for wholesale inflation of more than 7 
percent 
investors had already been worried about inflation because of 
thursdays report that the merchandise trade deficit jumped 
unexpectedly to 138 billion in february 
the big trade gap signaled to some investors that an overheated 
economy was sucking in too many imports the report also threatened 
to fuel inflation by knocking down the dollar which would boost 
import prices 
in spite of the wholesale inflation report the fear that drove 
prices down thursday was largely absent from the markets on friday 
theres a bit of concern in the producer price number but not 
anything great said lincoln anderson an economist for bear 
stearns amp co 
investors realized that the big jumps in food and energy costs 
that swelled the index in march were probably only temporary 
anderson said 
interest rates rose friday as traders speculated the federal 
reserve would try to wring inflation expectations out of the market 
by tightening credit and slowing down the economy 
tightening by the fed would push up interest rates in the short 
term but pave the way for them to decline over the longer term by 
easing fears of an overheated economy 
some economists worried that the fed would accidentally knock 
the economy into recession by trying too hard to cool things off 
whats absolutely amazing to me is that last fall all the 
experts were looking for recession and depression and that was 
bad here 180 days later a strong economy is seen as bad 
said neil eigen senior vice president of integrated resources 
asset management a new york money management firm 
the yield of the benchmark 30year treasury bond continued to 
rise to 894 percent by midafternoon friday a new threemonth 
high up from 886 percent thursday 
the dollar bobbed within a narrow range after falling 2 percent 
thursday against the japanese yen west german mark and british 
pound traders said major central banks bought dollars to support 
the currency for a second day 
overseas friday key indexes fell less than 1 percent on the 
tokyo and london stock exchanges 
the dow industrials had climbed nearly 130 points from april 5 
through tuesday largely on anticipation that februarys trade news 
would be favorable 
the value of us stocks fell by 997 billion in thursdays 
plunge according to a 5000stock index measured by wilshire 
associates of santa monica calif stocks fell an additional 1 
billion in friday the organization said

knightridder inc said friday that its board of 
directors amended a shareholders rights poison pill plan to a 
make it even tougher for a hostile takeover of the media giant 
the board also authorized a stock buyout of up to 5 million 
common shares four months after it approved the purchase of up to 
2 million shares spokesman frank hawkins said the stock was needed 
for several reasons including employee share and option plans 
more than 40 percent of knightridder stock is owned or 
controlled by directors officers employees or founding families 
under the poison pill amendment shareholders would be able to 
buy additional common shares at a discount should someone acquire 
up to 20 percent of the companys outstanding stock said hawkins 
the effect of that is to make a hostile takeover attempt 
extremely dilutive he said 
meanwhile friday knightridder president james k batten 52 
was elected chief executive officer batten a 31year veteran 
newsman of knightridder replaces alvah h chapman jr 67 who 
remains as chairman 
knightridder publishes 30 daily newspapers including the miami

also retreated 
on other markets cattle futures finished higher after reversing 
sharp losses pork futures moved lower oil futures advanced for 
the fifth straight day precious metals and stockindex futures 
posted slight gains 
soybeans declined on a combination of bearish fundamentals 
including good harvest weather for the south american soybean crop 
disappointing export sales last week and relatively high cash 
prices for soybeans and soybean products analysts said

prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
the government released grain export sales figures thursday for 
the week ending april 7 showing shipments of both soybeans and 
soybean meal were down about 60 percent from the previous week 
the rally last week that pushed newcrop soybean futures well 
above 7 a bushel likely persuaded more farmers to plant soybeans 
another bearish factor said joel karlin an analyst for 
chicagobased research department inc 
analysts said chicagobased campd commodities the largest 
speculative firm on the floor led the decline by selling large 
numbers of contracts for soybeans and soybean products that it had 
purchased in recent weeks

buying for outdoor cookouts said chuck levitt an analyst in 
chicago for shearson lehman hutton inc 
the abiltiy of the market to shake off its early severe losses 
today indicated anticipation of better retail business next week 
he said 
the lower prices for pork futures reflected concerns about the 
weeks unusually high slaughter numbers levitt said 
there is no sign of a seasonal letup in supplies he said 
until we start to see the marketings subside the market will 
struggle with the large production 
live cattle settled 10 cent lower to 37 cent higher with april 
at 7397 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent lower to 30 
cent higher with april at 7967 cents a pound hogs were 32 cent

countries appear unwilling to cut their production but the market 
has so far ignored those bearish signals said michael rothman 
senior oil analyst for merrill lynch capital markets in new york 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 8 cents 
higher with may at 1837 a barrel heating oil was 24 cent to 43

friday for the second consecutive session as new worries emerged 
about inflation 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond fell point or 
625 for every 1000 in face value its yield which moves 
inversely to its price climbed to 894 percent from 886 percent 
late thursday 
the 30year bond dropped about 10 for every 1000 in face 
value moments after the government reported wholesale prices jumped 
06 percent in march the biggest increase in 11 months 
but prices later recoverered as buyers appeared when yields on 
the longest issues edged closer to 9 percent a height last touched 
in january 
the latest price decline came on the heels of thursdays sharp 
slide in stock and bond prices sparked by news of an unexpected 
widening in the us trade deficit 
most analysts had been looking for a more moderate gain in 
wholesale prices than the 06 percent rise reported by the 
government 
it catered to the markets recent fears about whether the 
economy is expanding too rapidly and is facing demand pressures 
and bottlenecks that would tend to move prices higher said 
william v sullivan jr director of money market research for the 
investment fir dean witter reynolds inc 
inflation erodes the value of fixedincome securities and 
increases the chances that the federal reserve board will encourage 
higher interest rates to curb rising prices 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
issues fell point intermediates lost 516 point and 20year 
governments fell point according to the financial information

world finance leaders wrapped up a tumultuous 
meeting of the international monetary fund on friday with more 
words of assurance to nervous financial markets and further efforts 
to rescue the us dollar 
the semiannual meeting of the 151nation imf was dominated by 
the dollars steep plunge after four months of relative stability 
in an effort to brake the nosedive the united states and its 
allies launched a multimilliondollar intervention effort selling 
off their reserves of japanese yen german marks and other 
currencies and buying dollars 
the intervention while doing little to slow the dollars 
descent on thursday met with more success on friday amid reports 
of further dollar purchases by the united states west germany and 
britain 
the dollar declined against the yen on markets in tokyo and 
europe but rallied later in the day in new york trading to close at 
1238 yen up from 1237 yen late thursday 
still the dollars rout shattered the optimistic tone the 
finance ministers had hoped to impart in their first highlevel 
discussions since the oct 19 stock market collapse 
the dollars plunge came less than 18 hours after the worlds 
seven largest industrial economies the united states japan west 
germany britain france canada and italy had issued a glowing 
appraisal of the world economy 
the socalled group of seven bragged in a joint communique 
wednesday that they had successfully stabilized the dollar since 
pledging to do so on dec 22 and reaffirmed their commitment to 
intervene in currency markets when necessary to keep the dollar 
stable 
instead of focusing on the words of optimism financial markets 
the next day were stampeded into a frantic dollar selloff following 
news that the us trade deficit widened to a disappointing 138 
billion in february 
administration sources who spoke on condition of anonymity 
confirmed friday that treasury secretary james a baker iii held a 
hasty 10minute conference with finance ministers from japan and 
west germany and federal reserve chairman alan greenspan to discuss 
the dollar selloff 
japan and west germany have supplied the largest amount of 
reserves to buy dollars currency traders estimated that on 
thursday alone the amount of intervention totaled as much as 700 
million sources said the intervention continued friday 
canadian finance minister michael wilson told reporters he found 
it encouraging that the markets had settled down somewhat on friday 
following the intervention effort which he termed a success 
i think the reaction thursday was one of surprise but we all 
realize that the trade figures are erratic and as people reflected 
on that things calmed down wilson said 
dutch finance minister h onno ruding who heads the imfs 
policymaking committee said the market turmoil came up in the 
discussions but he said that there was no undue concern 
members were aware of the development in the markets during 
their closeddoor session thursday but it has not changed 
dramatically the actions of our meetings ruding said we are 
trying to improve the world economic system regardless of the 
vagaries of the market from day to day 
ruding said the finance ministers decided against making any 
alterations in their assessment of global growth prospects the 
groups final communique on friday predicted continued growth for 
the world economy this year at a steady moderate pace 
the joint session of the imf and the world bank also addressed 
third world debt problems although no major new initiatives were 
unveiled 
world bank president barber conable in a speech friday said 
the overriding issue facing the two lending organizations was the 
need to reduce the poor countries debt burden which is estimated 
to total 1245 trillion at the end of this year 
nigel lawson british chancellor of the exchequer said one 
thing that would help would be a reduction in the interest rates 
the poor countries are being charged on their loans 
all of us know that there is no way in which the poorest 
countries can meet their interest payments he said the 
interest burden thus mounts exponentially and the poorest countries 
are thus caught in a vicious circle

the georgiapacific corp has suspended 
operations at its pulp and paper mill here and temporarily laid off 
400 employees while repairs are made to equipment that company 
officials said friday may have been sabotaged 
the closing follows a weeklong shutdown at a georgiapacific 
mill in vermont because of what the company also termed apparent 
acts of sabotage 
labor leaders have denied union involvment in the incidents at 
both mills 
the woodland mill was shut down thursday after a maintenance 
employee discovered two pounds of sand blasting shot in the gear 
box and lube system of a paper pulp washer in the bleaching plant 
mill manager jerry robinson said 
the machine has just been destroyed spokeswoman beth 
zoffmann said from the companys headquarters in atlanta if we 
cant make bleached pulp we cant make any paper and we cant 
make any bleached pulp 
robinson said the mill would remain closed and the 400 hourly 
workers laid off indefinitely while the washer is repaired and an 
investigation conducted into other areas of the mill 
company officials said the pulp washer was apparently 
sabotaged and maine state police detectives have been called in 
to conduct a criminal investigation lt john whynott said 
zoffmann said she did not know who might have tampered with the 
equipment which was located in an area accessible to all 
employees she also declined to say if the incident was related to 
stalled contract negotiations 
there is no evidence to indicate that it is she said i 
guess it would be speculation to say the union was involved 
jimmy dinardo vice president of the united paperworkers 
international union in new england said he did not believe union 
members were responsible 
the international does not condone anything like sabotage 
he said and i dont believe the company has proof of anything 
like that 
labor negotiations under way since july between 
georgiapacific the upiu and several smaller trade unions have 
been stalled and no date has been set to resume the talks the 
unions have been working without a contract since august 
among the sticking points are the unions demands for premium 
pay on sundays as well as the companys desire for more 
flexibility in assigning jobs and the opportunity to keep the mill 
open on holidays management of the pension fund has also been an 
issue 
this is not the first time equipment has been damaged at the 
mill and the cause attributed to sabotage in september another 
machine in the bleaching plant was found damaged during a regularly 
scheduled maintenance shutdown zoffmann said no one was found at 
fault in that incident and the investigation is continuing 
in vermont the georgiapacific paper mill in gilman was shut 
down april 613 because of what the company termed apparent acts of 
sabotage zoffmann said 185 workers including 140 union employees 
were sent home while police began an investigation into the dumping 
of dye in a vat of wallpaper stock 
police also are investigating an april 3 fire that damaged a 
garage and two vehicles at the littleton nh home of the gilman 
mills personnel manager 
workers at the gilman mill have been without a contract for six 
months and authorities in vermont have questioned whether the 
incidents are laborrelated union members have emphatically denied 
any connection

lawyers for some 1300 former xerox corp 
employees claiming they lost their jobs because of age 
discrimination asked a federal appeals court friday to allow them 
to sue for damages in a class action 
the case has bounced around the federal court system for five 
years and now it has bounced back to the third us circuit court 
of appeals where two judges said they were troubled that a lower 
court without considering statistical evidence had decertified a 
class of victims of an alleged pattern or practice of age 
discrimination 
according to briefs filed in the case xerox terminated forced 
to retire or denied promotion to at least 1300 people between may 
1980 and april 1983 in order to reduce its work force the lower 
court held they were not part of a class action because they had 
different jobs and different risks 
that is error said attorney robert dietz representing 13 
former salesmen of xerox facsimile devices who brought the appeal 
seeking to reinstate a 1984 order by the us district court in new 
jersey that had created a conditional class 
after nearly an hour of oral argument judges william 
hutchinson max rosenn and anthony scirica took the case under 
advisement 
a decision is not expected until sometime this summer 
robert jaffe another lawyer representing the employees said 
we are fighting the procedural barriers erected by a 
wellfinanced firm who have consistently denied that the reduction 
in force imposed by xerox targeted older workers even though the 
evidence we provided conclusively supports it 
you say the lower court failed to consider the statistical 
evidence or even company documents that supported it when it 
denied a class action designation asked rosenn 
right responded jaffe we ask you to instruct the trial 
court to consider that we say xerox conducted fraud on its older 
workers the undisputed facts of discrimination come from the 
companys own records what the lower court did was a clear error 
of law 
attorney robert del tufo representing xerox disagreed and 
contended that charges of discrimination must be proved 
separately by each claimant 
rosenn interjected that what troubles me is that in the 
district court opinion there is no discussion of the evidence 
hutchinson said he too was troubled because the judge 
didnt say what he found and that appears to be clear error 
rosenn added he ignored the statistical evidence and said it 
wasnt relevant should he have disregarded it thats what we have 
to decide 
del tufo argued that the statistical evidence is wrong and is

two computerized legal research services 
squared off in federal court friday for closing arguments in a 
twoweek copyright infringement trial a defense lawyer called a 
case of the emperors new clothes 
west publishing co filed suit against one of its competitors in 
1985 alleging copyright infringement west based in st paul 
accused mead corp and mead data central of illegally using wests 
copyright material in lexis their computerized legal research 
service 
mdc which distributes lexis is a subsidiary of mead corp a 
paper products manufacturer based in dayton ohio 
a case of the emperors new clothes is how i referred to 
this in my opening statement mead lawyer david c greer told the 
court the arrangements in this case are nothing more than legal 
finery which have been rigged up by some tailor 
last year mead sued west claiming that west is an illegal 
monopoly west also has filed an antitrust suit against mead 
bringing to three the number of lawsuits in which the two are 
engaged 
the copyright infringement trial heard by us district judge 
james rosenbaum is part of an 11count complaint the remaining 10 
counts will be resolved by judicial order once rosenbaum issues his 
ruling on the copyright issue 
wests national reporter system publishes judicial opinions for 
every state and federal court and the companys key number index 
system organizes and classifies case law 
west asks that mead and mead data central be permanently 
enjoined from continuing to copy wests materials and that the 
court impound and destroy all infringing materials 
mead took our materials they knew it and they expected to 
derive great revenue from it west lawyer vance k opperman 
argued we have both the right to copy and the right to display 
both have been infringed 
but mead claims theres been no infringement because west is not 
entitled to a copyright 
in no case does copyright protection from an original work or 
authority extend to an idea and if we have anything here all 
we have is an idea or concept greer argued 
greer said mead only wanted to make fair use of the 
materials and should have access to them 
west i submit confused access to the law with access to west 
books but west doesnt own the law greer said 
opperman argued that wests system reflects originality and is 
therefore protected by copyright 
this is the product of great intellectual effort great 
creativity opperman said

a federal judge friday blocked investors led 
by britains brian c beazer from proceeding with a 17 billion 
hostile takeover of koppers co but the judge left the door open 
for beazer to salvage the proposed deal 
us district judge maurice b cohill jr said that the novel 
role played by shearson lehman hutton inc in the takeover 
apparently requires the investment banking firm to file financial 
disclosure statements just like any other bidder shearson did not 
make the filings 
cohill said that since there is a great probability that 
the defendants have violated the williams act he was suspending 
the takeover until a trial can be held or the violations in the 
60pershare tender offer are corrected 
the williams act is intended to prevent manipulation of the 
stock markets 
the beazer group did not immediately indicate whether it would 
appeal cohills order or attempt to correct the technical defects 
and continue soliciting shares 
the tender offer was due to expire at midnight friday but the 
suitors are expected to extend the offer during the weekend 
beazer wants to combine his british and american holdings in 
construction and building materials with the pittsburghbased 
koppers a major us producer of building materials and chemicals 
shearson maintained that its partial ownership of beazers 
takeover company bns inc is merely an extension of traditional 
lending practices in corporate acquisitions 
the shearson interests appear to be somewhat stealthily 
pioneering the brave new world of equity financing the judge 
said in his 95page opinion and order as the legendary camel 
once got his nose in the tent intending to follow with its entire 
body so shearson seems to be pursuing an agenda of its own 
shearsons new approach prompted members of congress to propose 
legislation against the takeover and to call for investigations 
cohill said this is a difficult case made all the more 
complex by shearsons quite novel role as 
brokerdealerinvestment bankeradviserowner 
the facts are intricate and complicated the law is fuzzy 
he said 
cohill also said beazers plans to borrow 864 million from a 
bank syndicate led by citibank likely violate federal reserve board 
rules about posting stock as collateral on loans used to buy the 
stock 
the order is the second against the tender offer in a federal 
court 
a judge in los angeles has blocked it on antitrust grounds the 
us 9th circuirt court of appeals will hear arguments may 13 on 
beazers attempt to overturn the los angeles ruling 
beazers plans to sell koppers chemical operations stoked fears 
of losing 1100 jobs in pittsburgh and cohill said the takeover 
should be halted for now because the potential ramifications 
to the pittsburgh community are uncertain and possibly adverse 
in a countersuit the beazer group said kopperss filings in 
response to the tender offer also violated securities laws but 
cohill said the tender offer apparently is invalid under federal 
securities laws and until a valid tender offer is made 
koppers is not obligated to file the proper disclosures

gms profit rose to 36 billion in 1987 from 295 billion in

us automaking business to pay profitsharing to its 350000 
hourly us workers 
the outcry over the millions of dollars executives received in 
bonuses for 1986 prompted gms board of directors in 1987 to switch 
to an allstock bonus and spread each stock grant over several 
years 
united auto workers union president owen bieber and vice 
president donald ephlin said the 1987 compensation received by top 
gm executives still cant be justified rationally and constitutes 
an insult to common sense and fairness 
during a time when gms automaking business is earning so 
little they said in a statement we will leave the executives to 
forego all increases and supplementary awards in the spirit of 
shared sacrifice
