mikhail baryshnikov has done more than touch up 
the paint on swan lake he has rethought it and the 
centerpiece of the american ballet theater production that opened 
at the metropolitan opera on monday night is the ultraromantic duet 
in act 2 
swan lake never was for feminists but this 15 million 
production first danced by the company in december in costa mesa 
calif is even more romantic than most 
the swan queen danced by susan jaffe on monday night as well as 
in the california premiere is shy at the beginning of her pas de 
deux with ross stretton the prince who is entranced by her as 
they dance she clearly falls in love begins to trust him becomes 
happy poised and feminine in general expands to her potential 
through loving a man 
one reason this works so clearly is that the music in the latter 
part of the pas de deux is slowed allowing the two performers to 
spin out their dance movements musically another reason is that 
throughout the ballet miss jaffe is able to act with body language 
as well as dance superbly 
her arms ripple in the approved way of a swan queen but with 
miss jaffe one notices the rest of her body as well when she 
appears in act 3 as the evil magician rothbarts daughter to 
trick the prince she is as glittering as a diamond but not as 
hard she maintains some of the softness she has as the swan queen 
baryshnikov chooses to have her wear white with sequins it 
works but we think a traditional black swan costume works 
better 
act 1 often something of a bore as people walk and stand 
around has been filled with enjoyable dancing by baryshnikov the 
men were giving real dancing and looked good we enjoyed the first 
acts pas de trois by deirdre carberry christina fagundes and john 
gardner the corps de ballet of swans in later acts also was fine 
the staging throughout stressed that swan lake is theater 
not just dancing for that reason the least interesting part is 
baryshnikovs act 4 dances for the swans much of it looks like 
unorganized swooping around for some reason six of them now are 
in black and four of those dance with four in white interest picks 
up when the swan queen now looking wounded but loving and 
forgiving and the prince come in 
rothbart danced by michael owen in a mask with a beaked face 
topped by tall feathers comes in loses his power in the face of 
true love and has a neat brief death scene his home tower isnt 
visible so nothing crumbles the lovers walk into the lake and 
ascend into heaven as the swans walk around becoming women the 
latter an interesting new touch 
baryshnikovs choreography is added to that of marius petipa and 
lev ivanov jack everly conducted

a woman described as the witch of a 
drugsmuggling cult accused in the ritual slayings of 15 people 
said monday that group members held her hostage after the killings 
were discovered 
it was like hell 24yearold sara aldrete villarreal told a 
news conference monday afternoon they treated me like a 
prisoner i was scared 
i dont know how i got into this without knowing what it 
was she said 
ms aldrete who has been called the cults witch by 
suspects was one of five people arrested in mexico city after a 
gunfight saturday as police closed in a group member shot and 
killed cult godfather adolfo de jesus constanzo and his 
righthand man on the order of constanzo himself according to two 
of those arrested and mexican authorities 
constanzo 26 a cubanborn resident of florida and ms 
aldrete his mexican companion were sought on both sides of the 
border after police discovered bodies of cult victims buried at a 
ranch in matamoros just across the texas border from brownsville 
on april 11 
a source at the mexico city attorney generals office speaking 
on condition of anonymity said monday two more women had been 
arrested in the case he refused to identify them or provide any 
details 
also monday the attorney generals office adamantly denied 
statements by us law enforcement authorities who have questioned 
if constanzo and his assistant are really dead 
deputy city attorney general abram leopoldo uzcanga told the 
news conference we have no doubt that these were the men 
he said both had been positively identified through fingerprints 
and showed reporters official documents that he said certified the 
identities autopsies on both bodies showed the men died from 
multiple gun wounds to the head and abdomen he said 
officials said they examined the bodies of constanzo and his 
righthand man martin quintana rodriguez at the central city 
morgue monday 
meanwhile police continued to grill the five people arrested 
saturday and investigate whether other ring members still are at 
large all five were booked on charges of homicide criminal 
association wounding a police agent during the arrest and 
property damage 
fausto popoca a spokesman for the city attorney general said 
in a telephone interview monday they will be formally arraigned 
shortly 
mexican authorities said constanzo and ms aldrete a former 
honor student at texas southmost college directed the human 
sacrifices and other rituals 
they said the rituals were meant to bring occult protection to 
the ring which trafficked mostly in marijuana to the united states 
among those sacrified was mark kilroy 21 a university of texas 
premed student 
alvaro de leon valdez a 22yearold mexican told a sunday news 
conference he killed constanzo and quintana with a burst of 
submachinegun fire in the fourthfloor apartment on constanzos 
orders the bodies were found slumped together inside a tiny closet 
de leon valdez said constanzo went berserk when he thought 
police were closing in tossing fistsful of 50 and 100 bills from 
the window and shooting at passersby who stopped to pick them up 
constanzo then ordered de leon valdez to kill him and slapped 
him when he hesitated 
constanzo went crazy crazy de leon valdez said he said 
to kill him because if i didnt it was going to go very badly for 
me in hell 
ms aldrete told reporters she had nothing to do with the ritual 
slayings and learned about them from watching television reports 
i couldnt believe it it was amazing she said 
she said constanzo whom she called el padrino spanish for 
godfather did most of the killings 
authorities said the rituals included mutilations and boiling of 
brains and organs 
de leon valdez said he watched as kilroy was killed with a 
machete chop to the head and his spinal column removed for a 
necklace 
ms aldrete said constanzo initiated her into the christian 
santeria cult last year santeria an offshoot of voodoo is a 
blend of catholicism and old african beliefs that include animal 
sacrifices

space shuttle atlantis 
landed on a gusty desert runway monday after putting us planetary 
exploration back on track with the launch of the unmanned magellan 
probe to venus 
atlantis touched down at 1243 pm pdt on a concrete runway at 
rogers dry lake after a fiery hourlong plunge from orbit 184 
miles above earth 
congratulations and nice landing said capsule communicator 
frank culbertson in houston youve extended the shuttles reach 
far beyond earth orbit now commodore magellan the 16th century 
explorer for which the venus probe was named would approve 
its good to be back its a great trip shuttle commander 
david m walker told reporters and space agency workers before the 
crew flew back to johnson space center four hours after landing 
we had a great time on orbit we hope you liked what we 
did said mission specialist mary l cleave 
the crew left the orbiter about an hour after landing and 
inspected its underside accompanied by senior national aeronautics 
and space administration officials they found little damage to its 
thermal tiles 
the vehicle looks about as clean as any one that ive ever 
seen richard truly nasas acting associate administrator for 
space flight told a postlanding news conference 
the magellan spacecraft is floating toward the planet 
venus to open up a new era of planetary exploration truly said 
only about 27500 of a predicted 100000 spectators braved 
baking heat to see atlantis dive through the thin high clouds and 
rock the desert with the its signature twin sonic booms 
about 200 people cheered the astronauts return home monday 
night at houstons ellington field even a few of the astronauts 
dogs were on hand to greet their 945 pm cdt arrival 
i cant tell you how grateful all of us are to those of you 
who have supported us personally and professionally through all 
these many months of training and through in fact our whole 
careers walker told the crowd of mostly johnson space center 
workers 
the astronauts left the airport with their families they were 
scheduled to report back to work tuesday to begin reviewing their 
mission 
just 12 minutes before touchdown atlantis was ordered to land 
on the concrete runway 22 rather than the hardpacked clay of 
runway 17 as dust devils whipped up by the variable winds twirled 
across the lakebed 
truly said the switch was apparently ordered because the 
crosswind angle was better on the concrete runway for a test of 
handling under such conditions a precursor to someday resuming 
landings at kennedy space center in florida 
the crosswinds at landing were believed to have ranged from 126 
mph to 207 mph which would have yielded significant 
information on such landings arnold d aldrich director of the 
shuttle program 
reentry began when two big engines at the rear of the 
spacecraft ignited and burned for 2 minutes 38 seconds over the 
indian ocean on atlantis 64th orbit 
the crew commander walker pilot ronald j grabe and mission 
specialists norman e thagard mark lee and mission specialist 
cleave rocketed into space from kennedy space center on thursday 
and launched the magellan spacecraft 
the 550 million probe will reach venus after a 15month 800 
millionmile journey and begin mapping the surface of earths 
cloudshrouded sister 
the trajectory is about as accurate as you can get said 
lennard fisk associate administrator for space science and 
applications i think we demonstrated with this flight that the 
shuttle is in fact very capable of putting a planetary mission up 
magellan marks the first new us planetary exploration in 11 
years the start of its mission was cheered by scientists working 
on a variety of programs that were delayed by the long hiatus in 
the shuttle program after the jan 28 1986 challenger disaster 
nasa last explored venus with the 1978 launch of the pioneer 
probe which examined the planets murky atmosphere and did some 
radar mapping magellans radar should map of 90 percent of the 
planet and with much greater resolution than pioneer 
the soviet union sent two venera probes to venus in 1983 but 
only mapped about a quarter of its surface 
atlantis mission the fourth since shuttle flights resumed 
sept 29 1988 had two significant technical problems the orbiter 
was 31 seconds from launch on april 28 when a shortcircuit was 
detected in a fuel pump delaying takeoff until the pump and a 
leaky fuel line were replaced on sunday one of the four redundant 
computers that control the shuttles systems failed 
the crew was able to restart the computer but mission 
controllers decided not to trust it for reentry the crew 
abandoned other tasks and spent 4 hours replacing the faulty 
computer with a spare the first time that had been done 
the shuttle could land with just one computer operating 
according to nasa 
until the computer problem developed the crew had worked on an 
experiment involving crystallizing a metal sample in a furnace and 
had photographed lightning and pollution on earth 
the workload for mission sts30 was light because magellan and 
its booster weighed 45000 pounds cutting the number of 
experiments that could be carried 
the mission also served to boost flight experience in the 
shuttle astronaut corps it was the third shuttle flight for 
thagard the second for walker grabe and cleave and the first for 
lee

a tiny barefoot 3yearold girl carries her even 
smaller sister on her back as she wanders onto a stage in 
madagascar to stand near the pope from faraway rome 
a french missionary in malawi springs from the crowd and breaks 
into a spontaneous african celebration dance at the foot of the 
altar waving his arms back and forth over his head 
a young beggar boy tugs at the robes of a bishop and pleads for 
a handout during a stadium youth rally in zambia 
these were some of the faces of africa that pope john paul ii 
glimpsed during his fifth trip to the continent 
the nineday tour which ended saturday provided the pope with 
the picture of an africa that suffers from some of the worst 
poverty in the world but bursts with a richness of tradition and 
faith 
everywhere he went from dusty airfields to regal presidential 
palaces john paul found a christianity that wont sit still even 
at masses usually solemn ceremonies the pope was surrounded by 
colorful dancers singers and tribal drummers 
the beautiful ceremonies and the wonderful spirit of 
celebration that accompanied them are special memories for me he 
said in his farewell speach in blantyre malawi i will treasure 
them 
some memorable moments from john pauls 41st foreign pilgrimage 
in antsiranana on the northern tip of the impoverished island 
of madagascar a french missionary nun brings an abandoned 
11monthold baby girl to receive the popes blessing at an 
openair mass angelicas mother is believed to be a prostitute 
at the end of the service the child is carried to the steps of 
the altar by the girls foster mother who kneels at the pontiffs 
feet the pope takes angelica in his arms kisses her on the 
forehead and gives her his blessing 
we wanted the popes benediction to give hope to all abandoned 
children says jeanine couve the french nun who runs an 
orphanage 
in antananarivo the capital of madagascar the pope is 
getting ready to address tens of thousands of youths in a soccer 
stadium when the 3yearold girl with her 1yearold sister on her 
back wanders out of the dancing crowd climbs the steps of the 
stage and walks over to where john paul is sitting 
the pope smiling broadly embraces both of them and gives them 
rosaries the girl stands next to the pope for a few minutes before 
slipping back into the crowd 
in lusaka zambia the pope mixes with the youths in the 
independence stadium and briefly joins them in swaying to the 
lilting african beat 
your desire to celebrate in song and dance today shows the 
churchs desire to celebrate and share the message of christs love 
with the whole world he says 
the women flight attendants on an air malawi flight from 
blantyre to lilongwe fall to their knees in the aisle to serve the 
pope a gesture that not only shows respect but also is in keeping 
with womens traditional subservience to men in malawi 
in a striking sign of the order and discipline in the former 
british colony of malawi the tens of thousands of people lining 
the papal motorcade route in blantyre stand in a perfect nearly 
motionless line for miles without a single barrier or armed 
policeman to hold them back 
malawis presidentforlife hastings kamuzu banda orchestrated 
some of the most unusual scenes of the popes tour often upstaging 
his guest 
at the welcoming ceremony at the blantyre airport banda 
wearing a homburg carrying an elephant hair fly wisk and 
surrounded by his personal cadre of hundreds of brightly costumed 
women dancers joked with the pope and pulled him up from his chair 
for a long embrace 
banda who is believed to be in his early 90s took center stage 
again at a mass the following day with the pope waiting in a hall 
nearby banda and his official hostess mama c tamanda 
kadzamira arrived 10 minutes late in a black mercedes limousine 
encircled by his dancers and waving his fly wisk out the window 
the pope doesnt take these things too seriously said 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro he understands the need to 
understand and adapt to local cultures

parishioners who donated thousands 
of dollars to their roman catholic priest were shocked to discover 
after his death that he spent hundreds of dollars a month on a 
greyhound racing ring 
the rev thomas flahive pastor of our lady of guadalupe church 
for 28 years until he died of a brain hemorrhage in 1985 quietly 
ran an international racing dog operation for more than a decade 
records show 
during that time concerned parishioners clothed him gave him 
furniture and even helped pay for annual trips to his native 
ireland where it turns out he also kept dogs 
to me deception is dishonesty said parishioner eileen 
miguel 
the priests double life was exposed in a 500000 lawsuit filed 
by flahives rectory housekeeper who claimed she invested her 
salary into his dograising endeavor and failed to receive ample 
compensation after his death 
virginia betz died of cancer in december before the suit went to 
trial and her heirs are considering whether to pursue it 
records show flahive spent hundreds of dollars a month to train 
his dogs pampering some on sirloin steak and chicken while he 
lived frugally at the rectory 
the priest owned more than 90 greyhounds in the united states 
over the last decade of his life according to records from the 
national greyhound association in abilene kan 
the clergyman also bought an airconditioned desert home in 
bermuda dunes and transformed it into a luxury kennel for his 
greyhounds 
revelations of his financial capabilities contrasted the 
impression parishioners had of their spiritual leader 
in the rectory everything was more or less handmedowns 
ms miguel said anything that was needed we went out and paid 
for we were glad to do that because we thought he was really so 
poor 
his flock might be resentful but the catholic diocese of san 
bernardino in a letter to ms miguel found absolutely no 
evidence that would cast any doubts on the integrity of father 
flahive 
he left most of his estate appraised at 283094 to the 
catholic church

a man who served as president of the vietnam 
veterans of americas dallas chapter gave speeches about seeing 
buddies killed in southeast asia but never served in vietnam 
military records show 
the closest joe testa came to the military was fort hood near 
killeen the dallas times herald reported 
he was absent without leave twice received suspended sentences 
totaling nine months of hard labor and never rose above the rank of 
private records show 
testas ability to rise to the presidency of the veterans 
group before he was removed in january illustrates a growing 
problem as america shows a belated appreciation for those who 
served in vietnam some people are embellishing their roles in the 
war and even fabricating military careers 
when the war was unpopular people were reluctant to admit 
they had served in vietnam said barry kasinitz public affairs 
officer for the 30000member vietnam veterans of america in 
washington dc but now being a vietnam veteran is chic and 
you see an awful lot of people making up war stories 
experts say some do it for glory or attention some to justify 
their drug abuse unemployment or other personal problems and some 
for the camaraderie of veterans groups where they can drink beer 
and swap stories real or imagined about the war 
these are people who wanted to be combat vets who as males 
in our society felt they had to prove themselves by fighting in a 
war said david rodriguez a veterans counselor in dallas but 
they were unwilling or they didnt get the opportunity to go to 
vietnam 
so now they live the experience vicariously they hang around 
with vietnam vets and call themselves vietnam vets 
veterans and government officials said there may be legions of 
people who have invented or inflated their military service in 
southeast asia the impostors often go unchallenged said bg 
burkett treasurer of the vietnam veterans memorial fund of texas 
the etiquette among vietnam vets is you dont ask about 
another vets experience said burkett an army lieutenant in 
vietnam and now a dallas stockbroker if they want to talk about 
it fine but you dont pry that allows fraud to exist even among 
vietnam veterans 
testa moved and did not leave a forwarding address according to 
the us postal service and his former employer tinamou corp a 
marketing firm the telephone directory has no listing for testa in 
the dallasfort worth area 
representatives of dallas veterans groups and the veterans 
administration say they dont know his whereabouts

hoping to rebuild the ancient jewish temple 
where islamic shrines now stand a group of israeli rabbis are 
compiling computerized lists of potential priests weaving seamless 
linen robes and reproducing a gemstudded breastplate described in 
exodus 
the plan would place the temple altar on what some 
ultrareligious jews believe is its historical site the spot is 
where the goldtopped dome of the rock now stands a jerusalem 
landmark and one of the holiest sites of islam 
the seemingly irreconcilable claim by arabs and jews to the 
area known to jews as the temple mount and to arabs as haram al 
sharif or noble enclosure is one of the most emotional issues 
of the arabisraeli conflict 
any attempt by israel to reclaim it would be certain to stir 
tensions throughout the moslem world the government does not 
support the rabbis plan to rebuild the temple 
all jewish history as far as were concerned is one big 
parenthesis until the temple is returned said rabbi nahman 
kahane of the temple institute 
it isnt like moslems who have to make the pilgrimage to mecca 
only once in a lifetime in judaism three times a year a person is 
mandated by the torah to go to the temple life without the temple 
is not really living said kahane who immigrated from new york 
city 
the temple institutes 50 rabbis and artisans have made temple 
vessels and produced a computerized blueprint of the shrine in 
preparation for rebuilding it on the site where it stood until ad 
70 when the romans destroyed it 
more than 200000 has been collected to finance the project 
most of it from american jews according to institute director 
rabbi yisrael ariel 
in the centuries since the temples destruction the 35acre 
rectangular platform has become a sacred islamic site marking the 
spot where the prophet mohammed is said to have ascended to heaven 
it encompasses the dome of the rock and al aqsa mosques 
considered islams holiest places of worship after mecca and medina 
tensions mounted last month when israel began barring moslems 
from worshiping at al aqsa after arab rioters threw stones that 
landed on jews praying at the adjacent western wall 
the restrictions prompted accusations that israel had reneged on 
a pledge to maintain freedom of worship at moslem holy sites 
adherence to the policy had been a source of pride since israel 
seized the old city and its shrines from jordan in the 1967 middle 
east war 
this is an ugly action and a serious matter not acceptable by 
religion or by law said sheikh mohammed al jamal deputy 
director of the moslem trust that controls islamic properties 
moslems have the right to express themselves politically within 
the mosque 
jewish militants have disputed israeli measures that in an 
effort to prevent sectarian conflict bar them from praying freely 
on the temple mount 
the moslems built the mosques against the feelings of the jews 
and this must be changed said gershon salomon of the temple 
mount faithful a group dedicated to regaining israel control of 
the site 
asked what he would do about the mosques he replies i honor 
moslem feelings about mecca so we shall help them to take the two 
mosques to mecca and rebuild them there 
kahane rejects such ideas as crazy 
there is no amount of money that would induce the moslems to 
move those mosques but nothing could compel us to give up the 
temple either said kahane brother of rabbi meir kahane the 
founder of the antiarab kach party 
it is up to god to decide said the greybearded kahane who 
says he is confident the temple will be restored in his lifetime 
to speed the process kahane has computerized a list of about 
1000 israeli descendents of the biblical high priests called 
kohanim in hebrew and recorded their addresses and professions 
this way when the messiah comes i can say here mr 
messiah heres your data base said kahane whose own name 
appears on the list 
to show what his dream might look like kahanes cramped office 
contains a photomontage of jerusalem with a replica of the second 
temple superimposed on the temple mount the dome of the rock and 
al aqsa have been eliminated 
on display at the institutes museum are reproductions of 30 of 
the 93 items required for daily temple worship including the 
copper wash basin used by priests to wash their hands and feet 
their seamless linen garments and the high priests golden crown 
currently under construction are a sixfoot high menorah 
ornately worked in silver and the high priests breastplate set 
with 12 gemstones representing the tribes of israel 
the items are described in exodus the chapter of the bibles 
old testament that chronicles the religious history of the jews 
flight from egypt

just about everybody in the democratic party 
seems pleased at the prospect that jesse jackson might run for 
mayor of washington in 1990 and not for president of the united 
states in 1992 
its a great idea from a democratic point of view a strategic 
point of view and for jesse and the city said donna brazile a 
political consultant who has worked for jackson and other 
democratic presidential candidates 
after two groundbreaking presidential campaigns that altered 
democratic politics jackson is tantalizing party leaders with 
hints he might forego a third campaign and run instead for mayor of 
washington he has said he would consider the race only if his 
friend marion barry does not seek reelection 
its a winwinwin situation for everybody except mayor 
barry said al from executive director of the democratic 
leadership council a group of moderate democrats many of them 
southerners 
the idea has won enthusiastic if tentative support from nearly 
all parts of the democratic party and carries appeal for both 
jacksons backers as well as his detractors 
by taking himself out of the presidential race jackson would 
release his monopoly on black votes in the primaries open up the 
party to other potential contenders and some believe make it 
easier for democrats to unite in the fall and win back the white 
house 
it would incredibly change the dynamics of the nominating 
process in 1992 said from 
jackson could provide a highvisibility replacement for the 
scandalplagued administration of barry who is viewed by some as 
becoming a national embarrassment to the democratic party jackson 
could direct his motivational abilities to help stem the 
drugsanddeath epidemic in the majorityblack city should he win 
barry has been plagued by repeated embarrassments and 
suggestions of personal impropriety he is currently under 
investigation for visits to the hotel room of a friend later 
indicted on cocainedealing charges and has seen top appointees 
convicted of criminal wrongdoing in office 
such a change would require a lowering of political sights for 
jackson but some argue it would make sense for him as he could 
escape a likely third presidential defeat and gain a reliable local 
base something he doesnt have in chicago where he has backed 
two losing mayoral candidates 
and in the process jackson could pick up some government 
experience which if successful could help him in a future 
national race 
in keeping with jacksons style however his intentions remain 
unclear and are shrouded in carefully worded answers and cryptic 
signals 
jackson told interviewers from the washington post and new york 
times that he has not yet made a determination to run when the 
washington mayoral seat is up in 1990 and that he would not oppose 
barry an old friend from the civil rights movement 
if barry stepped aside however jackson said thats a 
different situation and he said he has speeded up planned 
remodeling of a vacant house he owns in washington and may move 
from chicago when it is ready 
jackson has until november a year ahead of the mayoral 
election to shift his legal residence to the district if he is to 
be a candidate 
several political activists who are close to jackson said the 
preacher and civil rights leader is seriously considering the 
mayoral race and has held lengthy discussions on the subject 
it has become a lot more real possibility in the last couple 
months said ann lewis an adviser in his 1988 campaign 
he clearly has been getting advice and to some extent is 
seeking it said another adviser who wants him to make the race 
and who spoke on condition of anonymity 
but it is the impact on the national political scene that makes 
the dc mayoral race such a subject of intense interest 
you really havent had any other candidates compete with jesse 
jackson for the black vote so that would be a big change said 
ohio state democratic chairman james ruvolo 
frank greer a consultant to democratic candidates said 
jacksons exit would trigger a collective sigh of relief among 
democrats eliminating what many see as a polarizing influence 
by running for mayor jackson would not necessarily eliminate 
himself from the presidential race two years later but most 
observers assume he would and there is debate over whether that 
would help liberal or more moderate or conservative candidates 
while creating an opening on the partys left jacksons exit 
might also allow room for another candidate to put together a 
biracial coalition such as jimmy carter did in 1976 
mark mellman a pollster who worked for tennessee sen albert 
gore jr in the 1988 primaries argues that gore was the second 
choice of many southern black political leaders and could have won 
some of the southern and other states won by jackson without him in 
the race 
i dont think it automatically pulls the debate to the left in 
an ideological way mellman said 
from said potential 1992 candidates such as gore sen sam nunn 
of georgia sen chuck robb of virginia and gov bill clinton of 
arkansas have demonstrated an ability to appeal to black voters and 
might be given an opening by jacksons exit 
and from argues all the democratic candidates might have the 
chance to gain more attention and escape the seven dwarfs image 
that dogged the party in 1988

a drug best known for its use in treating 
hyperactive children eased mental and emotional impairment caused 
by the aids virus in a new study a researcher reports 
the results emerged when ritalin was given to 97 patients with 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome or aidsrelated complex said 
francisco fernandez 
seventysix percent showed moderate to marked improvement in 
such areas as energy vigor and mood while 67 percent showed gains 
in such areas as reaction time information processing speed and 
longterm memory he said 
fernandez is chief of the psychiatric consultation service at 
st lukes episcopal hospital and assistant professor of psychiatry 
at the baylor college of medicine in houston 
he spoke in a recent interview before addressing a symposium 
sunday at the annual meeting of the american psychiatric 
association 
ritalin also called methylphenidate is often prescribed for 
children with attention deficit disorder which commonly produces 
hyperactivity despite that use it is actually a stimulant 
when the aids virus attacks the brain it can cause such 
symptoms as memory loss mental slowing confusion disturbances in 
body movement apathy withdrawal depression and anxiety 
none of the patients in the new study was taking azt an aids 
drug that has been shown to ease impairment in mental functioning 
caused by the aids virus fernandez said 
side effects in the study were eliminated by changing dosages 
fernandez said twelve patients had initial shortterm changes in 
blood pressure and pulse twelve exhibited nervousness and 
restlessness and two had insomnia he said 
fernandez stressed that ritalin is not a cure but rather a 
helpful auxilliary treatment for some mood and thinking problems 
caused by the aids virus 
stimulants such as ritalin have been used for some time to 
improve mood and energy in people with cancer or aids and the new 
research shows it also helps mental performance said william 
breitbart assistant attending psychiatrist at the memorial 
sloankettering cancer center in new york 
in contrast to azt stimulants do not fight the aids virus 
directly he said in an interview instead they improve mood and 
concentration which helps patients perform better on mental tests 
he said 
were really not improving anything in their brain but were 
giving them an edge for using what theyve got breitbart said 
its getting a little more juice out of the system

highdefinition television was the 
undisputed star of this years national association of 
broadcasters convention dominating conversations around hotel 
lobbies at restaurants and in numerous technical and policy 
sessions 
a dozen companies laid out advanced television displays 
covering 22000 square feet as they tried to convince tv station 
owners and engineers that crisper widescreen tv images and 
compact discquality sound will be worth the large investment in 
new equipment 
some estimates have put the cost at 3 million to 18 million to 
convert a tv station to full hdtv capability 
at the same time no one knows if tv viewers will pay the 
30004000 that hdtv sets are expected to cost when they first 
appear in this country probably by 1995 
but no matter how hdtv develops many members of congress want 
to make sure its an american show those congressional proponents 
see hdtv which is expected to be a 50 billion business in 20 
years as a means of revitalizing a us electronics industry that 
was decimated by competition from lowcost asian imports in the 
1970s 
american industrial competitiveness in advanced electronics 
especially consumer advanced electronics is not what it should be 
is not what it could be and highdefinition television does 
offer a vehicle to combat that loss of competitiveness rep don 
ritter rpa told an nab session 
ritter has introduced a bill to pump at least 100 million a 
year in federal grants or loans into hdtv research as well as 
revising antitrust and trade laws to spur a us hdtv industry 
and he said the japanese have no right to criticize this team 
america approach 
i dont think its appropriate to be lectured to by the 
japanese on how to deal with important technological advance when 
it comes to ones own national interests he said to an 
appreciative audience of broadcasters 
although it will be at least two years before the federal 
communications commission decides on standards for overtheair 
hdtv broadcasts companies such as nbc zenith japans nhk 
broadcasting network and others are beating the drums for their 
competing approaches to advanced television 
the fcc has said a us hdtv system must not make the nations 
existing 160 million tv sets obsolete that means manufacturers 
must find ways to give viewers both the standard signal called 
ntsc and the new hdtv signal for those who have special tv sets to 
receive them 
hdtv signals typically pack seven times as much information as 
do ntsc signals 
no one has yet demonstrated a way to fit that much information 
into current tv channels without causing interference with 
neighboring channels 
hdtv probably will need more space and it will be up to the fcc 
to decide whether to give hdtv a bigger chunk of the already 
crowded airwaves 
some are proposing that stations broadcast two signals the 
standard ntsc signal and then a second highdefinition signal on a 
channel that isnt being used currently 
older sets would receive the ntsc signal while new hdtv sets 
could receive both the old and new signals 
others want stations to send a standard ntsc signal that when 
combined with another signal on an adjacent channel would create 
hdtv 
others such as nbc are taking a more cautious approach its 
advanced compatible television system provides an enhanced tv 
image that nbc is promoting as a lowcost interim step towards true 
hdtv 
the actv system which is being developed by nbc rca and the 
david sarnoff research center was demonstrated at the nab meeting 
nbc also demonstrated computer simulations of the proposed 
second generation of actv which would provide double the clarity 
of existing tv displays and very highquality sound considered 
true hdtv 
zenith officials at nab claimed they had found a way to fit 
their spectrum compatible hdtv signal into the amount of space 
six megahertz that tv stations need for each channel without 
causing interference with adjacent channels 
zenith doesnt have such a system yet but it proposes to 
transmit its signal on the socalled taboo channels that arent 
being used on the tv dial 
fcc regulations require that stations in a single market 
separate their signals by one channel in order to avoid 
interference if for instance a community has stations on 
channels 7 9 11 and 13 channels 8 10 and 12 would be open 
zenith says there are enough empty channels to allow 997 
percent of all us broadcasters to transmit hdtv signals it 
expects to have hardware available for testing by the end of the 
year 
nhk was promoting its enhanceddefinition system muse6 that 
will provide a better picture to existing tvs and it also showed 
an hdtv system muse9 that would require 15 channels to transmit 
hdtv sets would combine the 15 channels into one to produce an 
hdtv picture while older sets would receive only the one standard 
channel 
a small california company faroudja laboratories says others 
are barking up the wrong tree in their pursuit of hdtv faroudja 
has found a way to dramatically improve current ntsc tv signals to 
create what faroudja calls superntsc 
faroudjas system was used to broadcast an enhanced tv signal at 
nab and it was used on a videotape of the movie indiana jones 
and the temple of doom 
the faroudja exhibit attracted large numbers of spectators at 
the hdtv demonstration area at the las vegas convention center 
where a large barco video projector displayed very highquality 
images of the movie on a screen 85 feet wide and 12 feet high but 
scenes shot on video cameras were not nearly as good 
faroudja achieves its improved picture by removing flaws from 
the standard ntsc signal and by doubling the number of lines of 
horizontal dots used to paint a picture on a tv screen from 525 
to 1050 
faroudja officials say their system can be installed at tv 
stations for a fraction of the cost of competing hdtv systems and 
that it even will improve the picture on older tv sets

a renewed push for greater drought relief in 
kansas and other stricken grain areas is likely to be one of the 
results when the agriculture department issues a longawaited 
estimate of winter wheat production later this week 
dry conditions last fall harsh winter cold and continued 
drought in early spring have bitten deeply into 1989 harvest 
prospects winter wheat with kansas normally its biggest producer 
provides about threefourths of the nations total wheat output 
according to usda projections which will be revised thursday 
when the new report is issued the 1989 total wheat crop could be 2 
billion bushels or less a far cry from the sharply expanded output 
that was foreseen last fall 
last years drought cut the 1988 harvest to 181 billion 
bushels resulting in reduced supplies for export and higher market 
prices federal planting curbs were eased for 1989 and usda 
analysts expected production to rebound sharply 
president bushs budget proposals to congress earlier this year 
included an assumption that us wheat production this year would 
be around 255 billion bushels even until recent weeks usda has 
been saying unofficially that 1989 wheat production could be as 
much as 245 billion bushels 
but further deterioration and evidence of widespread winter 
damage in kansas and other areas have cast a pall on the situation 
last week for example the senate approved a nonbinding 
resolution calling for drought assistance to winter wheat 
producers it calls for making federal aid available to winter 
wheat growers by extending drought programs enacted last year 
but the usda has said the 1989 winter wheat crop doesnt qualify 
for any of the 39 billion in assistance approved in 1988 for 
farmers hurt by drought in the midwest and northern great plains 
resolutions such as the one introduced by sens bob dole and 
nancy kassebaum of kansas do not have any power of law and are 
designed to express the opinion of the senate 
dole citing new usda figures said drought assistance for wheat 
growers could cost 250 million to 350 million and should be 
covered by expected savings in federal wheat subsidies 
crop prices are projected to rise because of a smaller wheat 
harvest from the drought which in turn should lower direct subsidy 
payments to farmers 
in fact agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said in a may 3 
letter to dole and others that the estimate of 250 million to 350 
million was based on a projected winter wheat crop of 2 billion to 
22 billion bushels this year 
that would mean the 1989 us wheat crop could be as much as 22 
percent below the expectations of budget makers a few months ago 
and perhaps only 10 percent more than the droughtshriveled 1988 
harvest

if further tests work out consumers one day 
may see on their grocery store shelves rosy red tomatoes that are 
truly vineripened 
scientists at cornell university in ithaca ny say an 
experimental process could keep vineripened tomatoes from turning 
into spoiled mush before they can be sold in grocery stores 
according to the university the process involves the vacuum 
infiltration of a chemical solution into the vineripe tomato 
through its stem or stem scar the substance is a naturally 
occurring polyamine 14 butanediamine which is said to be 
present in all living things 
the tiny amount of the substance about 1 milligram per tomato 
causes the ripening process to stop temporarily the effect is to 
extend the shelf life of vineripened tomatoes to 10 to 12 days 
from only four or five normally 
peter j davies a cornell professor of plant physiology said 
in a recent report that we simply increase the level of 
polyamines that are already in the fruit thus preventing the ripe 
fruit from becoming soft too quickly 
the current practice of tomato production and sale is to pick 
tomatoes while still green which diminishes their flavor by the 
time they are sold at produce counters the report said 
in the cornell method the tomato is picked after it begins to 
ripen on the vine which is indicated by the first appearance of 
orange color 
cornell researchers who were supported by grants from the 
universitys biotechnology program the frasch foundation and the 
agriculture department said they got the idea of using polyamines 
while studying an obscure tomato from brazil the alcobaca 
the brazilian tomato has to be ripened fully on the vine 
because it refuses to ripen if picked green the report said 
subsequent investigations showed the butanediamine content of 
the brazilian tomato was about triple that of regular varieties 
we think that this particular compound plays a key role in 
slowing the ripening process of the brazilian tomato but other 
plant hormones also may be involved davies said 
although the cornell method has worked successfully in 
laboratory tests whether it can be used under commercial 
conditions remains to be seen the report said

united states from spain in the early 1960s she saw america as a 
place to be anything she wanted 
and for a while it was picciotto says she settled in new york 
city got a job as an interpreter for an office of the spanish 
embassy married gave birth to a daughter and lived out the 
classic american dream 
but somewhere along the way that dream fell apart now she 
lives in lafayette park across the street from the white house 
where she protests injustices in the american political system 
i never dreamed to be a protester in my life she said i 
found out that the united states is not an ideal country 
flanked by large signs decrying nuclear arms picciotto spends 
her days painting rocks with doves and messages of peace and 
passing out antinuclear literature to tourists and passersby 
we have to assure that we have a world we are on the brink of 
having a nuclear holocaust she said all they government 
officials care about is just building weapons

lafayette park since 1981 she claims to have kept up the longest 
vigil of any demonstrator in the park 
to comply with park rules which prohibit camping picciotto gets 
by with the bare minimum local charities give her food tourists 
give her donations for her rocks picciotto said she leaves her 
post only for an infrequent shower or to use a bathroom 
her bed is an afghancovered box next to a sign where she 
perches at night lest a passing policeman find her asleep and 
accuse her of camping 
she is required to stay within three feet of her demonstration 
signs or else risk a 50 citation she keeps up on current events 
with secondhand newspapers from trash cans 
you have to learn how to survive piocciotto said

a federal committee today rejected the idea of 
requiring seat belts on the nations more than 300000 larger 
school buses concluding that it would cost 40 million and save an 
average of just one life a year 
the overall potential benefits of requiring seat belts in 
school buses is insufficient to justify a federal standard 
mandating installation said a committee of the national research 
council after an 18month study the nrc was set up by the national 
academy of sciences 
the committee said however that some steps should be taken to 
improve what transportation officials say already is one of the 
safest public conveyances including raised seat backs and programs 
to prevent accidents while children are getting on and off the 
buses 
the group estimated that if all school buses were equipped with 
seat belts for each passengers and half the students used them it 
might save one life and prevent several dozen serious injuries a 
year it would cost 40 million a year to equip and maintain all 
larger school buses with passenger seat belts the study said 
raising seatback heights from a minimum of 20 inches to 24 
inches could save two to three lives prevent up to 95 serious 
injuries and cost about 6 million a year the report said 
the national highway traffic safety administration does not 
require seat belts in buses rated at more than 10000 pounds gross 
weight that typically carry more than 16 passengers smaller 
vanlike buses must have belts however 
the study ordered by congress and funded by the department of 
transportation recommended that all states prohibit children from 
standing on school buses when they are in motion some states allow 
school buses to carry more children than there are seats 
the committee which included a wide range of safety and 
transportation experts also recommended that states local school 
districts and private contractors stop operating school buses made 
before 1977 because they do not comply with current safety 
standards 
buses built after 1977 have extra padding in seats protected 
fuel tanks and other modifications to make them less deadly in 
crashes 
the recommendation on older buses followed a similar conclusion 
from the national transportation safety board five weeks ago after 
an investigation into the headon collision between a pickup truck 
and an older school bus used by a church group in kentucky in may 
1988 that killed 24 children and three adults 
although that crash was blamed on the allegedly drunken driver 
of the pickup truck who is to face trial in november on 27 murder 
charges the safety board said design of the bus contributed to the 
severity of the accident the buss unprotected fuel tank burst 
into flames that spread fire and smoke through the bus 
the report said a minority of committee members felt seat belt 
use should be encouraged for all motor vehicles 
in reaching its conclusion that a school bus seat belt law is 
unwarranted the committee studied the experience of new york and 
several school districts in illinois new jersey virginia and 
arizona that have required safety belts 
the committee said that an average of 10 children a year are 
killed while riding school buses but 40 are killed while trying to 
board or leave a bus twothirds of them hit by their own or 
another bus 
the report proposed more careful driver selection and training 
mandatory stopsignal arms on all new buses and possible use of 
loudspeakers barriers and sensors to prevent pedestrian accidents 
although the death or injury of any child transported by 
school bus is cause for concern the safety record of school buses 
is good considering the amount of travel involved the report 
said us school buses log four billion miles a year 
the report said its four times safer to ride in a school bus 
than an automobile

federal drug czar william bennett says sending 
persons convicted of casual drug use to boot camps instead of 
jail would cost the government less money but still be a strong 
deterrent 
bennett interviewed sunday on cbs face the nation said he 
was considering such a plan as part of the overall antidrug 
strategy he is preparing for the bush administration 
you dont put them all in jail but you can fine every one of 
them you can take their cars away you can send people to boot 
camp bennett said 
we are looking into this boot camp thing which weve seen in 
several states which looks to be a very productive kind of thing 
in such a boot camp he said the drug offender gets up at 
430 in the morning he does pushups he runs a good bit and 
doesnt watch soap operas or tv as many people do in jail 
its inexpensive it teaches good lessons and the recidivism 
rate is very very low because it is so grueling and so unpleasant 
people dont want to go back to it he said

former military ruler hugo banzer suarez 
clung to a dwindling lead early monday in presidential elections 
according to partial unofficial returns and it appeared congress 
would have to choose a winner 
gonzalo sanchez de lozada of the governing party seemed poised 
to overtake banzer but neither seemed able to garner the 50 
percent of the vote in sundays balloting needed to assume the 
presidency 
the balloting was peaceful as voters in this impoverished nation 
stood patiently in lines to choose from among nine candidates to 
replace 81yearold president victor paz estenssoro who is 
retiring from politics 
voters also chose representatives for all 27 senate seats and 
all 130 house seats according to the constitution lawmakers must 
choose the president from among the top three finishers when no 
candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote 
the independent station american television said it had tallied 
669977 of the estimated 18 million ballots cast and that banzer 
and his centerright nationalist democratic action had garnered 
289 percent 
sanchez de lozada of the governing conservative revolutionary 
nationalist movement was second with 27 percent jaime paz zamora 
of the social democratic movement of the revolutionary left had 
227 percent and six other candidates trailed far behind 
banzers percentages slipped steadily from more than 30 percent 
in initial returns and american television predicted sanchez de 
lozada would pull ahead as more votes from the countryside came in 
the stations computerized projections showed sanchez de lozada 
with a final tally of 278 percent banzer with 253 percent and 
paz zamora with 23 percent 
banzer the frontrunner in polls was known to be strong in the 
cities where the vote was counted first while sanchez de lozada 
and paz zamora were counting on heavy support from rural areas 
where the vote was tabulated more slowly 
national election officials said they would not release any 
returns until at least midday today they said the complete count 
would take nearly three weeks as ballots trickle in from remote 
areas 
the new congress convenes on aug 4 and will have two days to 
decide on a new president who is to be inaugurated for a fouryear 
term on aug 6 
banzer had hoped for a convincing win by at least 5 percentage 
points to oblige congress to declare him president 
sanchez de lozada said he was confident he could win the 
presidency in congressional negotiations if he finished first or a 
close second 
even if banzer maintained his lead he ran the risk of being 
denied the presidency for the second straight time he finished 
first in the 1985 election but congress picked the runnerup 
estenssoro whose revolutionary nationalist movement had formed an 
alliance with the thirdplace movement of the revolutionary left to 
shut out banzer 
the election day calm was notable in what was once was south 
americas most politically volatile nation bolivia suffered 13 
military coups this century and had nine governments between 1978 
and 1982 
no serious violence was reported on sunday 
opposition parties made some complaints of fraud and 
authorities said three people were arrested for carrying several 
different identity cards apparently to vote more than once a la 
paz provincial official was arrested for voting twice officials 
said 
nonetheless election officials said they had no evidence of 
widespread irregularities and foreign observers said their initial 
impression was of a fair vote 
garcia pintos an uruguayan observer said voters are being 
provided with all guarantees we havent seen any sign of 
irregularities 
spirits ran high despite the long waits to cast ballots which 
were multicolored to help the 37 percent of the 67 million 
population who are illiterate 
this is a step forward for democracy said la paz 
businessman martin cariaga as he waited its another example of 
the maturity of the country 
banzer 62 seized power in a bloody coup in 1971 that toppled a 
leftist military dictatorship he ruled until 1978 when popular 
pressure obliged him to call elections 
banzer sanchez de lozada and paz zamora pledged to continue the 
governments battle against cocaine production and trafficking the 
united states provides about 55 million a year for drug programs 
to reduce coca leaf cultivation in bolivias jungles 
an estimated 300000 bolivians depend on coca leaf farming 
cocaine processing or trafficking for their livelihood government 
figures show coca leaves are the raw ingredient in cocaine

during reconstruction the state purchased the land for a black 
college hiram r revels the first black to serve in the us

boom over the next few years 
the republican president also will travel saturday to much 
larger mississippi state university in starkville to give another

students 
several alcorn state students said they were overjoyed to have a 
president visit no matter what his party affiliation 
however 19yearold thomas lewis of natchez was among the few 
not enthusiastic 
personally im a democrat he said i dont agree with 
his views on stuff so its no big deal to me 
others said they just hope bush actually comes unlike former 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson who scratched 
alcorn state from his campaign itinerary at the last minute

a couple of hours said 20yearold lutrenda smith of greenwood

the opposition and the government 
both claimed victory sunday before most votes were counted in a 
presidential election considered a referendum on the de facto rule 
of gen manuel antonio noriega 
the opposition claimed that forces loyal to noriega had 
perpetrated widespread fraud and some us observers reported 
witnessing irregularites 
turnout was high in sundays largely peaceful balloting which 
pitted noriegas handpicked candidate carlos duque against the 
oppositions guillermo endara 
the triumph of the opposition is indisputable endara said 
after polls closed but before any results had been announced he 
claimed there were serious irregularities and called for a 
protest march on monday 
endara told a news conference that he had won by a twotoone 
margin 
the government coalition countered in a statement that we can 
affirm that our triumph is decisive just honest and perfectly 
clear 
we are satisfied and grateful for the support of the people 
duque told a news conference he called opposition talk of fraud 
childish 
the victory speeches came as workers tallied paper ballots at 
polling places and both sides released exit polls that favored 
their side 
the opposition said its poll gave endara 551 percent of the 
vote to 391 percent for duque the government poll showed duque 
with 509 percent of the vote to 447 percent for endara 
in the only reported incident of violence the roman catholic 
church said a dutch priest was shot and seriously wounded by 
soldiers as he urged people over a loudspeaker to go to the polls 
in the western city of david 
voters began lining up at some polling stations at 5 am two 
hours before the scheduled opening at one booth more than 100 of 
348 registered voters were in line by 8 am the lines were gone by 
late afternoon 
the government promised official results within 24 hours 
the opposition accused the government of making arrangements for 
its supporters to vote early and often 
opposition vicepresidential candidate ricardo arias calderon 
charged that many members of noriegas 15000strong defense forces 
had voted more than once 
opposition leaders noted that soldiers were allowed to jump to 
the front of voting lines and that they could vote at any booth 
they said hundreds of opposition supporters who went to the san 
juan bautista de la salle college to vote were told they were not 
registered the college is in a wealthy district and the opposition 
enjoys wide support among the business community 
arias calderon one of the leaders calling for a protest march 
on monday also claimed three foreigners invited by the opposition 
were detained for several hours sunday before being freed 
sen john mccain rariz part of a 13member uninvited 
delegation sent by president bush said earlier the general 
belief is that the election will be stolen sometime tonight 
weve seen many irregularities but it is difficult to judge 
the extent of the irregularities he said 
former president jimmy carter however said he had seen no 
irregularities the only problem ive seen is with the number of 
voters he said carter was invited by the panamanian government 
along with former president gerald ford 
daniel nunez the roman catholic bishop of david said the rev 
nicolas van cleef was arrested by the defense forces while urging a 
high voter turnout and criticizing fraud over a car loudspeaker 
van cleef was shot while inside the car and was in grave 
condition the church said telephone calls to government spokesmen 
for comment were not returned 
the government contends the opposition has joined forces with 
the united states in an effort to abrogate the 1977 panama canal 
treaties which call for the united states to give the canal to 
panama on dec 31 1999 
duque cited damaging us economic sanctions us drug charges 
against noriega and reports that the united states provided the 
opposition with 10 million in campaign assistance 
the opposition denies the government charges and says noriega 
must be eased out if democracy is to progress in panama 
endara 52 and duque 59 are businessmen the new president 
takes office sept 1 
a progovernment newspaper la republica published official 
election tribunal figures showing progovernment parties with 
611000 registered members out of 118 million registered voters 
arias calderon repeated accusations that the electoral register 
included 100000 extra names and that out of a sampling of 3000 
recent deaths the names of 27 percent of the dead were still on 
the register 
noriegas hold over the defense forces has effectively given him 
control of the government since 1983 and he has been able to 
remove presidents at will 
in the last election in 1984 nicolas ardito barletta was 
narrowly elected over arnulfo arias madrid amid cries of fraud 
noriega had barletta resign and installed eric delvalle as 
president in 1985 
when delvalle tried to fire noriega in february 1988 after the 
general was indicted in the united states on drug charges noriega 
engineered delvalles ouster and installed solis palma as acting 
president 
noriega denies the drug charges

the father of a texas student slain and 
mutilated by members of a drugsmuggling cult said he was not 
surprised to see the ringleader slain 
the world wanted him caught said james kilroy father of 
mark kilroy whose remains were found in a mass grave april 11 
there were very few people would would put up with a guy like 
him 
adolfo de jesus constanzo 26 who was accused of leading the 
drugsmuggling ring that killed kilroy and 14 others was one of 
two men killed when mexico city police closed in on them saturday 
constanzo apparently ordered one of his followers to kill him 
when he realized arrest was imminent 
kilroy said late saturday it was inevitable that constanzo would 
surface 
it was the disappearance of mark kilroy on a spring break 
drinking foray into matamoros mexico that set off a massive 
police investigation that eventually alerted authorities to the 
deadly drug smugglers 
the cult was led by constanzo and his girlfriend sara aldrete 
who was described as the witch police said 
ms aldrete 24 was being held by mexico city police she was 
arrested along with four other men following saturdays shootings 
kiloy said he was disappointed when he first heard of 
constanzos violent end 
its unfortunate in a way that he was killed said kilroy 
he could have revealed a lot of drug information he could have 
revealed a lot of drug sources 
kilroy said he and his wife helen have tried not to think 
about the savage death of their son instead concentrating on a 
nonprofit foundation they have created in his name to fight drugs 
were definitely putting our feelings and energy into the 
fight against drugs kilroy said for that reason we dont 
look back we try to look forward

france has told new zealand it 
soon will start a new round of nuclear testing in the south pacific 
despite strong regional opposition a government official said 
today 
france has conducted 103 underground nuclear tests on the 
mururoa and fangataufa atolls since 1975 
deputy prime minister geoffrey palmer said he discussed the 
issue with prime minister michel rocard of france on sunday while 
the two were in the french territory of new caledonia for the 
funeral of slain independence leader jeanmarie tjibaou and his 
aide yeweine yeweine 
they were assassinated thursday on the island of ouvea 
palmer in an interview with radio new zealand said rocard was 
aware of strong regional sentiments against nuclear testing but 
that it was beyond his power to do away with the program 
disarmament minister fran wilde said rocards comments were 
unacceptable to pacific island nations 
there is an urgent need to stop the nuclear tests and the 
time to act is now she said new zealand will continue not 
only its strong opposition to the french testing program in the 
pacific but also its active promotion of a comprehensive test ban 
treaty

chinas unemployment rate of 2 percent will rise 
to about 35 percent this year as more people compete for fewer 
jobs an official newspaper said today 
the china daily quoted xi zhongsheng of the state commission for 
restructuring the economy as saying 10 million people will be 
looking for work this year with just 5 million jobs guaranteed by 
the state 
jobs are scarce this year mainly because the government in an 
austerity program to combat inflation and toorapid economic 
growth has canceled or suspended thousands of construction 
projects and cut off credit for new investment 
factory managers also have been given greater authority to hire 
and fire workers and have been encouraged to reduce the number of 
employees 
it has been estimated that 20 million to 30 million of chinas 
135 million workers are not really needed by their employers 
workers are rarely fired and get paid regardless of whether there 
is work to keep them busy 
the actual number of unemployed is thought to be far higher than 
government estimates because official figures apply to the nations 
urban workers not rural laborers who have left farms in search of 
jobs 
millions of people have given up farming to find work in rural 
enterprises during the past decade of economic reforms and 
millions more have flocked to cities for jobs in the booming 
construction and service industries 
since the austerity program was put into effect last fall 
however construction jobs have dried up and many rural industries 
have gone bankrupt because of a lack of credit and materials 
according to government figures about 27 million workers were 
jobless last year if 10 million additional people enter the work 
force this year and the unemployment rate rises to 35 percent 
more than 5 million people would be without jobs

a man whose two infant daughters died under 
similar circumstances within three years told police his wife was 
upset after giving birth apologizing both times for not having 
boys 
robert sims implicated his wife in the deaths and said he 
thought the deaths were accidents authorities said sunday the 
couple had told police the infants were abducted from their home 
police sgt rick mccain said investigators may have enough 
evidence to file charges against sims and his wife paula but 
added i want to make sure we have all our ducks in a row 
mccain has said the simses are the prime suspects in the 
suffocation death april 29 of their 6weekold daughter heather 
lee but that officials were awaiting the results of fbi tests on 
evidence before making arrests 
the simses also are suspects in the 1986 death of their 
13dayold daughter loralei according to jersey county sheriff 
frank yocom 
mccain said sims 37 told him the night of april 29 when mrs 
sims reported heather had been abducted that sims was somewhat 
suspicious of her story but that both deaths were accidental 
in the latest case mrs sims 30 told police that a masked 
gunman knocked her unconscious april 29 and that she believed he 
took heather she said her husband was at work 
a fisherman found heathers body in a trash can wednesday across 
the mississippi river in missouri the childs body had been 
refrigerated since her death about the time mrs sims reported her 
abducted mccain said earlier 
mrs sims account was nearly identical to one the couple gave 
authorities in loraleis case 
the remains of a child believed to be loraleis were found about 
a week after her disappearance near the couples home in nearby 
brighton where the couple then lived 
mccain said that sims on thursday night said he was unsure of 
his wifes masked gunman story and that his wife might be involved 
in the deaths of both his daughters 
the couple who have been staying with mrs sims parents in 
nearby cottage hills have refused to comment a person who 
answered the phone at the home sunday hung up when a reporter 
identified himself 
the simses attorney donald groshong was not at home sunday 
and could not be reached for comment groshong however has said 
his clients are innocent

custody on friday after sims told police the boy might be in 
danger mccain said

her roommate at the hospital what sex child she had had 
when the roommate said she had had a boy the sheriff said mrs 
sims said i wish we would have had a boy

crying saying she was sorry she did not have a boy yocom said 
mccain said mrs sims made similar statements after giving birth 
to heather

the governing party declared victory 
early monday for its presidential candidate gonzalo sanchez de 
lozada who was poised in unofficial returns to upset former 
military ruler hugo banzer suarez 
no contender won an absolute majority in sundays balloting 
however so law required that the new congress select the president 
while banzer still held a razorthin and shrinking lead in 
unofficial returns the campaign chief of sanchez de lozadas 
party andres petricevic projected that he would win 29 percent of 
the vote to 27 percent for banzer 
the balloting was peaceful as voters in this impoverished nation 
stood patiently in lines to choose from among nine candidates to 
replace 81yearold president victor paz estenssoro who is 
retiring from politics 
voters also chose representatives for all 27 senate seats and 
all 130 house seats according to the constitution lawmakers must 
choose the president from among the top three finishers when no 
candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote 
an independent television station the bolivian television 
association said banzer of the centerright nationalist democratic 
action party had won 278 percent of the vote and 274 percent for 
sanchez de lozada of the conservative revolutionary nationalist 
movement 
it based its computerized projections on a tally of 851437 
votes of the estimated 18 million cast nationwide 
jaime paz zamora of the social democratic movement of the 
revolutionary left was running third with 193609 votes or 227 
percent six other contenders trailed far behind 
banzers percentages slipped steadily from more than 30 percent 
in initial returns and another station american television 
predicted sanchez de lozada would pull ahead as more votes from the 
countryside came in 
banzer the frontrunner in polls was known to be strong in the 
cities where the vote was counted first while sanchez de lozada 
and paz zamora were counting on heavy support from rural areas 
where the vote was tabulated more slowly 
national election officials said they would not release any 
returns until at least midday today they said the complete count 
would take nearly three weeks as ballots trickle in from remote 
areas 
the new congress convenes on aug 4 and will have two days to 
decide on a new president who is to be inaugurated for a fouryear 
term on aug 6 
banzer had hoped for a convincing win by at least 5 percentage 
points to oblige congress to declare him president 
sanchez de lozada said he was confident he could win the 
presidency in congressional negotiations if he finished first or a 
close second 
even if banzer maintained his lead he ran the risk of being 
denied the presidency for the second straight time he finished 
first in the 1985 election but congress picked the runnerup 
estenssoro whose revolutionary nationalist movement had formed an 
alliance with the thirdplace movement of the revolutionary left to 
shut out banzer 
the election day calm was notable in what was once was south 
americas most politically volatile nation bolivia suffered 13 
military coups this century and had nine governments between 1978 
and 1982 
no serious violence was reported on sunday 
opposition parties made some complaints of fraud and 
authorities said three people were arrested for carrying several 
different identity cards apparently to vote more than once a la 
paz provincial official was arrested for voting twice officials 
said 
nonetheless election officials said they had no evidence of 
widespread irregularities and foreign observers said their initial 
impression was of a fair vote 
garcia pintos an uruguayan observer said voters are being 
provided with all guarantees we havent seen any sign of 
irregularities 
spirits ran high despite the long waits to cast ballots which 
were multicolored to help the 37 percent of the 67 million 
population who are illiterate 
this is a step forward for democracy said la paz 
businessman martin cariaga as he waited its another example of 
the maturity of the country 
banzer 62 seized power in a bloody coup in 1971 that toppled a 
leftist military dictatorship he ruled until 1978 when popular 
pressure obliged him to call elections 
banzer sanchez de lozada and paz zamora pledged to continue the 
governments battle against cocaine production and trafficking the 
united states provides about 55 million a year for drug programs 
to reduce coca leaf cultivation in bolivias jungles 
an estimated 300000 bolivians depend on coca leaf farming 
cocaine processing or trafficking for their livelihood government 
figures show coca leaves are the raw ingredient in cocaine

shot to death apparently ordering one of his followers to kill him 
when he realized he was going to be arrested 
mexican officials last month located 15 bodies at or near a 
ranch west of matamoros the dead including a us college

human sacrifices and mutilations to bring magical protection to 
drug smuggling

slain 
the world wanted him caught said james kilroy father of 
mark kilroy whose remains were found in a mass grave april 11

mexican officials say some of the men in custody in the case 
have reported that she played a major role in the cults activities 
across the river in brownsville sheriff alex perez said 
whatever she gets in punishment it wont be enough 
of constanzo the sheriff added i think that he should have 
maybe died a little slower death because that guy he was a very 
dangerous man 
the savagery with which the cult went about its drugrunning 
business stunned this border citys populace once the macabre 
ritualtinged activities became known 
some say theyll regularly look back over their shoulders for a 
while 
it wont be as tranquil as before martin cortez alvarez

a selfdescribed jewish grandmother and a 
nononsense italianamerican attorney top a crowded democratic 
primary field fighting for the legacy of the late mayor richard s 
caliguiri 
sophie masloff a city councilwoman who succeeded caliguiri 
after his death last may has been reported in recent polls to be 
running neckandneck with allegheny county controller frank 
lucchino four other candidates trail 
the winner of the may 16 primary should be the favorite in the 
november democrats make up 82 percent of the citys 220000 
voters compared to just 13 percent who are republicans 
the gop hasnt held the mayors office since 1933 and there are 
no republicans candidates for mayor yet 
the democratic contenders are battling for the right to continue 
the work of caliguiri who was credited with transforming 
pittsburgh from a sickly steelmaking town to a proud and 
progressive serviceoriented city of 365000 
the popular caliguiri held the office for 11 years and twice won 
reelection by landslides before dying at 56 of a rare protein 
buildup in his heart 
mrs masloff 71 a democratic loyalist for more than 50 years 
was city council president before succeeding caliguiri 
she often invokes her predecessors memory proudly proclaiming 
their shouldertoshoulder work in city hall particularly in a 
1985 drive to keep the pittsburgh pirates baseball team in town 
caliguiris widow jeanne has endorsed her 
in her year at the helm mrs masloff has cut the citys wage 
tax to 35 percent from 4 percent paved selected streets and put 
more police officers into the fight against drugs 
in addition to stressing her experience mrs masloff seeks to 
exploit her grandmotherly image and neighborhood folksiness 
im sophie to everybody she says nobody says mayor and 
nobody says mrs 
 
lucchino 50 is a thirdterm controller and former city 
councilman who also emphasizes his bluecollar and neighborhood 
roots but he counters mrs masloffs grandmotherly image with that 
of a nononsense administrator 
my number one priority is economic development and jobs 
lucchino said 
using a large campaign chest that opponents charge was garnered 
from rich and republican supporters lucchino has aired television 
spots showing him in rolledup shirtsleeves fighting for steel 
workers and other industrial jobs 
lucchino has won the endorsement of the citys two daily 
newspapers 
city controller tom flaherty 38 has the local partys 
endorsement but his campaign hasnt caught fire polls have shown 
him drawing the support of 15 percent or less of likely democratic 
voters behind masloff and lucchino at between 20 percent and 30 
percent each 
the other candidates include byrd r brown 59 an attorney and 
selfdescribed liberal who led the local branch of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people in the 1950s and 
60s and thomas j murphy jr 44 a state representative who 
talks about neighborhood service and a hightechnology future for 
the city 
gary henderson 45 a littleknown committeeman stopped 
campaigning for lack of funds but remains on the ballot

a thinning crowd of opposition voters 
waited patiently by the light of flickering fires as their ballots 
were painstakingly counted by precinct officials 
some had voted early sunday morning and had come back to watch 
the count proceed into the night 
theyre not going to steal it this time im going to stay 
here until dawn said a woman in a red blouse and pearls 
opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara claimed the 
government that gen manuel antonio noriega controls planned to 
steal the election as it is thought to have done in 1984 
theyre rabid for endara here i couldnt even wear my 
carlos duque button i was afraid theyd spit at me said wilma 
reina among the few government supporters in this welltodo 
opposition stronghold 
opposition to noriega is strong in panamas business community 
while the general gets much support from the lower classes 
at box 2472 one of seven set up in a dusty empty lot election 
officials had sat in a shed at a rough wooden table with party 
pollwatchers arrayed behind 
voters stepped up to the bench and profferred their 
identification cards which were checked by all and punched 
an elderly man was guided to the correct booth a man whose id 
card did not quite match the registration list was allowed to cast 
his ballot after a quick discussion 
the instructions say to assume minor problems are just 
mistakes or typos said one official 
by the time the polls closed 281 people had voted out of 348 
registered to box 2472 
i was hoping for a higher turnout fretted one opposition 
worker we need to win big here 
poll workers burned unused ballots and other voting material on 
the ground in front of the booth smoke drifted across the booths 
for hours 
at 7 pm two hours after the polls closed the count was 
progressing slowly as more than 200 people watched at the seven 
booths 
poll workers and watchers took turns opening envelopes and 
reading the contents aloud laughter broke out when white cards 
with the words i abstain printed in purple ink fell out of two 
envelopes 
the slower it goes the better for us muttered a lone 
soldier from noriegas defense forces 
after the cardboard urn was finally emptied at 930 pm 
everyone read their totals when counts varied the ballots were 
counted onebyone 
an argument arose over how to inscribe the totals on the 
official tally that goes to the election tribunal in figures or 
also written out 
if you dont write it out theyll put a one in front and 
change the vote said alcibiades broce an endara pollwatcher 
eduardo martin poll president replied angrily 
you should at least consult me before you decide he said 
there was nothing in the instructions about writing out any 
numbers 
stop discussing it and lets move on were wasting time and i 
have a date said a government party poll watcher 
meanwhile poll secretary yadira funt was scribbling busily 
im writing them out and thats the end of it youre all 
boobs she announced 
the total came to 229 votes for endara 43 for duque seven null 
ballots and two abstentions this is not our territory they 
rolled over us here said alexis tulloch a duque man 
he gazed glumly at the bmws and mercedes benz parked nearby and 
said he had gotten up at 4 am to take the bus from tocumen a 
working class district 16 miles to the east 
only 25 people were still watching as the total was announced 
the woman in the red blouse who had announced she planned to see 
the dawn was not among them

the nations farmers are beginning 
to sow their fields for this years crops but probably not with 
their first choice of seed since producers were so badly hurt by 
last summers devastating dry spell 
it dramatically reduced the amount of seed produced said 
harley j otto executive vice president of the minnesota crop 
improvement association which certifies seed for certain 
standards minnesota leads the nation in the number of acres of 
certified seed 
the more popular better producing seeds are in short 
supply he said 
last summers drought slashed yields of corn and soybean seed by 
as much as 35 percent 
the small crop forced seed producers such as northrup king co 
and cargill inc to deplete reserves and call upon winter 
production facilities more than two decades had passed since 
northrup was forced to rely on winter facilities in texas and 
argentina the company said 
although farmers got all the corn seed they needed not all got 
the topofthe line seed they wanted 
they got good hybrids but if they had a choice they probably 
would have chosen a different one said don jacoby northrups 
vice president of agriproducts sales 
we did not have enough of our topline hybrids for the central 
and southern corn belt we had to ration them out said bruce 
priebe president of cargill hybrid seeds 
and if the drought continues seed producers say some farmers 
may be lucky to get quality seed at all for the 1990 growing season 
if we have another drought this year its going to affect our 
whole industry very severely said ag laos vice president of 
northrups us agriproducts group it would be a major 
catastrophe for the industry and for agriculture here in the us 
david l thomas northrups executive marketing director said 
if the drought repeats itself last years dry spell will seem like 
playtime in comparison 
itll just be a disaster he said 
jack riopelle owner of the 850acre riopelle seed farm in the 
northwest minnesota town of argyle agreed 
this year will be a little tighter than it usually is said 
riopelle who lost onefourth of his wheat barely soybean and pea 
seed crop to last years dryness well be able to survive but 
its going to be a pinch if we have another drought a person can 
hold out only for so long

nearly a half century has passed since 
archie artist bob montana hung out at the chocolate shop 
drawing cartoons on napkins and gossiping with classmates who would 
later inspire veronica betty and company 
but those days didnt seem very far away as the haverhill high 
school class of 1940 met sunday for the opening of an exhibit on 
archie recalling their mischievious youth and how it was captured 
in the comic strip adventures of frecklefaced archie andrews and 
his hapless mates jughead and moose 
montana died in 1975 but the comics continue to be published 
along with a saturday cartoon show 
let me tell you a secret when i left high school i had 300 
afternoon sessions to make up said arnold daggett the widely 
accepted prototype for moose with his snowy white crewcut and 
friendly squarejawed face the 68yearold daggett was 
unmistakably the vintage version of hearty footballplaying moose 
daggett said he did not know of his celebrity status until the 
exhibit was organized but he said he recognizes himself in one 
strip where i was getting kicked out of class 
others such as charlie hayden who first saw the comics as a 
serviceman abroad said they recognized landmark statues and the 
high school newspaper the brown amp gold 
rita walker who lived two streets away from montana said she 
recognized haverhill high almost immediately when archie burst on 
the american comic scene in 1941 cheering at football games 
driving high school principal mr weatherbee crazy and hanging out 
at the choklit shop montanas spelling of the popular haverhill 
spot 
the chocolate shop we all knew darn well where the chocolate 
shop was he used to go there all the time and draw cartoons on 
napkins said mrs walker 
all the graduates agreed that daggett is moose partly because 
of a high school cartoon of daggett the football star that is very 
similar to moose the comic strip character but on the other 
characters theories abound 
archie experts differ as to whether other archie characters are 
direct caricatures or composites at the exhibit excerpts from 
montanas diary were shown that contained many references to his 
high school experiences 
montana traveled the vaudeville circuit with his parents as a 
child and then lived in bostons theater district his years in 
haverhill were his first encounter with smalltown life said his 
widow peggy bertholet now remarried 
i think he enjoyed high school so much that he was more the 
average american high school student than most high school students 
are she said 
mrs walker described montana the high school boy as a tall 
lanky kid to me he appeared to be a shy guy from the outside 
looking in and wishing he could be hellions like some of them 
were 
in the years since his 1941 debut archie has swapped his 
checked knickers for blue jeans and tackled such uptodate issues 
as dyslexia but he and his friends havent lost the concept of 
idealized youth said brian walker exhibit director of the museum 
of cartoon art in rye brook ny 
archie was the brainchild of john goldwater a partner in the 
new york publishing company where montana worked as an artist from 
the beginning the comics strove for a humorous approach to 
reallife issues said michael silberkleit chairman of the current 
archie comic publications inc whose father louis was a company 
founder

us congressional observers charged with 
reporting to president bush on the fairness of panamas election 
watched talked questioned and came away with mixed reactions to a 
presidential vote latinstyle 
it is good that they are here said jorge eliezer miranda 
an 18year old voting for the first time and representing the 
governing party at a precinct in the town of chilibre about 20 
miles south of the atlantic ocean side of the panama canal 
they can show the world this is a democratic not a communist 
country as the oppositon claims miranda said during the sunday 
polling 
you dont stand in line for two hours said rep lawrence 
coughlin rpa unless you hope for a free and honest election 
the panamanian government did not issue visas to the bush 
observers and said they were not welcome but the americans came 
into a us military installation here and obtained visas under 
terms of the panama canal treaties 
the panamanian government also invited teams of international 
observers including former president jimmy carter 
but at the precinct level coughlin and rep allan mollohan 
dwest virgina received mostly warm welcomes and were allowed to 
enter voting booths following reports that some party ballots were 
missing or stolen 
anything else we can do for you asked gladys estela de 
castro after showing the bush observers around at a school in buena 
vista about 10 miles south of colon 
the observers noted what a panamanian called normal 
irregularities meaning opening delays at voting precincts late 
arrivals of some party representatives or of some documents needed 
by precinct officials 
more serious charges included accusations that soldiers loyal to 
defense forces chief gen manuel antonio noriega allowed by law 
to vote at any polling station were being bused to different 
places to vote repeatedly 
however most of the alleged violations were somewhere else 
reported by someone who was told about them by someone else 
i do not think we have seen any hard evidence said 
mollohan referring to the possibility of outright fraud at the 
precinct level 
if they are going to do it it will be at the place where all 
the votes are tallied mollohan said thats what i would like 
to see 
the general belief is that the election will be stolen 
sometime tonight said sen john mccain rariz as polls closed 
at 5 pm sunday 
watch the counting watch the counting an old lady softly 
urged the congressmen as they went by everything is fine now 
but thats where the problem is going to be she added wagging 
her finger 
a precinct official smiled and pointed her finger upward when 
asked where the possibility of fraud was as she indicated it would 
be done somewhere up along the line to the national electoral 
tribunal 
albatina gill government candidate for a national assembly 
seat met with the congressmen and told them she expected 
differences with the united states over noriegas de facto rule 
would end soon 
i believe in government presidential candidate carlos 
duques capacity and in the understanding of the government of the 
united states to find a solution 
carter who led a nonofficial us delegation from the council 
of freely elected heads of state and signed the canal treaties was 
met with applause at polling precincts 
i have checked with the opposition and the government 
representatives at the polls and they dont seem to have any 
problems at the places where i have been carter said 
rep john murtha dpa also with the bush delegation said 
people feel very strongly about this election 
noting polls that favor the opposition he said it is going 
to be difficult to have a fraudulent election and overcome what the 
polls indicate

all but two bands of chippewa 
indians called off their treatyprotected spearfishing outings a 
day after the states general fishing season opened amid mass 
protests and hundreds of arrests 
were not giving in to anything michael allen tribal 
chairman of the lac du flambeau band said sunday 
calling off spearfishing was a gesture of good will that 
neither the state officials nor the people of northern wisconsin 
deserve but that we are freely offering them anyway allen said 
the spearfishing season which coincides with the spring 
spawning of walleye pikes normally ends in the beginning of may 
gov tommy g thompson who tried and failed last week to win a 
federal court order ending spearfishing friday night expressed 
relief at the announcement 
i think people are tired and its been pushed as far as it 
could be and as far as it should be thompson said im glad 
its over its been a very trying emotional period of time 
this is the fifth year the six chippewa bands have speared 
walleyes and other game fish from northern wisconsin lakes off 
reservations since a federal court ruling in 1983 that decision 
held that the tribe retained rights to hunt fish trap and gather 
wild grain in 19th century treaties that ceded most of the northern 
third of wisconsin to the united states 
chippewa spearfishing began april 23 more than 200 opponents of 
the indians treaty rights have been arrested primarily at lakes 
used by the lac du flambeau band when crowds crossed police lines 
set up at boat landings used by tribal fishermen 
this years protests were larger than in previous years more 
than 200 opponents of the indians treaty rights have been arrested 
since the season began 
opposition grew after state and court rules allowed tribal 
fishermen to take up to 100 percent of what was considered a safe 
catch or the number that could be taken without hurting the fish 
population from the 254 lakes the tribe targeted for spearing 
the result is a reduction in the daily bag limit of walleyes for 
sport fishermen using many of the lakes 
the tribal catch wound up being much smaller than last year 
despite the concerns of spearfishing opponents 
the state department of natural resources said the chippewa as 
of sunday had taken a total of only 15725 walleyes including 
8326 taken by the lac du flambeau band 
by contrast about 25900 were caught last year and the tribal 
fishing goal this year had been set at 43801 the estimated catch 
by nonindian anglers last year was 672000 walleyes 
allen said tribal officials would consult with spearers to 
decide if and when to resume spearing

the crewman who was trying to steer the exxon 
valdez when it struck a reef in alaskas prince william sound said 
the captain did not appear to be drunk the night the ship ran 
aground a newspaper reported 
there was no indication there was anything wrong third mate 
gregory cousins told the tampa tribune in his first interview since 
the march 24 accident 
cousins who exxon has said was operating the 987foot ship when 
it hit the charted reef has been on leave at home in tampa 
preparing his testimony on the 10 million gallon crude oil spill 
for a national transportation safety board hearing may 16 in 
anchorage alaska 
cousins who described ship capt joseph hazelwood as 
extremely competent defended similar statements from other 
crew members about hazelwoods apparent sobriety when the tanker 
grounded 
its not like were circling the wagons its just the 
truth cousins said in the interview published saturday 
hazelwood of huntington ny was fired by exxon when tests 
conducted more than 10 hours after the accident showed a 
bloodalcohol level above the 04 permitted under coast guard 
regulations he faces trial june 20 in valdez for allegedly 
operating the vessel while drunk 
cousins who was not certified to navigate the tanker in the 
sound said he is anxious to tell his side of the story but his 
attorney has advised him to wait for the ntsb hearing 
the associated press was unable to reach cousins over the 
weekend because he has an unlisted telephone number 
i think all the pieces have been reported but they havent 
been put together right said cousins who was responsible for 
safety and emergency equipment on the tanker 
he spent two days after the accident in valdez listened to 
public reaction and was disturbed about misperceptions about tanker 
crews 
its a tragedy of some enormity you cant blame people for 
being outraged he said emotions were running high 
cousins called the spill damage sickening but said he believes 
exxon is doing all it can with cleanup no matter what anyone 
says 
he faces a coast guard review of his license and must testify at 
state and federal trials resulting from the spill the oil has 
moved about 500 miles southwest of valdez fouling the shore at the

soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
characterized as incompetent a remark by us defense secretary 
dick cheney that soviet efforts at economic restructuring would 
fail according to a magazine 
cheney said during a television interview april 29 that soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev would ultimately fail in his attempt 
to restructure the soviet economy and is likely to be replaced by 
somebody who will be far more hostile to the west 
that particular statement is incompetent and not serious i 
think president bush understands the situation quite well when he 
says perestroika is an irreversible process shevardnadze said in 
an interview in the may 15 edition of time magazine 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater last monday said cheneys 
comments were personal observations and did not reflect the 
views of the bush administration

police arrested a top dissident leader 
today as part of a crackdown on antigovernment groups to curb 
violent protests and the defense ministry warned it would block 
strikes in key industries 
police officials announced the arrest of lee changbok a leader 
of the nations main dissident alliance the united national 
democratic movement on charges of violating national security laws 
officials said lee had supported communist north korea and 
organized strikes and violent demonstrations 
the arrest is part of a crackdown that follows the deaths last 
week of six riot troopers in a clash with radical students in the 
southern port of pusan lee was the fourth alliance leader to be 
arrested along with dozens of other suspected extremists 
president roh taewoo warned may 3 that he would invoke 
emergency measures to halt a wave of violent protests and strikes 
he charged that dissidents were attempting to stage a leftist 
revolution under the control of rival communist north korea 
roh was to hold a cabinet meeting tuesday to discuss further 
measures to curb protests and break up antigovernment groups 
officials said 
the defense ministry warned today it would use strong 
countermeasures to keep strategic industries running if they are 
hit by strikes it did not specify any action but officials have 
said troops could be used to keep defense and other important 
industries running 
defense officials who declined to be named said strikes in 
defense industries are illegal and warned anyone organizing labor 
unrest would be severely punished 
south korea has been hit by a wave of violent antigovernment 
protests and labor strikes the government has warned that efforts 
by radicals to build an alliance with workers could threaten 
political and economic stability 
the government says strikes have cost the economy almost 4 
billion in lost production so far this year 
south korean newspapers reported today that roh would remove 
some cabinet ministers for failing to handle violent protests and 
labor unrest government officials indicated a shakeup was 
expected but declined to provide details 
opposition leader kim daejung called over the weekend for the 
entire cabinet to resign to accept responsibility for the political 
situation top officials in korea traditionally resign to accept 
moral responsibility for problems or failures even if it is not 
their fault 
the main opposition parties which generally do not support the 
dissidents have called for curbs on violent protest but also 
charged the government is trying to use the unrest as an excuse to 
crack down on all opponents 
education ministry officials said today that they would close 
university student newspapers and other publications that publish 
leftist or pronorth korean articles 
the officials who also declined to be named said they were 
considering allowing riot police to raid college campuses to end 
protests or to halt manufacture of firebombs and other weapons 
radical students and the antigovernment dissident groups have 
little support because of their violent tactics and extreme 
political views the radicals have been calling for the overthrow 
of roh and the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers and 
farmers 
roh a former general won presidential elections in late 1987 
after rival opposition candidates split the antigovernment vote 
he has helped introduce democratic reforms but many koreans 
distrust the government because of its ties to the authoritarian 
regime of former president chun doohwan

they were not hurt 
heidi von egidy a stringer for the associated press and 
freelance photographer john liebenburg said four bullets went 
through the side and back of the car sunday night

was tossed into the centers garden during a cocktail party

the territorys transition to independence from south african 
control the united nations is supervising the change 
ms von egidy said today that she and liebenburg were driving on 
the main road to katatura to check on an anonymous call liebenburg 
had received at home about an explosion near police headquarters in 
windhoeks black township the report was false 
the road was deserted there were no cars and we were not 
followed they must have been parked on the side of the road 
waiting with their lights off she said we were looking the 
other way when they started shooting we just ducked 
they drove close to johns side of the car not a meter yard 
away with their headlights on bright and immediately afterwards 
disappeared down a side street it was well planned im sure they 
were trying to kill john

press centers garden thursday night during a cocktail party for 
diplomats and un officials it exploded but no one was hurt

foreign journalists have their offices and residences at the 
center 
jacobs said he was in his room reading on saturday night when he 
heard what sounded like an explosion from the front of the 
house 
he said he looked around in the darkness but so no evidence of 
what he thought was another explosive flare but the next morning 
a 16inch hole was discovered below the front fender of a car 
belonging to freelance photographer philip littleton who was out 
of town 
i dont think littleton was the target it was just the only 
car in front of the press center jacobs said whoever fired it 
was aiming at the fuel tank it was a shotgun blast fired at close 
range and flattened pellets were found under the car

east german police broke up antigovernment 
rallies in leipzig after nationwide voting and arrested about 100 
demonstrators who were demanding democratic reforms church and 
opposition sources said today 
about 800 people rallied sunday after voting in municipal 
elections in which candidates of the ruling communist party ran 
unopposed the sources said 
about 2000 security forces backed by water cannon and police 
dogs were dispatched and police used loudspeakers to order the 
demonstrators to disperse said the sources who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
they said some protesters were arrested after they tried to 
march from downtown to a nearby square 
the sources said police arrested another 15 people after 
officers sealed off a lutheran church where a group of 
demonstrators gathered to protest the singlecandidate elections 
they said about 100 people in all were arrested 
sundays municipal elections reflected east germanys strong 
resistance to democratic reforms occurring in the soviet union 
poland and hungary 
some church and human rights groups had urged voters to boycott 
the elections 
staterun television reported that 987 percent of east 
germanys 124 million registered voters went to the polls it was 
the first time east germany officially reported a turnout of less 
than 99 percent 
communist party officials use high voter turnout figures to 
claim massive support for government policies voters who boycott 
elections or cast invalid ballots face serious repercussions 
west german officials said hundreds of east germans were allowed 
to emigrate in the days before the elections in an apparent 
government effort to prevent disturbances during the balloting 
police in leipzig banned reporters from the west german 
television ard from entering the city before sundays demonstration

on his first soviet trip secretary of state 
james a baker iii will ask for cooperation in the middle east 
central america and other trouble spots and steer clear of 
preparations for a superpower summit meeting until the results are 
in 
despite several steps by mikhail s gorbachev to lower tensions 
baker set out today on his first visit to moscow skeptical that 
the soviet leaders actions are in line with gorbachevs new 
thinking 
baker has publicly questioned for instance whether reductions 
in troops and defense spending announced by gorbachev have done 
much to offset warsaw pact edges in some military categories in 
europe 
two of bakers closest aides briefing reporters before his 
takeoff for finland said he would discuss a summit meeting with 
gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze only if they 
raised the subject 
if there are reasons to have such a summit then we would 
certainly be pleased to have one said one aide speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
but prospects for a meeting between president bush and gorbachev 
depend on progress in several areas the us officials said 
they said baker wants soviet cooperation in central america and 
the middle east in combating terrorism and in slowing the 
proliferation of ballistic missiles the officials left unclear how 
much had to be accomplished before bush would consent to a 
superpower summit 
the presidents past position is that one should not meet just 
for the sake of meeting but rather one should have particular 
topics that are ripe for heads of government to engage in a 
baker aide said 
gorbachev took exactly that position on summitry after rising to 
power in 1985 but he then went on to hold five meetings with 
former president reagan concluding a treaty to abolish 
mediumrange nuclear missiles and easing tensions in afghanistan 
and on a number of other fronts 
but the bush administration says that is not enough 
in central america the administration wants the soviets to 
sharply reduce military aid to nicaragua it amounted to 500 
million last year ussupported rebels are trying to overthrow 
the marxist government 
in the middle east the administration wants the soviets to 
muffle their calls for an international peace conference and join 
bush in pushing for direct negotiations between israel and 
palestinians 
also baker would like the soviets to stop providing syria with 
missiles that add to israels military concerns 
i think that thats a very potentially important topic that 
the united states has not engaged the soviet union in depth on in 
the past an official said 
baker who has never been on soviet soil either in private or 
government life is stopping first in helsinki to catch his breath 
before going on to moscow wednesday morning he also will meet with 
finnish leaders whose country is western in outlook and has a 
neutral foreign policy 
baker will see shevardnadze on wednesday morning and again on 
thursday morning and gorbachev for two hours thursday afternoon 
us officials said he would propose that us and soviet 
negotiators resume their work in geneva the third week of june on a 
treaty to reduce longrange bombers missiles and submarines by 30 
to 50 percent 
baker will suggest that the talks basically pick up where they 
left off in november when they were recessed with about 90 percent 
of the work completed 
but he does not intend to outline to gorbachev and shevardnadze 
the position the united states will take on specific issues at the 
bargaining table said the officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
essentially we are looking for continuity and keeping arms 
control on a fast track an official said 
the negotiations had been tentatively scheduled to resume in 
midfebruary but bush after taking office in january ordered an 
indefinite postponement while the administration reviewed us arms 
control and weapons policies 
us and soviet negotiators have some tough problems to resolve 
these include whether to try to restrict mobile missiles and how to 
verify such elusive weapons as cruise missiles fired from airplanes 
and submarines 
meanwhile a senior aide to baker said the administration had 
ruled out any deal with the soviets to impose a coalition 
government in afghanistan 
the official said the united states had neither the inclination 
nor the power to persuade the afghan rebels to strike a deal with 
president najibullah 
calling for the sovietbacked leaders ouster the official 
said we do not believe we will have peace in afghanistan as 
long as najibullah is in power

civilians scrambled for their bunkers 
today when moslem and christian forces resumed heavy shelling 
across the city after a brief morning lull 
police said syrian and allied druse moslem gunners pounded the 
coast near the ports of jounieh and byblos blocking the only 
escape routes for 1 million people trapped in the besieged 
christian enclave christian gunners struck back with barrages of 
155mm howitzer fire aimed at west beiruts seaside districts and 
around the international airport police said 
thousands of residents had left their basements and underground 
bomb shelters during the lull to replenish food and water supplies 
police said 21500 shells and rockets were fired on beiruts 
moslem and christian sectors from dusk saturday to midnight sunday 
ending a ceasefire negotiated by the arab league 
a police spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
said 22 people were killed and 120 wounded in the 30hour barrage 
since the current round of fighting in lebanons 14yearold 
civil war began on march 8 300 people have been killed and 1131 
wounded 
lakhdar ibrahimi of algeria the arab league assistant 
secretarygeneral was to return to beirut on tuesday to try to 
revive the ceasefire beirut newspapers reported the papers said 
he will be accompanied by brig gen ali almomen the kuwaiti 
commander of a 321man observer force that will be drawn from six 
arab nations to monitor the truce that was called on april 28 
the arabs face the difficult task of shoring up the 
ceasefire otherwise the observers will have nothing to monitor 
the police spokesman said 
gaping holes were blown in scores of apartment buildings on both 
sides of beiruts green line which divides the citys moslem and 
christian sectors hundreds of cars smoldered on streets blanketed 
with debris glass shards and dangling power cables 
theyve destroyed everything i own said mahmoud younis a 
30yearold moslem as he stared at his gutted electrical tools shop 
in west beirut i hope they will roast in hell all of them 
one shell tore through the building that houses the west beirut 
office of the british reuters news agency and caused extensive 
damage no one was injured the agencys staff reported 
another shell struck the newsroom of the staterun television 
station in a building in west beirut it was a miracle no one was 
hurt said announcer leena saidi were now operating from the 
stations bunker 
the fighting pits army commander gen michel aouns 20000 
troops most of whom are christians against syrian army forces and 
the 7000strong militia of druse warlord walid jumblatts 
progressive socialist party 
the latest round began after aouns troops blockaded illegal 
harbors run by moslem militias south of beirut he said the ports 
cost the state about 100 million a year in customs levies 
jumblatt retaliated by shelling the 310squaremile christian 
enclave north of the capital the syrians later joined the fighting 
and sealed off the enclaves land exits

americas cities and counties like many of 
their residents are increasing their spending faster than their 
income according to a pair of new census bureau reports 
total city and county income still exceed spending but the gap 
is narrowing and local governments are increasingly unable to turn 
to uncle sam for help because federal aid is declining said the 
studies released sunday 
spending by the nations cities was 79 percent higher in the 
198687 fiscal year than the year before according to the reports 
during the same period revenues rose 69 percent 
the result was spending totaling 1641 billion by the cities 
compared with revenues of 1698 billion 
that left cities 57 billion in the black for 198687 although 
that marked a reduction from surpluses of 66 billion the year 
before and 77 billion in 198485 
for counties spending rose 112 percent while income climbed 
93 percent between 198586 and 198687 the census bureau said 
that totaled out to 1058 billion in revenues and 1029 
billion in expenditures for a surplus of 29 billion counties 
were 42 billion in the black a year earlier and 46 billion in 
198485 
the reports also showed that federal aid fell by 142 percent 
for cities and by 72 percent for counties between the 198586 and 
198687 fiscal years 
overall cities raised 710 percent of the money they spent 
while counties got 632 percent from their own sources for both 
the balance came primarily from federal and state assistance 
in spending cities put more of their money into law 
enforcement while for counties public welfare was the top 
expenditure education was the second largest expense for both 
units of government 
police expenses accounted for 148 billion of city spending up 
88 percent from the year before education cost 134 billion up 
85 percent while highway expenditures rose 80 percent to 101 
billion 
debt interest was the fastestgrowing city expenses climbing 
149 percent to 93 billion spending on sewerage rose 114 
percent to 91 billion 
among counties public welfare costs led spending at 143 
billion 83 percent more than a year earlier 
second place went to education up 96 percent to 140 billion 
followed by hospital costs which rose 54 percent to 98 billion 
rounding out the top five were highways 82 billion up 80 
percent and general management which was up 88 percent to 67 
billion 
although it didnt make the top five in total spending debt 
interest was also a big gainer for counties rising 218 percent to 
nearly 67 billion

police fired tear gas today to disperse crowds 
of israeli rioters who blocked streets with burning tires to 
protest the slaying of a soldier that has been blamed on 
palestinian guerrillas 
the violence occurred in ashdod hometown of soldier avi 
sassportaz whose body was found buried in a field near the 
occupied gaza strip on sunday he disappeared 81 days ago while 
hitchhiking home from his army base 
the body of sassportaz 21 was found as more than 1000 troops 
fanned out near gaza in search of a second missing trooper ilan 
saadon 18 he was last seen wednesday hitchhiking in southern 
israel 
israel radio said preliminary findings showed sassportaz was 
shot in the head several hours after he was picked up at the 
hodiyya intersection 20 miles southwest of jerusalem police said 
they believe palestinians were involved in the disappearances of 
sassportaz and saadon 
industry minister ariel sharon was quoted by the hadashot daily 
as telling israelis in southern dimona that these cases were the 
result of a serious national blunder in handling the 
17monthold arab rebellion in which 465 palestinians and 21 
israelis have died he did not elaborate 
in the gaza strip today the army maintained curfews on more 
than 240000 palestinians in refugee camps in an effort to contain 
violent outbreaks at least 158 arabs were wounded by gunfire in 
weekend clashes with soldiers according to un figures 
saturdays wounded toll by un count was the highest daily 
figure since the start of the uprising dec 8 1987 the army put 
the number of wounded saturday at 77 
army curfews also were maintained on eight towns or refugee 
camps in the west bank that are home to about 200000 palestinians 
sunday night and early today more than 200 israeli youths took 
to the streets of southern ashdod shouting death to the arabs 
and burning tires israel radio and the itim news agency reported 
a police spokesman eli elimelech said there were two violent 
outbreaks in the town of 75000 in which tear gas was fired 
in one case 150 people rioted during a march toward the police 
elimelech said later 300 people burned tires on a main street 
corner he said 
national police commissioner david kraus issued an appeal for 
restraint 
i think it is worth urging the public to demonstrate 
responsibility and restraint and not to force the police to turn 
forces from its main task of antiguerrilla patrols kraus said 
on army radio 
newspaper editorials reflected the frustration felt by many in a 
country where all men serve in the army and where soldiers rely 
heavily on hitching rides to get to and from their bases 
the soldiers death also prompted calls by rightwing mayors to 
consider firing thousands of palestinians employed by israeli 
municipalities the haaretz daily reported 
about 100000 palestinians from the west bank and gaza strip 
work in israel most at construction sites and sanitation jobs

two scientists under fire to prove their 
claims of cold fusion go before a jury of their peers tonight 
at a chemists conclave in los angeles 
university of utah chemist b stanley pons and martin 
fleischmann of the university of southampton in england hoped to 
bolster their claims that they achieved nuclear fusion in a jar at 
room temperature a breakthrough that if confirmed could open 
the door to a cheap and virtually inexhaustible source of energy 
pons said sunday that he and fleischmann would present their 
evidence at the electrochemical societys biannual meeting 
last week in baltimore scientists at a meeting of the american 
physical society discounted the fusion claims accusing pons and 
fleischmann of errors 
physicists have been the pairs chief critics since they 
announced march 23 that experiments had produced fusion using rods 
of palladium in electrically charged coils of platinum immersed in 
deuteriumrich heavy water 
the two said their experiment yielded more than four times the 
energy needed to produce it pons said he and fleischmann would 
report on later research including new results that exhibit very 
large amounts of excess heat 
if confirmed utahs cold fusion claims would undercut the 
longheld belief that fusion which powers the sun and hydrogen 
bombs occurs only at extremely high temperatures

governing party candidate gonzalo sanchez 
de lozada today claimed an upset election victory over former 
military dictator hugo banzer suarez but the congress will have 
final say over who becomes president 
neither candidate appeared to have won more than 50 percent of 
the vote in sundays election so by law the new congress will 
choose the president 
nevertheless sanchez de lozadas surprising finish provided a 
kind of public endorsement of the governments conservative 
freemarket economic program which has included severe austerity 
measures 
it also was expected to help ensure continuity in this 
impoverished countrys usfinanced war on cocaine production and 
trafficking 
all 27 senate and 130 house of deputies seats were also up for 
election but officials said there would be no clear indication on 
how each party had fared until later today 
no official figures were available and the tally was expected to 
take nearly three weeks to complete as votes arrived from remote 
parts of the landlocked largely undeveloped south american country 
an independent television station the bolivian television 
association said banzer of the centerright nationalist democratic 
action party led with 277 percent of the vote to 273 percent for 
sanchez de lozada of the conservative revolutionary nationalist 
movement 
it based its computerized projections on a tally of 851437 
votes of the estimated 18 million cast nationwide 
the station said however that sanchez de lozada was projected 
to eventually pull ahead a percentage point when the rural vote 
came in banzer was strong in cities which reported their returns 
quickly sanchez de lozada was counting on a big vote from the 
countryside 
sanchez de lozadas campaign manager andres petricevic said 
his party projected a victory with 29 percent of the vote to 27 
percent for banzer 
late sunday banzers party refused to concede defeat but said 
it would respect the will of the people 
jaime paz zamora of the social democratic movement of the 
revolutionary left was running third with 204717 votes or 223 
percent six other contenders trailed far behind 
the new congress convenes on aug 4 and will have two days to 
select the president whose inauguration to a fouryear term is 
scheduled for aug 6 
banzer 62 had sought victory by a margin of 5 percentage 
points or more to oblige congress to respect the popular vote and 
name him president he finished first in the 1985 election with 
286 percent but congress picked the runnerup victor paz 
estenssoro who had 264 percent 
the 81yearold incumbent is retiring after a tumultuous career 
that spanned half a century and included three periods as president 
sanchez de lozada 58 said on the eve of the election that he 
felt confident of being picked president if he finished first or a 
close second a wealthy mine owner he was educated in the united 
states and has a philosophy degree from the university of chicago 
most opinion polls showed banzer as the frontrunner this year 
and he was confident enough to say his party would back whomever 
finished first he called on other parties to do the same but 
trailing in the polls they declined 
the vote took place in a holidaylike atmosphere with a calm 
and order remarkable for what once was the continents most 
politically volatile country since the turn of the century there 
have been 13 coups with nine governments between 1978 and 1982 
some irregularities were reported including the arrest of three 
people who carried several different identity cards and apparently 
planned to vote several times there also were reports that some 
voters were given already marked ballots but foreign observers 
said they had no initial indications of widespread fraud 
paz estenssoro said upon casting his ballot that the elections 
would help lead bolivians to political maturity the important 
thing is to consolidate democracy he said 
he launched a severe economic program when he took office in 
1985 to halt economic chaos including an annual inflation rate of 
23000 percent 
the austerity measures included laying off 35000 state miners 
and other public workers a tenfold increase in the price of 
gasoline and a 95 percent currency devaluation 
banzer sanchez de lozada and paz zamora pledged to maintain the 
program which has cut inflation to 15 percent a year and 
contributed to some small economic growth for the first time in a 
decade 
in addition they all vowed to continue the governments battle 
against cocaine production and trafficking the united states 
provides about 55 million dollars a year for the efforts which 
include programs to reduce coca leaf cultivation in bolivias 
jungles

pravda told soviet readers today that dictator 
josef stalin had detailed information about nazi germanys plans to 
invade the country but ignored the warnings and failed to prepare 
for war 
the fullpage article in the communist party newspaper the most 
detailed look yet at what soviet spies knew about adolf hitlers 
plans came on the eve of the 44th anniversary of the soviet 
victory in world war ii 
the article marked a sharp break from the soviet press tradition 
of publishing uncritical patriotic reminiscences of soviet heroism 
the report also contrasted with a jovial mood in moscow which 
was festooned with red banners for tuesdays holiday on red square 
a large banner stated simply 19411945 the years of the war 
in which 20 million soviets were killed 
western historians have written extensively about how stalin 
ignored intelligence reports about hitlers plans but little has 
come out in the soviet union stalin traditionally had been 
portrayed as a brilliant wartime leader 
but under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
or greater openness many soviet writers and historians have 
recently condemned stalins political repression of millions of his 
people and reexamined his wartime role 
last summer pravda published a chapter of a new book about 
stalin that denounced him for signing a friendship treaty with nazi 
germany purging the red army when the nation was on the brink of 
war and ignoring warnings that war was imminent 
todays article further rewrote an embarrasing page in soviet 
history 
pravda said the articles author history professor a baidakov 
gleaned the accounts from classified state security archives 
he said the state security agencies managed to infiltrate the 
gestapo secret police germanys aviation ministry and its coding 
service 
according to baidakov security officials promptly forwarded 
information to soviet political leaders about hitlers invasion 
plans as early as november 1940 german forces invaded june 21 
1941 
but the historian said 
the leadership of the ussr peoples commissariats 
ministries of state security and defense did not in my view do 
everything to convince stalin and the countrys other leaders of 
the inevitability of an imminent confrontation with the germans 
then he added but the main blame for miscalculating the time 
of the start of the war for the country not being turned into an 
armed camp in time for not being brought into a state of full 
military preparedness lies with the ussr political leadership 
of that period 
baidakov revealed a series of intelligence reports forwarded to 
stalin and his foreign minister vyacheslav m molotov in april 
1941 for example the two were told that hitler had revealed to a 
yugoslav prince that an invasion of the soviet union was planned 
for june 
on june 16 this urgent message was delivered to stalin and 
molotov all military operations of germany on preparation of a 
military aggression against the ussr have been completely 
stopped and a blow can be expected at any time 
the next day baidakov wrote stalin asked intelligence 
officials whether the sources who wrote the message were reliable 
before the information could be rechecked the germans invaded

a us military official confirmed today that a 
hydrogen bomb was lost in the pacific ocean near okinawa when a jet 
fell off an aircraft carrier in 1965 many japanese expressed 
outrage at the disclosure 
the report was the top story in most japanese newspapers and was 
featured on the television news japan the only nation ever 
attacked with nuclear weapons remains very sensitive about nuclear 
arms questions 
the report was disclosed over the weekend in a report from 
washington in the current edition of newsweek magazine 
asked about the report a us military spokesman in tokyo said 
a nuclear weapon was lost in the pacific in 1965 when an a4 
skyhawk plane fell from a us carrier in international waters 
about 80 miles from the closest point of the okinawa island chain 
the spokesman demanded anonymity 
the newsweek article said the aircraft and bomb were lost in 
waters with a depth of 16200 feet 
the japanese government does not know the present location and 
condition of the bomb and there have been no discussions with the 
united states about how to deal with it said a foreign ministry 
official who requested anonymity 
he said his government had no plans to investigate the accident 
or possible dangers posed by the bomb 
the loss of the onemegaton bomb which has a force of 1 million 
tons of tnt was kept secret at the time newsweek said quoting a 
report by the institute for policy studies in washington 
the pilot was killed when the plane carrying the bomb 
accidentally rolled off the aircraft carrier ticonderoga which was 
on its way from vietnam to the japanese port of yokosuka said the 
report 
when the loss of the bomb was reported in a 1981 us department 
of defense listing of nuclear weapons accidents there was no 
indication that it occurred near inhabited islands another foreign 
ministry official said 
the report said only that it happened 500 miles from the asian 
mainland said the official who also insisted on anonymity 
in okinawa prefecture a string of islands stretching 570 miles 
south of japans main islands citizens expressed anger masaji 
shinzato a reporter for the okinawa times told the associated 
press 
shock is running through okinawa this seems to represent how 
okinawa was used freely by the american military in those days 
he said 
there already was a great deal of bitterness over the continuing 
presence of 35000 us troops whose facilities occupy much of 
okinawas territory he said at the time of the accident okinawa 
was under us control it was returned to japan in 1972 27 years 
after japans defeat in world war ii 
the report said the bomb was lost not far from one of okinawas 
smaller islands about 200 miles from heavily populated okinawa 
island 
okinawan leaders of antiwar and antinuclear groups and 
opponents of the us military presence on the island immediately 
issued denunciations of the way the accident apparently had been 
handled local press reports said 
japans socialist and communist parties both strongly 
antinuclear sharply criticized japans government and the united 
states 
the government must demand that the us government take 
responsibility for the accident said tsuruo yamaguchi 
secretarygeneral of the japan socialist party 
japan bans nuclear weapons it says us ships or planes cannot 
bring nuclear arms into japan without prior consulations with the 
government and there have been no such consultations the united 
states meanwhile refuses to confirm or deny the presence of 
nuclear weapons in specific locations

alaskas oil industry proved its political 
clout remains strong despite the exxon valdez spill when the state 
senate narrowly rejected an effort to raise oil taxes 
the industrys credibility in the wake of the march 24 accident 
was the center of debate late sunday before the chamber voted down 
the increase 119 
a bill to revise an oiltax break known as the economic limit 
factor or elf took three years to get to the floor of the 
republicanled senate the democratcontrolled house approved an 
elf bill twice in 1987 and this year 
proponents of the bill said the tax break should not apply to 
the two biggest oil fields in the nation prudhoe bay and kuparuk 
on alaskas north slope industry officials argued that changing 
the tax formula ultimately would cost the state jobs and oil 
revenue 
the bill would have added 235 million to the state treasury 
next year 
its last chance this year is a reconsideration vote which was 
expected to be one of the last items on the senate agenda today 
democratic gov steve cowper made passage of the bill a priority in 
the 1989 session which ends tonight 
the oil companies won sunday night cowper said its as 
simple as that mondays final vote on this issue will prove one 
thing whether the oil industry runs this state or whether the 
people of alaska are in charge 
hugh motley vice president of arco alaska inc said he was 
pleased with the victory it is a bad piece of legislation for 
alaskans he said 
the exxon valdez spill which polluted prince william sound with 
101 million gallons of north slope crude gave proponents of the 
bill new ammunition in the senate which has long been a bastion of 
oil industry support 
democratic sen al adams pleaded for passage of the bill and he 
cited an industry effort to swing votes against the bill with 
promises of additional union jobs 
who has made these promises adams asked is it the same 
industry that promised that a prince william sound oil spill would 
never happen is it the same industry that promised that they would 
not kill animals 
he urged his colleages to think of how the bills defeat would 
be seen by fellow alaskans irate over the spill 
they are looking to you tonight to stop giving this industry a 
tax break to stop doing them a favor and hold them accountable for 
their actions he said 
sen jan faiks a republican and longtime industry supporter 
said the industry had a pretty incredible record of more than 
8800 tanker trips in and out of the valdez harbor without a major 
spill before march 24 
we had a disastrous accident is that going to wipe out over 
8800 trips without any accidents and a 12year record she asked 
republican sen dick eliason said it would twelve years is 
certainly not enough as far as im concerned i was a believer at 
one time until good friday he said he added the politics 
of alaska has changed

reporters have had to play hideandseek with 
the judge and stand up through jury selection in a childmurder 
case 
cecil steve sutherland 33 is charged with sexually molesting 
and slashing the throat of a 10yearold who had left her house to 
look for her dog 
testimony begins this week in the trial which was moved here 
from mount vernon 60 miles away because of publicity 
despite the change of venue judge lehman krause imposed a gag 
order on participants and did not reveal the location of the 
proceedings to the press 
journalists said they traced subpoena requests to find where the 
trial was being held they said that krause let them attend jury 
selection only after a lawyer for the reporters complained but that 
he refused to let them sit 
its outrageous said david bennett director of the 
illinois press association we think what he is doing is clearly 
unconstitutional 
krause denied violating the constitution and said reporters were 
not barred from jury selection he said they never tried to enter 
the chamber the judge said reporters have not been able to sit 
because there are not enough chairs 
however a reporter was told to stand thursday even though a 
chair was empty except for a clerks purse said the sunday courier 
in evansville ind 
the judge said publicity has tainted potential jurors even in 
olney he said half of 120 potential jurors have been disqualified 
many because they had already decided sutherland is guilty

government officials refused today to begin talks 
with an independent group of university students formed after weeks 
of unprecedented prodemocracy demonstrations the students said 
a group of journalists working for statecontrolled media but 
inspired by the protests for freedom planned to seek their own 
talks with propaganda and publishing officials to push for an 
easing of press restrictions 
prodemocracy activists say a dialogue with chinas communist 
leadership is a major goal of their movement which seeks greater 
freedom and clean government 
the students had organized several mass demonstrations involving 
tens of thousands of people and a citywide class boycott by 
university students to press their demands but such activity has 
largely ended 
communist party chief zhao ziyang responded today by saying 
students were acting with more reason 
the situation has been prevented from becoming acute because 
the party and government have all along adopted a very tolerant and 
restrained attitude and because most students have acted with 
increasing reason the official xinhua news agency quoted him as 
saying 
zhao repeated comments he made thursday that chinese authorities 
are tackling the problems raised by students but the xinhua report 
did not mention zhao repeating his earlier call for dialogue with 
students 
officials have refused to meet with the independent student 
union that organized the three weeks of protests 
a second organization the student dialogue representative 
group was formed last week with members from more than two dozen 
beijing universities to renew the appeal for talks they dropped 
several earlier demands including that the government 
representative be at least a vice premier 
four group members met for nearly an hour with officials at the 
government receiving department today shen tong one of the 
student leaders said after the meeting that we still have to 
further talk things over 
another student leader xiang xiaoji said the officials did 
not rule out conducting a dialogue with the group but he refused 
to clarify the governments position 
government officials are not hesitating to talk with students of 
their own choosing however the communist party paper peoples 
daily said agriculture minister he kang and five vice ministers of 
the ministry of machine buiding and electronics met with two small 
groups of university students sunday 
topics included inadequate financing of education and official 
corruption the report said 
efforts by students to set up talks with the government come as 
the prodemocracy movement seems to be losing focus leading 
student activists seem unsure of what to do next to keep up the 
momentum there are no more marches planned and only beijing 
university is continuing a boycott called off by other schools 
after two weeks 
student leaders at beijing university the nations most 
prestigious school announced sunday the strike would last at least 
through friday but activists acknowledged that perhaps as many as 
30 percent or more of the students were in class today 
wall posters continued to appear at beijing university today 
including one from a group of journalists who oppose the tight 
official control over the press it announced they would deliver an 
appeal tuesday for talks with leading officials such as the 
communist party propaganda department chief wang renzhi 
more than 100 reporters at the youth news signed the petition 
which has several hundred supporters one of the newspapers 
journalists claimed 
since the prodemocracy demonstrations in beijing began in 
midapril the capitals media has been unable to completely 
fairly and objectively report because of all kinds of pressure 
the appeal said adding that the restricted coverage has crippled 
the reputation of the chinese press at home and abroad

the bush administration censored one of our 
governments foremost scientists by ordering him to change his 
planned congressional testimony on global warming sen albert gore 
jr said today 
gore dtenn said at the outset of a hearing by a science 
subcommittee he chairs that the administration sought to minimize 
the seriousness of the problems found by dr james e hansen 
director of nasas goddard institute for space studies 
gore said sunday that the office of management and budget 
censored the testimony on the socalled greenhouse effect 
the senator added today scientists like dr hansen tell us 
that global temperatures could increase two to five degrees 
centigrade in our lifetimes because of the billions and billions of 
tons of carbon dioxide we pump into the air every year and because 
emissions of other greenhouses gases 
the senator said there are a few environmentalists in this 
administration such as william reilly at epa the environmental 
protection agency who is first rate but they are outnumbered by 
the james watt clones put in key posts throughout the 
administration the environmentalists are being overruled and 
worse theyre sometimes being muzzled 
as former president reagans interior secretary watt pursued 
policies that were vehemently opposed by environmental groups 
gore said hansen one of our governments foremost 
scientists was censored not on questions of policy but on his 
scientific opinions concerning detailed painstaking research 
the new york times today quoted hansen as saying omb edited the 
text of his testimony for todays hearing to soften the conclusions 
and make the prospects of change in climate appear more uncertain 
it distresses me that they put words in my mouth they even 
put it in the first person hansen told the times adding that he 
had tried to negotiate with the budget office over the wording 
but they refused to change 
i should be allowed to say what is my scientific position 
there is no rationale by which omb should be censoring scientific 
opinion hansen said i can understand changing policy but not 
science 
the times said hansens original testimony was that computer 
projections of changes in climate caused by carbon dioxide and 
other gases released into the atmosphere show substantial increases 
in temperature drought severe storms and other stresses likely to 
affect the earths biological systems 
hansens original testimony would have supported the position 
that while there are still many uncertainties enough is known now 
about the general and even regional effects of the global warming 
trend to start acting now to mitigate and prepare for those 
effects the paper said 
hansen was not reachable for comment sunday night 
white house spokesman b jay cooper said he had no knowledge of 
the matter 
officials ordered the scientist to change his testimony because 
it would conflict with the ideologically based donothing 
approach which theyre most comfortable with said gore 
gore said he was told by sources in the bush administration that 
officials had censored the scientific opinions we have asked to 
be presented 
i think theyre scared of the truth i think theyre scared 
that hansen and the other scientists are right and that some 
dramatic policy changes are going to be needed and they dont want 
to face up to it because they prefer to do nothing 
gore said he knew of no similar orders being given to other 
scientists scheduled to testify he said his committee would ask 
omb officials to explain why the testimony was changed

series of meetings with government and governing party officials to 
discuss the selection of a new prime minister

party elders on tuesday in an attempt to form a consensus on a new 
leader 
takeshita 65 indicated in the philippines on sunday that he

but ito has refused the post when approached by party officials 
citing his age and poor health 
takeshita announced on april 25 that he would resign after the 
fiscal 1989 budget passes parliament because of the recruit bribery 
scandal that has decimated his partys popularity and dominated 
japanese politics 
four days later he went ahead with a scheduled visit to five 
southeast asian nations a move intended to show continuity in 
japanese foreign policy despite the impending leadership change 
but opposition parties today refused to proceed with debate on 
the budget in parliaments upper house renewing a demand that 
former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone testify under oath about 
his links to the scandal 
the government has been operating on a 50day provisional budget 
since the fiscal year began april 1 
discussions about who will succeed takeshita as head of the 
governing party who routinely becomes prime minister because of 
the partys large majority in parliament continued to center 
around ito who chairs the partys policymaking executive council

party who is untainted by the scandal in which the recruit co 
made massive donations to takeshita and other leading politicians 
and sold bargainpriced stock shares to about 160 politicians 
businessmen and others 
with an election for half the seats in the upper house slated

bribery and other charges in the recruit scandal and prosecutors 
reportedly are investigating several politicians three cabinet 
ministers also have resigned because of links to recruit

the united states is waging an uphill fight to 
prevent the palestine liberation organization from being admitted 
as a state member of the world health organization 
the us health secretary dr louis w sullivan met the who 
directorgeneral dr hiroshi nakajima in geneva today to stress 
us concern sullivan declined to comment on the possibility of a 
lastminute compromise 
the meeting came as the 166member agency opened its annual 
assembly a gathering which may be dominated by the plos bid to 
have it upgraded from nonvoting observer to state member 
secretary of state james a baker iii threatened last week to 
strip the international health organization of us funds if it 
admits the plo washington this year contributed 71 million to the 
who a quarter of the total budget for the agency which sponsors 
public health programs throughout the developing world 
us officials were working feverishly to persuade other member 
nations the plo request should be withdrawn deferred or as a last 
defense voted down 
the plo mission to the united nations in geneva on friday said 
compromise proposals are sugarcoated bait and called on all 
countries to oppose moves to delay a decision 
nakajima who has warned a cutoff of us funds would 
destroy the agency made an unpublicized trip to tunis 
tunisia on saturday in an attempt to get plo leader yasser arafat 
to change his mind and avert a showdown 
i understand he got nowhere a senior west european diplomat 
said in geneva today further developments now depend largely on 
the moderates among the third world nations 
zaires health minister dr ngandukabeya dibandala opened the 
meeting in geneva by warning the agency must avoid questions 
alien to health in its efforts to improve health throughout the 
world but dibandala president of last years assembly made no 
direct reference to the controversy 
chinas health minister professor chen minzhang was elected 
to preside over the 1989 assembly he told the 1200 delegates that 
they face important questions but that he is deeply 
convinced these will be resolved 
the new york times reported that nakajima who consulted with 
us officials in washington last week is pushing a compromise 
under which the who would offer more medical aid to palestinians in 
israelioccupied territories but defer consideration of the plo 
application until next year 
this would keep the united states from cutting off aid to who 
arafat last year declared a palestinian state on israeliheld 
land and about 100 of the 166 who members already have recognized 
the state of palestine or acknowledged its proclamation of 
statehood 
however the dec 15 un general assembly resolution that 
changed the palestine liberation organizations nameplates to 
palestine stressed this did not change its status as a 
nonvoting observer to the world body 
in the who only a simple majority is required for plo 
admission the assembly is expected to deal with the issue by 
wednesday

abc is pulling the shade on moonlighting as 
of may 14 
the offbeat detective series once a major hit for abc suffered 
creative struggles and schedule overruns the last two seasons and 
was moved last month to a sunday time period where its ratings 
have been abysmal in last weeks nielsen ratings moonlighting 
was the seventh lowestrated show of the week 
we feel the show has reached a creative conclusion and that 
this is the appropriate time to end the series abc said in a 
statement today 
we are quite proud of the innovation which moonlighting 
brought to television during the past four years and appreciative 
of the programs tremendous contribution to abcs program schedule 
during that time 
moonlighting debuted in the spring of 1985 as a midseason 
replacement it rejuvenated cybill shepherds career and made an 
instant star of bruce willis 
audiences were wowed by the chemistry and sexual tension between 
shepherds maddie hayes a straightlaced former model whose 
accountant ran off with her money and willis david addison a 
bebopping hangloose private eye who ran a detective agency hayes 
didnt know she owned 
the show broke tradition and televisions fourth wall by 
having the characters acknowledge behindthescenes realities such 
as commercial breaks and scriptwriters 
one episode paid homage to shakespeare in a fullblown costumed 
sendup of the taming of the shrew another parodied film noir 
with a blackandwhite episode titled the dream sequence always 
rings twice 
because of the complexity of the stories and the creative 
control exerted by creator glenn gordon caron moonlighting had 
trouble staying on schedule its season run often interrupted by 
reruns the problems were exacerbated two years ago when shepherd 
became pregnant 
audiences turned against a contrived storyline that had hayes 
pregnant and unsure whether addison or another love interest mark 
harmon was the father a quickie marriage to an entirely new 
character dennis dugan only made matters worse then the marriage 
was annulled and hayes suffered a miscarriage 
gordon had left the series for feature films and new executive 
producer jay daniel struggled to get the show back on track this 
season but to no avail it had already lost its audience 
we are extremely grateful to glenn caron jay daniel cybill 
shepherd bruce willis and the entire cast and crew for their 
efforts said abc

house speaker jim wright collected more than 
25000 by renting out his texas home while he and his wife used 
rentfree housing provided by the couples business partner 
according to financial disclosure documents 
papers on file with the house show that from 1979 through most 
of 1983 the wrights rented out their fort worth duplex for an 
annual total of between 5000 and 15000 in extra income 
the extra money is over and above the 53488 value of the free 
housing provided by fort worth real estate developer george mallick 
which is the basis of some of the 69 charges of ethics violations 
lodged against wright 
wright dtexas sold the residence in august 1983 for more than 
250000 and continued to use a condominium provided by mallick 
into 1988 the records show 
members of congress are required to report their finances only 
in broad ranges so it is impossible to determine the precise value 
of the rental income from the disclosure documents 
the embattled speaker continued to be pummeled today by news 
reports of other suspect financial dealings 
the wall street journal reported that wright accepted a number 
of free flights aboard the corporate planes of a financially 
troubled nursing home chain in which he had a 100000 interest 
the newspaper citing an unidentified former official of the 
company jewell enterprises said the practice apparently violates 
house rules against accepting gifts worth more than 100 from 
individuals with a direct interest in legislation wright recently 
reimbursed 8000 to a former texas savings and loan official four 
years after he had used the officials plane for a campaign trip 
he termed the failure to pay earlier an oversight 
a former texas sampl official and major democratic fundraiser 
thomas gaubert collected large political contributions from other 
sampl executives for a 1985 special house election in texas in which 
wright was active 
one of the officials david farmer testified in federal court 
in dallas on friday that he was told wright would block legislation 
viewed as unfavorable by the sampls in return for 250000 in 
political contributions 
wright in 1981 urged reagan administration cabinet members to 
consider retaliating against canada if it sought to restrict energy 
exploration by us companies according to the dallas times herald 
at the time wright was house majority leader and owned stock in 
american quasar petroleum a fort worth company that was heavily 
involved in canadian oil and gas activities through its subsidiary 
quasar petroleum ltd 
the developments come as the house ethics committee is 
considering whether to expand its case against wright beyond the 69 
original charges to include allegations stemming from his profits 
from a 1988 gas well investment 
wright is expected to go before an ethics committee disciplinary 
hearing late this month at the proceeding the panels special 
outside counsel chicago lawyer richard j phelan will present 
evidence and wright will have a chance to defend himself 
the speakers office said today that his legal defense team will 
include stephen d susman of houston expected to handle 
questioning at the disciplinary hearing rep robert torricelli 
dnj who would be wrights emissary to house democrats and 
robert altman a washington attorney 
legal strategy will continue to be mapped by william c oldaker 
who has handled the case for wright thus far the speakers backers 
hope they will gain public stature and credibility by the 
participation on the defense team of clark clifford a former 
defense secretary and longtime prominent democrat

least nine days said londonbased lloyds which monitors shipping 
traffic worldwide the incident has not been mentioned by the 
official islamic republic news agency

university students fighting for democracy and 
clean government have taken a page from past chinese mass movements 
by heavily relying on dazibao big character posters to 
state their views 
the posters several feet long have gone up daily since april 
15 when the death of the reformminded former communist party 
chief hu yaobang touched off student demonstrations for more 
freedom 
because the news media is tightly controlled by the state the 
posters have emerged as a major means of expression for the 
students 
at first the posters largely praised hu who was regarded as 
sympathetic to calls for political reforms those who should not 
die have died said a poster at beijing university the nations 
most prestigious school 
more recent posters have discussed the achievements of the young 
student movement and debated what new steps students should take to 
press their demands after staging several prodemocracy marches 
that involved tens of thousands of people and a class boycott at 
universities throughout the city student activists are divided on 
what to do next 
at beijing university the main outdoor bulletin board is thick 
with posters pasted one on top of another in recent weeks some 
written by newly formed independent student unions and others by 
individuals 
some are hastily scrawled on newspaper pages others are long 
discourses written in a methodical hand on several pages of 
notebook paper 
cartoons have appeared on the posters as have songs including 
the beijing university pledge which begins in twofour time 
dont fear dont fear never be afraid 
hundreds of students workers and teachers read the new posters 
daily some furiously copy the messages in notebooks others read 
them into tape recorders and still others take pictures 
im doing this to maintain a historical record said a 
26yearold management student from the central china city of wuhan 
who last week was snapping photographs of beijing university 
posters 
in a few days they might be torn down by students who 
support the government he added 
authorities at beijing university and most other major schools 
so far have tolerated the posters which also have gone up on 
dormitory walls and on outer walls surrounding the campuses 
the beijing college of aeronautics however infuriated 
activists earlier this month by hosing down the posters a few new 
ones have since appeared including one written on a map of france 
with bold black chinese characters racing across the pyrenees 
bigcharacter posters seem to have lost the stigma attached to 
them during the 196676 cultural revolution when they were a 
principal source of the ultraleftist upheavals mass hysteria 
during the decade of turmoil posters of rival fanatical 
factions were plastered everywhere quoting from mao tsetungs 
red book and heaping abuse on unpopular superiors and 
government leaders in disfavor 
shoppers had difficulty finding the right store because some 
city streets were blanketed with the posters 
mao forbade any tampering with the posters no matter how 
inflammatory but they came down soon after he died in 1976 
deng xiaoping who soon emerged as chinas supreme leader 
showed his distaste for the posters when in late 1979 he ordered 
the removal of all political signs pasted on beijings democracy 
wall 
shortly thereafter chinas parliament removed from the 
constitution the right to put up dazibao 
the posters reappeared in late 1986 when students pressed 
demands for greater freedom and democracy 
but the official chinese media denounced the signs calling them 
dangerous cancers that student movement quickly ended when hu 
was fired and three intellectuals accused of inciting the students 
were purged from the communist party 
the official media has yet to criticize the current campaigns 
posters keeping in line with the leaderships conciliatory public 
stance toward the student movement 
newspapers have refrained from using the term big character 
poster when describing the signs in an apparent effort not to 
recall the dark days of the cultural revolution when posters 
provoked fear instead of thoughtful debate

million short of its goal 
the figure was revealed this morning by richard roberts son of 
the evangelist on his tv program

failed to raise the full amount

oral roberts universitys graduation saturday or creditors would 
start dismantling the university on his sunday program he said 
the deadline had been extended until today 
roberts has said that monthly contributions have declined from 
5 million to 27 million over the past two years he blamed a 
spirit of skepticism from scandals involving evangelists jim 
bakker and jimmy swaggart

last week roberts announced the university is dropping out of 
ncaa competition to save 500000 to 1 million a year the 
4000student school has applied for admission to the national 
association of intercollegiate athletics

a government official monday said 247 
people were executed for their roles in the 1956 antisoviet 
uprising the first authoritative confirmation of the number of 
hungarians put to death 
unofficial sources had estimated the number at between 200 and 
300 
the independent daily newspaper mai nap quoted gyula borics 
state secretary in the justice ministry as saying the number was 
reached following an official review of government records 
borics said the figure covers deaths ordered between 1956 and 
1961 and that it was believed to be accurate 
he said the total included 13 executions for which records had 
disappeared 
hungarians supporting democratic reforms revolted in 1956 
against the stalinist system soviet troops and tanks were sent in 
to crush the uprising whose leader imre nagy was imprisoned and 
later executed 
janos kadar became the new communist leader surviving until may 
1988 when he was replaced by karoly grosz kadars role in ending 
the revolt has never been spelled out although there are 
increasing demands for it to be clarified 
the disclosure of the number executed after 1956 is seen as part 
of the attempt by communist party reformers to tell the full truth 
about what happened during and after the revolt

reporters since their reported abduction thursday night by five 
gunmen outside south lebanons provincial capital sidon they were 
released the next morning

have threatened to kill quint unless confessed twa hijacker 
mohammed ali hamadi receives a mild sentence after his trial in 
west germany 
in frankfurt west germany today the chief judge at the hamadi 
trial heiner mueckenberger said of the kidnappings it should 
be said that if anyone thinks that this can influence us they are 
wrong

piracy in the june 1985 twa hijacking in which us navy diver 
robert stethem was killed another 39 americans were held hostage

prime minister margaret thatcher met with 
nicaraguan leader daniel ortega for the first time today and 
reportedly told him she was disappointed by his countrys lack of 
progress toward democracy 
mrs thatcher also made no promises to help nicaragua improve 
relations with the united states a british source said on 
condition of anonymity 
ortega is on a 10nation west european tour to drum up support 
for his battered economy and to help persuade the united states to 
normalize relations with nicaragua 
this is the first time ive met the prime minister and that in 
itself is a positive action that the dialogue took place ortega 
told reporters after his 75minute meeting with mrs it was a 
very frank conversation we were both frank and direct 
after joking that they both wore green to the meeting ortega 
said on other points we might not have coincided so much but we 
can work toward a convergence 
the british source said mrs thatcher voiced disappointment at 
an absence of progress toward democracy which would mean removing 
east bloc advisers from nicaragua and cutting the size of the 
armed forces according to us officials there are 8000 soviet 
bloc and cuban personnel in nicaragua including 3500 military and 
secret police 
ortega signed an accord with four central ameican nations in 
which he promised electoral and other legal reforms to ensure fair 
general elections which will be held in february but last week 
the government rejected an opposition demand to negotiate further 
reforms 
mrs thatcher said there were doubts about nicaraguas 
commitment to democracy the british source said 
ortega told reporters mrs thatcher defines her own policy and 
is going to be fair in monitoring nicaraguan developments 
turning to the united states he said the prime ministers 
status as a world leader allows her to be able to contribute 
so that the problems which exist between the united states and 
nicaragua can be overcome the british source said mrs thatcher 
did not make any promises on that score 
ortega said she also did not promise any financial aid for 
nicaragua but he added we didnt have much hope for that 
mrs thatcher reportedly told ortega nicaraguas economic 
problems were largely his governments own fault ortega blames 
them on his long war with usbacked contra rebels that has left 
26500 people dead and 23500 wounded 
ortega and his delegation have visited france belgium spain

a blood test that measures the amount of a 
particular hormone may help in assessing a depressed childs risk 
of suicide a new study suggests 
but researcher cynthia pfeffer stressed that the approach needs 
further study and that results of her research provide just a 
glimmer that the test may be useful 
pfeffer an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at the 
cornell university medical college spoke in an interview before 
presenting the study monday at the annual meeting of the american 
psychiatric association 
each year about 100 to 200 suicides occur among children age 10 
to 14 a rate of about one per 100000 children writes paul 
holinger of the rushpresbyterianst lukes medical center in 
chicago in the newly published book suicide among youth 
perspectives on risk and prevention 
thousands of other children in that age group attempt suicide 
each year said herbert hendin executive director of the american 
suicide foundation in new york 
pfeffers research done with colleagues at cornell and at 
columbia university in new york involved 51 child patients in 
psychiatric hospital 
the average age of the children was about 11 within about six 
months before admission to a hospital three children had made 
serious suicide attempts 10 made mild attempts 12 threatened 
suicide and 14 had suicidal ideas ten others were not suicidal 
and the status of two could not be determined 
the blood test focused on a hormone called cortisol the hormone 
is involved with the neuroendocrine system which is part of the 
hormonal system regulated by the brain pfeffer said so cortisol 
measurements may be able to reveal abnormalities in that system 
she said 
some previous studies have linked cortisol abnormalities to 
depression stress and suicide in adults and adolescents but 
little research on cortisol and suicide has been done in children 
in pfeffers study researchers measured cortisol levels in the 
blood and also performed a procedure called the dexamethasone 
suppression test patients were given a substance called 
dexamethasone to see if it made their bodies produce less cortisol 
in most people dexamethasone will lower their cortisol levels 
but others including some depressed patients do not show that 
response 
the children in the study were tested within two weeks of 
admission to the hospital and again seven weeks after admission 
researchers found that children whose cortisol levels were not 
suppressed by the dexamethasone in the initial test tended to have 
more serious suicidal thoughts at the sevenweek point than the 
others did seriousness of the thoughts was ranked by such factors 
as whether the child had a plan for suicide and whether the plan 
was worked out in detail 
researchers also found higher natural cortisol levels at the 
sevenweek point in children who showed suicidal behavior or 
thoughts both at that time and upon hospital admission than in 
children who had shown such suicidal tendencies only in the first 
test so children with persistent suicidal tendencies averaged 
higher cortisol levels pfeffer said 
the studys results suggest the approach deserves further 
research but it is too soon to tell what the usefulness of 
cortisol testing might be michael stanley of the new york state 
psychiatric institute said in an interview 
herbert meltzer psychiatry professor at the case western 
reserve school of medicine in cleveland said children should be 
followed for a longer period to see how well the experimental test 
predicts suicidal behavior 
he also noted that only three children in the study had made 
serious suicide attempts before hospitalization 
but because the study results were consistent with findings in 
adults the new work suggests that research about the biology of 
suicide in adults also may apply to children he said 
meltzer cautioned however that the new results are limited 
because researchers evidently did not measure the amount of 
dexamethasone in the blood when cortisol suppression was measured 
people differ significantly in how much dexamethasone stays in the 
blood and that should be taken into account he said

opposition leaders today claimed gen 
manuel antonio noriegas forces rigged the presidential election 
and witnesses said soldiers stole vote tallies at gunpoint from 
precinct workers 
the official tabulation board said today it had not received a 
single vote to count witnesses said soldiers stole lists of 
precinct results nationwide and that shots were fired into the air 
in at least two instances when opposition members objected there 
were some reports of injuries by beating 
bishop daniel enrique nunez said a dutch priest who allegedly 
was arrested and shot sunday by noriegas defense forces died 
today unconfirmed reports said the priest the rev nichols van 
cleef was arrested after he urged a high voter turnout in the 
northern town of conception and denounced fraud 
both opposition and governmentbacked parties claimed victory in 
sundays largely peaceful voting a contest that was seen as a 
referendum on noriegas de facto rule and us involvement in 
panamanian affairs opposition leaders called for a massive march 
today to protest election fraud 
turnout was high and many people had to wait in line several 
hours to cast ballots for president two vice presidents and the 
national assembly 
there can be no recount when polls closed poll workers burned 
the ballots after official results were verified at each precinct 
and put on tally sheets a political tradition aimed at ending 
recount demands 
it was after the ballots were burned but before the tally sheets 
were turned in to central election headquarters that the tally 
sheets were stolen 
government and defense forces spokesmen did not immediately 
return telephone requests for comment or a statements a us 
embassy spokeswoman said the embassy was getting many reports of 
fraud but had no immediate comment 
for more than a year the united states has been trying to oust 
noriega who was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in 
florida the united states imposed economic sanctions supported 
antigovernment leaders and reportedly gave 10 million to the 
opposition election campaign 
sen john mccain rariz part of a 13member uninvited 
delegation sent by president bush said sunday weve seen many 
irregularities but it is difficult to judge the extent of the 
irregularities 
the opposition claimed that noriegas 15000member defense 
forces rigged the voting with soldiers voting more than once and 
some ballots cast in the name of dead voters 
despite all the irregularities the opposition has 
triumphed opposition presidential candidate guillermo endara 
told a news conference sunday night he claimed to have won by a 
2to1 margin over noriegas handpicked candidate carlos duque 
witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said today that 
final tallies of precinct votes were seized by soldiers in panama 
city its suburb of san migulito and the atlantic port city of 
colon 
at the venezuela school in panama city witnesses said 
government representatives offered to take the vote tallies to the 
central counting place when the opposition objected the lights 
went out and shooting began and when the lights went back on the 
ballots were gone they said 
witnesses reported similar thefts elsewhere but the extent of 
the fraud was uncertain 
in san migulito neighbors said soldiers entered the orlando 
winter gymnasium a ballot collection point at about 3 am and 
began firing rifles and shotguns into the air the witnesses said 
people waiting for the tallies to come in from various precincts 
fled over fences and into private homes 
vote tallies left behind showed the government losing badly 
witnesses said witnesses said people were beaten and at least one 
arrested 
they were in uniform they were riot police and they took 
over the street they knew the government had lost said one 
witness marcos herrera 
elizabeth escobar said a man ran into her house and left an 
envelope containing a tally sheet for precinct 3655 
he said hang on to this well be back to pick it up later 
 
table 3655 went to opposition candidate endara 12141 over 
duque other tallies the soldiers overlooked showed the government 
losing badly in some cases by a margin of 3to1 
we are deeply perplexed and surprised that at this hour they 
announce that they havent got the tally sheets said fernando 
suarez gonzalez a spanish member of a parliamentary observer group 
obviously if 120000 votes were to disappear as a result of 
violence it would be difficult to assume that this was an honest 
election he said the san miguelito district contained about 
120000 of panamas 118 million registered voters 
in colon an opposition spokesman said armed civilians stole 
about 270 of 281 tally sheets and that many party poll watchers 
were beaten 
in a statement read over national radio this morning diomedes 
rosa president of the national tabulation junta said it had no 
precinct reports from local vote collection points to tabulate as 
of 850 am almost 16 hours after voting ended 
the government promised results by this evening and declared 
today a holiday the opposition called for an afternoon protest 
march and threatened a general strike 
noriega campaigning on behalf of his handpicked candidate 
said a vote for the opposition would ensure suffocating us 
influence over panamanian affairs he also claimed that washington 
was preparing to renege on the 1977 treaty giving panama sole 
control of the panama canal in 1999 
the bush administration said last week that it expected noriega 
to rig the elections and that it was prepared to look for other 
ways including freezing noriegas foreign assets to oust the 
military ruler

a top government scientist said the office of 
management and budget over his strong objections significantly 
changed his conclusions on global warming in testimony prepared for 
a senate subcommittee today 
dr james e hansen director of nasas goddard institute for 
space studies told the panel that omb forced him to contradict his 
findings that the socalled greenhouse effect will increase the 
likelihood of drought 
the white house confirmed changes were made and it defended the 
action 
hansen said that as a government scientist he should be able 
to say what my opinions are but added he was unable to convince 
omb offiicals 
theyre scared of the truth said sen albert gore jr 
dtenn chairman of the senate science subcommittee its a form 
of scientific fraud by them 
if they attempt retribution they will have on their hands the 
congressional equivalent of world war iii gore told hansen 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the 
practice routine and said the changes were made by an omb official 
who was four of five levels down from the top still he said 
the administration stands behind it 
fitzwater claimed that much disagreement exists among 
scientists within and outside the government on the global 
warming issue 
hansens original testimony gave the appearance that there was 
unanimity within the government on this matter we simply wanted to 
point out that there wasnt the spokesman said we thought we 
were commenting on policy not scientific evidence 
opening the hearing today gore said scientists like dr 
hansen tell us that global temperatures could increase two to five 
degrees centigrade in our lifetimes because of the billions and 
billions of tons of carbon dioxide we pump into the air every year 
and because emissions of other greenhouses gases 
the senator said there are a few environmentalists in this 
administration such as william reilly at epa the environmental 
protection agency who is first rate but they are outnumbered by 
the james watt clones put in key posts throughout the 
administration the environmentalists are being overruled and 
worse theyre sometimes being muzzled 
as former president reagans interior secretary watt pursued 
policies that were vehemently opposed by environmental groups 
gore said hansen one of our governments foremost 
scientists was censored not on questions of policy but on his 
scientific opinions concerning detailed painstaking research 
the new york times today quoted hansen as saying omb edited the 
text of his testimony for todays hearing to soften the conclusions 
and make the prospects of change in climate appear more uncertain 
it distresses me that they put words in my mouth they even 
put it in the first person hansen told the times adding that he 
had tried to negotiate with the budget office over the wording 
but they refused to change 
i should be allowed to say what is my scientific position 
there is no rationale by which omb should be censoring scientific 
opinion hansen said i can understand changing policy but not 
science 
the times said hansens original testimony was that computer 
projections of changes in climate caused by carbon dioxide and 
other gases released into the atmosphere show substantial increases 
in temperature drought severe storms and other stresses likely to 
affect the earths biological systems 
hansens original testimony would have supported the position 
that while there are still many uncertainties enough is known now 
about the general and even regional effects of the global warming 
trend to start acting now to mitigate and prepare for those 
effects the paper said 
officials ordered the scientist to change his testimony because 
it would conflict with the ideologically based donothing 
approach which theyre most comfortable with said gore 
gore said he was told by sources in the bush administration that 
officials had censored the scientific opinions we have asked to 
be presented 
i think theyre scared of the truth i think theyre scared 
that hansen and the other scientists are right and that some 
dramatic policy changes are going to be needed and they dont want 
to face up to it because they prefer to do nothing 
gore said he knew of no similar orders being given to other 
scientists scheduled to testify he said his committee would ask 
omb officials to explain why the testimony was changed

the federal aviation administration said 
monday it has sent inspectors to eastern airlines main base in 
miami to see if there are any violations of maintenance 
recordkeeping rules such as those found in new york last week 
the air carrier announced thursday that it had temporarily 
surrendered its repair station certificate at new yorks john f 
kennedy airport after the faa determined eastern failed to follow 
its system for recording and inspecting maintenance performed 
the new york suspension was for actions that predated the start 
of the strike by eastern union workers on march 4 said jack 
barker public affairs officer at the faas atlanta office 
no maintenance work has been performed at kennedy since the 
start of the strike he saidtificate will have the 
effect of not allowing any future work until the deficiencies have 
been lifting the cer corrected 
since miami is the home office of eastern we have a team in 
miami checking the main maintenance base to see if there is a 
problem there barker said 
recordkeeping problems are a big part of the new york 
suspension to show that aircraft are in fact airworthy barker 
said that hopefully is an isolated incident in new york there 
seems to be a communications problem within eastern because there 
was not proper recording of work perforild radarevading bombers 
a straightforward accounting of the b2s cost schedule 
capabilities and management would contribute to the programs 
creditability and accountability aspin said in a twopage letter 
to cheney 
the armed services chairman said a piecemeal approach to 
declassification has only increased speculation about the status of 
the program 
the rash of recent media reports on the program its cost 
increases schedule slips and management deficiencies has done 
little to reduce skepticism about the b2 particularly in the 
current budget environment aspin said 
the wisconsin democrat did not provide reasons for the cost 
increase 
the pentagon has envisioned a fleet of 132 planes in the fiscal 
1990 budget cheney proposed pushing back production of the b2 a 
year to 1993 with almost 41 billion cut from the fiscal 1990 and 
1991 budgets

two west german relief workers said 
monday they were freed from brief captivity last week to carry the 
demands of kidnappers holding a third west german but they would 
not reveal the demands 
in bonn west german officials said the demands had been relayed 
by lebanese authorities they also refused to say what the 
kidnappers wanted but a spokeswoman for the relief agency said one 
was that mohammed ali hamadi be given no more than five years in 
prison 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is being tried in frankfurt 
for murder and air piracy in the june 1985 twa hijacking during 
which us navy diver robert stethem was killed and 39 americans 
were held hostage for 17 days 
prosecutors have requested a life sentence for the defendant 
who has admitted to the hijacking 
mondays meeting with journalists was the first for heinrich 
struebig and petra schnitzler since the report that five gunmen 
abducted them thursday night on the outskirts of sidon provincial 
capital of south lebanon 
they were freed the next morning and said the kidnappers were 
holding markus quint another worker for the private asmehumanitas 
relief organization abducted with them 
we were freed in the early morning of may 5 to transmit the 
orders of the kidnappers to the responsible authorities in west 
germany said a statement in english they distributed at a 
meeting in the relief groups seaside compound at aaqbieh 
in the statement they said we cant and we dont want to 
give any further information about this case now because we dont 
want to endanger the life of markus quint 
dagmar nackunstz of asmehumanitas said in bonn from what 
ive heard they want a mild sentence for hamadi not more than 
five years they also want a government mediator to travel to 
lebanon and brief them on the hamadi case 
col wajih abu ali plo military police commander in the region 
said friday that struebig and ms schnitzler told him the 
kidnappers threatened to kill quint unless hamadi got a mild 
sentence 
identification of the captive as quint dispelled confusion that 
arose when officials of the palestine liberation organization 
initially identified him as michael markus 
west german press reports said quint in his early 20s was the 
cook for a sixmember asmehumanitas medical team that provides 
medical care at ein elhilweh and mieh mieh palestinian refugee 
camps in sidon 
neither struebig nor ms schnitzler would say whether the 
demands had been conveyed to the west german government they 
disappeared and reappeared under similar circumstances last year 
and an official spokesman in bonn termed the latest incident 
strange 
ms schnitzler said they were shocked by a statement 
insinuating that weve sort of stagemanaged or engineered the 
affair 
we wondered how such a statement could be issued by the 
foreign ministry which has not tried to get directly to us for 
information she said they have sought information from 
various other parties but none directly from us 
asked whether the kidnappers had set a 10day deadline for 
compliance with their demands ms schnitzler a 26yearold nurse 
smiled and said we do have a limited time to convey the demands 
of the captors 
abu ali the plo commander said struebig and ms schnitzler 
also told him the kidnappers demanded freedom within 10 days for a 
lebanese jailed in cyprus he is believed to be amin zaarour 
sentenced to seven years in september 1987 after a suitcase loaded 
with grenades was found in his apartment 
struebig 48 is the relief groups administrator he and ms 
schnitzler have spent most of their time inside the twostory 
asmehumanitas headquarters building since being released 
both said they would not leave lebanon despite their 
governments advice that all remaining west germans do so 
we are a humanitarian organization trying to help people 
struebig said ms schnitzler added we will not leave lebanon 
we will not leave markus 
fifteen other foreigners are missing in lebanon including nine 
americans held longest is terry a anderson chief middle east

authorities seized a dissident leader 
monday and ordered the arrests of 90 other activists in a crackdown 
on violent protests by leftist radicals 
police announced the arrest of lee changbok a leader of the 
nations main dissident alliance the united national democratic 
movement they said he was arrested on charges of violating 
national security laws 
officials said lee 51 had supported communist north korea and 
organized strikes and violent demonstrations 
later police authorized the nationwide roundup of 90 students 
workers and others involved in antigovernment strikes and 
protests the number includes 25 student radicals police said 
the government began putting more pressure on the leftist 
movement after six riot policemen were burned to death in a clash 
with radical students in the southern city of pusan last week 
president roh taewoo warned may 3 that he would invoke 
emergency measures to halt the violent protests and strikes he 
charged that dissidents were attempting to stage a leftist 
revolution under the control of north korea 
also monday the defense ministry warned it would use strong 
countermeasures to keep key defense industries running if they 
are hit by strikes officials said troops could be used to keep 
plants operating 
defense officials who declined to be identified said strikes 
in defense industries were illegal and warned that anyone 
organizing labor unrest would be severely punished 
the government says strikes cost the economy almost 4 billion 
in lost production this year 
radical students and other radical antigovernment groups have 
little public support because of their violent tactics and extreme 
political views the radicals have been calling for the overthrow 
of roh the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers and 
farmers and reunification with north korea 
meanwhile the national assembly opens tuesday for a 20day 
session that will include debate on whether to ban firebombs 
ruling and opposition lawmakers have agreed in principle to

a car bomb injured a former cabinet 
minister as he was being driven to work monday and authorities 
blamed a leftist group they said may be trying to disrupt next 
months national elections 
former public order minister george petsos a senior member of 
the government socialist party was taken to a hospital in the 
suburb of philothei doctors operated to remove glass shards from 
his face and body 
petsos 42 was being driven to his office when his vehicle 
passed an parked auto rigged with explosives a police said 
i got out from the righthand door because the left one was 
jammed and ran out to find a car to take me to a hospital petsos 
told reporters from his hospital bed 
a police driver and a bodyguard were slightly injured police 
said 
we have no real leads in the case except that the rigged car 
and its license plates were stolen said a senior police 
official speaking on condition of anonymity 
no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack but 
police said they believe it was the work of the november 17 
terrorist organization an elusive group that has claimed 13 
killings and many bombings since 1975 
the government said the attack was aimed at disrupting the june 
18 general elections 
police said the attack was nearly identical to one in june 1988 
against us navy capt william e nordeen nordeen the us 
defense attache in greece was killed by a bomb that was in a 
parked car and exploded as he drove by in his armorplated 
automobile 
the november 17 group is named after the day in 1973 when troops 
and tanks crushed a student uprising against the 196774 military 
dictatorship 
the group aims to overthrow the government through armed 
revolution and establish a marxist regime 
petsos claimed the terrorist attack against him was the result 
of the libel and false reports about me in greek newspapers 
they gave the terrorists the tools to justify my 
eradication he said 
greek newspapers have alleged that petsos was involved in a 
multimillion dollar financial scandal surrounding a greek banker 
who is in custody in the united states awaiting a hearing on a 
greek extradition request 
the former chairman of the bank of crete george koskotas fled 
greece in november after being indicted for fraud forgery and 
embezzlement in connection with 200 million missing from his bank 
petsos was dropped from the cabinet during a march shakeup when 
premier andreas papandreou tried to rid his government of ministers 
accused of involvement in the bank scandal

vermonts court administrator said monday 
he has acted to force the retirement of a supreme court justice who 
is fighting a mandatory retirement provision in the state 
constitution 
justice louis peck turned 70 in december and according to the 
vermont constitution should have retired at the end of the year 
he did not believing the state constitutional provision violates a 
federal act that prohibits age discrimination 
thomas lehner administrator of the state court system said 
monday that he had filed state forms terminating justice peck 
from active service as of june 30 
i am doing this reluctantly to clarify the issue and establish 
the clear precedent whether the vermont constitution or federal 
statute prevails in this case lehner said 
peck said monday he expects to file a complaint protesting the 
move with the federal equal employment opportunity commission 
my hope is that the commission will act on my behalf and take 
on this case said peck 
as amended in 1974 the state constitution says all justices 
of the supreme court and judges of all subordinate courts shall be 
retired at the end of the calendar year in which they attain 70 
years of age 
but in late 1986 congress amended the age discrimination in 
employment act of 1967 to prohibit age discrimination regardless 
of age previously the law did not apply to anyone older than 70 
on pecks side is an opinion from the state attorney generals 
office saying the federal act prevails but a recent federal 
appeals court ruling involving a massachusetts judge rejects that 
reasoning 
in filing the forms to retire peck lehner wrote the state 
commissioner of finance and management that i have delayed the 
execution of this personnel action until today because the law in 
this area is not clear 
however the court administrator wrote because the 
constitution mandates retirement i have executed and forward to 
you the enclosed personnel action form 
peck is one of five justices on the state supreme court 
vermonts highest court and only appeals court he was appointed to 
the court in 1981 and has three more years in his term and would 
then have to seek legislative retention to continue on the court 
he has said he might consider retiring before his term is up 
but only if the age issue is settled i am not doing this for my 
sake he said im doing this for the people who will come 
after i am determined to stay on until this is resolved 
the 1st us circuit court of appeals said in the massachusetts 
case last year that it could not find any evidence congress meant 
its law to usurp the state power to govern the tenure of judges 
however 1st circuit rulings have no immediate effect in 
vermont which is under jurisdiction of the 2nd us circuit court 
of appeals 
peck said he hopes a suit could be decided quickly we will 
probably seek an injunction stopping the retirement order from 
going into effect he said 
the uncertainty over pecks status has prompted a number of 
lawyers to file motions challenging orders he has made so far this 
year and seeking his disqualification from upcoming cases the 
state defender generals office alone has filed 30 such motions 
the supreme court has tentatively scheduled two sessions next 
week to hear all the motions involving peck

communist party general secretary zhao ziyang on 
monday praised students who have returned to class after three 
weeks of prodemocracy protests saying it showed increasing 
reason 
zhao also promised china will proceed with political reform 
which has lagged well behind decentralization of the economy 
although the ruling party has made some effort to separate its 
work from that of the government and replace arbitrary 
decisionmaking with laws the government remains mainly the 
executor of decisions made by a few top party leaders 
economic and political restructuring should support each 
other the official xinhua news agency quoted zhao as telling a 
turkish delegation 
the tens of thousands of students who have held marches sitins 
and other protests the past three weeks have demanded the pace of 
political reform be stepped up and that basic freedoms such as the 
right to speak and a free press be protected they also called for 
an end to worsening official corruption 
many of the demands voiced by the students represent problems 
that the party and government are trying to solve zhao said 
without mentioning specifics 
the situation of the protests has been prevented from 
becoming acute because the party and government have all along 
adopted a very tolerant and restrained attitude and because most 
students have acted with increasing reason he said 
since a massive march thursday on tiananmen square many student 
activists have said they will change tactics and concentrate on 
spreading their message of democracy to the public rather than 
marching 
the only protest still continuing is a class boycott at 
prestigious beijing university activists said about 70 percent of 
the schools more than 10000 students remained out of class monday 
most other students in beijing have ended the boycott which 
began april 24 
beijing students also have continued to press their appeal for a 
formal dialogue with the government on political reform and 
democracy 
the student dialogue representative group established by about 
30 universities to pursue a dialogue met with officials at the 
government reception department for nearly an hour monday 
a member of the group said later the officials gave us a phone 
number and told us to call them by thursday with our proposal for a 
specific time and place the student speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the group was not assuming this meant acceptance 
but was preparing for talks anyway 
xinhua reported late monday that the head of the reception 
department zheng youmei told the students the government and 
party would have broad contacts and dialogues with workers 
peasants intellectuals students teachers and people with 
nonparty affiliations however he stopped short of saying 
whether officials would meet with the student dialogue 
representative group 
various government officials have met with selected students in 
the past nine days but have refused to recognize any of the 
independent associations the students have formed since beginning 
their democracy movement april 15 
instead the government has sought to divide the students by 
field for example agriculture minister he kang met sunday with 
about 20 students of two agricultural schools and answered their 
questions about rural problems he acknowledged not enough money 
was being invested in agriculture but offered no solutions 
according to a report in mondays official peoples daily 
the graduate student said such talks did not represent all 
beijing students or cover the broad topics that the student 
dialogue representative group hopes to discuss 
the group also hopes for protracted talks not a single meeting 
limited to students asking questions 
journalists for the official media also are pursuing a dialogue 
with the government several hundred planned to present a petition 
tuesday calling for talks on censorship and the dismissal of the 
editor of chinas most outspoken newspaper the world economic 
herald of shanghai 
the editor qin benli was fired two weeks ago after refusing to 
alter an edition in keeping with government instructions 
qins firing and tight censorship of reports on the student 
movement prompted about 300 reporters to march with the students 
thursday in an unprecedented rebellion by members of chinas 
official media

a group of american and soviet scientists 
saying technology is available to verify virtually all forms of 
arms control agreements urged on monday that up to 90 percent of 
existing us and soviet nuclear weapons and warheads eventually be 
destroyed 
at a briefing in a house hearing room american physicists also 
demonstrated a device which they said shows the feasibility of 
detecting antisatellite laser bursts effectively monitoring a 
future ban on laser beams of destructive intensity 
the briefing was held under the auspices of rep george brown 
dcalif who said that these scientists have shown that 
essentially all the major verification problems can be solved 
given a little creativity and some solid cooperation 
the problem of assuring effective verification is an obstacle to 
a new treaty making deep cuts in strategic intercontinental 
nuclear weapons ussoviet negotiations on such a treaty are 
expected to resume in geneva later this year 
previous treaties such as the pact banning mediumrange 
nucleararmed missiles in europe and elsewhere require the 
destruction of only the delivery systems not the actual warheads 
warheads were not affected for various reasons including the 
fear on both sides that an inspection of their destruction would 
reveal the secrets of their design 
frank von hipple a physicist and professor of public policy at 
princeton university representing the american federation of 
scientists outlined a system in which for example soviet nuclear 
warheads would be taken to a central facility to be dismantled in 
privacy by soviet technicians 
american inspectors on the perimeter of the facility would make 
sure that actual warheads entered the facility and that no warheads 
were removed 
the fissionable material would be removed under international 
safeguards to civilian reactors and the facility would be 
inspected to make sure no warheads had been hidden 
von hipple said other verification obstacles also could be 
overcome 
for example a limit on the number of nucleararmed warheads on 
a single missile could be verified by sensors without the necessity 
of actually looking under the weapons protective shroud he said 
von hipple said that effective verification could lead to far 
deeper reductions in nuclear arms than so far contemplated and to 
shutting down nuclear reactors producing weaponsgrade material 
we are looking toward 90 percent reductions he said adding 
that he believes the remaining nuclear deterrent on both sides 
would be secure and stabilizing 
a senior soviet scientist roald z sagdeev chairman of the 
committee on international security and arms control of the soviet 
academy of sciences said the proposals outlined by von hipple 
would provide a technical basis for the future 
it is conceptually feasible to create the technology for 
verification which would at the same time provide protection for 
the secrets of military design he said 
a team of american scientists who had set up a small laser in 
the hearing room demonstrated how the scattered light produced by 
the laser beam could be detected by a monitoring device and fed 
into a computer to measure its intensity 
they suggested that equipment could be developed that would fit 
into a van to be parked in the vicinity of an actual or suspected 
laser generating facility 
they said laser rays could be detected from a site up to a 
kilometer away from such a site the distance would be sufficient 
they said not to intrude on the actual site itself 
sagdeev was asked if the soviet union would permit such 
intrusive onsite inspection 
i would suspect its negotiable he replied 
brown said if it can be proved that bursts from a groundbased 
laser can be monitored and measured that could serve as the basis 
for a treaty blocking the development of such laserpowered 
antisatellite weapons

prime minister noboru takeshita huddled with 
governing party leaders monday to resume the search for a 
scandalfree successor and a way to revive the partys plunging 
popularity 
by all accounts most party members already have agreed that 
former foreign minister masayoshi ito should replace takeshita but 
ito has resisted the overtures 
takeshita who returned sunday from a nineday trip to southeast 
asia indicated he hopes to be succeeded by ito who chairs the 
governing liberal democratic partys policymaking executive 
council 
but ito on monday again refused the post when approached by 
party officials citing his age and poor health 
ito 75 suffers from diabetes and a heart condition and has 
been told by his doctor not to work more than three hours a day 
government and party sources said 
i am not inclined to accept the offer ito told a fellow 
liberal democrat according to a source close to the meeting 
ito is seen as one of the few senior liberal democratic party 
members not touched by the recruit bribery scandal which has 
severely eroded public support for the party that has dominated 
japanese politics for more than three decades 
with elections for half of parliaments upper house due this 
summer party leaders hope that a leader with a clean image will 
help it regain lost popularity 
in a poll reported monday by the newspaper asahi shimbun only 
about 25 percent of those responding said they would vote for 
liberal democratic candidates in the upper house election down 
from about 45 percent in the previous poll conducted in may 1986 
in talks monday takeshita asked shintaro abe the governing 
partys secretarygeneral to meet with party elders on tuesday to 
seek a consensus on itos selection and then meet with ito on 
wednesday news reports said 
the head of the ruling party routinely becomes japans prime 
minister because of the liberal democrats large majority in 
parliament 
in the scandal the recruit co made large donations to 
takeshita and other leading politicians chiefly from the ruling 
party and sold bargainpriced stock shares to about 160 
politicians businessmen and others 
in a new development monday the japan broadcasting corp 
reported that katsuya ikeda former deputysecretary general of the 
opposition clean government party received about 100000 in 
donations from recruit in 198587 
ikeda made statements in parliament on several occasions that 
were favorable to recruit prosecutors are said to have questioned 
him last week 
fourteen bureaucrats and businessmen have been arrested so far 
in the scandal which also has led to the resignation of three 
cabinet members 
takeshita announced april 25 that he would resign after the 
fiscal 1989 budget passes parliament to take responsibility for the 
scandals effects 
but on monday the liberal democrats and opposition parties 
failed to agree to begin budget debate in the upper house the 
opposition renewed a demand that former prime minister yasuhiro 
nakasone testify under oath about his links to the scandal

many buying their first homes and first cars 
but corporate staff will fall below 200 next month when the

say the belttightening was necessary because of the continuing 
slump in the petroleum industry 
some of those being let go have more than 25 years of service 
the relocation was a good move for all of us said carole 
morizio who has been with caltex for 30 years but now in this

a federal panel rejected the idea of requiring 
seat belts in most school buses monday and said safety officials 
ought to concentrate on bus loading zones where children are in 
much greater danger 
nearly 40 children are killed each year while trying to get on 
or off school buses compared to about 10 deaths among children 
riding the buses said a report by a committee of the national 
research council 
while most of the public controversy about school bus safety 
has revolved around seat belts and other measures to protect 
students en route to school this emphasis is really misplaced 
said charley wootan chairman of the panel of safety and 
transportation experts 
in an 18month study ordered by congress and paid for by the 
transportation department the group said it would cost 40 million 
a year to install and maintain seat belts on the 300000 large 
buses that transport most children only small vanlike buses that 
make up 20 percent of the fleet are now required to have belts 
the panel concluded that if half the students on all buses used 
the belts perhaps one life a year would be saved and several dozen 
injuries avoided statistics it termed not sufficient to justify 
a federal standard mandating installation 
the study did say the national highway traffic safety 
administration should require that seat backs on new buses be at 
least 24 inches high a fourinch increase the change would save 
two to three lives and avert about 95 injuries a year at a cost of 
6 million annually wootan said 
in addition the panel said all states should immediately ban 
standing in the aisles on school buses standing is specifically 
permitted by law in 14 states tennessee alabama georgia 
kentucky louisiana texas virginia massachusetts michigan 
missouri mississippi new york ohio and wyoming 
districts also were urged to phase out as quickly as possible 
buses built before 1977 which lack protected fuel tanks extra 
seat padding and other safety requirements instituted that year 
the panel studied school bus safety records for the period 
19821986 and found that twothirds of loadingzone fatalities 
occur when children are struck by a school bus usually their own 
five and sixyearolds are the most frequent victims 
the group recommended standards for bus driver training better 
education of children about safety in the loading zone and 
installation of stopsignal arms on all new school buses with 
consideration to putting them on older models as well the arms are 
stop signs with flashing red lights that extend from the left side 
of the bus when it stops they are required in 28 states 
wootan said districts should also consider the use of 
loudspeakers crossingcontrol arms improved crossview mirrors 
and electronic and mechanical sensors that could reduce the number 
of children struck by their own buses 
while there is no crisis in school bus safety wootan said the 
steps recommended by his panel should be able to produce 
important reductions in deaths and injuries without burdening 
already strained school budgets with high financial costs 
the recommendation on phasing out buses built before 1977 is 
similar to the one made by the national transportation safety board 
five weeks ago in connection to the headon collision of a pickup 
truck and an older school bus a year ago in kentucky 
the crash was especially severe because the bus unprotected 
fuel tank burst into flames that spread fire and smoke through the 
bus three adults and 24 children were killed 
asked why his panel did not recommend an immediate halt in the 
operation of older buses wootan replied its an economic issue 
we recognize that it is not going to be possible in many of the 
poorer school districts that do not have the money to replace these 
buses immediately 
more than onefifth of the nations school bus fleet dates from 
before 1977 and the life expectancy of a bus ranges from 15 to 30 
years panel members said 
while the 13member panel agreed the federal government should 
not require seat belts in buses it split on whether to encourage 
states and districts to install them anyway if they have the money 
wootan said a strong minority argued that buses should have 
belts to be consistent with the other vehicles in which children 
ride so you could maintain that seat belt habit but he said a 
narrow majority favored no encouragement on the grounds that the 
money could be more effectively spent to improve safety in other 
ways 
there are 390000 school buses in the country and they travel 4 
billion miles a year

dictator josef stalin ignored warnings from soviet 
spies that nazi germany was planning to invade and failed to 
prepare his country for a war that cost 20 million soviet lives 
pravda told its readers on monday 
the fullpage article in the communist party newspaper came on 
the eve of the 44th anniversary of the soviet victory in world war 
ii it marked a sharp break from the traditionally patriotic and 
positive reminiscences of soviet heroism 
the article also contrasted with a festive mood in the capital 
which was festooned with red banners for tuesdays holiday on red 
square a large banner stated simply 19411945 the years of 
the war 
western historians have written much about how stalin ignored 
intelligence reports about hitlers invasion plans but little has 
come out in the soviet union the dictator typically had been 
portrayed as a brilliant wartime leader who rallied the nation 
against nazi invaders 
but under president mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
or openness historians and others have condemned stalins 
repression of his own people and recently have begun to reexamine 
his wartime role 
last summer pravda published a chapter of a new book about 
stalin that denounced him for signing a friendship treaty with nazi 
germany purging the red army when the nation was on the brink of 
war and ignoring warnings that war was imminent 
mondays pravda further rewrote an embarrassing page in soviet 
history and gave soviets a fresh bonechilling look at what soviet 
spies learned about nazi war preparations 
pravda said the articles author history professor a baidakov 
gleaned the accounts from classified state security archives he 
said the state security agencies infiltrated the german secret 
police aviation ministry and coding service 
baidakov wrote that security officials forwarded concrete 
information to soviet political leaders about hitlers invasion 
plans as early as november 1940 german forces invaded june 21 
1941 
but the historian said 
the leadership of the ussr peoples commissariats 
ministries of state security and defense did not in my view do 
everything to convince stalin and the countrys other leaders of 
the inevitability of an imminent confrontation with the germans 
then he added but the main blame for miscalculating the time 
of the start of the war for the country not being turned into an 
armed camp in time for not being brought into a state of full 
military preparedness lies with the ussr political leadership 
of that period 
pravdas editors added their criticism saying in an 
accompanying note that the information was supervaluable however 
the political situation devalued it 
baidakov revealed several intelligence reports that he said were 
sent to stalin and his foreign minister vyacheslav m molotov 
in april 1941 he wrote soviet spies learned that hitler told a 
yugoslav prince that an invasion of the soviet was planned for 
june later that month german troops began massing on the 
romaniansoviet border later that month 
in early june soviet agents intercepted a romanian police 
telegram directing that ditches be dug by june 15 in 
germanpopulated areas to protect against air bombardment 
baidakov also wrote that stalin was told a source close to 
hermann goering a key hitler aide who founded the gestapo and 
headed the luftwaffe had ordered maps of targets in the soviet 
union 
also soviet agents in berlin reported june 12 that aviation 
officials had been told a final decision to attack was taken and 
that therefore an unexpected strike should be considered 
possible 
stalin also was told that german reconnaisance planes and agents 
had repeatedly violated the soviet border baidakov wrote 
then on june 16 this urgent message was delivered to stalin 
and molotov 
all military operations of germany on preparation of a 
military aggression against the ussr have been completely 
stopped and a blow can be expected at any time 
the next day baidakov wrote stalin asked intelligence 
officials whether the sources who wrote the message were reliable 
stalin was quoted as saying there isnt a german besides wilhelm 
pieck who can be trusted is that clear pieck was a german 
communist leader 
before the information could be rechecked the germans invaded

president maouya sidiahmed ould 
taya blamed senegal for violence in which more than 250 nationals 
of the two west african countries have been killed in each others 
territory 
in a speech broadcast sunday night taya told mauritanians any 
attempt at disturbing public order in this country would be 
considered high treason and treated as such 
he apparently referred to rumors in the capital about possible 
trouble between white and black mauritanians stemming from the 
recent violence 
twothirds of mauritanias estimated 17 million people are 
whites of arabberber descent known as moors the other third 
generally living in the southern part of the country are black 
like the senegalese 
violence began after shooting april 9 in the border village of 
diawara senegal in which two senegalese were killed some say by 
mauritanian border guards and others in a fight between local 
tribesmen 
senegalese began attacking mauritanians in their country and 
mauritanians did the same 
no official casualty toll has been issued by either country but 
unofficial reports put the number of dead at 200 in mauritania and 
60 in senegal 
taya said senegalese news media inflamed the situation by 
distorting events after the diawara shooting he also mentioned 
the remarkable passivity of senegalese authorities and police 
his accusation that distorted accounts instigated 
confrontation among nationals apparently responded to a 
televised speech a week earlier by president abdou diouf of senegal 
diouf cited inhuman and degrading treatment of senegalese in 
mauritania and accused the government in nouakchott of being behind 
the violence 
the government statement and the statement of the senegalese 
president gave the impression of an instigation to carry out more 
of these acts taya said 
an airlift was established between mauritania and senegal to 
repatriate their nationals among countries supplying aircraft were 
france algeria morocco and spain 
mauritanian officials said 50000 mauritanians were repatriated 
30000 by air and 20000 across the senegal river border about 
30000 senegalese residents of mauritania were sent home 
taya said sunday night the border shooting was not the cause of 
the strife but a pretext he demanded compensation for 
mauritanians whose shops were looted in senegal and the return of 
money he said senegalese authorities confiscated before expelling 
them 
until the violence mauritanians controlled about 80 percent of 
the small retail business in senegal in mauritania senegalese did 
most of the work in the fastgrowing fishing industry and served as 
drivers and domestic employees 
many black mauretanians in nouakchott and other northern areas 
fear a resurgence of racial friction with the moors and have begun 
moving south toward the senegal river where blacks are the 
majority 
officials deny racism still exists in mauritania but it has led 
to bloody confrontations in the past between blacks and white 
moors who have controlled the government since independence from 
france in 1960 
reports from senegal said mauritania used the air shuttle to get 
rid of some of its own black citizens including policemen who 
turned up in dakar with their identity cards and in uniform 
mustapha ould abedarrahman mauritanias information minister 
said no mauritanians had been sent to senegal but he did not deny 
some people may have had mauritanian papers 
in the formation of our young state a certain number of 
papers were made fraudulently the minister said 
no immediate official reaction to tayas speech was reported in 
dakar but the senegalese press showed no reticence 
a commentator for agence de presse senegalaise the official 
news agency said taya after a long silence since the beginning 
of these events has just made an unfortunate and deplorable 
response facile denunciation gratuitous affirmations and 
argumentation without proof have always been the arm of those who 
are in a weak position in disputes with others

heightened trade tensions between tokyo and washington

to japan arrived from hawaii where he held consultations with the 
commanderinchief of us pacific forces

looked forward to working with the japanese people 
armacosts arrival comes less than a week after the office of 
the us trade representative announced 54 items ranging from 
helicopters to cosmetics on which it said it may slap tariffs to 
penalize what it called japans failure to open its 
telecommunications market 
everybody benefits from trade the more even the better 
armacost said at the airport 
asked about the trade representatives recent move he said 
they really havent made those decisions yet were awaiting the 
results of those deliberations 
before leaving washington armacost said he hoped to negotiate 
trade issues in a mature way which benefits us both avoiding 
the emotional attacks sometimes called japanbashing 
he said he wants to contribute in some way to discussing these 
issues in a kind of lowkey cool objective way which avoids 
histrionics and hyperbole and a lot of unnecessary nationalism on 
both sides 
the united states registered a trade deficit with japan last 
year of about 52 billion according to us figures 
hiroshi mitsuzuka japans minister of international trade and 
industry said monday he was hopeful a solution could be worked out

asked the united states to give us more time to study the trade 
representatives report 
on april 30 us trade representative carla hills said her 
office was reviewing the trade activities of 34 nations whose 
markets were not open to us goods 
japan was the nation most frequently cited in her report which 
threatened retaliatory tariffs as high as 100 percent 
the trade representative has set may 30 as a date by which 
foreign governments must start marketopening negotiations with the 
united states if penalties are to be avoided 
mitsuzuka said he hoped a reply could be made by may 27 when 
japans fiscal 1989 budget is to take effect 
he said however the telecommunications issues were up to the 
ministry of posts and telecommunications

the state departments highestranking career official before 
being named ambassador to japan by president bush

and for one year prior to that was senior staff member for east 
asia at the national security council

christian university in tokyo in 196869 and a lecturer at johns

the chief judge said monday a 
verdict on twa hijacker mohammed ali hamadi will be delivered may 
17 and pressure from kidnappers who seized a west german in lebanon 
wont affect the case 
reports have linked the abduction in south lebanon on thursday 
of markus quint a young west german relief worker to the hamadi 
case 
it should be said that if anyone thinks this can influence us 
they are wrong said judge heiner mueckenberger at the opening of 
court monday here we are dealing with german law and it shall 
remain so 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is charged with murder and air 
piracy in the june 1985 twa hijacking 
us navy diver robert stethem was killed and 39 americans were 
held hostage for 17 days after twa flight 847 was seized between 
athens and rome and diverted to beirut 
prosecutors demand a life sentence for hamadi who admits taking 
part in the hijacking but denies shooting stethem 
the verdict will be on the 17th mueckenberger said if 
hamadi is convicted he also will be sentenced on that day 
security sources in bonn said privately there was a certain 
connection between the quint kidnapping and the hamadi case but 
gave no details 
a spokeswoman for asmehumanitas the private relief agency for 
which quint worked said the kidnappers demand that hamadi be given 
a sentence of five years or less 
hamadi went on trial july 5 1988 in a heavily guarded 
courtroom inside frankfurts preungesheim prison in addition to 
determining whether he is guilty the court must decide whether he 
was an adult when the hijacking occurred 
he could receive a lighter sentence if the court rules he was 
under 21 hamadi claims he is younger than court records indicate 
defense lawyer hansburkhardt steck told the court monday his 
client must be judged as a juvenile or adolescent even though 
court documents show hamadi was born june 13 1964 he said 
planning of the hijacking began before he was 21 so he should not 
be deemed an adult at the time 
steck argued that the planning phase was the actual beginning of 
the hijacking the plane was seized june 14 1985 
the lawyer said hamadi acted with limited reponsibility 
because he was influenced by those who ordered the hijacking and 
should get no more than five years for his part in the operation 
and three years transporting explosives 
stethem 23 of waldorf md was shot at beirut airport and his 
body thrown from the plane 
his parents richard and patricia and their sons kenneth and 
patrick listened quietly to the closing defense arguments monday 
with no show of emotion

the first taiwanese officials to visit 
china stood for the communist nations national anthem but this 
did not imply recognition of beijing a government official said 
monday 
finance minister shirley kuo who led the 12delegate team said 
they stood because they feared they would ejected from the annual 
meeting of the asian development bank in beijing 
we did not pay any respect to the anthem at all i even made a 
gesture by crossing my arms to signal that i do not recognize 
china kuo told a news conference on her return monday from the 
threeday meeting 
the action sparked controversy in taiwan some lawmakers and 
newspapers labeled it tacit recognition of the communist regime 
analysts say the sixday china trip is part of a taipei 
initiative to break its diplomatic isolation with a more flexible 
foreign policy 
in an editorial monday the china times said the trip signaled 
taipei has readjusted its relations with beijing by abandoning its 
conservative staunch political ideology to face reality 
the breakthrough has not only won praises from this nation and 
abroad but also triggered worries and dissatisfaction from the 
conservatives it said 
president lee tenghui said sunday the delegates completed their 
mission successfully 
the liberal independence evening post reported monday that 823 
percent of 407 readers questioned said in a telephone survey they 
were satisfied with the delegations performance only 32 percent 
of those polled said they were disappointed the rest declined 
comment 
the asian development bank which taiwan helped establish in 
1966 is the only major international organization in which taiwan 
is a member 
only 23 countries have diplomatic ties with the nationalist 
government on taiwan while 136 countries recognize china 
taiwan boycotted the banks meetings in 1986 and 1987 after 
china became a member it attended last years meeting but its 
delegates covered their name plates with nationalist flags and 
placed signs that read under protest 
the trip is a significant step toward thawing the longtime 
hostilities between both sides of the taiwan straits said chang 
lingchen a political science professor at national taiwan 
university 
it indicated that we no longer ignore the fact of communist 
rule on the mainland she added 
the nationalists who fled to this island in 1949 after losing a 
civil war on the mainland still are technically at war with the 
chinese communists

free housing given to house speaker jim wright 
by a business partner enabled him to collect upward of 25000 in 
extra income by renting out the duplex residence he owned in fort 
worth texas house records show 
financial disclosure documents show that wright rented out the 
house from 1979 through most of 1983 before selling it for more 
than 250000 wright reported rental income in each of those years 
of 5000 to 15000 made possible because he and his wife had 
moved their belongings to housing provided by fort worth real 
estate developer george mallick 
the housing mallick provided first in an apartment building and 
later a condominium was valued by the house ethics committee at 
53488 for the period 1979 through 1988 and is the basis for some 
of the 69 house rules violations alleged against the texas democrat 
members of congress are required to report their finances only 
in broad ranges so it is impossible to determine the precise value 
of the rental income from the disclosure documents 
wright will have to defend himself beginning late this month at 
a triallike disciplinary hearing and on monday he announced he 
has assembled a threepronged legal team to make his case before 
the committee the full house and the public 
the team also was drafting defense motions which were expected 
to be filed later in the week contesting some aspects of the 
charges a media briefing on the defense arguments was scheduled 
tuesday 
at the same time wright continued to be pummeled by news 
reports of other questionable financial dealings including a wall 
street journal story citing a number of free flights accepted by 
wright in 1983 and 1984 aboard corporate planes of a financially 
troubled nursing home business in which he held a 100000 interest 
the newspaper citing an unidentified former official of the 
company jewell enterprises said the practice apparently violates 
house rules against accepting gifts worth more than 100 from 
individuals with a direct interest in legislation 
referring to the companys owner tr jewell wright said 
mr jewell gave me a ride but it wasnt on any airplane he took 
me for a ride a reference to the companys eventual bankruptcy 
and wrights loss of most of his 100000 investment 
i have absolutely no recollection of ever being on any 
airplane i thought was owned by anybody connected with that firm 
wright said he declined to answer when asked whether jewell an 
official of the arlington texas bank which loaned wright the 
money to buy into the nursing home venture had helped him get the 
loan 
wright also took issue with testimony at a federal fraud trial 
in dallas involving allegations that officials of commodore savings 
association raised illegal corporate political contributions for a 
1985 special house election in which wright took a personal 
interest 
on friday the institutions former chief financial officer 
david farmer said he was told wright would kill legislation 
opposed by the savings and loan industry in return for 250000 in 
campaign contributions 
he testified that he was amazed that someone as high up as 
jim wright would be involved in this 
wright denied the allegation and said he does not know farmer 
he invited reporters to go to fort worth and interview constituents 
he has tried to help you can look until youre blind ask until 
youre hoarse listen until youre deaf and you will never find 
anybody of whom ive asked anything in return he said 
in an announcement the speakers office said his legal defense 
team will include democratic patriarch and former defense secretary 
clark clifford as senior legal and political adviser stephen d 
susman of houston expected to handle questioning at the 
disciplinary hearing rep robert torricelli dnj adviser and

an agriculture department scientist said 
monday the mysteries of outer space are no more perplexing than 
those a few inches below earths surface 
richard w zobel a plant geneticist said the root zone of 
plants called the rhizosphere is a teeming world of minerals 
gases water and life forms insects earthworms microscopic 
nematode worms a host of microorganisms living and dead plant 
roots and the chemicals they exude 
we dont even begin to thoroughly understand it although 
were slowly pulling it together he said id say our 
knowledge of the area six inches to two feet below the soils 
surface is comparable to our knowledge of outer space right now 
zobel works for the departments agricultural research service 
at the agencys laboratory in ithaca ny 
one reason for lack of knowledge about the world at our feet is 
that only recently have we had the tools to study it and theyre 
still not up to the job he said soil physics and chemistry 
plant biology and physiology entomology and microbiology all 
provide tools but none of them is designed to work with more than 
a single microorganism or a single plant at a time 
and when a scientist has to put all these elements together 
and try to study them its tough zobel said we need to learn 
how microorganisms interact with the plant and with each other 
plant roots arent all the same theyre functionally different and 
have different growth patterns some die back every two weeks 
continually feeding the microorganisms in the soil 
zobel spoke at an annual symposium held by the agency at 
beltsville md his remarks were included in reports issued by the 
department 
topics in the fourday conference include genetic engineering 
and some of the new technologies for investigating the earths root 
zone 
at a ceremony henry a wallace who died in 1965 was honored 
as the first member of a new usda honor roll of agricultural 
scientists wallace was secretary of agriculture in 193340 and 
us vice president 194145 
wallace whose roots were deep in iowa agriculture gained 
acclaim for his work as a corn breeder and as the founder of the 
first commercial hybrid seed company his father henry c wallace 
was secretary of agriculture in the early 1920s

atlantis astronauts 
glided out of orbit to a safe landing in the mojave desert today 
after a fourday mission that sent a robot spacecraft streaking 
through the solar system toward venus 
commander david walker guided the 97ton winged spaceship to a 
stop on a concrete runway at 1243 pm concluding a flight that 
covered 168 million miles and launched the first us 
interplanetary mission in 11 years 
congratulations and a nice landing and youve extended the 
shuttle reach far beyond earth orbit now magellan would be 
proud said mission control referring to the 16th century 
portugese explorer for whom the unmanned venus probe is named 
about 27500spectators the smallest crowd ever to watch a 
shuttle landing were on hand in 90degree heat the smallest 
previous crowd was 35000 in 1985 an estimated 460000 were here 
for discoverys landing march 18 a saturday 
an hour before landing walker fired braking rockets 184 miles 
above the indian ocean to drop atlantis out of orbit and start it 
on a blazing dive through the atmosphere on a course over the 
pacific and across the california coast 
two sonic booms crackled over the desert as atlantis swooped 
powerless through the clear sky making wide circles as it 
descended nasa selected a concrete runway because of crosswinds 
gusting up to 28 mph on two hard clay runways 
as the five astronauts ended the journey the magellan probe 
they released on monday was more than 640000 miles from earth on a 
15month 800millionmile voyage to venus to map its cloudveiled 
surface with supersharp radar 
scientists say the images should tell them about the history of 
venus and the evolution of its sister planet earth sulfuric acid 
clouds and a carbon dioxide atmosphere have had a greenhouse 
effect on venus with surface temperatures of 900 degrees and 
some scientists fear earth may similarly overheat 
on sunday the astronauts stayed up an hour past bedtime to stow 
equipment after replacing one of its four main computers which 
failed briefly in the only major glitch of the journey the 
computers actually fly the shuttle most of the time 
the problem posed no threat to the flight the shuttle has four 
computers a backup and a spare and can land on one computer but 
nasa decided to take no chances and had the crew cut short their 
experiments and install a spare 
the crew took 4 hours to install the computer and then got 
about seven hours of sleep 
we send our congratulations good work said mission control 
communicator tammy jernigan we wanted to point out that this is 
the first time that such a changeout has ever taken place on 
orbit 
the astronauts wakeup call this morning consisted of a barking 
dog and the beatles song a hard days night a reference to 
the repair work the night before 
good morning its time to come home mission control 
communicator ken cameron told the crew whose members also included 
pilot ronald grabe and mission specialists norman thagard mark lee 
and mary cleave 
the crew abandoned plans to melt and then crystallize a metal 
sample in a furnace and to photograph lightning and polluted areas 
on earth 
before the problem walker noted you couldnt ask for a 
better flying machine

former french premier jacques chirac on monday 
said the united states insist on modernizing shortrange nuclear 
missiles in europe despite broad west german opposition 
nuclear deterrent is the only means to insure peace chirac 
told reporters for people to be sensible they have to be 
frightened anything that would lead to denuclearization is too 
dangerous 
he said he thought soviet president mikhail gorbachev would 
succeed in his reforms but that made no difference to the nuclear 
question because we will never eliminate the risk of war 
chirac who met with president bush on monday in in the united 
states on a nineday visit 
the french conservative leader said he understood the fears of 
west germans about upgrading the lance missiles most or all of 
which would be based on their territory 
but he said west german chancellor helmut kohl is a sensible 
man a european and a man of peace and i am absolutely convinced 
that he will find a way to have the modernization of the lance 
accepted by german public opinion and that there will be no crisis 
in nato 
naturally chirac said this means that the americans must 
be very firm 
he said he was fully in accord with bush and with british prime 
minister margaret thatcher that the missiles should be modernized 
and that he didnt think west germany would withdraw from nato if 
the alliance does build new weapons 
there is absolutely no question that mrs thatcher will 
remain adamant in her support chirac said adding that french 
president francois mitterrand must also use his influence on the 
germans 
he recalled that at kohls invitation mitterrand made a speech 
in 1983 to the west german parliament the speech played a decisive 
role in winning german agreement to the deployment of mediumrange 
us pershing 2 missiles in germany chirac said 
its true that that today we do have the impression that mr 
mitterrand is less firm he said but added that he thought the 
french president would in the end come out strongly for 
modernization 
chirac said mitterrand appeared to be showing restraint out of 
concern for kohl and because of his own policy toward the soviet 
bloc which perhaps would leave him to be more open that in the 
past in negotiations 
i personally feel that he mitterrand will be firm and in the 
spirit of very deep friendship with the germans he will make use of 
his influence to support a solution which will lead to a 
modernization of the lance 
kohl chirac said is faced with serious domestic policy 
problems naturally we dont want to interfere because this perhaps 
might entail the risk of a redgreen coalition which certainly 
wouldnt be an improvement of the situation from our point of 
view

a top nasa scientist told a senate panel 
monday that testimony hed prepared on likely harsh effects of 
global warming was toned down by the bush administration despite 
his vigorous objections 
dr james hansen said the office of management and budget forced 
him to contradict within his own prepared statement his finding 
that a buildup of greenhouse effect gases would increase the 
likelihood of drought 
sen albert gore jr who questioned hansen at a subcommittee 
hearing said he saw a form of scientific fraud by the 
administration which has been taking what environmentalists 
consider a goslow position on dealing with global warming 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater confirmed that changes 
had been made in hansens prepared testimony but he said the 
scientist had never been muzzled 
the development came two days after it became known that william 
reilly head of the environmental protection agency and other 
officials had been rebuffed by the white house when they suggested 
the us government call for an international convention on global 
warming 
gore dtenn chairman of a science subcommittee commended 
hansen for courage and said that if administration officials 
attempt any kind of retribution in return for candor they will 
have on their hands the congressional equivalent of world war iii 
another government scientist dr jerry d mahlman of the 
national oceanic and atmospheric administration said he had a 
similar experience with the budget office in congressional 
testimony he prepared in february 
mahlman said he successfully fought changes that would have been 
embarrassing to me in facing his fellow scientists and told 
senators if we do not have the right to be wrong we have 
squelched the right to be creative 
at the white house fitzwater said that hansens written 
testimony as submitted represented administration policy he 
called the practice of alterations routine and said the changes 
were made by a budget official four of five levels down from the 
top 
he said the national aeronautics and space administration 
scientist was free to express his own views in answering committee 
questions hes never been muzzled hes free to say whatever he 
wants 
fitzwater said that much disagreement exists among scientists 
inside and outside the government on the global warming issue and 
said that hansens original testimony gave the appearance that 
there was unanimity within the government on this matter we 
simply wanted to point out that there wasnt 
we thought we were commenting on policy not scientific 
evidence fitzwater said 
hansen told the committee that it was unlikely scientists would 
alter the conclusions of computer models that greenhouse gases 
would increase drought in low and middle latitudes but the 
testimony also said the computer models were not reliable 
why did you contradict yourself gore asked hansen who then 
related his confrontation with budget office officials 
i did object he said i dont believe the scientific 
aspects in testimony should be altered i did try to get them to 
compromise i was not successful 
hansen said officials also added a sentence that it was unknown 
whether the buildup of greenhouse gases was from natural forces or 
from human activities hansen and others at the hearing said humans 
were primarily responsible by burning fossil fuel cutting down 
tropical rain forests and other actions 
every scientist that testified here today and every 
reputable scientist in the field supports your conclusion this is 
primarily a human cause its not an act of god omb forced you to 
say it may be just the forces of nature gore said 
theyre acting as if theyre scared of the truth the 
senator added its a form of scientific fraud by them the 
administration does not want to act it wants to sit still and do 
nothing 
the greenhouse effect is said to occur when gases in the earths 
atmosphere trap radiant heat near the planets surface in addition 
to natural buildup scientists say the gases have increased greatly 
because of burning coal oil and gas and destruction of tropical 
rain forests 
at a separate hearing monday william m diefenderfer iii 
nominated to be ombs deputy director told the senate governmental 
affairs committee that he had no firsthand knowledge of the hansen 
changes and added that he was told hansens protests had not 
reached the agencys upper echelons 
if there was an attempt to alter or change scientific fact or 
conclusion it would not be a policy i would support he said 
but he defended the agencys right to change a witness conclusions 
if they differed from the presidents policies 
administration officials said saturday that epa head reilly and 
other government proponents of a greater us leadership role on 
global warming had urged the white house to call at a 
unsponsored meeting beginning monday in geneva for an 
international convention on the subject but chief of staff john 
sununu had said the idea was premature 
epa spokesman david cohen said saturday of sununu basically 
he has been extremely supportive and he has said only that he has 
some questions that he wants answers cohen said reilly also 
believes the questions deserve answers

wisconsins governor called on the federal 
government monday to help pay for security provided at lakes where 
chippewa indians spearfish under the guarantee of 19th century 
treaties 
gov tommy g thompson said the arrests of more than 170 
nonindian protesters during the indians spring spearfishing 
season which essentially ended sunday after two weeks signaled 
the need for federal intervention 
i cant imagine that the federal officials would want to see 
this situation continue thompson said 
the republican governor met with reporters before leaving for 
washington where he was to meet with wisconsin congressmen on 
tuesday he is to meet with us interior secretary manuel lujan 
about the burdens the federal treaties with the chippewa have 
placed on the state 
the chippewa began spearfishing two years after a federal court 
ruled that the tribe retained rights to hunt fish trap and gather 
wild grain off their reservations when they gave the northern third 
of wisconsin to the united states sport fishermen complain that 
spearing fish when they are in shallow water is so much easier than 
catching fish by rod and reel that indians have an unfair advantage 
opposition to spearfishing grew even more heated this year after 
the state announced it would reduce walleye pike catch limits for 
sport anglers because a federal court had ruled the chippewa could 
spear up to 100 percent of the fish that biologists determine can 
be safely taken from the lakes 
thompson said the state could not continue picking up the cost 
of enforcing the treaties the legislature recently appropriated 
about 300000 for meeting peacekeeping costs at the lakes this 
spring plus 150000 to complete reimbursing local enforcement for 
last years enforcement expenses 
if this was a state issue i would figure out a way to solve 
it immediately he said i would call the legislature into 
session 
thompson wouldnt detail what he would discuss with federal 
officials but he said he would not seek abrogation of the chippewa 
treaties 
four of the six chippewa bands in wisconsin confirmed sunday 
they have ended spearfishing this spring after two weeks of 
enduring racial slurs and rock throwing from antitreaty protesters 
the tribal chairman of the lac du flambeau band most active of 
the chippewa spearers said the continuation of spearfishing amid 
the violent protests was a victory over racism and empty promises 
from politicians 
michael allen said the clearest victory occurred saturday night 
when an estimated 1000 vocal supporters of chippewa treaty rights 
outnumbered the 600 or so protesters at butternut lake 
we showed that we can if pressed outnumber the racists at 
the boat landings allen said 
all season long we have shown that racial violence cant bully 
us into surrendering the right he added having shown all 
that we have decided its time to stop for now 
dnr spokesman dave kunelius said the four chippewa bands ended 
spearing mostly because of the weather and the end of walleye 
spawning when the fish leave shallow water 
the tribes could spear later in the year or use gill nets after 
june 1 on lakes of more than 1000 acres according to tribal 
ordinances and federal court rulings

president bush on monday challenged small 
businesses to take the lead in finding more creative ways to 
provide child care for working parents 
he said small business is at the cutting edge of the economic 
expansion thats 77 months old and still going strong small 
businesses during the past decade have created two out of every 
three new jobs in the us economy bush said 
the president spoke during a white house ceremony at which he 
announced the selection of tad bretting of ashland wis president 
of a familyrun machinery business as national small business 
person of the year 
he said the issue of child care should be on the top of the 
list for all all small business people claiming a small 
business is less a corporation than a family 
i urge americas small businesses to take the lead in 
developing creative solutions in child care bush said 
the president has proposed legislation to give lowincome 
working families up to a 1000 tax credit for each child under age 
4 
however rival legislation sponsored by sen christopher dodd 
dconn under which the government would provide more direct help 
to businesses and individuals providing child care is headed for 
senate action 
bush indicated opposition to such an approach i think it has 
to be decided by the federal government making as flexible as 
possible the use of child care tax credits he said 
speaking of this years award winner bush said bretting had 
entered the business in 1958 and those 30 years have seen the 
bretting company grow adn prosper from 11 employees to 260 today 
from 120000 in sales to 30 million 
and today his company is the worlds leading producer of high 
tech customdesigned machinery for making paper products bush 
said and the secret of tads success is the one small business 
people know so well it all comes down to taking good care of 
customers 
the business has been in brettings family since 1890 when it 
produced machinery for sawmills 
bush presented bretting with a plaque in a ceremony in the east 
room attended by other small business leaders and many of the 52 
men and women who were in contention for the award 
this room is full of success stories today bush said 
the award is given annually by the small business administration 
bush also announced other finalists in the competition 
including first runnerup richard barlow of salina kans president 
of rema bakeware inc and second runnersup carolyn stradley 
president of camps paving inc of marietta ga and chad h olson 
chairman of the pro image inc in bountiful utah

a house panel asked former housing and urban 
development secretary samuel r pierce jr to testify so it can 
evaluate statements by one of his associates monday that the blame 
for abuses in a federal housing program goes beyond what an 
investigator has reported 
former federal housing commissioner thomas t demery told the 
house government operations subcommittee on employment and housing 
that problems existed in a lowincome housing rehabilitation 
program before he gained the post in october 1986 
demery told the panel that one of his hud predecessors silvio 
debartolomeis had been reluctant to sign funding requests for the 
socalled moderate rehabilitation program in 1986 once demery 
said debartolomeis left town rather than sign a funding request 
demery said a hud inspector generals report two weeks ago with 
his name on the cover was motivated by malice negligence and a 
coverup or a combination of the three by the inspector 
generals office 
he questioned why deborah gore dean former executive assistant 
to pierce was mentioned only briefly in the 700page report even 
though he considered her one of the programs major participants 
demerys statements that he has been singled out will be 
assessed by the committee which has asked pierce to appear said 
panel member christopher shays rconn 
demery is saying his direct predecessor had problems with the 
program and just left town and had someone else sign we need to 
check that out and it happened on pierces watch shays said 
after the hearing 
the inspector generals report two weeks ago alleged a 
perception of favoritism in the awarding of funds to fix up 
housing for the poor hud secretary jack kemp shut down the program 
temporarily and blocked some 100 million of pending contracts 
part of the problem was poor documentation in the 
decisionmaking process inspector general paul adams told the 
committee another he said was the volume of highlypaid 
consultants many of them former hud or other government officials 
who used clout to win contracts for developers 
your view of the role of the consultant was really not one of 
providing technical expertise but of providing inside information 
privileged information special access to the individuals who made 
the decisions subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif asked 
adams 
yes sir thats correct adams replied 
the committee has asked former interior secretary james watt to 
testify about his work on behalf of a 312unit project in essex md 
watt earned a 300000 fee despite indicating that he had 
little if any knowledge of the program adams said but adams 
said he knew of no instance where laws were broken by consultants 
most projects selected during the past five years were done 
without open competition and appeared to be concentrated in 
florida puerto rico and a few other areas adams testified 
but demery said florida and puerto rico simply had long 
waiting lists and that other areas were also funded on the basis 
of need still demery said he recognized problems with the 
program and sought in may 1988 to ensure the selection system was 
fair and welldocumented 
he said he never stated or implied an ability on the part of 
hud to favor a specific project

officials of the smithsonian institution and 
the museum of the american indian in new york signed an agreement 
monday to transfer the worlds largest collection of american 
indian artifacts to the smithsonian 
as a symbol of the agreement roland force director of the new 
york museum presented robert mcc adams secretary of the 
smithsonian with a peace pipetomahawk 
this single piece does in a very real way symbolize the 
entire collection force said of the pipe which had been given 
to tecumseh the shawnee chief by col henry a proctor of the 
british army in 1812 
the museum agreement capped years of oftenacrimonious 
negotiations among federal state and local politicians officials 
of the smithsonian and the indian museum and american indians 
concerned for the preservation of their heritage 
a memorandum of understanding covering the transfer was signed 
at a ceremony overlooking the site where the smithsonian hopes to 
build the national museum of the american indian the museum 
which would be the smithsonians 14th in washington is to display 
objects from the heye foundation collection of more than a million 
artifacts 
i dont think there ever will have been a museum quite like 
the one we foresee with great confidence going up on the site 
behind me adams said with his back to the plot between the 
national air and space museum and the us capitol the last 
available place on the mall 
the signing came after the smithsonian board of regents voted 
without dissent to approve a plan to build a national indian 
museum in washington and also to move the existing museum of the 
american indian to larger quarters in the old us custom house a 
landmark lower manhattan building owned by the federal government 
part of the collection will be exhibited at the new new york site 
under the agreement the smithsonian also will build additional 
storage space at its museum support center in suitland md for 
the part of the collection moving to washington 
suzan harjo a member of the new york museums board and herself 
an americanindian said she hoped the new museum would foster a 
great healing process in america between indians and other 
americans 
its going to be a long way between now and actual bricks and 
mortar but this is more than a museum it has more than that 
meaning to all of us she said 
legislation is still needed to give the smithsonian the millions 
of dollars necessary for the undertaking the plan also must be 
approved by new york state courts which force said he expected to 
be easily given 
adams estimated that it would take about six years before the 
washington museums doors open the memorandum of understanding did 
not include a cost estimate but earlier this year adams put a 
pricetag of more than 150 million on the entire undertaking 
sen daniel k inouye dhawaii who was a principal architect 
of the agreement said he would introduce legislation this week to 
authorize the startup

the army has responded to budgetary 
constraints by relying more on reserve units which are less capable 
than regular forces said a study released monday 
because so many assets are in the reserve components it is 
not in particularly good shape to execute a worldwide strategic 
concept of multiple contingencies said a report written for the 
brookings institution by analysts martin binkin and william 
kaufmann 
reserve units account for 43 perent of army combat units and 70 
percent of tactical support personnel said the study by the 
liberal think tank 
such a degree of dependence would not be a source of concern 
if the reserve components came close to matching their activeduty 
counterparts in capability and readiness but they do not said 
the 162page report us army guard and reserve rhetoric 
realities and risks 
traditionally reserve units have been forces held in reserve 
with a cushion of time to complete mobilization and traiing it 
said today many of the armys reserve units are expected to 
deploy along with the active forces some with only a few days 
notice and most of the remainder within weeks rather than months or 
years as in the past it said 
reserve units both combat and support would be among the 
first deployed in a range of conflicts from fastbreaking 
limited contingencies to major confrontation in central europe 
said the report 
under current plans 40 percent of army forces to be deployed in 
the first month of a european war would consist of reserve forces 
it said 
reserve and national guard units would make up 50 percent of the 
services force structure under the proposed bush administration 
budget for the 1990 fiscal year maj gen merle freitag director 
of the army budget office told reporters on april 25 
but the army maintains that the reserve component question is 
not directly related to our ability to fight on multiple fronts 
said army spokesman lt col john chapla 
the army has acknowledged that we do not have a force capable 
of doing everything in the world that we might face so the ability 
to fight on multiple fronts is a different issue chapla said 
in an era of fiscal restraint the pentagon budget is expected 
to shrink rather than expand and the army anticipates no reversal 
of its growing dependence of reserve units 
our general position has been that the reserves play a very 
vital role in any future contingency planning said chapla our 
policy has been to equip units on a firsttofight basis in some 
cases that means that reserve units get equipment modernization 
before some active units if the reserves are slated to go into 
battle before the regular units 
of those divisions stationed in the united states slated for 
deployment overseas all of them have some kind of reserve compoent 
roundout said chapla explaining that one brigade or about 
onethird of the maneuver units in those divisions consists of 
reserves 
of the divisions that would be mobilized quickly in the event of 
war he said the following frontline divisions have reserve 
components first cavalry fourth infantry fifth infantry ninth 
infantry and 10th mountain

a fugitive greek tycoon accused in a banking 
scandal that has rattled his socialist government said monday he 
faces death at the hands of terrorist squads or secret police if he 
is forced to return to his homeland 
george koskotas 35 a former chairman of the bank of crete 
filed papers in us district court seeking to be released on bail 
and fighting extradition to greece charging that senior officials 
of the greek government authorized plans to embezzle millions from 
the bank and would kill him to ensure his silence 
the 200 million scandal has embarrassed greek prime minister 
andreas papandreous government prompting the conservative 
opposition to file a censure motion that was narrowly defeated in 
parliament 
as the koskotas affair began to unfold in greece last 
october mr koskotas was given strong reason to believe that he 
would be killed before he could give testimony incriminating the 
greek government and its leaders including in particular prime 
minister papandreou the petition said 
a spokeswoman for the greek consulate in boston declined to 
comment on koskotas charges 
koskotas is being held without bail at a salem jail pending the 
extradition process 
i am the one individual in the united states most 
knowledgeable about the improper political motivations that the 
pasok government of greece has in bringing charges against me and 
in seeking my extradition he said in court papers 
koskotas said he fled greece for brazil last november because 
i was informed that i would be killed either by terrorists or by 
pasok agents desiring my silence 
he left brazil he said for the united states shortly after 
that because he learned greek secret police were dispatched to 
brazil with orders to kill him 
federal prosecutors say the reciprocal nature of international 
extradition treaties demand cooperation despite the political 
ramifications 
assistant us attorney victor wild said monday prosecutors 
received the proceedings and will review them 
we will be opposing his various motions wild said 
a conference was scheduled may 17 before us magistrate joyce 
alexander to discuss the extradition proceedings he said 
papandreou who is up for election in june filed a libel 
lawsuit against time magazine last month over an article involving 
allegations of financial wrongdoing at the bank that quoted 
koskotas saying he had passed millions from the bank of crete to 
papandreou and other government officials 
koskotas was arrested by fbi agents in bedford last november 
when he landed in a private jet with his wife and five children he 
fled greece shortly before he was to face charges of forgery and 
embezzlement 
meanwhile the bank of crete has brought a civil lawsuit against 
koskotas seeking more than 100 million

gonzalo sanchez de lozada of the 
governing party and hugo banzer a former military dictator 
claimed victory monday in a close presidential race and congress 
will choose the winner 
officials said the outcome of sundays presidential and 
congressional elections were an endorsement of the governments 
economic austerity program which both banzer and sanchez de lozada 
supported 
since none of the nine presidential candidates got a majority 
the new congress will convene aug 4 to elect bolivias 77th 
president who will inaugurated two days later for a fouryear term 
the tendencies are clear sanchez de lozada told a news 
conference monday i will be the next president of bolivia and 
my primary goals will be social programs and economic stability 
jaime cespedes a spokesman for banzer claimed victory for his 
party and said we will not accept the victory of sanchez de 
lozada because the only victory acceptable is that of the electoral 
court there is evidence to indicate fraud and the annulment of 
votes favorable to banzer 
foreign observers who visited voting places throughout the 
country reported some problems that appeared to stem from the 
ignorance of rural electoral officials but said they found no 
evidence of widespread fraud 
us ambassador robert gelbard told journalists his office 
monitored the vote in eight cities and found only minor 
irregularities he called it one of the most impressive latin 
american elections in contemporary times 
the electoral college is to present its final tally may 28 
bolivias constitution requires congress to choose the president 
when no candidate gets a majority the 27 seats in the senate and 
130 in the house of deputies will be divided among the parties 
according to the number of votes they received in each electoral 
region 
a projection by the private bolivian television association said 
sanchez de lozadas government party would gain four senate seats 
to 13 and banzers party would lose four leaving it with five 
members 
it said sanchez de lozada would have 38 seats in the new chamber 
of deputies maintaining the current twoseat advantage over the 36 
of banzers party 
eight other parties would share the rest of the seats 
according to the television associations tally of 1059305 
votes an estimated 60 percent of those cast banzer and his 
centerright nationalist democratic action led with 284028 votes 
or 268 percent and sanchez de lozada of the conservative 
revolutionary nationalist movement was a close second with 279385 
or 264 percent 
jaime paz zamora of the movement of the revolutionary left was 
third with 233568 votes or 221 percent it said 
the projection said sanchez de lozada probably would pull ahead 
of banzer by one or two percentage points when the vote came in 
from rural areas where early returns showed him with a solid lead 
that would put sanchez de lozada 58 in a good position to win 
congressional approval 
banzer 62 seized power in 1971 and was forced out in 1978 he 
said before the elections that all candidates should support the 
one who won the most votes 
information minister herman antelo told the associated press on 
monday in the name of president victor paz estenssoro i would 
like to express satisfaction for the form and results of the 
election independently of who is the winner more than two thirds 
of the population has given its endorsement to the governments 
economic policy and the need to continue with it 
the 81yearold incumbent is retiring after a career that 
spanned half a century and included three periods as president 
sanchez de lozada a wealthy mine owner was educated in the 
united states and has a philosophy degree from the university of 
chicago 
voting was calm and orderly in what once was the continents 
most politically volatile country since the turn of the century 
there have been 13 coups with nine governments between 1978 and 
1982 
some irregularities were reported including the arrest of three 
people who carried several different identity cards and apparently 
planned to vote several times there also were reports that some 
voters were given already marked ballots but foreign observers 
said they had no initial indications of widespread fraud 
paz estenssoro said upon casting his ballot that the elections 
would help lead bolivians to political maturity the important 
thing is to consolidate democracy he said 
he launched a severe economic program when he took office in 
1985 to halt economic chaos including an annual inflation rate of 
23000 percent 
banzer sanchez de lozada and paz zamora pledged to maintain the 
program which has cut inflation to 15 percent a year and 
contributed to some small economic growth for the first time in a 
decade 
in addition they all vowed to continue the governments battle 
against cocaine production and trafficking the united states 
provides about 55 million a year for the efforts which include 
programs to reduce coca leaf cultivation in bolivias jungles

contributors have whittled the 11 million 
debt of the oral roberts ministries down to 22 million with the 
rest expected to be raised by wednesday the son of the founder 
said monday 
we havent quite done it but were very close oral 
roberts son and fellow evangelist richard said on his daily 
television show 
oral roberts said march 28 that the 11 million was owed to 
4000 vendors and suppliers of the oral roberts ministry oral 
roberts university and the city of faith medical center he said if 
the money wasnt raised by may 6 graduation day at the university 
creditors could begin to dismantle the university and hospital 
he said later the date was extended until monday because may 6 
was a saturday monday his son said on his tv show that creditors 
were being asked for a threeday extension 
mark swadener the ministrys chief financial officer issued a 
statement saying that while all vendors have not been paid we 
have attempted to make some payment to virtually all of them since 
april 1 
our vendors generally do not view us in a bad light but they 
do want to be paid the statement said 
attempts to reach swadener for further comment were not 
successful ministry workers repeatedly said he could not be 
disturbed other ministry officials referred callers to swadeners 
office 
one vendor the company that provided medical personnel for the 
hospital filed a lawsuit last week seeking 17032 in staffing 
payments for the period from dec 16 through feb 3 
oral roberts has blamed a spirit of skepticism from scandals 
involving tv evangelists jim bakker and jimmy swaggart for a 
decline in monthly contributions from 5 million to 27 million 
over the past two years 
it was two years ago that the elder roberts made his 
controversial announcement that he needed 8 million for his 
medical school or god would end his life 
both roberts and his son have made pleas for money on their 
television shows since march 28 they also staged a fourhour 
primetime telethon 
some costcutting moves have been initiated by the ministry 
roberts announced last week that the 4000student university is 
dropping out of ncaa competition to save 500000 to 1 million a 
year in addition some television commitments also are being 
curtailed

federal drug czar william bennetts suggestion 
that firsttime drug offenders be sent to bootcamp style prisons 
drew mixed reviews monday from correctional experts 
prison experts said submitting offenders to rigorous programs of 
militarystyle discipline and rigorous physical exercise might 
teach selfcontrol and discipline 
but they disputed bennetts assertion that such programs aleady 
being operated in mississippi georgia new york and several other 
states necessarily reduce the number of repeat offenders 
bennetts idea however drew support from one influential 
member of congress 
i support the concept very strongly said rep william 
hughes dnj chairman of the house criminal justice subcomittee 
i dont think there is any question but that weve always 
intended to develop alternatives 
hallem williams head of the district of columbias corrections 
department said city officials have studied the idea and we 
would not be averse to this as an option in the overall scheme of 
things 
on the cbs news show face the nation bennett said sunday he 
was studying a proposal to encourage more states to set up boot 
camp prisons for drug offenders as a cheaper more effective 
alternative to incarceration 
its inexpensive it teaches good lessons and the recividivism 
rate is very very low because it so grueling and so unpleasant 
people dont want to back to it bennett said 
jerry miller who heads the national center for institutions and 
alternatives in alexandria va questioned the research cited by 
bennett 
there is almost no controlled research that shows they work 
said miller who formerly ran youth corrections programs in 
pennsylvania and massachusetts 
while programs in georgia and mississippi programs claim high 
success rates they will put through such lightweight offenders 
they generally tend not to be repeat offenders anyway miller 
said 
his comments were echoed by criminologist james finckenauer of 
rutgers university in newark nj who said there isnt any 
empirical evidence to support that it actually does what people 
think its going to do 
i would suspect if one looked at recidivism rates you are not 
going to find any differences finckenauer said 
in fact the new york state department of correctional services 
says the recidivism rate among inmates who successfully complete 
its bootcamp program is not any lower than among inmates who spend 
two or three years in prison 
but department spokesman james flateau said that to the extent 
you can compress a program into six months and be that successful 
makes it a very successful program 
new york operates three camps that hold a total of 570 inmates 
who are freed from the state prison system if they successfully 
complete the sixmonth program flateau said 
to qualify an inmate must be serving a prison term of less than 
three years for a nonviolent crime he said 
ours is definitely not a boot camp said flateau boot 
camp by definition is a place of rigorous physical activity 
besides physical activity there is an equal emphasis on 
mandatory academic education and mandatory individual counseling 
and group therapy for people with drug problems flateau said 
you must complete all phases of it he said 
the legislature is considering a proposal to build more camps 
and to extend the program to other inmates 
robert gangi director of the correctional association of new 
york gave the program high marks 
the concept is good but the key thing is to have the staff 
dedication to make sure it works so that it doesnt become another 
gimmick 
the key thing is that everybody in the progam from the top 
staff on down is committed to rehabilitating the inmates he 
said that is not true of every other prison i have been into 
most prisons see themselves as more or less warehousing people 
until the time they are to be released

new details about the navys 1965 loss of a 
hydrogen bomb in the pacific show that the errant weapon was much 
closer to a heavily populated japanese island than the military has 
acknowledged a research analyst said monday 
the analyst william arkin said the evidence showed that us 
ships ignored japans ban on nuclear weapons during the vietnam war 
era and he said he will publish evidence that the navy continues 
to carry nuclear weapons on ships in allied ports the navy 
declined comment 
arkin and an associate joshua handler of greenpeace said their 
research had established that many other nuclear devices have been 
lost in the sea 48 nuclear warheads and 11 reactors the 
majority of them soviet 
he said there was little danger of detonation from the 
onemegaton bomb which has a force of 1 million tons of tnt 
although he said the materials do threaten the environment as they 
deteriorate over time 
the navy acknowledged the 1965 accident more than 15 years after 
it occurred but revealed few details such as which ship was 
involved where it was destined and where it was bound it did 
concede in 1986 that the incident was classified as among its two 
most serious nuclear accidents 
the new evidence shows the accident occurred aboard an aircraft 
carrier that was steaming past okinawa and bound for the japanese 
port of yokosuka after war duty off the vietnam coast 
in 1981 the navy revealed that the mishap occurred on dec 5 
1965 involved an a4 attack jet loaded with one nuclear bomb and 
took place more than 500 miles from land at sea in the 
pacific 
the navy said the jet rolled off the elevator of a us 
aircraft carrier and fell into the sea and that the pilot plane 
and bomb were all lost 
 
arkin said recently declassified documents reveal the incident 
occurred aboard the uss ticonderoga bound for japan after a 
deployment off vietnam and that the bomb was a one megaton b43 
hydrogen device it was lost in international waters about 80 miles 
from the closest point of the okinawa island chain and only about 
200 miles east of the heavily populated island of okinawa arkin 
said 
 
this accident occurred 500 miles from land alright but the 
navy forgot that japan was between the ship and china said 
arkin an expert on nuclear matters with the institute for policy 
studies a liberal think tank 
a newly declassified memo described the strategic mission of the 
ticonderoga at the time of the accident as including the 
capability to launch a nuclear strike when and where directed by 
the president the a4 was the navys main deepstrike aircraft 
at the time and an undisclosed number on each us carrier would 
always be equipped with the b43 hydrogen bomb arkin said 
japan bans nuclear weapons it says us ships or planes cannot 
bring nuclear arms into japan without prior consultations with the 
government and there have been no such consultations the united 
states refuses to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons 
in specific locations 
arkin who is about to publish a study on serious naval 
accidents around the world along with the environmental group 
greenpeace said the mishap demonstrates that nuclear weapons 
were carried on aircraft carriers during the vietnam war something 
that no us administration has ever admitted 
he said he assumed that us ships still carry nuclear weapons 
in japanese waters although he provided no details he told a news 
conference that he would issue a report next year providing 
evidence that us ships regularly carry nuclear weapons into 
allied ports including those in japan 
the navy declined comment on arkins findings beyond repeating 
its standard policy of never confirming nor denying the presence of 
nuclear weapons on its ships 
japan the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons 
remains very sensitive about nuclear arms questions the report was 
prominently featured in japanese newspapers and on television 
leaders of antiwar and antinuclear groups and opponents of the 
us military presence on okinawa immediately issued denunciations 
at the time of the accident okinawa was under us control it 
was returned to japan in 1972 27 years after japans defeat in 
world war ii 
besides its 1981 admission of the accident the navy hasnt 
commented on the mishap beyond a january 1986 report describing it 
as one of only two socalled broken arrow accidents ever 
experienced broken arrow is the code name for the most serious 
nuclear accident the other broken arrow was the 1968 loss of the 
submarine scorpion in the atlantic 
the navy kept the true details of this accident a secret not 
only because it demonstrates their disregard for the treaty 
stipulations of foreign governments but because of the questions 
it raises about nuclear weapons aboard ships in vietnam arkin 
said 
arkin asserted that the united states sidesteps the japanese ban 
by arguing that a temporary transit or port call by a ship does not 
amount to the introduction of nuclear weapons and thus 
consultations are unnecessary 
the researcher said there was probably little danger of the lost 
bomb exploding 
but we do think there is a threat to the environment he 
added over time the pressure water circulation and corrosion 
are likely to lead to the release of radioactivity 
the estimate of the number of other lost nuclear devices is 
contained in arkins study neptune papers 3 describing naval 
accidents from the end of world war ii through last year arkin 
said that 48 nuclear warheads and 11 reactors most of them soviet 
were sitting on the bottom of the ocean the figure includes 
two reactors aboard the soviet mike class submarine that sank last 
month in the norwegian sea

harry and bess trumans white victorian 
house still stands dish cloths still in the kitchen sink his 
beige trenchcoat and tan hat still hanging by the back door 
and the 33rd presidents sisterinlaw remembers them and still 
plays bridge as she did with mrs truman 
may wallace 94 moved to the house behind the truman home with 
her husband george wallace in 1916 she remembers her trips to 
washington time spent with trumans daughter margaret and the 
presidents honest nature 
mrs wallace recalled life with the trumans in a recent 
interview before the annual observance marking trumans birth on 
may 8 1884 
mrs wallace said mrs truman her husbands sister was a 
cordial good sweet woman 
if somebody came along and tried to kid her she wasnt in for 
something like that mrs wallace said she might wish you 
werent there but you wouldnt know it 
after the trumans lived at the white house nearly a year mrs 
truman invited 10 members of the tuesday bridge club from 
independence to washington at the time life magazine reported 
that the clubs real business was to exchange menus gossip talk 
about children fashions and husbands 
mrs wallace isnt sure if she is the last remaining member of 
the original bridge club started by the presidents wife when she 
was a teenager 
a white house employee once said mrs truman would make more of 
a fuss over her bridge club than she would over the social queens 
of washington 
when the presidents daughter margaret was a child she would 
often come to the wallace house for predinner dessert aunt may 
beufie and uncle george da would give her ice cream and by 
dinnertime young margarets appetite was gone 
when margaret was older the wallaces took her to movies the 
trumans didnt like to go out at night so margaret used to sneak 
out of the house she said 
the extended family converged on the truman house at christmas 
one of my fondest memories of the big house is the way the 
big living room looked on christmas morning mrs wallace said in 
a handwritten statement for the national park service which cares 
for the truman house margaret always insisted that the christmas 
tree be tall enough to reach the ceiling a 9foot one at that 
the tree trimming took place on christmas eve when all 
gathered to help actually my husband george and margaret did 
the real trimming with much comment from the sidelines 
truman was thrust into the public spotlight in 1944 when he was 
elected vice president just five months later president franklin 
roosevelt died and truman became president 
mrs wallace said it was a difficult time for the trumans who 
resisted attempts by the press and curiosityseekers to invade 
their privacy 
it was hard to live you had to be so careful about what you 
say all the time she said

safety tests on a candidate aids vaccine will 
begin soon in england an american researcher announced monday 
allan goldstein an aids researcher at the george washington 
university school of medicine said 24 volunteers are being sought 
in london to test the safety of a vaccine known as hgp30 
the volunteers he said must be free of any aids infection a 
second 24 to be used as a control group also will be selected 
goldstein said the purpose of the yearlong trial is to 
determine if the candidate vaccine is safe to use on humans 
earlier tests on laboratory animals did not reveal any problems of 
toxicity or other adverse effects he said 
control trials in the united states have not started goldstein 
said because the drug has not been approved by the food and drug 
administration for human experimentation 
hgp30 is a synthetic copy of a protein that is part of the 
internal structure of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv which 
causes aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
in laboratory tests goldstein said hgp30 has been shown to 
stimulate the production of antibodies which attack and kill both 
the aids virus and cells in the body that are infected with the 
aids virus 
two other vaccines developed by other researchers are also in 
early safety trials according to an fda spokesman 
the main advantage to the hgp30 vaccine said goldstein is 
that the protein copy is based on a region of the hiv called p17 
that does not change the other vaccines are been based on proteins 
in the envelope of the virus a region that tends to change in a 
process called genetic drift because of this change vaccines 
based on stimulating antibodies against the viral envelope may not

developing the hgp30 vaccine is still at a very early stage 
goldstein said it will be at least a year before the start of any 
clinical trials testing how well the vaccine actually prevents 
aids those trials he said could last for years

any aids vaccine is ready for general use and it could be much 
longer

the mcdonnell douglas corp easily retained 
its position as the pentagons top research contractor last year 
winning awards totaling almost 29 billion the defense department 
said monday 
the martin marietta corp ranked second for the second year in a 
row with contracts totaling 203 billion the pentagon added 
among educational and nonprofit entities the massachusetts 
institute of technology continued to hold down the top ranking 
winning research contracts during the year worth 4037 million 
the aerospace corp of el segundo calif was close behind with 
contracts worth 367 million followed by the johns hopkins 
university with 3539 million 
overall the pentagon increased its spending on research by just 
over 3 percent in fiscal 1988 with awards worth a total of 225 
billion by contrast the department spent 218 billion on 
research in fiscal 1987 
a great deal of last years spending appeared to be related to 
work on the star wars antimissile defense system the amount 
of money invested in research on missile and space systems 
totaled 78 billion in fiscal 1988 or 346 percent of the total 
the pentagon said 
those numbers were little changed from fiscal 1987 when missile 
and space systems research consumed 79 billion 
the secondranked program category was research on aircraft it 
consumed 224 percent of the total or about 51 billion 
the latest figures are contained in a statistical report 
prepared annually by the pentagon to rank the top 500 companies or 
nonprofit groups performing research development test and 
evaluation work the rankings are based on a review of all 
contracts totaling 25000 or more awarded during the fiscal year 
that ended last sept 30 
mcdonnell douglas which earlier this year also claimed the 
overall ranking as the nations largest defense contractor had 
climbed into the top spot for research work in fiscal 1987 when it 
displaced the lockheed corp 
it widened its lead in fiscal 1988 with two of its units 
ranking in the top 10 on their own mcdonnell douglas aircraft held 
down first place with 216 billion while the parent mcdonnell 
douglas corp received other contracts worth 664 million and 
ranked in 8th place 
other mcdonnell douglas subsidiaries received 57 million in 
research contracts giving the entire corporation its total of 
288 billion 
after mcdonnell douglas aircraft and martin marietta the 
remainder of the top 10 included the boeing co in 3rd place with 
awards totaling 8787 million grumman aerospace corp 8434 
million raytheon co 8409 million rockwell international 
corp 7377 million general electric co 7102 million 
mcdonnell douglas corp 664 million trw inc 6587 million 
and lockheed missiles amp space co 6112 million 
while lockheed missiles amp space co ranked 10th other lockheed 
units received awards worth 1345 million giving that entire 
corporation a grand total of 7457 million in fiscal 1988 
the 4037 million in research contracts won by mit was enough 
to give it the 15th ranking overall in fiscal 1987 mit had won 
contracts worth 4076 million and was ranked 11th overall 
all told the top 500 concerns accounted for 97 percent of the 
total research contracts awarded or 219 billion the top 500 
included 377 business firms 103 educational and nonprofit 
organizations three us government agencies and 17 foreign 
contractors 
that breakdown was little changed from fiscal 1987 
the research awards to foreign concerns totaled 129 million a 
small increase compared to the 1143 million reported in fiscal 
1987 the leading foreign contractor was west germanys 
messerschmittboelkow blohm with awards totaling 272 million

passengers on a 1983 eastern airlines flight 
forced to make an emergency landing after all three of the jets 
engines failed have a right to sue for emotional injury a federal 
appeals court ruled 
a lower court judge had ruled that florida and federal laws did 
not provide an avenue for the 25 plaintiffs to make a case but the 
11th us circuit court of appeals said the warsaw convention an 
international treaty drafted in 1929 that governs airline 
liability provides for such cases 
the 11th circuit however said the passengers may not seek 
punitive damages 
the case involves eastern flight 855 which left miami for 
nassau bahamas on may 5 1983 during the flight one of the 
planes engines lost oil pressure the crew shut it down and headed 
back to miami 
during its return the jets other two engines failed and the 
plane began to lose altitude the crew told the passengers they 
would have to ditch the plane in the atlantic ocean the court said 
the crew managed to restart one of the engines and the plane 
landed safely at miami international airport court records show 
twentyfive of the passengers sued contending they suffered 
mental distress from the incident two of the passengers also 
claimed physical injury 
the warsaw convention sets terms under which passengers can seek 
damages for problems related to air travel it was accepted by the 
united states in 1934 the original liability limit of 8300 has 
been amended several times to the current 75000 per person 
in its decision made friday but not released until monday the 
11th circuit said the warsaw convention takes precedence over local 
laws 
there has been considerable legal debate over whether the 
language of the original document drafted in french provided 
compensation for mental and emotional injury the court said 
the 11th circuit concluded it did saying it talked about 
personal injury rather than bodily injury

the united states which agreed to spanish 
demands to remove 72 f16 fighter bombers from spain by 1992 will 
pay severance to about 700 spanish employees who worked at the 
fleets air base 
lt gen es leland jr chief of staff of the us european 
command said monday that under an agreement the state department 
negotiated with spain the united states will pay severance that 
at the very most could total 12 million 
in light of spains pressure on the united states to remove the 
jets and 3600 us troops and 600 civilians attached to the unit 
sen alan dixon dill chairman of the senate armed services 
subcommittee on readiness sustainability and support said he 
wouldnt blame americans for feeling like fools in the deal 
leland said that at the time the us officials who negotiated 
the agreement thought it was to the americans advantage he also 
reminded dixon that there was a good chance the severance cost 
would be less because the spanish government will try to find other 
jobs for the workers 
in january 1988 the united states accepted spains demands that 
the us air force withdraw its 401st tactical wing from the joint 
usspanish air base at torrejon de ardoz just east of madrid 
italy has agreed to provide a new home base for the jets troops 
and civilians at crotone 
the cost of moving the 401st from spain to italy is estimated at 
830 million with the north atlantic treaty organization paying a 
large share of the cost said cmdr mel sundin a pentagon 
spokesman the united states is expected to pay about 28 percent of 
the cost 
dixon questioned whether the united states could have saved 
money by returning the jets and troops home it looks to me like 
a missed opportunity the illinois senator said 
but leland said nato favored keeping the tactical wing in europe

britain urged monday that a world 
conference be convened to chart ways to combat global warming and 
said the security council should monitor environmental trends that 
could threaten world peace 
the proposal would expand the councils peacekeeping 
responsibilities dramatically 
sir crispin tickell britains un ambassador announced 
londons new approach in a speech before the un economic and 
social council 
the atmosphere knows no boundaries and the winds carry no 
passports he said 
just as member states of the united nations came together to 
take action on damage to the ozone layer so we now need to come 
together to see how to cope with the wider problem of likely global 
warming 
scientists believe global warming is caused by an increase in 
the greenhouse effect when gases in the earths atmosphere 
trap radiant heat near the planets surface in addition to natural 
buildup scientists say the gases have increased greatly because of 
burning coal oil and gas and destruction of tropical rain 
forests 
the ambassador said global warming and climate change could 
undermine world peace as fertile nations are beset by droughts 
coastal cities are inundated by rising oceans and storms 
hurricanes and floods strike with greater frequency and intensity 
tickell said the international conference should proceed 
cautiously avoiding utopian pronouncements or demands for 
immediate and obligatory changes in energy use patterns 
in working out guidelines we would try to look at measures to 
dissuade governments from taking actions that have a bad effect on 
somebody else such as manipulating rainfall river flows or 
ocean currents said tickell 
we can look into the ways that energy could be better 
conserved again you could look at guidelines which would try to 
dissuade people from using certain sorts of fuel for example coal 
and oil produce far more carbon dioxide than natural gas and that 
produces a bit more than nuclear energy he said 
so there are a whole variety of subjects in which the world is 
not ready for a formal treaty but you can perhaps work out and 
point in certain directions in these guidelines which would help 
nations to understand the nature of the problem and what is to be 
done about it 
he said the framework for an international convention already 
exists in the intergovernmental panel on climate change a yearold 
body with three study committees chaired by the united states 
soviet union and britain 
the security council could monitor progress toward dealing with 
the effects of global warming under article 34 of the un charter 
said tickell 
the article allows the council to look into any dispute or any 
situation which might lead to international friction or give rise 
to a dispute 
in the past wars have been about productive land they have 
been about the supply of fresh water and they have been about the 
movements of people now all of those could be very directly and 
disagreeably affected by climactic change tickell said 
tickell is a key adviser on environmental affairs to prime 
minister margaret thatcher and is author of a book on the effects 
of climactic change on international relations

the white house indicated monday that a 
superpower summit is not a high priority for secretary of state 
james a bakers talks in moscow and said there is no guarantee his 
trip will produce a date for resuming arms talks 
baker left washington monday and will arrive in moscow on 
wednesday after a stop in helsinki he will see soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze wednesday and again thursday morning 
and meet with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev for two hours 
thursday afternoon 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater suggested baker 
would not even mention a summit without prompting from the soviets 
fitzwater said baker is willing to discuss a summit should 
that be raised by the soviets and should he feel that it is 
warranted by the circumstances at hand 
the white house spokesman said baker goes there with an open 
mind but its a first meeting a chance to explore any number of 
issues and we just couldnt predict whether that would be an 
outcome or not 
baker who arrived in finland on monday evening for a rest stop 
before heading for moscow told reporters he intends to make clear 
that the bush administration is seeking an active constructive 
positive and expanding relationship 
we want to test the soviet new thinking across the full 
range of our relations baker said if we find that the soviet 
union is serious about new global behavior then we will seek 
diplomatic engagement in an effort to reach mutually beneficial 
results 
we recognized that there is real change taking place in the 
soviet union he said we think this provides the united states 
and the west with an opportunity 
baker is expected to propose that us and soviet negotiators 
resume talks the third week of june on a treaty to reduce 
longrange bombers missiles and submarines by 30 to 50 percent 
the negotiations were suspended last november and were 
tentatively set to resume in february but the talks were put on 
hold when bush announced a review of policies toward the soviet 
union and other issues 
asked if he expects baker to reach agreement in moscow on a date 
for resuming talks fitzwater said he would not predict anything 
that specific 
he said a review of the us position on longrange nuclear arms 
is not due for completion until probably june july midsummer 
is the latest ive heard 
in recent weeks the bush administration has come under 
increasing criticism for moving too slowly and cautiously toward 
steps by gorbachev to lower tensions such as reductions in troops 
and defense spending the administration has questioned whether 
those steps have done much to offset warsaw pact military 
advantages in europe 
reporting on the results of the foreign policy reviews 
president bush will outline his position on the soviet union and 
eastwest relations in a speech friday at texas aampm university 
on may 21 bush will deliver a speech at boston university on 
nato and how the west should deal with the continuing threat from 
the soviet union fitzwater said 
the spokesman said bushs speech friday would talk in terms of 
taking advantage of the changes that have been made under general 
secretary gorbachev would address the presidents view of the 
impact of glasnost openness and perestroika economic reforms 
and talk about how the western nations should define its 
relationships with the soviet union in that changing political 
climate 
fitzwater acknowledged that the west will have to redefine its 
relationship with moscow 
the united states indeed all of the western countries have 
had a certain attitude and a set of policies since world war ii and 
even before based upon the soviet threat he said 
there are a number of activities underway in the soviet union 
which are changing the nature of our relationship with them 
under gorbachev the west is discussing issues such as regional 
conflicts arms control and human rights with a degree of 
openness that has not been possible in the past fitzwater said 
he said it seems clear that we are at a point that suggests a 
definition of a different relationship between the east and west 
from an economic military and trade standpoint 
on a related subject fitzwater said the presence of shortrange 
nuclear weapons in europe is part of the equation that goes with 
having our troops in europe 
there is no intention of changing that policy at this time 
fitzwater said west germany has called for negotiations with the 
soviet union to curb shortrange nuclear weapons but the united 
states has rejected the idea 
meanwhile jacques chirac the mayor of paris and former french 
prime minister met with bush and said later that bushs opposition 
to eastwest talks on eliminating the shortrange weapons was 
widely supported by most european leaders

borden inc pulled milk from stores in two 
southern states monday after learning that milk from some northwest 
louisiana and east texas dairies might contain traces of a compound 
used in rat poison 
borden the worlds largest dairy company pulled milk off store 
shelves throughout mississippi and in north louisiana 
gwen stewart of the louisiana department of health and hospitals 
said officials believe they kept all milk contaminated with 
dangerous amounts of barium carbonate from reaching store shelves 
the bottom line is there is not and has not been any 
contaminated milk on the market stewart said 
some milk with trace levels of barium was allowed on the market 
but it was considered an acceptable level she said health 
officials in mississippi agreed 
the amount you can drink is far less than the amount that 
would be dangerous said dr ed thompson of the mississippi 
department of health theres just not a significant health risk 
involved 
a person would have to drink about seven 8ounce glasses of the 
milk in succession for it to have any ill effect and more than 100 
8ounce glasses for it to be fatal thompson said 
there were no reports of anyone suffering any ill effects from 
drinking any of bordens milk officials said 
bordens spokeswoman chris tilton said they learned of the 
barium contamination on sunday and decided to voluntarily pull its 
milk as a precautionary measure even though tests indicated the 
amounts of barium present was below the acceptable level 
the problem first came to light when cattle died at an east 
texas dairy farm on april 22 and a louisiana dairy farm on april 
24 stewart said 
the milk was ordered held at the dairies and was not sent to 
companies for processing and therefore did not reach the general 
public officials said 
frozen milk samples taken after the withhold orders were given 
revealed the presence of barium from 2 parts per million to 5 
parts per million stewart said 
a check with a purina feed mill in shreveport revealed that feed 
used by the farmers had been carried in a rail car used to 
transport barium carbonate 
stewart said tests were done later at dairies and at plants that 
received milk from those dairies traces of barium less than half 
the maximum amount listed in government water standards were 
found in some samples stewart said 
barium carbonate is a white powder used in rat poison and a 
variety of processes including manufacture of some kinds of glass 
and ceramics according to the mississippi emergency management 
agency it is toxic if swallowed 
there are no standards set for barium in milk stewart said 
however she and tilton said government standards for water limit 
barium to 1 part per million 
after checking records purina told the state that contaminated 
feed had been sold to other farmers in the northwest louisiana and 
east texas area 
tilton speaking by telephone from bordens columbus ohio 
offices said the company did not know whether any of the milk ice 
cream and other products it distributed to stores was contaminated 
we made the assumption that this was in our milk supply she 
said 
purina picked up the unconsumed feed that went to louisiana and 
texas farmers and tests were being conducted to make sure milk from 
those areas was uncontaminated stewart said

former gov edwin edwards whose third 
term was marked by his trial and acquittal of federal racketeering 
charges said monday that he will seek a fourth term as the states 
chief executive in 1991 
i can tell you that buddy roemer will not be the next 
governor so i decided to make the run edwards said of the 
incumbent at an impromptu news conference at the capitol 
asked why he was visiting the capitol just over a week after 
roemers tax revision package was rejected by voters edwards 
replied im going to tell the people i told you so 
this governor just wants to increase taxes he said 
roemer was not available immediately for comment said his press 
officer sidney coffee 
roemers tax package was aimed at reducing a 700 million 
deficit projected for the new fiscal year beginning july 1 
edwards a democrat said he will again push for a lottery and 
casino gambling as he did in 1987 when he trailed roemer in the 
gubernatorial primary and bowed out of a runoff roemer had 
campaigned calling for budget reductions no new taxes and no 
lottery 
pressure is mounting in the legislature for a lottery but the 
governor continues to oppose it 
a lottery and casino gambling are the only answers in these 
economic times edwards said there are some longrange things 
that can be done but the state needs something sooner and not 
taxes on the backs of the people 
edwards elected in 1971 and 1975 was constitutionally barred 
from seeking reelection in 1979 in 1983 he defeated dave treen 
louisianas first republican governor since reconstruction 
edwards said he would open a campaign office in about a year 
right now im handling volumes of telephone calls and mail 
strictly political things people wanting favors advice and 
counseling im doing that out of my own pocket he said

the khmer rouge on monday 
rejected a ceasefire proposal saying cambodias 
vietnameseinstalled government must first be dismantled 
we cannot accept a ceasefire that keeps in place a puppet 
government said khmer rouge leader khieu samphan once there 
is is an international commission to supervise the vietnamese 
pullout there will be a ceasefire not before 
vietnamese troops invaded cambodia in december 1978 ousted the 
radical khmer rouge that had ruled for more than three years and 
set up another communist government 
vietnam has said it will withdraw its estimated 50000 to 70000 
military personnel from cambodia by sept 30 
prince norodom sihanouk head of a threeparty resistance 
coalition that includes the khmer rouge held talks last week in 
indonesia with cambodian premier hun sen on the formation of a 
provisional government 
khieu samphan and sihanouk spoke with reporters after a 
diplomatic ceremony at a guerrilla base here in cambodias siam 
reap province about a half mile from the border with thailand 
at the ceremony ambasadors from china north korea and senegal 
presented their credentials to sihanouk as president of the 
coalition government 
during the indonesian conference thai prime minister chatichai 
choonhavan proposed that sihanouk and hun sen agree to a ceasefire 
before the vietnamese withdrawal is completed 
sihanouk and hun sen agreed but khieu samphan said monday a 
ceasefire could come only with the simultaneous dismantling of the 
hun sen government he said a provisional government should be 
formed outside the framework of the two regimes the guerrilla 
coalition and hun sen government 
sihanouk had no immediate comment on khieu samphans rejection 
hun sen opposes khmer rouge participation in any new government 
the vietnamese communists and khmer rouge came to power in the 
spring of 1975 defeating usbacked governments in south vietnam 
and cambodia 
it is estimated that under khmer rouge rule more than 1 million 
people in cambodias population of 8 million were executed in 
purges or died of starvation 
sihanouk leads the resistance coalition but the khmer rouge 
with as many as 40000 combatants is far stronger than the other 
two members sihanouks supporters and the noncommunist khmer 
peoples national liberation front 
sihanouk who has condemned the khmer rouge atrocities said 
that in indonesia hun sen suggested they join forces to defeat the 
khmer rouge 
sihanouk on monday did not rule out that possibility and said he 
would decide by november 
but he also said as long as vietnamese troops remain in cambodia 
he would insist that hun sen allow the khmer rouge a place in a 
fourparty provisional government 
he said he was insisting on a fourparty government not as an 
accomplice of the khmer rouge but because i have to be realistic 
to make them the khmer rouge bandits and rebels would be the 
worst solution for a postvietnamese cambodia sihanouk said 
what i fear most is a civil war

moscow will keep supplying 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government with weapons as long as 
the united states sends arms to other central american nations two 
soviet diplomats here said monday 
nicaragua would be at a disadvantage if all the region 
continues getting weapons and nicaragua doesnt you must remember 
that honduras is practically a north american base in central 
america said yury sajnin political counselor at the soviet 
embassy in the costa rican capital of san jose 
with nicaragua we have diplomatic relations and agreements 
and these include supplying weapons even though armament shipments 
have been reduced said vadim rozanov the soviet ambassador to 
costa rica 
they spoke at a news conference in the soviet embassy called to 
commemorate the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic 
relations between the soviet union and costa rica 
rozanov said moscow believes the conflicts in central america 
should be solved by the central americans themselves without 
outside interference 
he said the soviet government supports a peace effort undertaken 
in 1987 by the presidents of costa rica el salvador honduras 
nicaragua and guatemala 
the soviet union is willing to respect the agreements reached 
or to be reached by the central american governments and to 
contribute to a peaceful solution to the conflicts in the area 
rozanov added 
the peace initiative begun by president oscar arias of costa 
rica seeks a negotiated end to the civil war between the 
sandinista government and ussupported rebels known as contras 
who are based in honduras it also seeks negotiations to end 
rebellions in el salvador and guatemala and calls for 
democratization in central america 
the five regional presidents have met periodically to advance 
the plan to date the sandinistas and contras have achieved a 
tenuous ceasefire while nicaraguan president daniel ortega has 
called for national elections in february 1990 
rozanov rejected a recent accusation by salvadoran 
presidentelect alfredo cristiani that the soviet union supplies 
aid to that countrys leftist insurgency no one has proof of 
that it is a deception of public opinion he said

news coverage by television networks has been 
deteriorating while ted turners cable news network is improving 
a former cbs news president said 
ed joyce who headed cbs news from 1983 to 1986 critiqued 
current news coverage in the may 13 tv guide magazine 
the three broadcast networks changed owners in the past four 
years and the big losers in those transactions have been 
television viewers who have depended on network programs as their 
primary source of news joyce contends 
the networks ability to provide adequate news coverage has 
been sacrificed to protect bloated stock values he wrote 
in less than 18 months cbs dismissed onethird of its news 
staff and closed bureaus in warsaw and bangkok to cut costs joyce 
said nbc and abc made similar reductions 
but turner tightened cnns budget in other ways and in december 
announced the addition of seven new foreign bureaus bringing cnns 
total to 18 joyce wrote 
for decades the broadcast networks have made decisions on what 
is major news based on where their foreign bureaus are located 
joyce said 
labor unrest say a miners strike in england where each 
network has a large bureau is news a similar story in santiago 
chile where they dont have bureaus is not 
the broadcast networks cutbacks are predictable he said 
because they are no longer being run by entrepreneurs but by people 
who view them as investments as such network decisions are based 
on the minimum risk factor whereas turners strategy is surrounded 
by the aura of risk 
if ted turner can maintain an expanding global news service 
he deserves applause and a measure of gratitude he said 
for the networks the failure to preserve their news franchise 
is a colossal blunder they are creating a situation in which they 
will become increasingly irrelevant

armando villanueva resigned as prime minister 
on monday and was replaced by vice president luis alberto sanchez 
as criticism of government antiinsurgency policies increased 
sanchez who is 88 and nearly blind is also a senator and is 
one of perus most respected political figures despite his age 
sanchez frequently travels abroad on state business participates 
regularly in congress and plays a leading role in the internal 
affairs of the centerleft aprista party 
the government said president alan garcias entire 15minister 
cabinet also submitted resignations as is customary when a prime 
minister quits 
a peruvian prime minister is not as powerful as in a 
parliamentary system such as britain or canada where the position 
is the highest government post in the nation 
sanchez will keep both his senate seat and his vice presidential 
post which is largely ceremonial 
garcia is expected to replace some cabinet members to more 
effectively combat perus economic and insurgency woes 
villanueva who also quit his interior ministers post said a 
recent increase in terrorism including the assassination of two 
congressmen in 10 days prompted the resignation 
peru has fought a leftist insurgency by the maoinspired shining 
path guerrilla group for nine years more than 14000 people have 
been killed including about 1000 so far this year 
sanchez is the fourth prime minister of the garcia government 
which holds power until july 1990 critics said cabinet changes 
have not had much impact because garcia is the dominant personality 
garcia on monday called sanchez a national institution who has 
the prestige and knowledge to unite us in two fundamental 
areas the fight against subversion and to reactive the economy 
garcia a populist took office in july 1985 for a fiveyear 
term after two years of prosperity the economy has entered a deep 
recession analysts said the economic and insurgency problems 
undermine perus democracy 
shining path guerrillas killed seven people in attacks that also 
left two rebels dead police at huancayo 140 miles east of lima 
said monday 
also monday more than 200 soldiers swept through the staterun 
university of huancayo seeking leftist guerrillas and hoping to

a judge on monday fined three newspapers 83500 
each for contempt of court for publishing material from a former 
intelligence agents memoirs in violation of a court injunction 
high court judge sir andrew morritt ruled that the newspapers 
published excerpts from spycatcher by retired secret service 
man peter wright knowing that publication could prejudice the 
court case against the book 
the government fought a 2year court battle to suppress 
spycatcher arguing that wright was bound to a lifetime vow of 
secrecy it lost the case and the book is now legally available in 
britain but the state pursued prosecution of the independent the 
sunday times and the nowdefunct news on sunday 
sunday times editor andrew neil vowed to fight the ruling all 
the way to the european court in strasbourg france 
it seems that now to get a proper value put on freedom of the 
press you have to go outside this country he said there was 
not one word in this judgment today about the freedom of the press 
or about the importance of a newspaper publishing things that 
powerful people dont want published 
independent editor andreas whittam smith said the ruling meant 
that injunctions can now be manipulated as a sort of blanket gag 
on the press 
the editors said they were worried because the ruling meant an 
injunction obtained against one newspaper automatically applied to 
other newspapers even if they had not had time to argue the case 
for publication before a judge 
its another nail in the coffin of those of us who think we 
ought to be able to publish what we want in the public interest 
said neil 
the judge said whittam smith clearly knew that printing part of 
the unpublished text of spycatcher in april 1987 would 
inevitably interfere in the proper administration of justice 
the sunday times which had bought the serialization rights 
also published in the knowledge it would damage or destroy the 
secrecy of wrights material morritt ruled 
he said brian whittaker former editor of the news on sunday 
published with the intention of doing exactly what the courts had 
said should not be done 
on the day after the house of lords sitting as britains 
highest court barred publication the papers banner headline 
said we defy the house of lords a law made to be broken 
neil told bbctv the public would be baffled why the case was 
still going on when the book was freely available 
you can buy it two blocks down the road from here he said 
publication of it hasnt brought the roof down in this country 
yet here we are in still in the courts still battling over 
it

more than 30000 slovenians marched 
through downtown ljubljana on monday night protesting the trial by 
a military court that sentenced three journalists and a soldier to 
prison 
the four were convicted in july of making public a classified 
military document and were given sentences ranging from 10 months 
to four years 
the defendants contended the document outlined illegal military 
actions planned against political activists in slovenia considered 
to be the most liberal of yugoslavias six republics 
protest organizers accused slovenian officials of bowing to army 
actions 
participants in the peaceful twohour march carried banners 
saying freedom for the four means freedom for all of us and 
against militarism for human rights 
the rally was called by newly formed opposition and human rights 
groups 
speakers at the rally denounced military leaders and communist 
party conservatives saying they used the four defendants as 
scapegoats in a political attack on slovenian liberals 
we demand a revision of the judicial process and we want 
this farce to be declared null and void said joze skolc head of 
the official youth forum 
france tomsic leader of the new slovenian social democratic 
party said an end must come to meddling in civilian affairs by 
yugoslavias sovietstyle stalinist army 
earlier monday students at ljubljana university voted to begin 
on thursday a boycott of classes to protest the military trial 
one of the defendants janez jansa was taken to the dob 
penitentiary friday after he failed to win a reversal of his 
18month sentence 
jansa and franci zavrl editors of the mladina youth weekly 
were sentenced to 18 months and david tasic a mladina reporter 
was given a 10month sentence sgt maj ivan borstner who is to 
report to the dob prison on may 16 was sentenced to four years 
zavrl and tasic are still appealing their sentences 
a special commission set up by slovenias parliament to study 
the document obtained by the defendants said some of the military 
outlines it contained were illegal and unconstitutional but it 
said because the document is still classified it could not specify 
what plans were contrary to yugoslav law 
in another development slobodan milosevic was elected president 
of serbia by a unanimous vote in parliament milosevic who had 
been the republics communist party chief was unopposed 
under yugoslavias system of annual rotation of key political 
officers milosevic had to resign his party post to become president 
as party leader milosevic led the campaign to gain more control 
over serbias provinces of vojvodina and kosovo which have ethnic 
albanian majorities 
at least 24 people were killed in battles between ethnic 
albanians and police in march after serbias parliament approved 
constitutional amendments giving serbia more control over police 
forces and education in kosovo

than 120000 of panamas 118 million voters were registered for 
sundays presidential election 
but the raid was not thorough scores of sheets were left on the 
floor of the gym some were still in the polling stations large 
yellow envelopes 
all sheets examined by an associated press reporter showed a 
clear lead often by more than 31 for opposition candidate 
guillermo endara over gen manuel antonio noriegas handpicked 
candidate carlos duque 
it was a brazen show of force in an election that the opposition 
claimed already had been rigged by noriega commander of the 
panamanian defense forces commander and the countrys de facto 
ruler 
you should not be surprised about this said a man sitting 
on the porch of his home near the gymnasium this is that they 
did in 1984 when the govenrment also was accused to rigging the 
elections 
similar instances of tally sheet seizures took place throughout 
the nation 
it was not known where the soldiers took the sheets but the 
national tabulation board announced monday morning it had not 
received tallies from any of the 40 electoral districts 
said elizabeth escobar whose house is about 50 yards from the 
gym 
a man who said he was bringing a tally sheet came running into 
the house and gave it to me saying hang on to this well be back 
to pick it up later 
she showed the tally sheet of precinct 3655 and other 
documentation to journalists endara had beaten duque 12141 
a member of the defense forces and a policeman watched 
journalists as they walked into the gymnasium an hour later the 
doors to the gym were locked 
talk to the neighbors if you want to know what happened an 
officer said 
a few blocks away government sympathizers gathered in a 
politicians office victor schailer an alternate candidate for 
the national assembly said he had not heard about the attack on 
the gym 
if anything happened it was probably the result of the flow of 
adrenaline and the emotions of people he said adding he had not 
heard any shots fired 
when told of the scene at the gym with ballots scattered on the 
floor schailer said he would have to confirm it himself 
at a news conference in panama city european and us election 
observers expressed concern 
voting was peaceful until 5 pm sunday when the polls closed 
said fernando suarez gonzalez a spanish member of a parliamentary 
observer group our doubts begin at five 
angry residents of san miguelito a workingclass suburb 
gathered in knots on the street monday and vented their 
frustrations at some foreign journalists 
you were here in the morning shouted one man referring to 
sunday when former president jimmy carter visited the area 
where were the international observers where were you when the 
soldiers came in

gen manuel antonio noriega is 
stealing panamas presidential election for his own candidate by 
substituting phony vote counts former president jimmy carter said 
monday 
i hope there will be a worldwide outcry against this dictator 
stealing this election from his own people said carter who came 
to panama as an independent observer at the governments invitation 
a delegation of us observers named by president bush made less 
dramatic charges of irregularities in sundays election the 
delegation said it concluded that noriegas soldiers intimidated 
voters and carried out widespread fraud 
carters charges appeared to support those of opposition 
leaders who said soldiers raided voting stations nationwide and 
stole tally sheets 
the opposition said noriega panamas de facto leader ordered 
the move to prevent his candidate carlos duque from losing to 
opposition candidate guillermo endara 
carter told a news conference he was permitted to examine vote 
tallies at the election center and determined they were counterfeit 
he said the military seized thousands of tally sheets in a 
nighttime sweep 
during the day those records have been discarded and 
counterfeit documents have been substituted said carter 
he said the documents at the election center were not signed by 
opposition poll watchers while all sheets had been signed before 
leaving polling booths 
the tally sheets contain numbers based on a count of ballots 
which are burned afterward to prevent tampering 
carter said the panamanian government stopped cooperating with 
his mission as soon as he raised the issues his news conference 
was held in a hotel lobby as a crowd of noriega supporters jeered 
outside 
at a separate news conference at the officers club at albrook 
air force base the chairman of the official us delegation rep 
john murtha said his group could not certify that the election was 
free and fair 
murtha dpa said the archbishop of panama marcos mcgrath 
told him a church exit poll indicated the opposition won in a 
landslide 
this election was a terrible fraud on the panamanian people 
said one delegation member rep larry smith rfla 
the 13 us observers said they witnessed fraud firsthand 
watching individual panamanian defense forces soldiers voting in 
more than one precinct around the capital 
noriega is chief of the defense forces 
the panamanian committee for human rights which invited 279 
observers from 21 nations also branded the election as fraudulent 
the committee said the military intimidated voters and tampered 
with precinct tally sheets it called on the noriegacontrolled 
government to respect the decision of the panamanian people 
smith said his delegation saw polls open late voter lists with 
some names missing and names of dead people included 
it was all small different fraud he said 
the us delegation steered away from policy questions saying 
it would consult congress and the white house before suggesting 
what methods may be used to dislodge noriega the general was 
indicted in february 1988 in florida on federal drugtrafficking 
charges which he has denied 
some members of the delegation speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said the pentagon should withdraw 5700 military 
dependents in panama and tighten the economic screws 
others were more vocal in miami sen bob graham dfla an 
observer who left early monday said the united states should now 
consider the use of force in panama 
floridas other senator republican connie mack said that if 
noriegas candidate is declared the winner he expects to introduce 
legislation this week to cancel the 1977 treaty that is to give 
panama control of the canal in 1999

president bush faced with reports of rampant 
fraud in panamas election huddled with top advisers monday to 
weigh what steps the united states should take next in its efforts 
to oust dictator gen manuel antonio noriega 
an administration official who asked not to be identified said 
one possibility is to beef up the us military presence in the 
canal zone to protect us citizens 
some 10000 us military personnel are already based in the 
canal zone which remains under us control despite the decadeold 
treaty that cedes control of the panama canal to that central 
american country at the end of the century 
also under consideration in addition to beefing up the us 
military presence are further economic sanctions the official 
said 
bush will get a firsthand report at the white house on tuesday 
from the team of us observers he sent to monitor sundays 
balloting he will make no decision until after that meeting the 
administration official said 
the president met monday with vice president dan quayle defense 
secretary dick cheney white house chief of staff john sununu 
director of central intelligence william webster and other aides to 
weigh us options 
meanwhile the state department expressed deep concern monday 
night over evidence that forces loyal to noriega were using 
fraudulent means to ensure victory for his candidate 
the evidence cited by the department was based partly on 
comments by the head of the presidential observer delegation in 
panama rep john murtha rpa who claimed the electoral process 
was marked by fraud and manipulation 
the state department also said the vote tabulation had been 
interrupted after the election sunday and european parliamentarians 
reported that 127000 ballots were destroyed 
we are deeply concerned by evidence pouring in of electoral 
fraud on the part of the pronoriega forces the statement said 
it added that opposition demonstrators were met monday by a show 
of force including water cannons riot police and armed civilian 
supporters of the government 
earlier white house press secretary marlin fitzwater noted 
there were numerous reports of fraud and intimidation and he cited 
independent exit polls showing the opposition slate had well over 
60 per cent and the government coalition in the low 20s 
at the state department deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
at this juncture it appears clear that the people of panama have 
voted for democracy it is now up to gen manuel antonio noriega 
to respect the wishes of the panamanian people 
he refused to say what action the united states would take if 
the administration concludes that noriega the defense forces 
commander rigged the results in favor of his handpicked 
candidate carlos duque 
other officials said last week the administration is weighing a 
series of options if noriega retains power through fraudulent means 
one option would be to take legal action to seize noriegas 
personal assets in the united states and europe according to the 
officials these assets are believed to total in the hundreds of 
millions of dollars 
imposing a trade embargo against panama is another option the 
officials said 
meanwhile two us senators arrived in miami from panama on 
monday saying the united states should consider force against 
noriega if his military government steals the election 
democrat bob graham and republican connie mack both of florida 
along with miami mayor xavier suarez spent sunday as white house 
observers at polling places in various parts of panama 
at an airport news conference all three said they saw strong 
evidence of irregularities including soldiers allowed to vote 
repeatedly premarked ballots and padded voter lists 
i believe the united states should now consider the use of 
force in panama said graham weve tried economic sanctions 
which have had almost no effect on noriega and the people who 
keep him in power 
at a washington news conference ambassador juan b sosa a 
leader of antinoriega forces in exile disagreed with grahams 
assertion that noriega is as strong as ever 
he said noriega has been weakened tremendously since early 
1988 and is now on the verge of being deposed 
overthrowing a dictator is a sometimes slow and painful 
process but the actions by noriegas opponents have taken their 
toll he said 
sosa said he was encouraged by indications that many members of 
the defense forces voted against duque on sunday this reduces the 
possibility that bloodshed will be required to end noriegas rule 
he said

the 150member association of polish air 
traffic controllers began a protest action monday seeking higher 
wages and modernization of radar equipment 
three controllers speaking for the group said a 
workbytherules slowdown started with takeoffs allowed only at 
10minute intervals and lengthening of the distance between planes 
coming in to land 
in the first significant strike since the april 5 agreement 
between the government and solidarity union workers at four copper 
mines remained off the job 
negotiations continued monday with the workers whose fourday 
strike has cut ore production by 100000 tons daily the state pap 
news agency reported 
warsaw television said the strike by about 20000 miners has 
spread to copper mine employees working in warsaw on the citys 
subway system 
the solidarity information service said about 6000 strikers 
were occupying the four mines near lubin 
the strikers are seeking a 50 percent increase in pay that now 
averages between 118 and 176 per months 
solidarity suspended in december 1981 and subsequently 
outlawed was restored as a legal union under the april 5 accord in 
which communist authorities also agreed to political and electoral 
reforms 
the strikes began friday at the four mines that produce most of 
polands copper copper exports to the west in 1987 amounted to 
233 million according to the governments statistical yearbook 
the three air traffic controllers speaking with the condition 
they not be identified said the controllers were on a strike 
alert 
they said the protest action began because the the controllers 
did not receive a satisfactory response to repeated requests for 
improvements in equipment and pay 
flights in and out of warsaw were running up to 40 minutes 
behind schedule because of the job action the controllers said 
zbigniew dabkowski director of commercial cargo for polands 
lot air lines said i dont think it affects us to such a degree 
that anybody would want to comment on it talks continue 
the controllers said a letter was sent last month to prime 
minister mieczyslaw f rakowski complaining of the deterioration 
over a number of years in the air traffic control system 
they said that old unreliable radar and the decline in wages 
compared to the 80percent inflation rate has caused a number of 
controllers to leave the service and forced others to take second 
jobs 
controllers now earn an average 147 per month with overtime or 
about the national average according to the three 
they said the controllers are seeking salaries ranging from 
about 220 per month for assistant controllers to 470 montly for 
senior supervisors

automatic rifles broke up a march on monday by thousands of people 
who were alleging massive election fraud at least three people 
were wounded 
about 15000 people joined the march to protest raids by gen 
manuel antonio noriegas soldiers who witnesses said seized 
thousands of vote tally sheets and prevented sundays presidential 
election from being tabulated 
i hope there will be a worldwide outcry against this dictator 
stealing this election from his own people said former president

reliable indicator that duque had lost by about 3to1

the elections by seizing the tallies across the nation 
president bush met with top advisers in washington on monday to 
weigh what steps america should take next in its efforts to oust 
noriega an administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said one possibility is to reinforce the us military 
presence in the canal zone to protect us citizens 
a delegation of official us observers in panama declared the 
election fraudulent 
duque denounced what he called obvious american intervention 
in affairs that only concern panama and the abuse by observers of 
panamanian hospitality 
the attack on the demonstration seriously injured a tv 
cameraman a reporter for the french newspaper le monde and a 
marcher were slightly hurt

fraud they said they witnessed fraud firsthand watching 
individual panamanian defense forces soldiers voting in more than 
one precinct in the capital area sunday

before mondays raids by soldiers the opposition had also 
charged during sundays voting that soldiers voted more than once 
and that there were 100000 extra names on voter rolls 
in the panama city suburb of san miguelito where carter had 
praised voting procedures the day before troops arrived at 3 am 
and dispersed poll workers with gunshots and beatings 
they knew the government had lost said opposition poll 
watcher marcos herrera tally sheets left behind and scattered 
across the ground were viewed by the associated press and overall 
they showed a 31 margin for endara 
obviously if 120000 votes were to disappear as a result of 
violence it would be difficult to assume this was an honest 
election said fernando suarez gonzalez a spanish member of a 
parliamentary observer group 
san miguelito served as the counting center for 120000 of 
panamas 118 million registered voters 
a spokesman for the election board boris moreno only would say 
that no official complaints had been filed about events in san 
miguelito 
in the panamanian system ballots for each precinct are counted 
at the polls and then burned to prevent recounts tally sheets 
listing the vote totals are then taken to a counting center 
the opposition coalition said in a statement it had managed to 
obtain figures from 1039 of the nations 4255 precincts many of 
them in its own strongholds 
the figures showed endara with 174510 votes to duques 59729 
with 21857 blank ballots

nicaraguas foreign minister said monday that 
president bush doesnt have ronald reagans gut commitment to 
destroy the sandinista government and there are hopes for better 
relations with the united states 
in an interview with the associated press miguel descoto said 
he felt bush is more pragmatic than former president reagan 
with bush at least i dont think theres the degree of gut 
commitment to the destruction of the sandinista revolution 
descoto said speaking in english 
he said he also was led to have some optimism on the fact that 
secretary of state james a baker iii i think is a pragmatic 
man he said baker does not differ ideologically from reagans 
secretary of state george p shultz but he believed baker is in 
the presidential inner circle and shultz was not 
descoto who is accompanying nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
on a 10nation western european tour said reagan was a man with 
a pathological obsession about nicaragua i really think it can 
only be described as that 
then he reagan got himself into this so much that there was 
no coming back because of a fear to lose credibility 
ortega conferred with prime minister margaret thatcher on 
monday and a british source said mrs thatcher told him she was 
disappointed by his governments lack of progress toward democracy 
ortega said mrs thatcher did not promise any financial aid for 
nicaragua and he said we didnt have much hope for that 
later at a rally in the central hall westminster ortega told a 
rally attended by about 2500 cheering supporters that he was not 
asking favors of anyone 
if i were to draw up the balance sheet of the sum of all the 
wealth that marketoriented developed countries have extracted 
from all third countries of the world all of our foreign debt 
would be paid off and they would still owe us he said 
ortega was introduced by novelist graham greene who said 
lets look at the darkness in our own country and not an 
imaginary darkness in your own republic 
about 50 opponents of the leftwing sandinistas gathered outside 
the building and engaged in a shouting exchange with ortegas 
backers police kept the two groups apart but reported three 
arrests 
descoto said the united states which recently extended its 
trade embargo against nicaragua is not really helping 
relations 
he said the only positive sign was the us decision to allow 
nicaragua to replace seven of its diplomats kicked out by the 
reagan administration in retaliation for the ouster of seven us 
diplomats 10 months ago the sandinistas accused the american 
envoys of fomenting unrest 
nicaragua insists on respect from the united states the foreign 
minister said all that we are asking for is a new type of 
relationship with the states in other words we want to be friends 
and their response is who in the heck are you to be friends with 
the united states 
i believe with the united states its a question of time he 
added 
ortega after his 75minute meeting with mrs thatcher said 
it was a very frank conversation we were both frank and direct 
he told reporters that mrs thatchers status as a world leader 
allows her to be able to contribute so that the problems 
which exist between the united states and nicaragua can be 
overcome 
the british source speaking on the condition he not be 
identified said the prime minister did not make any promises 
on that issue 
mrs thatcher expressed doubts about nicaraguas commitment to 
democracy according to the british source 
ortega this year signed an agreement with four other central 
american presidents in which he promised electoral and other legal 
reforms to ensure fair elections set for february but last week 
his government rejected an opposition demand to negotiate reforms 
ortega and his delegation leaves tuesday for west germany and 
then ireland before returning home

hoping to rebuild the ancient jewish temple 
where islamic shrines now stand a group of israeli rabbis is 
compiling computerized lists of potential priests weaving seamless 
linen robes and reproducing a gemstudded breastplate described in 
exodus 
the plan would place the temple altar on what some 
ultrareligious jews believe is its historical site the spot is 
where the goldtopped dome of the rock now stands a jerusalem 
landmark and one of the holiest sites of islam 
the seemingly irreconcilable claim by arabs and jews to the 
area known to jews as the temple mount and to arabs as haram al 
sharif or noble enclosure is one of the most emotional issues 
of the arabisraeli conflict 
any attempt by israel to reclaim it would be certain to stir 
tensions throughout the moslem world the government does not 
support the rabbis plan to rebuild the temple 
all jewish history as far as were concerned is one big 
parenthesis until the temple is returned said rabbi nahman 
kahane of the temple institute

the scandal about scandal is much 
overblown declares john hurt star of the movie about naughty 
goingson among the high and mighty in 1960s england 
the british actor was recently in los angeles for the opening of 
the film and he termed the fuss over its x rating a storm in a 
teapot 
the scene that was allegedly the demon was what we call the 
orgy scene he said it was certainly not a sexy scene it was 
really a rather tawdry nasty scene behind closed doors with a 
particular tired old upper class 
it was directly opposite to what the protagonists christine 
keeler and mandy ricedavis represent the swinging 60s it was 
a different kind of permissiveness 
scandal which concerns the sex revelations that helped 
topple harold macmillans tory government was handed an x rating 
by the motion picture association of americas ratings board 
after making a few snips from the orgy scene the film was rated r 
an x would have meant boxoffice death few bookings fewer ads 
hurt viewed the film before and after the cuts and concluded 
it says the same thing apparently somebody took exception to 
what is known as rocking motion the rocking motion went and 
something else was put in its place 
the reaction in england to scandal was something else we 
had quite a lot of flak for making the film the establishment 
somewhat closed ranks really what i call the poor old jack 
syndrome came up why drag him through it again 
which is understandable i suppose but most of the criticisms 
were made by people who hadnt read the script or certainly seen 
the film thats not surprising i suppose because they may have 
thought that we were making some kind of specious movie which is 
not the outcome at all 
poor old jack is john profumo britains former minister of 
war a married man who was bedding keeler at the same time she was 
having an affair with a soviet naval attache and suspected spy 
i cant say that we did profumo a favor but i think the 
film has put him in a different light hurt said our 
perception is different from the publics perception at the time 
largely gleaned from the sensationalist press 
hurt portrays the late stephen ward an osteopath who was 
charged with pimping for his celebrity clients 
i think its pretty clear from the evidence that he was a 
scapegoat the actor said 
with his gaunt face and intense manner john hurt has made a 
specialty of difficult portrayals the most notable was the title 
role in elephant man which drew an academy nomination as best 
actor 
robert deniro would do something like raging bull the same 
year hurt said about the actor who won the prizethat year 
he was the mad emperor caligula in i claudius and the 
eccentric homosexual quentin crisp in the naked civil servant 
in champions he was a famed jockey who conquered cancer 
the inmate of a turkish prison in midnight express for which 
he received an oscar nomination as supporting actor and the 
homosexual cop in partners with ryan oneal 
hurt moves smoothly between the london and new york stage 
television and films surprisingly for a stagetrained actor he 
prefers movies 
if i were told that i could only do one medium and had to cut 
the rest out i think i would choose film he said

since its ceasefire with iraq iran has 
become a killing ground of executions 
hundreds of people some say thousands have been put to death 
in purges that reflect political turmoil inside iran since the 
fighting stopped in the persian gulf in august 
it is the biggest wave of executions in iran since 198081 when 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis loyalists turned on their leftist and 
secular allies who helped topple shah mohammad reza pahlavi in the 
1979 islamic revolution 
fears mount that a growing outcry against liberals and the 
power struggle within the tehran hierarchy indicate that more 
executions are likely 
the radical newspaper jomhuri islami said in a recent editorial 
the liberals are in conflict with the revolution 
why have they been left to infiltrate every place they 
want to carry out wicked acts the snakes are in their holes 
and waiting to release their poison 
among those executed were followers of ayatollah hussein ali 
montazeri the most prominent of the socalled moderates who was 
ousted in march as khomeinis successor as irans spiritual leader 
he had called for a halt to the executions wider freedoms and 
openly criticized the shortcomings of the 1979 islamic revolution 
many who were executed were middleranking islamic clerics 
including hojatoleslam omid najafabadi a former revolutionary 
judge they were described by intelligence minister mohammad 
reyshahri as psuedoclergymen involved in various political 
moral and corrupt offenses 
the purges appear aimed at eliminating dissident or outlawed 
factions opposed to khomeini in the postwar era or deemed to be too 
liberal for the new radicalism 
the iraqibased mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors who 
make up the main antikhomeini opposition movement claim that more 
than 12000 political prisoners have gone to their deaths at the 
hands of the state in the last six months it has given out the 
names of 1600 it says have been victims 
the united nations amnesty international and the us state 
department estimate that about 1000 political prisoners have been 
executed although they acknowledge that the true figure is 
probably far higher 
iranian officials deny the dissidents claim but the official 
media have reported that scores of counterrevolutionaries have 
been publicly executed since august 
the media have also reported nearly 550 alleged drug smugglers 
have been hanged from mobile cranes and expressway overpasses in a 
score of cities under a new antinarcotics law that makes the death 
sentence mandatory for possession of even small amounts of drugs 
the mujahedeen rebels claim tehran has sought to mask the purge 
of dissidents by claiming that many of those executed without trial 
were drug smugglers 
the rebels alleged that 200 people it said were executed in the 
western city of hamedan in recent weeks as smugglers were 
dissidents 
reports persist of mass executions in iranian prisons some 
dissident accounts claim that hundreds of prisoners some of them 
held without trial for years were blown up while other groups 
were gassed 
khomeinis supporters say that the deposed montazeri was 
politically naive and allowed himself to become the mouthpiece for 
opponents of the regime 
but diplomats and other analysts believe montazeri was 
reflecting growing uneasiness among many iranians about the 
direction the islamic revolution had taken 
with the radical resurgence interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi has called for a purge of socalled liberals and 
the enemies of islam in iran 
tehran newspapers have been echoing the outcry against the 
liberals believed to include mehdi bazargan the islamic 
republics first prime minister 
he resigned in 1979 in protest of the storming of the us 
embassy in tehran and the taking of its staff hostage since then 
he has led irans token opposition party despite constant 
harassment and was becoming increasingly close to montazeri 
irans military has not escaped the purge senior iranian 
officials claimed in april that several networks of us spies had 
been smashed within the military 
they allegedly included senior figures in the navy and army 
long distrusted because of their links with the shah and even the 
foreign ministry whose officials have been branded as too 
prowestern

pirates have killed scores if not 
hundreds of vietnamese boat people this year in southeast asian 
waters children have been clubbed into the sea women and young 
girls have been raped or abducted and men have been shot or beaten 
according to official accounts 
the level of violence the viciousness of attacks has gone up 
even though the number of attacks has gone down a western 
aid official said 
the pirate attacks began with the flight of vietnamese from 
their homeland with the communist takeover in 1975 but in recent 
years they had been in decline 
generally the pirates are after the refugees possessions which 
sometimes include gold or other valuables 
on april 16 pirates off malaysia set fire to a refugee boat and 
killed 130 vietnamese in a rampage of rape shootings and 
clubbings relief officials in malaysia said 
survivors of other attacks have told of scores of people 
drowning in single attacks as the pirates rammed vietnamese boats 
and used hammers sticks and other objects to beat adults and 
children back into the water when they tried to cling to pirate 
boats 
more than 100 people are missing and presumed dead from two 
attacks in march according to the united nations high commissioner 
for refugees unhcr 
on march 19 three pirate boats with about 15 crewmembers 
attacked a boat with 46 vietnamese on board they abducted 10 
women then rammed the vietnamese vessel until it capsized a 
passing vessel rescued the only known survivor 
on march 25 pirates abducted as many as 30 women and children 
after looting a boat with 58 vietnamese on board armed with knives 
and metal objects the pirates beat the other passengers and threw 
them overboard a teenage boy and an old man who floated to an oil 
rig were the only known survivors 
un officials in malaysia said they only recently learned of 
the april 16 massacre from a lone survivor a 22yearold man they 
identified as pham ngoc minh hung 
they said he told them he fled vietnam on april 14 on a 
motorized wooden boat with about 130 refugees including 20 
children 
two days later pirates from two boats boarded the vessel shot 
and killed its two pilots and its mechanic and raped some if not 
all of the 15 to 20 women and girls as young as 12 a un 
statement said 
then the pirates set the boat ablaze 
in the ensuing panic many refugees grabbed buoys and 
jerrycans and floats and plunged into the sea the un statement 
added 
the pirates used sticks to prevent refugees from clinging on 
floating objects those who resisted were shot at 
pham survived by clinging to dead bodies or other debris until 
he was picked up by another refugee vessel 29 hours later 
it is one of the worst incidents of piracy we have heard of 
said jean marie fakhouri the un refugees commissioner in kuala 
lumpur malaysias capital 
western officials say most pirates are thais in the south china 
sea the gulf of thailand and waters near indonesia 
pirates have attacked vietnamese boat people since they began 
fleeing the communist takeover in april 1975 in recent years 
however the attacks had been steadily decreasing with the 
strengthening of a thai antipiracy program coordinated by the 
unhcr and funded by western nations mostly the united states 
some western officials say the pirates were emboldened by the 
official thai government policy early last year of repelling boat 
people from thai shores as a deterrent to others aid officials 
said more than 100 people were killed in such pushoffs from 
thailand some in rammings by thai fishermen authorities had asked 
to help 
thailand claimed in april 1988 it had restored asylum for the 
vietnamese but sources say authorities since then have sent 
thousands of them away and directed them south to malaysia they 
said at least one vietnamese boat was attacked by pirates last year 
after thai authorities drove it away 
clearly anyone that wants to engage in piracy has to feel it 
is easier to get away with it when the government is making the 
kinds of statements they are making about refugees said shephard 
lowman president of the usbased voluntary group refugees 
international 
western officials said the thai policy has prompted most boats 
leaving vietnam to sail south to malaysia instead of east to 
thailand they say that puts them in the waters beyond the patrols 
of the antipiracy vessels it also forces them to spend a much 
longer time at sea 
thai government officials would not commentd on the record but 
some dismissed the accounts by survivors as fabrications designed 
to win sympathy and quicker resettlement in the west they also 
dismissed suggestions the governments policy had encouraged the 
violence 
western officials believe that most assailants are pirates of 
opportunity fishermen who chance upon vietnamese boats and 
cannot resist an easy plunder 
in 1988 authorities arrested 21 suspected pirates fourteen 
were found guilty and given sentences ranging from six to 50 years 
the maximum under thai law

japans largest underworld syndicate which has 
21000 members has just named its new boss and said it plans a 
formal installation the police are scrambling to find out when and 
where 
yoshinori watanabe takes over as head of the yamaguchigumi 
syndicate a post that had been vacant for more than four years 
because of a gang war 
watanabe 48 a muscular gangster known for his crewcut and 
violent bent was annointed by 13 members of the syndicates elder 
brother council in midapril according police in kobe a port city 
in western japan where the huge syndicate is based 
a police official there said that following the councils 
decision more than 80 of the syndicates top dons who each 
control a network of subgangs met at central headquarters april 
27 to give watanabe their approval 
the move was expected but police hope jockeying for posts in 
the new hierarchy may lead to disunity they are closely watching 
who will be appointed to executive ranks in the tightly knit empire 
the day after they made their decision we held a meeting to 
discuss tightening our crackdown said takashi ishii assistant 
director of the national police agencys organized crime control 
office 
right now we are trying to gather information on who will be 
the new leaders under watanabe while trying to make sure the 
gangs celebration is never held 
watanabe heads the powerful kobebased yamaken gang which has 
3000 members the largest single group within the yamaguchigumi 
organization he is now facing charges involving an assault 
committed in 1984 a verdict is expected may 26 
if he goes to jail it will only be for a short time maybe a 
year and wont effect his position as boss said an underworld 
source he added that having lived through four years without a 
boss another year or so would pose no real problem for the gang 
watanabe is free on bail 
watanabe is credited with singlehandedly negotiating an end to 
a conflict with the ichiwakai gang and forcing its boss to retire 
police reported more than two dozen deaths in 315 armed incidents 
during the fouryear battle making it the bloodiest ever in 
japans underworld 
the ichiwakai which had 6000 members at its peak was created 
in june 1984 after an internal dispute over yamaguchigumi 
leadership led to a revolt fear of a similar split and an equal 
balance of power between watanabe and acting boss kazuo nakanishi 
66 helped keep the gang from naming a new boss until watanabe 
ended the yamaichi war in late march 
in keeping with underworld custom leaders of the gang hope the 
watanabe ceremony will usher in a new era and publicly reaffirm 
their establishment status 
its an important matter of face for both the police and the 
gang because the yamaguchigumi wants to use the party to 
demonstrate its power said the underworld source the police 
want to stop them or if they cant force them to simplify the 
ceremony 
when the last inauguration was held in naruto on the southern 
island of shikoku in 1985 about 1000 police surrounded the 
meeting place but had no grounds to stop it more than 300 
gangsters dressed in formal black suits or kimono attended that 
rite part of which was televised no incidents were reported 
in most japanese gangs members have complex family 
relations created at elaborate ceremonies where participants sip 
sake to seal their vows of fidelity through these rites gangsters 
develop intricate elder and younger brother relationships and 
dedicate their lives to their father or boss 
police estimate overall gang membership in japan at about 90000 
and say nearly half are affiliated with the three largest 
nationwide syndicates the yamaguchigumi the sumiyoshi rengo and 
the inagawakai 
japanese underworld operations range from extortion and illicit 
gambling to the drug and sex trades they are also often involved 
in construction real estate money laundering and entertainment 
though the yamaguchigumis activities are primarily domestic 
police have said it has close relations with taiwans united bamboo 
gang which allegedly produces stimulants for illicit sale in 
japan strict guncontrol laws have also sent japanese gangs abroad 
in their search for weapons many of which come from the united 
states and the philippines 
national police officials say a fullscale expansion of japanese 
gangs abroad is constricted by the lack of large japanesespeaking 
communities and add that aside from the gun and drug trade 
operations outside japan often center on japanese tourists

a new agreement reducing the us military 
presence in spain should bring an end to an era of sometimes bitter 
relations between the two countries spanish officials say 
we have to recover all this wasted time said leopoldo 
stampa an adviser to spains defense minister i am very 
optimistic we have to relaunch our relationship based on this 
nuno aguirre de carcer a former ambassador to the united 
states said the end of negotiations brought a situation of 
normality in the relations 
the agreement accepts a spanish demand that the united states 
withdraw a highly visible air force fighter wing from the torrejon 
air base on the outskirts of madrid the capital the units 72 
f16s will be transferred over the next three years to southern 
italy 
the united states also is allowed under the eightyear pact to 
continue using three spanish military bases and nine communications 
posts 
the agreement reduces the authorized maximum number of us 
troops from 12545 to just over 8000 about 4000 are assigned to 
the torrejon base 
the accord replacing a fiveyear agreement was recently 
ratified by wide margins in both houses of the spanish parliament 
the two countries signed the texts of the new agreement in 
december ending several years of sticky bargaining 
carlos miranda director of international security affairs at 
the foreign ministry said the american decision to trim its forces 
in spain was regarded by the public as a kind of test 
spaniards he said have seen after this agreement that the 
united states is a country with which you can talk on equal terms 
the new levels set for us personnel represent he said what 
both countries feel is needed but not something imposed from 
washington to spain 
the spanish demand for removal of the 401st tactical air wing 
had angered us officials who were worried about finding a new 
location and paying for the move at a time of budget austerity 
moreover spain was seen as shirking its responsibility as a 
member of the 16nation north atlantic treaty organization the 
f16s comprise a crucial part of us frontline striking power in 
europe and are assigned to the defense of natos southern flank 
along the mediterranean sea 
italy has agreed to take the wing the relocation expenses will 
be picked up by nato except for housing and recreational costs for 
american troops 
in demanding the removal of the jets officials said the 
socialist government of prime minister felipe gonzalez was 
responding to public pressure 
in a march 1986 referendum a majority of spaniards voted to 
remain in nato but with conditions these included keeping spain 
out of natos integrated military structure maintaining a ban on 
nuclear weapons on its territory and reducing the us military 
presence spain joined nato in 1982 
the united states was given the right to use spanish bases under 
a military cooperation agreement first signed in 1953 during the 
authoritarian regime of gen francisco franco 
many spaniards still associate the us military arrangement 
with franco and argue it gave support and legitimacy to his regime 
with the removal of the fighter wing spanish officials said 
they have met the requirements of the 1986 referendum on reducing 
the us presence 
theres no reason why there should be further reductions 
said stampa 
the foreign ministrys miranda agreed 
the us presence in spain was excessive so there was no need 
of having the kind of presence we had he said and this goal 
has been attained 
in comparison with other west european countries spain has more 
us troops on its soil than greece and italy but fewer than 
britain and germany 
us forces will remain at bases in zaragoza moron and rota 
about 5100 us personnel are assigned to rota a naval base on 
the atlantic ocean in southwestern spain mostly providing support 
for the us 6th fleet in the mediterranean no us ships are 
permanently stationed there

a few photos of dylan thomas stuck on 
the wall of the bar in browns hotel are all there is to tell the 
visitor he has stumbled into the poets adopted hometown 
laugharne has always been in two minds about thomas torn 
between pride at being associated with a giant of 20thcentury 
poetry and the suspicion that he made the town a laughing stock 
so while they dont disavow him they certainly dont exert 
themselves to publicize the connection either that means no 
souvenir stores not even a sign directing visitors to his house or 
grave 
people are always surprised at this says tommy watts who 
owns browns hotel where the poet used to tipple the evenings away 
they expect to find dylan thomas bookshops and dylan thomas 
teacups 
thomas spent his last four years in the little seaside town in 
south wales living with his wife caitlin and their three children 
in the boat house overlooking the bay 
on the edge of the cliff above the wooden house is the work shed 
my wordsplashed hut he called it where he wrote such 
memorable poems as do not go gentle into that good night 
poem on his birthday and the comic verse play under milk 
wood 
rumpled impoverished and harddrinking thomas embodied the 
legend of the romantic selfdestructive poet dying in new york in 
1953 during the last of his three us poetryreading tours he was 
39 
the boat house my seashaken house on a breakneck of rock 
is a museum now the hut overlooking a forested slope that may 
have been thomas fictional milk wood is in danger of sliding off 
the cliff and workmen are shoring up its foundations 
the path to the house was renamed dylans walk in 1976 which is 
the only way youd guess who once lived there 
the living room is furnished with a tattered rug an old radio 
and overstuffed 1950s chairs in which visitors are encouraged to 
relax and listen to recordings of thomas reading his poems 
lorraine scourfield the curator doesnt believe in the 
donottouch approach 
we want people to have the feeling that theyre really coming 
into his room she said 
thomas would lie in bed with a cold or a hangover feasting on 
his childrens candy and bleating mournfully to caitlin for milk 
and sugared bread most mornings he would amble over to the pubs 
then to the shed where caitlin later wrote it was bang into 
intensive scribbling muttering whispering intoning bellowing 
and juggling of words 
thomas liked to stand on the verandah tossing bread crumbs to 
the herons after his death his mother went through his clothes 
and found crumbs in the pockets 
as the tide went out one recent spring morning a sand bank 
glittered like mother of pearl in the sunshine the town of 1500 
a timeless mild beguiling island looks scrubbed and tidy 
with its sunbathing cats lazy dogs and townfolk hurrying about 
their business with brisk good mornings to each other 
dylan thomas called laugharne the strangest town in wales 
and it certainly is different laugharnes name rhymes with barn 
the mayor goes by the rare and ancient title of portreeve and 
wears a ceremonial chain of gold cockleshaped medallions in 
tribute to what was once laugharnes main industry 
it is englishspeaking in a predominantly welshspeaking region 
and regards the nearest neighboring town as a foreign country 
people are generally reluctant to talk about thomas 
watts 57 says he generally tells curious visitors to go away 
but this day he says hes in a good mood 
i remember him all right he says we used to throw stones 
at him 
why 
because he was a foreigner 
thomas came from swansea 27 miles away 
dylan thomas to local people doesnt mean much says the 
portreeve terry thomas they feel laugharne was always here 
always will be always had its local characters and dylan was one 
of them 
in a letter the poet called laugharne the best town the best 
house the only castle the mapped measured inhabited drained 
garaged townhalled pubbed and churched shopped gulled and 
estuaried one state of happiness 
under milk wood was a richly comic tribute to laugharnes 
eccentricities and although the play is now performed in the town 
every three years laugharne was less enthusiastic at the outset 
at first i was angry yes said watts i thought who does 
this bloody man think he is coming here and writing about us all 
that stuff about webfoot cocklewomen 
one lady was up in arms because she thought one of the 
characters was her father now shes turned around now she tells 
everybody oh yes that was my father 
you see time immortalizes everything were stuck with dylan 
thomas whether we like it or not 
thomas had been visiting laugharne regularly since 1938 but 
only in 1949 did he move in permanently after a friend margaret 
taylor rented the boat house to him he wrote to her this is 
it the place the house the workroom the time here i am happy 
and writing 
he moved his parents into laugharne and when his father was 
dying it inspired his most famous poem 
do not go gentle into that good night 
old age should burn and rave at close of day 
rage rage against the dying of the light 
young though he was it could have been his own epitaph 
his drinking was becoming uncontrollable he and caitlin fought 
incessantly poverty always his curse was far more acute now with 
three children to feed 
i cant think im cold its raining on the sea the herons 
are going home he wrote 
nine days after his 39th birthday he collapsed in a new york 
city hotel four days later on nov 9 1953 he was dead 
he lies now buried in laugharnes churchyard under a simple 
wooden cross and a bed of wild primroses

for a member of congress theres a thin line 
between properly representing a constituent with a gripe against 
the government and improperly twisting arms 
ethics monitors have been trying for generations to determine 
how and where that line should be drawn they havent succeeded yet 
the subject is once again at issue in the ethics case against 
house speaker jim wright even though the house ethics committee 
decided not to press charges over his heavyhanded intervention 
with federal regulators on behalf of texas savings and loan 
interests 
rep newt gingrich rga wrights original accuser says he 
thinks the sampl accusations will be revived if charges against the 
speaker involving outside income and unreported gifts come to the 
house floor for action 
gingrich said wrights intercession led to delays in house 
action while the problem worsened and that the delays in turn 
may have added 40 billion to the cost of settling the sampl crisis 
both his points are hypothetical but they illustrate the 
problem a congressman can face when he takes up the cause of a 
constituent who is having trouble with the federal government 
theres no telling where it might lead 
yet for the member of congress who wants to remain one 
intervening for constituents with problems is essential work it is 
part of the process of representing a district or a state it also 
is one of the ways congress oversees the executive branch 
from the missing social security check to the overzealous 
regulator that kind of intercession can solve problems besides 
this years constituent with a problem solved becomes next years 
voter donor perhaps campaign volunteer 
the trouble is that it is hard to determine who really is out of 
bounds the constituent or the civil servant a senate panel tried 
to set guidelines as far back as 1951 and wound up offering advice 
instead of rules 
a legislator should not immediately conclude that the 
constituent is always right and the administrator is always 
wrong wrote paul h douglas the late democratic senator from 
illinois who headed that ethics subcommittee he said the senator 
or representative should investigate try to determine the merits 
of each case and proceed accordingly 
that advice was cited by richard j phelan special counsel to 
the house ethics committee in his report recommending that wright 
be charged with improperly pressuring the federal home loan bank 
board in behalf of texas savings and loan operators 
a house ethics report in 1970 said members are in bounds when 
they seek information about cases before executive or independent 
agencies arrange appointments make judgments and ask for 
reconsideration of decisions they think are not supported by law 
the report also said the congressmans services should be 
provided to all constituents on an equal footing without regard to 
politics or position and that any suggestion of either favoritism 
or reprisal against the agency involved is unwarranted abuse of 
the representative role 
the douglas subcommittee said pressure against federal agencies 
through hostile action in budgets or legislation is a kind of 
blackmail which is damaging to the public interest 
at the same time the senate panel said members of congress 
should intercede for their constituents so long as they do it with 
proper restraint for civil servants frequently become 
perfunctory in their work and careless of the people whom they are 
presumed to serve 
legislators can therefore legitimately serve as an informal 
board of inspectors the subcommittee said they can prevent 
administrators from flagging in their zeal and can detect and check 
abuses in the conduct of public business 
but the panel saw ethical quicksand in efforts by members of 
congress to get favorable rulings for constituents in specific 
cases it said legislators should insist on fairness but shouldnt 
try to force specific outcomes 
that sounds simple it isnt when a government agency is ruling 
on a case vital to an individual a business or a group the people 
involved are likely to see fairness in only one outcome 
in the end the individual member of congress has to decide 
whats fair and proper when those decisions come due no rule book 
can substitute for conscience and common sense

abortion has been legal under communist 
rule for 33 years in predominantly roman catholic poland but now 
with conditions relaxed and open elections ahead theres talk of 
outlawing it 
at a recent meeting of solidarity union activists preparing for 
the elections nominees were challenged on their positions on 
abortion 
in a television special a parliament member suggests the 
possibility of a nationwide referendum on the law that has made 
abortions legal since 1956 
a proposal submitted by 78 of the 460 members of the sejm as 
parliament is called would ban abortions altogether it provides 
for threeyear jail terms for women who have them and the doctors 
who perform them 
catholic church loyalists within the government alliance support 
the ban but it is opposed by the communist party leadership there 
are strongly religious strains against abortion within the 
solidarityled opposition movement while others in the movement 
defend abortion as a personal matter 
abortion was legalized in poland as part of a communist economic 
and social policy unfettered by religious considerations or public 
debate 
poland now has one of the worlds highest rates of abortion 
with some estimates suggesting that more than half of all 
pregnancies are terminated 
the most recent statistics available record 605500 births and 
122500 abortions in 1987 but the abortion figure does not count 
the vast numbers performed in private doctors offices one 
demographic study puts the total at 600000 abortions a year and 
church attacks on abortion have estimated 800000 to 1 million 
procedures annually 
since the abortion bill was submitted in the sejm on feb 28 
the official press and television have carried lengthy discourses 
on abortion and hundreds of abortion foes attended a catholic mass 
and protest march while opponents of the ban circulated petitions 
the recent negotiations between solidarity and the government 
only touched on abortion partly because of the divided opinion 
within the union 
dr zofia kuratowska who leads the solidarity side on health 
issues considers the proposed ban very repressive but says 
that within the movement people who are very strongly with the 
catholic church are not so strongly against the ban as i am 
two solidarity activists who are election candidates awkwardly 
played both sides of the issue during a recent meeting opposing 
the proposed law because of its stiff jail terms while agreeing 
that abortion was wrong 
the church is organizing antiabortion drives in parishes and 
outlining its opposition 
the law legalizing abortion is the work of totalitarian ruling 
of the stalinist type which has common ideological roots with 
nazism said the rev jerzy bajda an antiabortion leader 
looking at the 1956 law from todays perspective one should 
say its aim could only be the moral and biological destruction of 
the polish nation jan dobraczynski a catholic sejm deputy and 
head of the national patriotic group pron voted against the 
abortion law in 1956 while one of the five nonparty sejm members 
and is a leader in the fight now 
from the moment the new law was in force it quickly became 
more dangerous than it looked in theory he said the law 
allowed abortion but set many social and economic conditions soon 
it gave doctors the freedom to do it without any justifications 
opponents of the ban say that forbidding abortion after 33 years 
would drive it underground making it less safe and more costly 
this proposed law is dangerous because we may return to the 
secrecy of abortions said jan mlynarski a warsaw hospital 
physician some doctors will be making fortunes on it but women 
will only suffer 
mlynarski added that most women seeking abortions give him 
economic reasons women are afraid of what might happen with 
their second or third child 
the impact of unplanned pregnancy takes on special poignancy 
because couples often are hard pressed to support children with 
whom they may be sharing two tiny rooms 
the wait for an apartment is a decade or more for young couples 
the housing crisis and poor economic conditions have an deep impact 
on decisions to have children 
married women in poland work out of economic necessity if not 
professional reward but child and essential family care remains 
their responsibility 
banning abortion would accelerate the pauperization of 
millions of women who are already the most burdened part of our 
society a group of intellectuals wrote in a womens magazine 
the governmentbacked polish womens league has also spoken out 
we oppose the assumption included in the draft law that the 
woman is to bear all legal responsiblitiy for abortion which 
contradicts the legal acts that provide for womens and mens 
equality in rights and duties league secretary elzbieta 
dehnelluszczynska told the state news agency pap

in lebanon two rival governments one 
christian the other moslem battle each other for power but at 
the united nations lebanon speaks with one voice 
the division raised questions at the united nations over which 
faction secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and other un 
officials should deal with 
the secretarygeneral deals with the permanent representative 
of lebanon at the un said un spokesman francois giuliani 
that representative is ambassador rachid fakhoury 
but to whom does fakhoury and all other lebanese diplomats 
around the world answer 
under a mutual understanding without any public declarations 
the secretarygeneral of lebanons foreign ministry transmits 
positions from both factions said clovis maksoud the arab 
leagues ambassador to the united nations and the united states 
the secretarygeneral of the foreign ministry in beirut farouk 
abilama is the de facto foreign policy adviser for the divided 
government but this is being strained now in the current 
crisis said maksoud 
there is no attempt on the part of the governments to 
challenge the unity of the embassies or missions abroad or to 
embarrass them by getting them to take a factional position he 
added 
since there is no way the divided government could agree on 
appointing any new ambassadors for overseas posts the lebanese 
diplomatic corps has been frozen pending the outcome of the current 
crisis 
all embassies are getting a new lease on their tenure said 
maksoud 
the assumption is that this is a transitory stage and 
hopefully a short one 
ambassador fakhoury declined to be interviewed 
lebanons un mission consists of four diplomats two 
christians and two moslems who from all indications work together 
amicably 
arab league mediators have tried to arrange a ceasefire to halt 
the violence in lebanon which has claimed at least 278 lives since 
march 8 
maksoud noted that a few key government institutions survive in 
beirut the central bank in particular 
the central bank pays for the expenses of both factions of 
government impartially and for the missions and embassies he 
said 
the government crisis broke out sept 22 when the christians 
rejected moslem nominees for president to succeed the outgoing 
president amin gemayel a christian 
gemayal then chose gen michel aoun commander of 20000 
christian troops to lead the government and the moslem faction 
picked acting prime minster salim hoss to head the rival government 
by tradition lebanons president is christian the prime 
minister a sunni moslem and the parliament speaker a shiite moslem 
but this time the moslems wanted one of theirs to be president

editors note the johnstown flood of 1889 still ranks as the 
second worst natural disaster in us history in the number of 
people killed as the pennsylvania mountain town prepares to 
observe the 100th anniversary of the disaster a 106yearold woman 
is the only survivor who still who recalls that terrible day that 
afternoon in may when her father burst into their home to warn 
the dam has broken 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a century later elsie frum remembers 
vividly the steady shrill whistle of warning and the horrifying 
wall of water that killed 2209 people in the johnstown flood of 
1889 
my father ran into the house and said run the dam has 
broken and we ran we just got out in time mrs frum recalls 
it was terrible it sounded like thunder it took everything 
everything in front of it railroad engines the roundhouse it 
took all the buildings it looked like an ocean 
then there was nothing left it was like a beach when it was 
over we just stood there and watched it everyone was stunned we 
didnt know what to do 
mrs frum 106 years old and a greatgreatgrandmother is the 
last known survivor who remembers the flood of may 31 1889 the 
first of three floods to devastate this western pennsylvania 
mountain city and nearby villages 
one of the five worst natural disasters in us history the 
johnstown flood of 1889 was caused by the collapse of the south 
fork dam about 15 miles northeast and 450 feet above johnstown 
the 72foothigh earthen dam held a private lake for the 
exclusive summertime recreation of such 19th century industrial 
barons as andrew carnegie henry clay frick and andrew mellon 
experts said later it was weakened by poor maintenance and 
extraordinarily heavy rains of up to 10 inches in 24 hours 
the dams collapse sent a 35 to 80foot surge of water racing 
down the narrow little conemaugh river valley sweeping away 
houses barns railroad cars and locomotives telegraph poles 
livestock people and nearly everything else before it hit 
johnstown at 407 pm 57 minutes after the dam broke 
then a budding industrial city of about 10000 deep in a 
bowllike valley johnstown was already under several feet of water 
from the rains 
the midafternoon flood waters pushing a roll of debris before 
it crashed into the citys busy steel mills fragile woodframe 
homes and finally into its sturdy pennsylvania railroad bridge 
most of the people in johnstown never saw the water coming 
they only heard it historian david g mccullough wrote in his 
1968 book the johnstown flood 
those who actually saw the wall of water would talk and write 
about how it snapped off trees like pipestems or crushed houses 
like eggshells mccullough wrote but what seemed to make the 
most lasting impression was the cloud of dark spray that hung over 
the front of the waveit was talked of as the death mist and 
would be remembered always 
scores of stranded people floated on a huge jumble of wreckage 
covering about 30 acres that jammed up at the stone railroad bridge 
just below downtown but the great pile caught fire and 80 helpless 
victims died in a second horror 
clara barton then 67 years old and eager to promote her new 
american red cross rushed in from washington dc and set up 
headquarters inside a boxcar 
the new red cross helped organize field hospitals kitchens and 
laundries five months later johnstowns citizens bid her farewell 
with a diamond locket and their grateful thanks 
mrs frum then a 6yearold schoolgirl lived with her parents 
and two younger sisters in east conemaugh just upriver from 
johnstown her father john shaffer owned a planing mill next door 
mrs frum remembered her father was a nosy and nervous man 
especially about increasing rumors that the south fork dam was in 
trouble 
shaffer had stepped outside in the rain to see if nearby wooden 
bridges were still standing when mrs frum recalls everyone heard 
engineer john hess heroic warning whistle from the cab of 
pennsylvania railroad engine 1124 
mccullough wrote hess in his engine blazed down the valley 
the water practically on top of him in an incredibly heroic dash 
to sound the alarmnearly everyone in east conemaugh heard it and 
understood almost instantly what it meant 
that was our paul revere mrs frum recalls a man had 
taken his train up and he was on the way down and saw the dam had 
broken and he tied his whistle down he jumped he was saved he 
stayed on it till he got into conemaugh 
my father knew then that the dam had broken she says

from the safety of a nearby hill elsie and her family saw 
everything just roll away 
we could see things tumbling around in the water she says 
shaffer sent his family into the country for a week when elsie 
returned her father was building coffins for the dead brought to 
the nearby united methodist church 
i remember they brought the bodies there to wash took them 
across to the church and laid them across the top of the seats 
mrs frum says they put a robe over them he made the coffins to 
bury them in thats what i remember i saw all that 
it was horrible i was scared to death of dead people 
i remember the cleanup every time they would dig a place for 
a home they would find a body and every time they would dig 
anyplace they would find something you know a body or 
something 
johnstowns dead were found miles past the stone bridge for 
weeks debris was recovered as far away as pittsburgh about 75 
miles to the west the last body was discovered 15 years later 
many bodies could not be identified and 663 of the unknown were 
buried in a common plot in nearby grandview cemetery three years 
later 
in terms of lives lost the johnstown flood ranks as the second 
worst natural disaster in us history a hurricane that hit 
galveston texas in 1890 left 6000 dead the san francisco 
earthquake of 1906 ranks fifth with 500 killed 
the nations press sensationalized the tragedy sometimes filing 
false stories of heroism and looting but the press also helped 
mobilize quick national and international help for the stricken 
area 
within days trainloads of food tents clothing lumber 
construction supplies and even coffins arrived cash 
contributions from around the world totaled 37 million according 
to mccullough 
mrs frum remembers the relief efforts the immediate rescue and 
reconstruction activity 
all kinds of food came in and all kinds of clothing she 
says 
later fingers of blame were pointed at the millionaires south 
fork fishing and hunting club which had allowed the dam at the 
former reservoir to deteriorate several lawsuits were filed and 
without a lake the club soon closed 
but mccullough reported not a nickel was ever collected 
through damage suits from theclub or from any of its members 
every person was warned oh long before it broke mrs frum 
says oh yes they were warned every time it rained they said 
the dam was going to break and it didnt and of course when it 
happened why nobody thought it was going to happen and nobody ran 
but us 
the shaffers were lucky the high water flooded their house and 
they returned to live in it 
but mrs frum lost everything including the contents of her 
johnstown home on march 17 1936 when a warm rain melted heavy 
winter snows too quickly and the city suffered its second major 
flood the 1936 flood left 25 people dead and caused 41 million in 
damage 
moving to a nearby suburb atop a mountain mrs frum missed 
johnstowns third great flood on july 22 1977 when 11 inches of 
rain fell in the area in nine hours the 1977 flood left 80 people 
dead and caused 350 million in damage 
mrs frum never left the johnstown area and she has survived two 
husbands all of her 30 descendants are still alive 
i have wondered yes a lot why im here she says i 
guess its just not time for me to go ive gone through a lot i 
dont want another flood i know that 
there have been other hard times for johnstown stung by rapid 
declines in the steel industry johnstown at one point in 1983 bore 
the nations highest unemployment rate 266 percent at the same 
time it maintained the nations lowest crime rate 
the city now about 35000 people and slowly recovering 
economically has planned more than 100 commemorative and special 
events this summer to mark the floods 100th anniversary under the 
slogan a triumph of the american spirit 
the reason for the celebration is to show how the city has 
been resilient not only from the floods but from the various 
economic adversities says mayor herbert pfuhl jr 
referring to survivors of the 1889 flood pfuhl says i think 
theyd be pleased with the changes and the progress that has 
happened

editors note the communist insurgency in the philippines 
appears to have weakened since a popular uprising toppled president 
ferdinand marcos authoritarian administration in february 1986 
but the rebels still number about 23000 fighters according to 
government estimates and last year more than 3900 people were 
killed in the fighting 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the recent killing of an american 
colonel reflects a shift in strategy by filipino communist rebels 
seeking to reverse setbacks suffered since president corazon aquino 
took power three years ago 
as part of the shift the communist party of the philippines is 
reverting back to a ruralbased strategy after the failure of an 
urban campaign and is becoming more selective in recruiting after 
military agents infiltrated its ranks 
the rebels are also focusing on american influence especially 
the presence of six us military installations in a bid to gain 
support in urban areas where opposition to the bases is strongest 
the rebels have offered peace talks if the government agrees to 
close the bases 
they also took responsibility for the april 21 assassination of 
col james n rowe of the joint us military advisory group a 
rebel statement said the colonel was slain because of american 
interference here 
assessing the strength of the rebellion is difficult since most 
activity takes place in remote areas where communications are poor 
much of the information on rebel activity comes from the 
163000member armed forces of the philippines 
today at the national level the insurgents appear to be on 
the defensive and attempting to regroup rear adm timothy w 
wright acting us deputy assistant secretary of defense told a 
us congressional committee recently 
in the provinces however where the struggle is primarily 
waged the picture is less clear because much of the insurgents 
grassroots program is not conducted on the military battlefield 
nonetheless there is a public perception especially in manila 
that the insurgency has weakened since a popular uprising toppled 
president ferdinand marcos authoritarian administration in 
february 1986 
rebel propaganda portrays mrs aquino as no different from 
marcos but most filipinos still support her and do not blame her 
personally for the shortcomings of her government 
without going into statistics there is a feeling in the 
population that the insurgency is in disarray military chief of 
staff gen renato de villa said in an interview with the 
philippines free press magazine i think the most important 
development is the realization that is spreading that the insurgent 
alternative is not that palatable 
that perception has arisen despite military reports that 
fighting actually escalated in 1988 military reports show the 
number of clashes rose from 3118 in 1987 to 3525 last year 
areas reporting increased fighting include southern districts of 
luzon the main island and the davao and misamis oriental 
provinces on mindanao 
according to the military more than 3900 people including 
guerrillas government troopers and civilians were killed last year 
in insurgencyrelated incidents a 163 percent increase over 
1987 
the military also acknowledges that guerrillas influence nearly 
8000 of the 41000 villages and urban wards rebels operate in 
about 65 of the 73 provinces 
but the military also claims guerrilla strength declined by 84 
percent last year to about 23000 fighters western sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity suspect this may be simply a 
refinement in the militarys estimate which was too high in the 
final years of the marcos administration 
de villa says captured rebel documents indicate demoralization 
in the ranks due to a 21 percent increase in battlefield deaths 
during the first three months of this year military officials 
believe rowe was killed in part to boost morale in rebel ranks 
wright noted the favorable military reports but said there was 
no way to verify them nor are they conclusive of a significant or 
lasting setback to the rebels 
clearly however the party has suffered reverses they include 
the arrests in the past year of eight members of its central 
committee including secretary general rafael baylosis and more 
than 30 regional and provincial officers 
western sources with close ties to the military say the arrests 
were made because government informants penetrated senior party 
ranks during the final years of the marcos administration when 
membership rolls swelled 
despite rebel attempts to win foreign support both soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and chinese leader deng 
xiaoping have personally assured mrs aquino that they will not 
support the insurgents the rebels acknowledge their main source of 
weapons comes from raids on government forces 
the perception that the insurgency is waning may stem in part 
from a reduction in rebel and leftwing activity in the capital 
which peaked in the months following marcos ouster and the rise of 
mrs aquino to power 
since the party was founded in december 1968 it had followed 
the strategy of late chinese leader mao tsetung in building a base 
in the impoverished rural areas from which to isolate the urban 
centers

but the overthrow of marcos and the rise of mrs aquino afforded 
the party new opportunities to expand into manila the rebels 
acknowledge they made a tactical error in boycotting the february 
1986 election between marcos and mrs aquino held two weeks before 
the uprising 
after taking power mrs aquino freed hundreds of political 
prisoners including party founder jose maria sison who now lives 
in the netherlands she offered peace talks and negotiated a 60day 
ceasefire in december 1986 
rebel leaders such as satur ocampo and antonio zumel both 
former journalists emerged from years in the underground to appear 
on television talk shows and public rallies 
both joined nearly 100000 people in a funeral march for slain 
labor leader rolando olalia during which communist flags were 
openly displayed 
the rebels also used the ceasefire to infiltrate nearly 3000 
armed city partisans into manila after peace talks collapsed 
and fighting resumed guerrillas launched a campaign of street 
assassinations killing nearly 100 police officers soldiers and 
civilian officials during 1987 in manila alone 
but rebels acknowledge that the urban strategy failed 
indiscriminate killings alarmed the urban classes they also 
prompted sometimes draconian responses from the police 
in bacolod police drew up a list of suspected leftwing 
sympathizers and warned the rebels they would liquidate five of 
them for every policeman slain street killings there ceased 
manila police organized a network of armed informants and 
launched a series of mass raids in which hundreds of civilians were 
rounded up for questioning 
the strategy led to protests from human rights groups but 
prompted slum dwellers to turn in guerrillas to avoid harassment 
human rights groups even took out paid advertisements in manila 
newspapers urging the rebels to scale down their killings for fear 
the military would target them in reprisal the military claims 
such groups are rebel sympathizers 
the military claims the failure of the urban strategy led to a 
shakeup of the partys manila branch in which more than 50 members 
were investigated either for mistakes or as suspected military 
informants some of them were executed the military claims 
in a recent issue of its official organ ang bayan the nation 
the central committee acknowledged it was reassessing the nature 
and style of operations of armed city partisans and would be more 
selective in choosing targets 
the rebels apparently are gambling that killing an american 
colonel will not elicit the same public outrage as indiscriminate 
attacks on lowly filipino policemen 
meanwhile rebel offers of peace in return for closing the six 
us bases appear to be a bid to build support among urban groups 
opposition to the bases is substantial among the nationalistic 
intelligentsia and the urban classes 
mrs aquino has not accepted the offer and the rebels 
apparently hope this will make her appear an american puppet in 
the eyes of many filipinos 
meanwhile the rebels have put new emphasis on rural organizing 
about twothirds of the 58 million filipinos live in rural areas 
which have so far not benefited from improvements in the economy 
there the rebels hope to expand their system of shadow governments 
and recruit followers 
we are now trying to professionalize leaders in preparation 
for building provisional revolutionary governments said one 
rebel official on negros island who used the pseudonym fidel 
castro we also need a higher level of training to combat 
government counterinsurgency strategy he said 
defense secretary fidel ramos said in december that rebels have 
seized more than 76500 acres of land nationwide and are 
distributing tracts to landless farmers 
the military last september drafted a twostage threeyear plan 
for crushing the insurgents the first stage which is near 
completion calls for retraining troops reorganizing command 
structures and selecting targets 
the second phase beginning this spring calls for 
systematically eliminating rebel forces first in remote mountains 
and jungles and then nearer towns and cities 
under the plan the military is training and deploying thousands 
of civilian militiamen to augment rural security plans called for 
deploying about 80000 militiamen but the figure was scaled down 
to about 50000 because of budget restraints 
military and civil officials concede that the campaign cannot 
succeed unless the government can improve the livelihood of its 
people provide essential services and eliminate social injustices 
that are still widespread 
there are disturbing signs that basically the situation of our 
people has not changed said the manila chronicle in an 
editorial seventy percent still live in abject poverty and there 
are those who hold power wealth and influence who have not learned 
to share resources with the majority for as long as these symptoms 
persist the insurgency will find a fertile and hospitable ground

junior ramey and his con games are part of the local lore now 
little junior ramey not to be confused with his brother big 
junior ramey is making a name for himself in politics but he 
intends to stay on the right side of the law now that hes had a 
taste of prison

little junior ramey who was west virginias 
youngest mayor before he was sent to prison is back in town and 
planning on getting back into politics 
but james ramey jr iii has a family reputation to live down or 
live up to depending on whos doing the talking 
a lot of folks hereabouts have fond memories of his father 
james ramey jr who before his death in a federal penitentiary in 
1983 had become known as west virginias greatest con artist 
he could sell you anything whether he had it or not says 
little junior who is back running his diner where the menu 
features things like chicken and dumplings and corn bread he 
could convince you your black jacket was white 
despite making his living as a con man junior ramey was elected 
time after time as a county constable the citizens of wayne also 
elected his wife louise ramey a justice of the peace and they 
elected his son james ramey jr iii mayor of the town at the 
tender age of 22 
ramey now 26 resigned that job in 1987 after he pleaded guilty 
to a tax evasion charge and was sentenced to two years in a federal 
prison a sentence that many people consider to have been unfair 
regardless of that ramey is back in wayne having been released 
from prison on parole in january 1988 he plans to run for mayor in 
june after he completes his parole 
i always said that i didnt know which it was that got me that 
jail sentence being junior rameys son or being the mayor of 
wayne ramey says any other person that got caught for what i 
did wouldnt have gotten two years in prison if id been an 
average small business person they would just have made me file 
and pay my taxes 
at first ramey says he was reluctant to seek office again 
fearing that it was his prominence as the youngest mayor in the 
state that helped get him a jail sentence 
but everybody in this town kept insisting for me to run 
again ramey says and i like being a small town mayor its 
not like real politics its just trying to do your best to help 
your community 
the town of wayne population 1495 has indeed supported the 
rameys when little junior pleaded guilty to the tax charge nearly 
1100 people put their signatures on a petition urging that the 
young mayor be given probation and community service work for his 
sentence 
but its said the ghost of junior ramey raised its head at the 
younger rameys sentencing once a ramey always a ramey the 
prosecutor said a day before the 1987 tax filing deadline 
people can either sit down tomorrow night and do the right 
thing or look at mr ramey and feel theyve been taken 
assistant us attorney joe savage said in asking us district 
judge charles haden to impose a jail term on the young mayor 
the legacy of junior ramey apparently remains with us today 
savage told haden who also had sentenced the famed con artist 
this raft of rameys tends to confuse outsiders after all james 
ramey jr had eight wives and 13 children one of the sons was 
named james robert ramey another was named james ramey jr ii and 
was known as big junior thus james ramey jr iii the youngest 
came to be called little junior 
although he never really asked for an explanation of the muddled 
names little junior has a pretty good idea why his father named 
his sons as he did 
it probably had to do with confusing the irs ramey 
explains and if somebody came in here looking for junior ramey 
we could always say he wasnt here 
and somebody was always looking for junior ramey 
he was good at what he done no question ramey says of his 
father everybody here knew what my father did for a living but 
he always took his money from the rich people the people of this 
town always liked my father and the people he beat out usually 
were looking for something for nothing

one of rameys most famous cons was selling people on the idea 
of a moneycranking machine with which the lucky owner could 
turn 1 bills to 10 bills just put in a dollar bill turn the 
crank and out comes a green portrait of alexander hamilton 
complete with serial numbers and seals in another con ramey sold 
his mark a process for making 20 bills in a bathtub by soaking 
two real bills in chemicals and pressing them against a blank piece 
of paper 
it was usually just one crook taking off another crook like 
selling somebody counterfeit money that didnt exist ramey says 
he was taking off two and three a week making thousands and 
thousands of dollars but he had to keep looking over his shoulder 
for people coming after him 
i know that if i lost 20000 to a con man id probably shoot 
him 
junior ramey also enlisted his children in his schemes 
i loved my father dont get me wrong little junior adds 
at 13 or 14 he taught me how to do everything run all the cons 
he knew they couldnt do anything to me because i was under age 
it frequently meant life on the run for much of the ramey 
family in 1974 junior ramey was arrested in phoenix after an 
alabama coin dealer accused him of selling him a nonexistent coin 
collection the arrest came according to little junior after a 
scene right out of the movies 
they chased us through the desert with a helicopter and he 
tore up three fbi cars as well as our car before they stopped us 
ramey says then somehow he talked that arizona judge into 
setting his bail at just 20000 he was out the next day and 
gone 
throughout his colorful career wherever junior ramey landed 
his family went along little junior has been to every state but 
hawaii when his father was sentenced to prison in lexington ky 
for 18 months the family pulled up stakes and moved to kentucky to 
be close by 
i missed three days out of 18 months of seeing my father every 
single day ramey says i was there monday through friday from 
530 pm to 10 pm and on saturdays and sundays from 830 am 
to 330 pm every single day 
despite an early start as a junior con artist most people in 
this area say little junior ramey is an exemplary citizen 
after i turned 18 my father wanted me to go straight ramey 
says 
so he took over the pioneer driveinn once owned by his father 
and made it into one of the booming businesses of wayne 
the tax charge that was the only thing i was still doing that 
my dad told me to do ramey says most of my brothers have been 
in and out of jail all their lives 
ramey says the investigation of his failure to file tax returns 
started when one of his halfbrothers former kermit police chief 
david ramey was being investigated for selling drugs and tried to 
get prosecutors to go easy on him by steering them in other 
directions 
when little junior was subpoenaed to testify before a federal 
grand jury he says i went in and told them i was guilty i 
signed that plea agreement that day 
hes the only one of that whole family whos made something of 
himself says james e chambers a respected huntington lawyer 
whose son and law partner is the speaker of the state house of 
delegates 
representing ramey at his sentencing on the tax charge chambers 
who also had represented the elder ramey in the past told the 
judge that young ramey had pulled himself up by his own 
bootstraps from the environment in which he was raised 
coming back to wayne after his prison sentence wasnt hard 
ramey says the people of this town have supported me 
unbelievably and in the last year our business has really 
boomed 
hes considering running against john wesley mills who was 
appointed mayor after little junior was sentenced when he resigned 
after his first stint as mayor ramey says this town had a new 
fleet of cars it was 28000 to the good and didnt owe anybody 
anything 
but his months in prison even though it was a florida camp 
with white lines on the sidewalks instead of fences taught 
him the lesson his father never learned ramey says 
i feel like he should have learned his lesson when he first 
went to prison he says i did i know ill never take another 
chance at going back to prison and i was at a country club

editors note its an irrigation system regulated by computer 
modern technology at work to restore marshes and swamps to their 
natural state before man started altering the landscape this 
experimental project north of chicago is helping scientists learn 
how wetlands work and could serve as a model for similar efforts 
elsewhere 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<TEXT>
the prairie marshes ponds and streams 
near this town just north of chicago would look familiar to the 
europeans who first settled northern illinois 150 years ago 
but the wetlands today are being fed by a maze of underground 
pipes with the flow of water from the des plaines river regulated 
by a computer 
its part of a 10million project to help scientists better 
understand wetlands researchers worldwide are watching because 
the work could become a model for similar projects to restore vital 
marshes and swamps 
were aiming for a natural prairie landscape so when you look 
across it you will see what the early explorers would have seen 
says donald hey who heads the 450acre des plaines river wetlands 
demonstration project 
most of what were doing is trying to compensate for the loss 
of landscape through the introduction of concrete and controls 
says hey director of wetlands research inc a nonprofit group 
funded by corporate and government grants 
nationwide more than half the 200 million acres of wetlands 
that existed when european settlers arrived on the continent have 
disappeared they continue to be destroyed at an annual rate of 
275000 acres or more than onethird the area of rhode island 
according to figures compiled by the federal fish and wildlife 
service 
wetlands marshes swamps and bayous can soak up flood waters 
and help improve water quality many conservationists say 
one of the key values of wetlands is they serve as a kind of a 
filter some people might call it a kidney within an aquatic 
system says david davis director of the environmental 
protection agencys wetlands protection program 
we need to be finding ways to restore areas that have been 
degraded davis said in a telephone interview from washington 
he said the des plaines project probably will be examined around 
the country as a model for other projects spurred by increased 
awareness of wetlands and their benefits 
the 3mile stretch of the des plaines river about an hours 
drive north of chicagos loop will in the next few years be 
restored to the kind of flora and fauna that inhabited the site 
before settlers drained it for farming in the 1850s 
were reversing a 130year trend hey says were taking 
out a lot of vegetation that is ecologically out of place 
much of the vegetation that had overtaken the natural plants 
during the last centuryandahalf has been cleared that has 
involved bulldozing the land so it more resembles its natural 
contour and taking out many of the trees that settlers had planted 
it was choked it was overgrown with trees when we started 
hey says ive been amazed that there hasnt been more outcry 
over the cutting of the trees 
where the project has been completed the bullrush marshes are 
peppered with highlands of oak making the site a textured 
patchwork of browns and greys since the beginning of the spring 
it has begun to turn various shades of green and migratory birds 
have returned to roost 
hey hopes to see more of the osprey heron and bufflehead duck 
as well as fox and beaver that have already begun to repopulate the 
area 
its amazing the change weve had in waterfowl hey says 
the more we open up the land the more well see the waterfowl 
coming back 
the site looks like a nature preserve but with numerous 
conduits pumps and monitoring stations hooked up to an onsite 
computer the project is also a laboratory for experimenting with 
various aspects of wetlands management 
one of the things that is particularly interesting about the 
project is that it combines both wetlands restoration and applied 
research says davis of the epa its kind of a living 
laboratory 
hey says the project will explore what water depths soils and 
plant types are most effective in improving water quality how long 
to retain the water and what kinds of other elements are needed in 
the system 
so far with only 5 million of the 10 million price tag for 
the project raised hey and his colleagues have built four 
experimental wetland areas they can be filled to any depth water 
can be retained for any length of time and then drained in various 
cycles 
were really trying to find out how to make wetlands work how 
to restore them how to keep them running hey says we really 
dont know which kinds of plants do the most in terms of water 
purification 
plans ultimately call for another four experimental areas by the 
time construction is completed in early 1990 hey says congress 
has authorized another 22 million for the project but has not 
yet appropriated any of the money 
scientists from many states have visited the site and in march 
a group of wetlands researchers from china toured the project 
a documentary film and manual on wetlands restoration are also 
planned 
lt col jess franco chicago district coordinator for the army 
corps of engineers said the corps hoped to use much of the data 
from the project to restore other wetlands 
whats being done here can be used for similar wetlands 
projects across the nation franco says in louisiana on the 
coast of california in florida theyre different from what we 
see in the midwest but this is a good first step

editors note get the homeless off the streets and put them to 
work thats the goal in a lot of cities often without much 
success but a joint effort of private businesses and social 
service agencies in denver may be on the right track 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

less than a year ago pete shields had 5 to his 
name a drinking problem and nothing but the sky to sleep under he 
had spent 20 years living on the street 
shields 46 now has more than 400 in the bank an apartment 
and a 40houraweek job and not just at the minimum wage 
i dont figure ive done too bad he was saying the other 
day as he took a breather from his work at osage resource recovery 
inc which hires only homeless or indigent people 
the company which handles promotional mailings is owned by 
osage initiatives a combination of public and private concerns 
that was created just under a year ago as a new approach to solving 
the problem of the homeless 
osage has placed about 90 homeless people in jobs with 
denverarea businesses and has created about 25 jobs through its 
own business ventures such as orri which hired shields 
orri is osages first wholly owned business but it also works 
with companies in allied ventures to provide other jobs such 
ventures include the maintenance company artisan initiatives 
dominion services asbestos removal company and a cafeteria on 
osages premises that trains the homeless for work in the food 
service industry 
osage also houses five community agencies offering job training 
and counseling and a day care center 
orri pays its employees a minimum of 450 an hour plus 
benefits and says it has been competitive because of low overhead 
costs osages complex of renovated buildings lies along the 
railroad tracks just west of downtown denver 
it demonstrates that you can have a social conscience and be a 
capitalist all at once says marcia malone head of business 
development at osage she says many firms have responded favorably 
to doing business with the company 
businesses like what were doing because were doing it 
without federal funds 
osage director earl belofsky says more than 60 percent of 
denvers homeless mainly need jobs 
were saying dont give us money give us the contracts and 
the jobs he says if we can catch them before they fall 
through the cracks they havent lost their selfesteem most of us 
arent very far from that line 
most of the people osage hires or places come out of shelters 
which screen them to make sure they are willing and able to work 
each night there are between 2100 and 2600 homeless people in 
denver according to a census the colorado coalition for the 
homeless conducted about a year ago 
shields is one of about a dozen men working in orris renovated 
warehouse filling an order from a local brewery they are putting 
gift items into kits for a promotional mailing 
i was just one of those people who didnt want to settle 
down says shields who was married three times but drank my 
way through all my marriages 
one day i just decided im about that age where i should do 
something and not thrash around on the street he says 
shields joined an alcohol treatment program and was directed to 
osage for a job he had some construction experience he says and 
would like to get back to that eventually 
here i can make my way up the ladder if i use my head he 
says id like to get back into construction i have skills ive 
got the brain to do it if i just put my mind to it 
also working in the warehouse is john velasquez in the two 
months he has been working there velasquez and his wife and their 
four young children have been able to move out of a shelter 
velasquez had lost his job as a machine adjuster and ended up in 
jail for failing to appear in court on drunken driving charges 
when he decided to sober up he couldnt get hired again 
i had gone to electrical and mechanical school and i know ive 
got some talents here he says i knocked on a lot of doors 
even tried dishwashing 
velasquez says osage is teaching him new job skills 
they opened doors for hope im so grateful he says 
when you make a mistake it hits so hard 
the idea for osage developed after jack macallister the chief 
executive office of u s west the telephone company visited a 
denver shelter for the homeless macallister was struck by the 
sight of a man meticulously ironing a pair of pants for a job 
interview 
soon after he contacted the five agencies and worked to 
establish osage u s west donated the buildings and along with 
other community businesses provided a 28 million loan to help 
renovate them u s west also provided 300000 in seed money for 
business development and gave orri some of its first contracts 
fixing parts of phone booths 
belofsky says osage will pay back the loans 
malone says orri made its first sale in june and had sales of 
66000 in the next six months then in january alone it took in 
70000 malone says she is optimistic that orri can gross at least 
10 times that much this year 
our product is as good as anybodys belofsky says noting 
that orri is set up to handle big promotional mailings and similar 
projects that most companies are not set up to handle inhouse 
belofsky says the adolph coors co for instance placed its 
first order with osage for 1800 its second was for 42000 
belofsky says companies in other cities have contacted him for 
advice in starting up ventures similar to osage 
were in business to create jobs he says we have to make 
money so we can keep doing that

editors note americans are suckers for a slick sales pitch 
says a psychology professor who spent three years learning the 
tricks of a salesmans trade before he wrote a book on the subject 
and robert b cialdini learned one important lesson while doing his 
research he learned to say no 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
robert b cialdini wrote his book about sleazy 
sales techniques to warn consumers to be on guard now hes 
frequently invited to speak to the people in charge of the selling 
the 43yearold professor of psychology at arizona state 
university in tempe spent three years researching his book 
influence the new psychology of modern persuasion he became a 
usedcar salesman peddled products doortodoor sold advertising 
made cold calls on the telephone learning all the sales 
pitches 
now hes on the lecture tour taking his message to marketing 
and sales executives negotiators attorneys fundraisers and the 
like 
the people who invited me to come for lectures already 
understood the process in an inarticulated way he says that 
is they knew what worked but they wanted to know why it worked 
they wanted the psychological underpinnings 
thus cialdini began speaking more about the ethics of the 
persuasion process than the process itself he says he has a 
natural interest in the subject since he describes himself as a 
typical patsy for a sales pitch 
but he says hes not alone he maintains that we are socialized 
in such a way that if someone gives us something for free such as 
a hare krishna flower at an airport we feel we must reciprocate in 
some way or we are taught not to interrupt so we subject 
ourselves to a long telephone pitch because we are too polite to 
just hang up 
cialdinis research shows how the salesmen capitalize on these 
civilities without the consumer being aware 
in his own research he found a fire safety sales pitch among 
the seamiest the salesman would come in for a free inspection of a 
home and the lucky homeowner would receive a free fire extinguisher 
first the salesman would show pictures of burned children 
he says it was just awful 
after the inspection he would ask the homeowners to fill out a 
questionnaire while he went out to the car to get something 
he would always say stay seated ill let myself out and 
come back in thats very important think of it who do you let 
in and out of your house someone you trust so the salesman has 
established himself as a trusted person by this simple technique 
then came the pitch it went something like charles do you 
think your wife and litte girl here are worth 2000 what other 
way can you answer that 
if the potential customer was still resistant the salesman 
would ask permission to call his office and report he had failed at 
another sale a failure he explains that might cost him his job 
but then the front office all part of the central plot would 
explain that he could offer them the products for 500 less since 
his job was on the line 
cialdini also took breathing lessons so he could make a pitch on 
the telephone without taking a breath thus not allowing the other 
party to interject im not interested 
he regrets that consumer groups showed a lack of interest in his 
book but he says the interest of corporate america changed his 
life 
ibm flew me to monte carlo for a month twice for big 
educational conferences he says thats the kind of boondoggle 
i always read about somebody else getting but i got it and they 
paid me money besides 
he gets 3500 per lecture or 5000 for half a day but hes 
had to cut his speaking down to twice a month hes back teaching 
psychology after a sabbatical 
cialdini says hes pleased that the book did not turn him into a 
pop psychologist and that he did not lose academic standing 
because of it 
the book published in 1984 and reissued as an academic text in 
1988 outlines the six triggers people respond to in 
decisionmaking authority reciprocity scarcity commitment 
consensus and liking 
in discussing the authority technique cialdini offers an 
ethical and unethical use 
if nine out of 10 doctors really did prefer a certain brand 
thats one thing he says but its something else to have an actor 
whom the public identifies with the physician he portrays endorsing 
a decaffeinated coffee 
cialdini describes the difference as the detective approach 
and the smuggler approach the detective approach is to find 
naturally hidden triggers in the product the smuggler approach is 
to create them such as the actor in a white doctors coat 
endorsing a product 
lets say you have spent about half an hour with a usedcar 
salesman do you feel as though you like him if the answer is yes 
watch out you are being manipulated the question is whether the 
price on the car is a good deal 
that technique explains the success of such products as 
tupperware avon and mary kay he says the seller of those 
products is likely to be a friend or at least an acquaintance 
lets say you are looking at a house to buy and your real estate 
agent becomes aware that another family is also interested he 
tells you that someone else might get it that is perfectly 
legitimate hes acting in your best interest however in an 
unethical scenario there is no other buyer out there but the 
agent creates one to get you to put down a firm bid 
how do you know when its real 
unfortunately often you dont 
thats why all salesmen tend to get tarred with the same brush 
and end up ranking down there below undertakers cialdini says 
when i talk to business groups the point i make is that they 
are going to do better in the long term by being ethical he 
says then they sit up and take notice 
he uses as an example a trusted mechanic who told him the 
repairs necessary on his car would be 45 the previous mechanic 
had estimated 500 
he was very ethical and he now has me as a customer for 
life cialdini says 
although hes back teaching now cialdini says that the research 
he put in on his book gave him one more advantage 
i can say no a lot better now

cindy pickett who portrays the mother of a 
california boy who was abducted at age 7 says the boys real 
mother never abandoned hope during the seven years her son was held 
by his abductor 
a new nbc miniseries tells the story of steven stayner who was 
kidnapped from his home in merced calif in 1972 and held captive 
until he was able to escape in 1979 during those seven years he 
lived an apparently normal life as the son of his abductor kenneth 
parnell a convicted child molester 
but stevens parents never gave up hope of finding him alive 
she said she knew steven wasnt dead because a mother would 
know says pickett who portrays kay stayner the mother in i 
know my first name is steven 
the twopart miniseries which will be televised on monday and 
tuesday also stars john ashton as the father del stayner arliss 
howard as parnell corin corky nemec as the teenage steven and 
luke edwards as the 7yearold steven 
larry ellikan directed jp miller and cynthia whitcomb adapted 
the screenplay from a story by jp miller 
parnell told steven that his parents didnt want him any more 
the boy thought he haof offbroadways most 
innovative theaters particularly as a home for plays that deserve 
a second chance 
from its beginnings in an upper west side hotel where audiences 
had to cross a druginfested columbus avenue to get to the theater 
to its current space in a gentrified area of shops restaurants and 
coops on upper broadway second stage has made its mark 
during that decade its commitment to reevaluating plays like 
lanford wilsons serenading louie jules feiffers little 
murders and the woods by david mamet hasnt waivered yet the 
theaters vision has altered slightly 
weve evolved explains miss goodman a onetime actress who 
gave up acting for fund raising and administration when we came 
on the scene we fulfilled a need that wasnt present offbroadway 
everyone was doing new plays no one was doing contemporary plays a 
second time 
things have changed today from lincoln center to the new york 
shakespeare festival to the humana festival for new american plays 
in louisville ky theater companies offer playwrights second 
productions 
we also did plays that maybe hadnt been done in new york 
before like how i got that story or my sister in this house 
miss rothman says they had been done in other theaters around 
the country but not here so they seemed like new plays 
the women were diligent in their search for properties reading 
scripts doing library research reading reviews and meeting with 
every artistic director in new york to ask them if you could do 
a play again that you did in the past what would it be 
the women spent a year raising money 90000 and planning a 
threeplay season before the theater finally opened in 1979 
we did that so we could just concentrate on the plays miss 
goodman recalls we thought we were pretty smart ten days before 
we were supposed to start the first play nearly everybody quit 
the director the lighting designer the set designer and the two 
lead actors walked out along with them 
miss rothman took over the direction of the play miss goodman 
took over all its technical aspects and both begged two actor 
friends to come in and save them they did the play didnt get 
great reviews but it and the theater survived even if audiences 
had to take an elevator to the shabby buildings top floor to see 
the shows 
if you lived to get to the 16th floor you were happy to see 
anything miss goodman says 
among the works presented that first season was a revival of 
michael wellers split weller has been a mainstay of second 
stage he was the focus of the second stages last season when it 
presented two old weller plays moonchildren and loose 
ends as well as the world premiere of spoils of war a new 
weller work starring kate nelligan that later went to broadway 
it wasnt until the theaters third season that it attempted a 
new play the premiere was pastorale by deborah eisenberg 
the reason we did it was because it had been rejected by 
everybody in and outside new york miss goodman says we read 
the play and fell in love with it she wasnt going to get a 
production unless we did it 
the following season a subscriber and playwright named tina 
howe came to them with painting churches a play already turned 
down by the new york shakespeare festival 
the duo decided to do it the play was a success and transferred 
to the lambs theater near times square for an extended run 
as we began to see we were making our mark proving our point 
and had good relationships with playwrights it seemed silly for 
them if we had a good working experience to take their new play 
somewhere else miss goodman says 
the relationship with miss howe has continued through the years 
in 1986 the theater presented the playwrights next work 
coastal disturbances which also went on to broadway and 
received another best play tony nomination 
the relationship has continued with approaching zanzibar 
miss howes latest work currently enjoying a run at second stage 
the play which stars jane alexander and harris yulin looks at a 
family as it travels across the country to visit a dying aunt 
miss rothman has directed the play something she tries to do at 
least once each season her partner used to act in one play a year 
but after the first four years gave it up 
it was painful to be acting in my own theater miss goodman 
says thats a lot of responsibility every once in a while i 
say hey i could do this part but then i say to carole 
wouldnt judith ivey or diane wiest be good in this role 
second stage moved into its modern 120seat theater christened 
the walter mcginnjohn cazale theater in 1984 it was named for 
actor walter mcginn miss goodmans husband who was killed in an 
automobile accident in 1977 and a good friend of his john cazale 
another actor who died of cancer the following year 
today the theater has an annual budget of more than 2 million 
for its fourplay season and shows no sign of being a victim of 
its increasing success 
our mutual strength is that we have the same taste in plays 
says miss rothman we usually agree on things 
robin is incredibly giving to a production she adds even 
if a play doesnt get great reviews shell still be in there 
talking to people just making sure that the experience of working 
here is a positive one were not here to make a lot of money so 
you should get some joy out of the experience

many us and european officials fear improved 
relations will lead to even more rapid acquisition by the soviet 
bloc legally and illegally of the wests sensitive military 
technology 
american officials say the soviets spend at least 1 billion a 
year to obtain western technology and often will pay more than 
three times market value for something they want 
analysts say the soviets obtain high technology with the help of 
unscrupulous western businessmen who may acquire the goods legally 
then divert them to the east illegally soviet agents get other 
material through espionage 
the diversions are taking place in the more relaxed atmosphere 
created by mikhail s gorbachevs peace and disarmament overtures 
which have altered western perceptions of the soviet threat 
there is no sign that soviet efforts have diminished and 
evidence is that they are increasing said william waldegrave 
britains deputy foreign secretary 
francois heisbourg head of the international institute for 
strategic studies in london said losses now may surpass those of 
the late 1970s when soviet agents penetrated key ministries in 
france and west germany 
we will see an enormous draw from the west said john 
galvin the american general who commands nato forces in europe 
well probably lose the technological edge weve had for 
decades 
the united states and 16 allies belong to the coordinating 
committee on multilateral export controls known as cocom which 
tries to stem the flow of sensitive military goods to the soviet 
bloc 
stephen bryen former us deputy undersecretary of defense for 
trade security estimated western businessmen smuggled items worth 
up to 2 billion to the soviet east in 1988 
recent diversions and thefts analysts say have allowed soviet 
engineers to make more accurate missiles quieter submarines and 
stronger aircraft wings and to clone advanced computers they might 
have taken years to develop 
they say the soviets also are acquiring such new battlefield 
technology as helicopter weapons systems and tank armor and 
western experts worry that the trend to greater trade between east 
and west will increase the flow 
there is no question they are on a path toward getting 
more technology said richard perle a former top pentagon 
official who championed export controls we certainly gave away a 
lot during detente and this looks like a rerun 
gorbachevs ambitious plan to modernize the soviet economy has 
created intense interest in western business circles 
dozens of western companies are entering joint ventures that 
eventually may offer soviet consumers a variety and quantity of 
goods and services not available now joint ventures also may 
provide western technology money and management expertise 
gorbachev sorely needs 
some western allies urge caution lest such cooperation allow the 
soviets to concentrate its scarce resources on defense projects 
but others want to help gorbachevs liberalization program 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher of west germany said 
recently in view of the great economic problems confronting the 
soviet union as well as its process of restructuring a western 
readiness for cooperation in the economic sector is strongly 
needed not least in our own interest 
an american serving in paris said privately that if the thaw 
continues it will probably be more and more difficult to 
maintain the support for cocom that weve had 
john c kelley jr director of strategic investigations for the 
us customs service in washington said increased trade will 
provide more opportunity to mask some of the items and 
commingle more hightechnology merchandise with legitimate goods 
cocom based in paris regulates shipments of weapons nuclear 
technology and dualuse products such as communications 
equipment that have both commercial and military applications 
aaron karp of the stockholm international peace research 
institute said soviet engineers now are seeking manufacturing 
processes rather than single items 
in march west german authorities accused several german 
computer hackers of pirating technical data from the pentagon and 
research centers in the united states europe and japan over two 
years investigators say the hackers sold it to the soviets for 
money and drugs 
authorities said the information helped soviet engineers read 
data in some crucial industrial and military installations 
this is a new quality of espionage by the east said gerhard 
boemen chief of west german intelligence services 
espionage successes for the soviets mean western researchers 
must invest heavily to find something better than what has been 
lost 
nato officials say a spy ring in the us army in west germany 
broken up last august gave the kremlin even more sensitive 
information than originally believed 
italian authorities charged two men in february with selling 
secrets about a computer system being developed for the alliance 
french police seized a disassembled particle accelerator packed 
in 18 crates and destined for the soviet academy of sciences in 
moscow the police arrested aime richardt who was implicated in 
previous cases french customs charged that the machine is used to 
accelerate heavy ions which gives it military applications but 
richardt claimed it was an accelerator of light ions and was 
suitable only for scientific research the case is still pending in 
a french court 
viktor karpov the soviet arms negotiator laughed when asked 
whether moscows theft of technology had increased 
look at that florida case he said the man tried to sell 
to the fbi not the kgb 
a former defense worker in florida had called the soviet embassy 
to offer plans fbi agents on the line arrested him

theyre getting more than ever a ranking pentagon official 
said privately theyve come up with ways to pull together 
systems from separate directions thats new 
he said the us commerce department recently granted export 
licenses to austria for three apparently unrelated components none 
seen as sensitive on its own together they allowed the soviets to 
make advanced fiber optics 
all they needed was a little piece of software to make it all 
hum but commerce did not see the overall context the pentagon 
official said 
cia estimates say the soviet military industrial commission 
obtained 30000 pieces of hardware and 400000 technical documents 
between 1976 and 1980 
in the early 1980s the reagan administration pressed its allies 
to clamp down but gorbachev came along in 1985 with his talk of 
peace and reform 
waldegrave the british deputy foreign secretary said we 
must not let gorbeuphoria sweep away our defenses 
west germany which borders the soviet bloc and depends heavily 
on export earnings argues energetically for cooperation and more 
selective controls 
we dont want to have a new artificial division between east 
and west foreign ministry spokesman hanns schumacher said 
officials in the united states britain and france said they 
worried about west germanys ability and will to control 
sensitive exports 
a us defense department document made available to the 
associated press identifies west germany as the greatest single 
source of illegal transfers of sensitive technology 
after west german sales of chemical weapons components to libya 
and the middle east were criticized chancellor helmut kohls 
government agreed to crack down on sensitive exports 
enforcement officers remained skeptical german companies can 
sue officials for delaying goods and no prelicense or 
postdelivery checks guard against fraud investigators have 
limited access to company records 
there are 20 cases where the germans are pretending nothing is 
going on said perle the former us defense official 
we pleaded with them but they have not put in place a 
mechanism for enforcement they let the companies go out and sell 
differences in philosophy divide even close allies 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain recently allowed the 
company simon carves to sell electronic machining equipment worth 
450 million to a factory in soviet armenia despite us objections 
britain said nothing new was given away and the deal warmed the 
eastwest climate us officials argued against helping with such 
complex projects 
technology theft made headlines when toshiba machine of japan 
and kongsberg vaapenfabrikk of norway were caught faking documents 
to sell the soviets milling equipment to produce silent submarine 
propellers 
the case broke in 1985 but one pentagon specialist said the 
full effects would not be known until the mid1990s western 
engineers had to design better noisedetecting devices 
japan tightened controls but subsequent probes found similar 
violations in france west germany and italy americans and britons 
were involved in other cases 
punishment is seldom harsh for diverting technology and 
investigators complain that governments sometimes mask details to 
avoid scandal 
bryen the former us trade security official likened the more 
recent forestline case in france to toshibakongsberg because it 
allowed the soviets to machine sophisticated aircraft wings 
last april four executives of the forestline company were 
charged with smuggling machine tools to the soviet union 
they were released pending trial the paris daily liberation 
reported much later that a fifth man a government consultant was 
also under investigation 
a french official confirmed a fifth suspect who worked for the 
government then shrugged and said true we didnt exactly shout 
it from the rooftops 
from a us embassy annex in paris cocoms small staff protects 
a list of components and processes the size of a city telephone 
book a separate us list controls items for reasons of security 
or foreign policy 
the agency was not established by treaty and depends on the will 
of governments to apply national laws or priorities some europeans 
accuse cocom of needlessly limiting their markets 
many say the list is outdated and too long as a dutch delegate 
put it cocom needs a higher wall around a smaller garden 
us officials fear sensitive technology will move unchecked 
toward the easiest exit when the european economic community lowers 
internal customs barriers in 1993 
in washington the defense and commerce departments argue over 
what to deny the soviet union and how much to sacrifice in export 
earnings 
under foreign availability an exporter can sell a 
restricted item if he demonstrates someone else already is doing 
it officials say that invites abuse 
paul freedenberg undersecretary of commerce for export 
administration agreed with others that controls at best could slow 
an inevitable process stopping big diversions while smaller ones 
passed unnoticed

late last year dutch businessman 
franciscus govaerts traveled to boston to supervise the packing of 
14 million worth of hightechnology equipment he had ordered from 
teradyne inc 
was govaerts just a nervous buyer worried about his fragile 
cargo 
no says us customs its allegations say he was making sure 
teradyne would abide by a bargain to mislabel the boxes so they 
could be exported illegally to bulgaria in the soviet bloc 
in the boxes was equipment for testing and repairing computer 
chips that can be used in personal computers video games and 
missile guidance systems 
teradyne participated in an undercover sting operation 
govaerts was arrested and charged with violating federal export 
laws 
western officials say the export of militarily sensitive goods 
is difficult to control and some liken the flow to narcotics 
traffic 
to completely stop it is impossible said viktor jacobson 
the us customs attache in bonn west germany 
roger urbanski who heads the us customs office in vienna 
said its a race without a finish line because of rapid 
technological advances 
over the years legally or illegally the soviets and their 
allies have obtained billions of dollars worth of sensitive 
technology 
analysts say the acquisitions have aided soviet research and 
development efforts enabling them to devote scarce resources to 
other areas 
a cia report said the kremlin captures high technology through 
an espionage program run by the soviet military industrial 
commission and an illegal trade operation in the foreign trade 
ministry 
it said most of the ministrys program involves western traders 
under contract to the soviets 
when the suspects in the boston case pressed ahead with the 
order despite legal problems authorities said teradyne grew 
suspicious of their persistence and notified the customs service 
officials said they have been alerted to other cases by 
competing companies disgruntled employees intelligence services 
and random checks of export shipments 
one investigator was tipped to a case when he overheard an 
exporter boasting in a belgian bar about how easy it was to divert 
high technology officials said he learned that the braggart 
operated two german front or dummy companies 
g jonart head of belgiums customs investigations recalled 
that a spot check of goods being shipped through belgium uncovered 
a scheme to divert us computer equipment worth about 100000 to 
bulgaria 
requests from the soviets to their contacts for sensitive 
technology usually are detailed officials said 
the other side knows exactly what they want said jacobson 
the customs attache in bonn they are looking for specific items 
down to the model number 
in a june report on technology transfer the north atlantic 
assembly said moscow earmarked 14 billion in the late 1970s for 
purchases of oneofakind western hardware and documents 
each year between 3000 and 5000 new amended and 
reapproved requirements for hardware and documents are issued and 
form the basis for the soviet shopping list of western 
technology it said the assembly is made up of legislators from 
the 16 nato nations 
about onethird of the hightech requirements established by the 
soviet military industial commission are completely or partially 
filled annually said the report by the cias technology transfer 
assessment center 
soviet trade agents often contact unscrupulous businessmen at 
european trade fairs where hundreds of companies gather for a few 
days to do business officials said 
they also have an elaborate network of foreign trade 
organizations commercial offices joint companies and foreign 
procurement offices according to the cia report 
urbanski the customs man in vienna said the soviets put out 
the request the first one with the market and best price gets the 
deal its a normal transaction at an inflated price 
if the kremlin really wants an item the sky is the limit 
officials said and the soviets may pay triple the going rate or 
more 
ideology seems to have drained out of all of it urbanski 
said they do it only for money said jacobson 
with the deal struck a western european company possibly a 
front for the soviets may order the merchandise and have it sent 
legally to a nato nation such as france germany or belgium 
once the goods are in europe the diverters may disguise the 
packaging and shipping instructions and send the material through 
other countries possibily neutral switzerland or austria before 
slipping it into the soviet bloc 
money is no object in transportation jacobson said its 
the cost of doing business

perched on south americas northeast shoulder 
guyana is about the size of idaho has fewer people than major us 
cities and is sinking into economic depths after attempting a 
transition from capitalism to socialism this is another in a 
series of periodic reports by the associated press on the economic 
social and political turbulence that has turned south america into 
a continent in crisis 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
although it has bountiful resources 
including gold and diamonds guyana is in the throes of one of the 
worst economic declines in the developing world 
its 750000 people face chronic shortages of electricity water 
transportation fuel and food jobs are scarce and prices are 
soaring a gallon of milk costs the equivalent of 3 three times 
the average daily wage 
its only thriving economic sector is the black market 
frustration is giving way to violence and strikes 
fearing riots similar to those that killed 176 people in 
neighboring venezuela in late february and early march guyanas 
military is on alert the unrest here is simmering at its worst 
since race riots left hundreds dead in the mid1960s 
the world bank estimates guyana a former british colony on 
south americas northeast shoulder and the continents only 
englishspeaking nation has had the worst economic decline in the 
third world over the past decade 
we have sunk almost to the bottom of the table perhaps just 
above haiti and bolivia the independent daily the stabroek news 
commented recently 
guyana has had virtually no economic growth in 10 years and in 
the mid1980s suspended payments on its foreign debt now 19 
billion western creditors have stopped most aid to the country 
but not only does guyana which is about the size of idaho have 
a big foreign debt for its size it has no foreign exchange 
reserves it has borrowed 1 billion just to keep foreign 
currencies on hand for emergencies 
last year when the government needed more local currency the 
guyanese dollar it simply printed it 
without hard currencies such as the us dollar guyana cant 
afford to import parts or buy technology and this has left its 
infrastructure roads bridges sewers electric and water 
treatment plants to deteriorate this coupled with an exodus of 
the skilled workers and poor production of its three major exports 
sugar bauxite and rice contribute to the slump 
but the crisis also points to the governments establishment in 
1980 of a cooperative republic in transition from capitalism to 
socialism 
in the past two years president desmond hoyte has backed away 
from much of the socialism of his predecessor forbes burnham who 
led guyana to independence from britain in 1966 
burnham died in 1985 after 21 years of authoritarian rule 
during his presidency he nationalized 80 percent of the economy 
and discouraged foreign and private investment in a bid to make 
guyana a selfsufficient nonaligned socialist republic 
critics also blame the crisis on mismanagement resistance to 
democratic reform and alleged corruption by burnhams peoples 
national congress which has dominated politics since he became 
president in 1966 the elections in december 1985 that brought 
hoyte to office were widely regarded as fradulent 
there is a big question over elections which has never been 
addressed and its a cancer in the life of the country said 
anglican bishop randolph george the style has changed with 
burnhams death but its the same old gang its a 
minidictatorship 
although the government maintains burnhams socialist policies 
were not responsible for guyanas decline a pending agreement with 
the international monetary fund signals a change of course 
private enterprise doesnt conflict with socialism said 
prime minister hamilton green we need large inputs of money and 
we hope the imf program will provide incentives needed to grow 
but its going to be rough very rough 
western creditors want an imf agreement before giving guyana new 
aid so on march 31 hoyte imposed a threeyear imf program that 
devalued guyanas currency by 70 percent doubled interest rates to 
35 percent and triggered 300 percent price hikes 
to soften the blow the government gave state workers a 
20percent pay increase but thats small change for salaries that 
dropped in value to 1 a day from 250 as a result of the 
devaluation food prices skyrocketed workers have to work two days 
to buy a pound of chicken or a pint of cooking oil 
a 20 percent increase is not enough we need 1000 percent 
said lincoln lewis president of the guyana mine workers union 
representing 4000 of the 5000 workers in the bauxite industry

some 20000 workers from the sta he said 
he also said exxons response was reluctant and myopic 
characterized by stalling techniques disinformation and a refusal 
to pay real attention to damage outside of prince william sound 
the subcommittee today was to conclude two days of hearings 
investigating the nations largest oil spill todays session was 
expected to include testimony from exxon which has defended its 
actions 
alyeskas vice president for operations theo l polasek said 
the industrys response plans were sufficient to deal with a spill 
but that there was confusion after the tanker ran aground 
rep george miller dcalif told polasek that im not so 
sure this the cleanup was a high priority for you people 
the tanker exxon valdez ran aground on a reef in the sound on 
march 24 after filling its storage tanks with crude oil from the 
pipeline more than 10 million gallons of oil poured into the sound 
also sunday state officials said exxons decision to pull crews 
from an oilstained beach on smith island was surprising 
but exxon spokesman bill stillings said the crews were moved off 
the northern beach to attack more heavily soiled areas the island 
is considered crucial to the annual seal pupping cycle 
i think we fully intend to come back to that beach i wont 
tell you well be back on that beach tomorrow stillings said 
exxons best judgment at this point is that its time to move 
on 
two days earlier yost said the beach was far from clean 
exxon in a plan that has yet to win yosts approval has called 
for the worst of the oil to be cleaned off five islands in the 
sound by wednesday with 364 miles to be cleansed by sept 15

gorillas in the mist mca home video vhsbeta 8995 
rated pg13 
 
dian fossey was a driven committed woman a woman who gave up 
the comforts and safety of home her love life and her appendix to 
live with gorillas in central africa 
but she crossed that fine line between commitment and obsession 
between a illusion and reality and paid for the voyage with her 
life 
gorillas in the mist attempts to examine the life of the 
anthropologist who dedicated her life to saving an endangered 
population of gorillas in rwanda she fought poachers government 
officials animal traders and her own colleagues 
sigourney weaver stars as fossey but her performance is more a 
character study for a drama class than a finished product she 
stumbles through an array of emotions from joy to enthusiasm to 
wonder to rage but simply doesnt have the depth to be convincing 
fossey was a complex unconventional woman in weaver we see only 
a silly shrill 
but the gorillas are cute and far more interesting than the 
star 
bryan brown puts in an admirable performance as a national 
geographic photographer and fosseys sometime lover there also are 
good support jobs by john miluwi as fosseys house man and tracker 
and julie harris as a white local who befriends the anthropologist 
they overpower weaver who seems an amateur out of her league 
despite an academy nomination for the role 
if you can suffer through sigourney weavers acting youll 
enjoy the stunning vistas and beautiful photography of gorillas

punchline rcacolumbia pictures home video vhsbeta 
8995 rated r 
 
the manic melancholic merry world of standup comedy is 
studied in david seltzers punchline starring tom hanks and 
sally field 
critically acclaimed when released theatrically last year it 
was overlooked by the academy at oscar time too bad because hanks 
gives a much better performance as the brilliant comic steven golda 
than he did playing a 12yearold in big 
and the movie itself is a tightly written fastpaced portrait 
of that special world of comedy it is a movie that will make you 
laugh cry and think 
everybody tells lilah krytsick field a housewife from new 
jersey how natually funny she is more than anything else lilah 
would love to be comic so she spends her nights in a manhattan 
comedy club called the gas station 
but the personable lilah isnt too funny on stage shes a yawn 
with her polish jokes and her new jersey jokes enter steven the 
hit of the club with his lenny brucetype deliveries and acerbic 
satirical stabs he wants to make it big lilah just wants to make 
it 
she enlists his help he sees her potential and encourages her 
she sees his pain and befriends him along the way she and her 
husband weather a crisis in their marriage over lilahs avocation 
and become closer still 
the movie climaxes with two amazing monologs by the stars 
especially hanks brilliantly paced diatribe against stylists 
punchline is a mustsee rent it if you must but try to 
buy it its a worthy addition to your movie library

like a prayer sire madonna 
 
the perfumed inner sleeve is a tipoff if any is needed that 
this is not just a record but a pop culture event but put aside 
the hype the soft drink commercials the soap opera marriage and 
the controversial videos and what are we left with ah yes the 
music 
the fact is madonna knows how to make earcatching pop music 
this is not high art but neither is it the pasteurized processed 
music substitute that fills the airwaves of radio stations with 
such names like as 101 it may be bubble gum but with a spicier 
flavor than most 
the most interesting track is love song a collaboration 
with prince the two flamboyant stars work surprisingly well 
together their vocal tricks backed by sinuous guitar and 
synthesizer music to create a mood of sexual tension less 
successful is express yourself imitation motown that calls for 
a huskier voice madonna is no belter 
several songs deal with family relationships the death of a 
mother in promise to try a cruel parent in oh father a 
violently crumbling marriage in till death do us part however 
close the stories may be to madonnas own life a bit of genuine 
emotion does come through amid the slick production and stylized 
singing but dont look for insight the lyrics are simple and 
sentimental the cause of marital strife hes not in love with 
her anymore 
then theres the hit title track with its quasireligious 
imagery when you call my name its like a little prayer 
theres really nothing new about that references to heaven and 
angels abound in teen love songs the viewpoint here as throughout 
the album is adolescent but then consider the audience

dont tell a soul sire the replacements 
 
the replacements gradual switch from a raucous punk sound to a 
more mature melodic rock has drawn plenty of complaints from old 
fans who snipe that theyre selling out 
its all rather silly 
if the musics good it will find an audience but in this case 
the audience wont be terribly large dont tell a soul isnt a 
breakthrough because too many of its songs lack the bite and wit of 
leader paul westerbergs best work whatever the style 
westerbergs a critics darling because he combines the scruffy 
attitude of lower middleclass punk a weary voice roughened by too 
many cigarettes and a keen writers eye that frequently explores 
the vulnerability of himself and others 
his band used to thrash westerbergs songs out in a drunken orgy 
of noise but theyre getting older now slower tempos and acoustic 
guitars are showing up in the replacements repertoire 
westerbergs strengths are used best on the countryflavored 
achin to be about trying to unwrap the mysteries of a woman 
who dances alone in a nightclub 
the album opener talent show is extremely effective in 
capturing the mood of anticipation that comes with a rock show the 
jaunty asking me lies which talks about a mexican bar mitzvah 
and ill be you are also strong 
but songs such as back to back and well inherit the 
earth sound tentative and selfconscious its not the style 
changes its just a lack of strong material and the replacements 
arent adept enough at covering up the lost feeling that comes when 
theyre working on a subpar composition 
despite the occasional flashes dont tell a soul is flat a 
workmanlike album from a band that probably has better days ahead

talk about odd couples one is calm jewish 
and deaf the other is excitable black and blind 
thats the basis for the new comedyadventure see no evil 
hear no evil wally the deaf one is played by gene wilder 
dave who is blind is richard pryor its the third pairing of the 
two disparate stars whose careers and personal lives have had a 
bumpy ride in recent times 
wilder born jerry silberman in milwaukee 53 years ago won an 
academy nomination for mel brooks the producers starred in 
blazing saddles and young frankenstein directed himself in 
the adventures of sherlock holmes smarter brother and the 
worlds greatest lover his film appearances have been few in 
recent times largely because of the illness of his wife the 
comedian gilda radner who has been treated for ovarian cancer 
pryor 48 who grew up in his grandmothers peoria ill brothel 
has starred in headlines almost as much as movies his marriages 
divorces paternity suit neardeath and recovery from burns while 
freebasing have made lively reading he wrote and directed the 
autobiographical jo jo dancer your life is calling his recent 
films have been overshadowed by the new kid on the block eddie 
murphy 
wilder and pryor costarred successfully in silver streak 
and stir crazy before the opening of see no evil hear no 
evil they sat down for a joint interview here are highlights of 
that conversation 
q both of you have directed your own films was there ever a 
time during this movie when you wanted to say hey lets do it 
this way 
pryor arthur hiller directed this picture to me it was just 
amazing how he kept the geometry of the picture in his head he 
always knew something that nobody else knew 
wilder the only thing i wanted to say was thank you thank 
you thank you for staying for the rushes until 930 for eating 
your dinner at 11 and getting to the set before anyone else and 
answering all those questions about the props and the lights and 
costumes thank you for letting me go off when shooting is over 
take my time take a little stroll 
q but you both will direct again yes 
pryor unfortunately yes thats something you dont get over 
its great fun 
wilder yes ill direct again if i write something and i say 
this i will have to direct i will if its personal enough it 
might get lost somewhere otherwise ill let someone else direct 
q what is that magic chemistry that seems to work between you 
two 
wilder weve talked about it believe me but weve said 
lets shut up because we dont know the answer we might get 
in trouble if we tried to intellectualize it 
pryor im just glad it works 
wilder its there it works cold fusion i dont know how or 
why 
q dont you ever get a little bit exasperated with each other 
and say hold it we can do this better 
wilder its not an exasperation with each other its like 
weve done a scene 10 times and everyones anxious to get on to 
the next setup and richard has a sad face i know it wasnt right 
all the way but i see that sad face and i say whats the 
matter i dont think it was so good i dont think so 
either arthur oh arthur he doesnt question that we dont 
think it was there yet 
q gene how would you analyze richards comedy 
wilder i dont know if he should hear this he came up in 
comedy from a different road and we seemed to have met somewhere 
at a similar point but from very different backgrounds i dont 
think it matters much what the path was i laugh at him and i make 
him laugh together were very funny thats the only thing that 
counts 
q richard can you analyze genes comedy 
pryor i want to listen to him i know that i listen to what 
hes saying and it triggers something in me thats one element 
listening to him its a pleasure 
wilder when most actors do a scene 14 times it will be pretty 
much the same each time its not the nature of the art but its 
the nature of the beast if we did a scene 14 times its going 
to be different 14 times not only do you have to pay attention 
youre compelled to pay attention 
q there are a lot of laughs in see no evil hear no evil 
making comic use of deafness and blindness are you worried that 
some people might say youre poking fun at infirmities just as 
they criticized a fish called wanda for making fun of 
stuttering 
wilder we dont think so we took great pains for months before 
the first day of shooting to make sure there would be no fun made 
to make sure that people with seeing and hearing disabilities 
would be laughing 
pryor gene did a lot of research here at the braille institute 
and went through the script to eliminate anything that might be 
offensive he was very aware of it and so was i arthur hiller 
too 
q you did some research of your own richard 
pryor yes i went to the braille institute and studied to find 
out what it would be like if you were blind after being sighted 
most of your life i wanted to find out what not to do and the one 
thing i was told was dont tap your cane little things like 
that were very helpful 
q youve had personal trials gene with gildas illness 
whats the situation now 
wilder gildas got a book coming out in june called its 
always something everything you want to know is in the book 
i didnt work for 2 years or three years when i started working 
on this picture it was a great relief i was back home where i 
belong 
q and you richard you havent been in the public prints 
lately 
pryor good today im a very happy man im thrilled about the 
work weve done in this film i was delighted with the work gene 
did on the script he shares credit with four other writers i 
liked working with an excellent director and very good actors we 
worked hard to make it look like we were not working hard im 
happy 
q what about future projects 
pryor im working in a film now harlem nights with eddie 
murphy 
wilder im writing i want to write something thats right for 
richard and me

composer gian carlo menotti will direct his 
first mozart opera in the united states at this years spoleto 
festival 
the marriage of figaro is already sold out for seven 
performances at the spoleto festival usa in charleston sc 
which runs may 26 through june 11 
however in an interview before leaving for the 13th annual 
festival menotti was more enthusiastic about performances by the 
colla family marionettes 
when i was a child in milan there was a small theater a 
replica of la scala for the colla puppets he said all 
children from milan were dying to go see them on sundays they had 
ballets some were replicas of the 1890s very small 
then they were just forgotten except by gian carlo when i 
started the festival in spoleto italy in 1958 i made an 
investigation about the colla puppets i called up the family and 
said please unpack those puppets and come to spoleto they were 
thrilled to come they are quaint they are like oldfashioned 
dolls they have that charm 
the colla marionettes were a hit at the charleston event in 
1987 this time menotti sought and got sponsorship from cocacola 
about the marriage of figaro the composerconductor said it 
was an opera of love 
all the music is sweet tenderness he said its nothing 
to do with politics the acidity of the beaumarchais play is 
nowhere to be felt at the end everybody is happy 
when he rehearses figaro menotti does the first scene to 
see what the singers can do then jumps to the fourth act 
everybody does the first and second act very well the third a 
little less and they dont direct the fourth act at all 
in my first rehearsals i dont say anything i want to see 
what they do instinctively some all you have to do is guide them 
i like to work with young people you get with stars sometimes you 
have trouble 
his figaro staging wont be eccentric menotti said i go 
straight to the score read what the librettist said see what the 
music tells me to do it may already have been done i dont care 
menotti is acclaimed as an opera director h took over the 
figaro when patrice chereau dropped out for a film commitment 
menotti had declared that hed stage only his own operas after the 
parsifal he directed last summer in trieste 
i love parsifal the opera is about compassion he said 
one thing is so clear in the score parsifal is epileptic 
everytime he talks about his mother he starts to tremble in the 
second act i make him faint he has a tremendous mother complex 
before freud 
the only thing i changed from wagner is the grail is taken 
away at the end parsifal takes the grail and goes out into the 
world for me the grail is the symbol of hope and peace 
otello is an opera in which the title character is usually 
directed as epileptic menotti believes otello suffers instead from 
jealousy youve never been jealous like i have been ive 
suffered jealousy so strong i could have killed 
menottis most recent opera is wedding day composed for the 
olympics in seoul last september and based on a korean legend 
i had chosen a cast in america of koreans he said i was 
only allowed to bring two of them i was in a theater where the 
curtain took a whole minute to go up or down the opera was in six 
scenes so 12 minutes was spent on the curtain 
menotti also ran into cultural problems in nearly every scene 
in the first he had two friends who hadnt seen each other for 
years meet and embrace 
they said they cant touch i had the music passionate and 
the people facing each other with praying hands he said 
in charleston jeanyves thibaudet will give a recital on 
opening night dedicating the festivals new steinway piano from 
germany besides figaro there also is bellinis la 
straniera which was last fully staged in the united states at a 
new york performance in 1834 
there also will be a play chamber music dance and jazz 
menotti is trying to raise money to build a theater near his 
home in scotland its so i wont have to travel around the 
world id like to have a theater outside my door so i can prepare 
my things there all i need is 1 million 
the composer of amahl and the night visitors said that one 
of several commissions he has is for a childrens opera for the 
atlanta symphony 
robert shaw atlanta director wants it for his farewell 
menotti said one is a trio for the chamber music society of 
lincoln center one is a piano concerto 
he also is starting a book to be titled memoirs and 
fantasies 
its going to be like swiss cheese full of holes what i 
cant remember ill make up he said 
but dont look for menotti to get even with anybody i 
think there is nothing worse than being vindictive its one thing 
i want to avoid

the 1980s havent been too kind to phoebe snow 
but then nor have the 70s or any other time 
ive had an incredibly difficult life the song stylist 
says as she lets the world know that phoebe snow is back alive 
and quite well 
i feel a little bit like im in the safety zone things are 
fairly peaceful compared to how theyve been it sort of makes you 
appreciate how tenuous life can be and how fragile and how precious 
im afraid to say that too much afraid the house will fall on 
me when youve been scuffling you dont want to do anything to 
start trouble in the waters again 
snow who describes herself as a former wandering minstrel 
is finding her comeback welcome critics and fans hailed her recent 
performance at the bottom line in new york and her new lp 
something real has received an enthusiastic response its her 
first since rock away in 1981 
the main reason snow hasnt been able to pursue her career 
consistently is because she has been living in new jersey caring 
for her 13yearold daughter valerie who was born severely 
braindamaged 
i have a wonderful woman since november snow says shes 
a blessing from god weve had some notsonice people she 
spoils valerie rotten but thats ok 
to do what i do most efficiently eventually ill have to have 
more than one person to take care of my daughter 
snows husband musician phil kearns left her while valerie was 
still a baby their marriage ended legally in 1979 
her career which quickly took flight in the early 70s slipped 
away just as easily inexperienced in the music business she broke 
a number of contracts with record companies and others and found 
herself embroiled in a number of lawsuits and severe financial 
problems but her career and all other problems have taken a back 
seat to her daughter 
though the 80s havent been easy snow maintains a sense of 
humor 
the busiest live year was 1983 i did almost 90 dates that 
year it was the invisible phoebe snow tour it was the bestkept 
secret pretty low budget not much advertising she said 
it was anybodys guess as to whether wed survive i was ill 
im one of those people who feels quite driven to do things and 
regrets it afterwards ill never forget san francisco i had 
bronchial pneumonia they found a doctor who said dont worry 
ill get her on stage this is not an uncommon story 
i was so sick i was almost crawling on my hands and knees on 
stage i couldnt sing my throat was completely closed up i did a 
comedy routine i thought i better keep talking or im going to 
pass out it was spontaneity based upon desperation everytime i 
looked at the keyboard player he was in tears laughing 
i cant remember one thing i said 
im going to write a book part of it is going to be some of 
the road experiences promoters come up with the doctors youre 
geting the mystery doctor people think this is a glamorous job 
surprise 
last year snow had a hit duet record with dave mason the 
dreams i dream earlier she did a featured background part on 
joe cockers the one the b side of his unchain my heart 
she also gave a number of performances at acme a downtown 
manhattan club a lot of my friends were in the house band every 
wednesday night was blues night nothing was allowed but 12bar 
blues cyndi lauper came down and jammed one night john waite and 
carole king and her daughter sang it was really fun 
at the time her first album phoebe snow and hit single 
poetry man came out in 1974 snow was an insecure person no 
more 
there are turning points in everyones life where you decide 
if youre going to sink or swim my insecurity wasnt serving me 
well at all it was really a stumbling block she said 
you read up on it you watch how other people function 
wallowing in insecurity can be a very tiresome thing for yourself 
and anyone around you im in analysis you dont like the way 
things are working youve got to change them searching your soul 
can also be exhausting 
i want my life to run as smoothly as it can run in this 
business thats a joke 
theres no man in her life now im tired of having failed 
relationships so id prefer not to have any i dont know if i 
came out and said that before im saying it now im saying to all 
the men whove been in my life thank you very much for the 
experience goodbye 
im not conventional or conservative but in that regard i 
always thought id live with a man who was my friend and partner in 
life i believe i will meet a nice man and settle down thats 
something im striving for im not ready yet 
snow took a visualization course to help her reorganize her life 
you close your eyes relax your body and see how your life is 
now juxtaposed with how youd like it to be we practiced it every 
week there was a lot of humor in it she said 
a good percentage of what i visualized is happening now you 
can say it would have happened anyhow but i would recommend 
visualization for one thing it takes your mind off everything 
else

inside her house of glass joyce carol oates 
lives to haunt her readers writing books with all the anguish of 
thomas hardy and all the breadth of dickens 
outside her glasswalled house in princeton nj theres a 
different oates one who makes fewer demands one who really wants 
to be liked 
oates surprised her audience at a recent literary reading at 
russell sage college in troy just north of albany the audience 
knew of oates fascination with doubles and alter egos they also 
wondered how one writer could churn out two or more hefty books a 
year while teaching and lecturing but hearing her on stage they 
thought there really might be two joyce carol oates and that night 
they got the funny one 
she began with a terse cryptic piece that was over before the 
audience had a chance to really tune in there was a silence a few 
coughs no one was sure if literary etiquette allowed them to 
applaud 
if that means nothing to you youre very lucky oates said 
before moving on to a slightly longer piece i feel youre 
getting strength now and can handle longer work 
later when the audience did applaud she thanked them but 
added i assume youre applauding to hurry me up 
the audience had come to hear the bookish 50yearold princeton 
professor who has published 50 works since 1963 harsh and 
haunting and lyrical books in which used furniture salesmen fall 
victim to mccarthyism and suicide is always an option 
instead they saw a lanky woman who told funny stories 
when she first started publishing she submitted stories under 
the name jc oates 
i had the erroneous idea it was a world inhospitable to women 
writers she said editors would assume jc oates was a man 
maybe they were right in some symbolic way 
that leads to her fascination with doubles the worst day of her 
life was caused by her alter ego or the double who undone me 
oates says the double is rosamond smith the pseudonym she adopted 
to publish last years novel lives of the twins oates didnt 
tell her agent or her publisher ep dutton both were peeved 
i just wanted a new identity kind of a freshness to have a 
book come out where nobody was comparing it to other books she 
said in an interview you cant escape your identity thats very 
frustrating 
lives of the twins deals with twin brothers whose polar 
personalities merge as they fight for the same woman oates has 
written a second novel as rosamond smith being happily published 
by dutton which centers again on doubles soul mate due out 
this spring is about a princetontype professor involved with her 
opposite a charming ted bundyish psychopathic killer 
her latest novel american appetites takes place in a 
fictional town in new yorks lower hudson valley the setting is a 
camouflaged princeton and the main characters live in the same 
glasswalled house oates shares with her husband raymond smith 
like all her writing american appetites has an intensity 
and ferocity that disturbs readers the main character ian 
mccullough is tried for manslaughter in the accidental death of hi 
wife 
had he really thought she would be returned to him and their 
life would continue as always as if nothing had happened 
seizing her shoulders as he had in a paroxysm of murderous rage 
and throwing her backward helplessly backward into death into a 
sheet of glass 
a princeton colleague has called oates the fourth bronte sister 
while john updike suggested oates was born 100 years too late that 
she belonged amid a race of victorian wordeaters 
she has i fear rather overwhelmed the puny parsimonious 
critical establishment of this country updike writes 
she won the national book award for her novel them 
received the o henry prize for continuing achievement in the short 
story and is a perpetual nobel prize candidate 
even so critics complain about the complexity of oates work 
and her handling of traditionally male subjects shes been accused 
of writing like a man even of writing too much 
if theres a question oates hates its why so much 
violence in her novel wonderland a father kills his family 
before shooting himself in expensive people a young son plans 
suicide by gorging himself after killing his mother in 
bellefleur a vulture flies off with a bleeding baby in its 
talons and the heirapparent of a dynastic clan wipes out his 
family by crashing an airplane into their castle 
so why so much violence 
most writers have violence in their fiction oates says citing 
former princeton colleague el doctorows novel billy 
bathgate about gangster dutch schultz 
its much more violent than anything ive written she said 
but i notice in the reviews that doctorow gets theres never 
any mention of that i think thats because hes a male writer 
theres violence in oates ancestry oates grandfather died in 
a tavern brawl and her greatgrandfather killed himself after 
trying to shoot his wife 
oates grew up just outside the erie canal town of lockport ny 
her father frederic was an autoworker and signpainter her 
mother carolina a housewife 
fred oates a former amateur boxer got his daughter interested 
in boxing when he took her to golden gloves matches in buffalo in 
the 1950s the interest revived when she researched her novel 
you must remember this leading her to a friendship with 
heavyweight champ mike tyson and to ringside commentary at fights 
oates also wrote a booklength essay on boxing examining the 
sport not so much as athletics but as drama or dance 
felix stevick a character in you must remember this is a 
boxer oates research makes her feel as if shes been in the ring 
herself 
i really had to be in that mind that would naturally think 
like a boxer so i just imbued myself with it she said it was 
as if i had a lifetime partly as felix stevick 
filmmaker martin scorsese who memorialized boxer jake lamotta 
in raging bull has optioned the movie version of you must 
remember this 
as rosamond smith oates writes simpler tales of suspense books 
that might win her broader appeal but she doesnt believe shell 
ever have a huge following 
i dont think i could be a popular writer she said my 
writings too difficult bellefleur was a best seller but my 
secret feeling is that people bought the book and couldnt finish 
it

for country music singer david stewart 
nothing will ever beat how he was given a guest spot on the grand 
ole opry he walked 1600 miles 
stewart at age 37 spent about three months last year walking 
from wyoming to nashville to try to impress opry officials how much 
he wanted to sing on the fabled country music show he left his 
home in gillette wyo on april 30 and arrived in nashville july 
22 having lost 25 pounds and worn out three pairs of walking shoes 
as a reward the opry gave him a onetime guest shot on the show 
and he sang two songs last july 23 
we all have dreams he says looking back on his ambitious 
adventure a year later but not all of them come true mine did 
since his walk and the opry performance he has moved to 
nashville he has taken voice lessons pursued a songwriting career 
and made a music video about his trek 
if nothing else happens ive fulfilled my dream he said in 
an interview theres not a thing i can complain about 
stewart who has been singing country music most of his adult 
life walked through wyoming nebraska iowa missouri illinois 
and kentucky before reaching his destination 
accompanied by his dog snicker he averaged 22 miles a day six 
days a week a friend followed him in a motor home where he slept 
except for occasional complimentary lodging that was offered 
the chamber of commerce in a couple of places arranged for a 
room and a hot bath he recalled that was nice 
after reaching nashville he placed a call to opry manager hal 
durham who had heard about the walk through news reports 
stewart born and raised in bradenton fla recounted the 
conversation he said i understand you walked 1600 miles to be 
on the opry thats a long way son i said yes sir 
durham then invited him to sing the next night and stewart sang 
in the wings of the grand ole opry and jambalaya 
i had all the emotions of excitement and anxiety he 
recalled i hear the recording of that night and i can hear that 
i was on the edge of breaking up i have to pinch myself to realize 
its true i still get chills when i think about it 
he was received warmly by the audience after finishing his first 
song and did an encore 
he decided not to return to his job in wyoming at a fast food 
restaurant which he partly owned but he still realizes income from 
it which has helped him to meet expenses while trying to further 
his singing career in nashville 
for the first couple of months here i just unwound he 
said i gathered my thoughts and figured out where i was going 
with my career 
he has visited backstage at the opry but not performed any more 
i realize its for established stars stewart said 
he has not pursued a recording contract preferring to finish 
the video which he plans to use as a selling point for a contract 
with a major label in case a music career doesnt pan out hes 
passed the exam for a real estate license 
i found people here receptive but its still hard to break in 
because theres so much talent here he said its a matter of 
getting the right breaks at the right time and meeting the right 
people 
i still dont feel like ive broken in in a big way my 
biggest dream has come true singing on the opry now i intend to 
work hard to become a regular member of the opry i want to be 
able to walk on that stage many more times 
most of the 25 pounds he lost on his walk have returned to his 
tanned frame 
my wife tells me every day i need to get this weight off he 
said i have a weakness for catfish that fried food will put it 
on you

nurses salaries are beginning to improve in response to the 
critical nursing shortage 
salary increases during l988 averaged 69 percent for 
entrylevel nurses and 106 percent for more experienced nursing 
staff reports richard mckibbin who handles research for the 
american nurses association in kansas city 
advancement opportunities flexible scheduling tuition 
assistance and other enticements also are being brought into play 
to help hospitals replenish their nursing staffs 
about 165000 jobs were open for registered nurses at the 
beginning of l989 according to the secretarys commission on 
nursing of the department of health and human services 
the recent wage settlement for nurses at new yorks 
columbiapresbyterian hospital may be a harbinger the hospital 
agreed to raise starting salaries for nurses to 31500 and nurses 
with more than 20 years experience will receive 47000 the pact 
negotiated with the new york state nurses association eliminates 
both mandatory overtime and assignment of nurses outside their 
specialties some of the money to pay for the settlement will come 
from new york state which recently set aside 193 million to 
increase nursing salaries statewide for the year 
the settlement for the first time addresses nurses as 
professionals said sheila orourke columbiapresbyterian nurse 
as the agreement was made 
the figures are well above the 22416 entrylevel and 32160 
senior nurse averages for l988 reported by the ana spokeswoman 
carol grimaldi says these figures are still more realistic for most 
of the country which doesnt share the high cost of living with 
metropolitan centers on both coasts 
specialist nurses like anesthetists can expect salaries 
averaging slightly more than 45000 per year says mary jeannette 
mannino president of the american association of nurse anethetists 
in park ridge ill starting salaries for anesthetist nurses is 
estimated at between 31000 and 40000 
the money didnt make any difference at the time i chose nurse 
anesthesia but it does make a difference now and i think it 
should make a difference says margaret faut associate 
chairperson of surgical nursing at rush presbyterian st lukes 
medical center in chicago personally i think salary should be 
a consideration in making career choices 
im a single parent with two children and im thankful that i 
have this career you dont want to pick a profession because the 
pay is good but it doesnt hurt either 
the university hospital consortium inc a network of 48 
notforprofit teaching hospitals and clinics has launched a 
recruitment campaign that emphasizes improved pay advancement and 
working conditions 
by and large todays nurses look for more than a steady 
income says kristi kelsey a nursing personnel specialist and rn 
who directs uhcs recruitment network based in oakbrook terrace 
ill they want opportunities to progress through their work to 
the point where they can specialize manage conduct research or 
teach 
she says that many of the teaching hospitals are offering nurses 
continuing education for advancement tuition reimbursement 
nursing rounds and indepth orientation and internships 
in light of a steadily growing population of older americans 
expanding medical technology and the greater incidence of 
catastrophic diseases we will need more not fewer nurses as we 
enter the next century kelsey says 
the shortage is letting experienced nurses pick and choose 
exactly what they are looking for she says 
salaries for nurses have risen faster than for any other 
profession during the past year says dr carol a brooks vice 
president for nursing at long island jewish medical center in new 
hyde park ny at last the moneys getting there to provide a 
lifestyle to go with a busy professional life

judi devins career ladder had hit a ceiling 
joan lieb needed more rewards from her job 
their reasons were different but the result was the same both 
women decided to start their own businesses 
and their numbers are growing both in people and in profits 
an estimated 5 million women now own businesses in the united 
states says the chicagobased national association of women 
business owners 
statistics compiled by the association show women contributed 
250 billion to the economy in 1988 of that 37 billion went into 
the us treasury and 13 billion into state and local coffers 
devin who serves as a spokeswoman for the association says 
women are starting businesses at three to five times the rate of 
their male counterparts many of the new female entrepreneurs 
entered the corporate world in the 1970s she said in a recent 
interview 
these women were the most educated in history she added 
many were feeling frustrated for not being allowed to reach their 
full potential in a business sense and started looking for 
alternatives 
that condition is known as the glass ceiling and its a 
condition devin herself knows well 
in 1975 she was the first woman manager in her division at one 
of the countrys largest computer and data service companies but 
four years later she felt her options were not as many as i 
would have liked 
so she started her own minneapolis company medium well done 
which designs and develops instructional projects and now her list 
of international clients includes her former bosses 
lieb was unhappy at a large chicago real estate company so in 
1980 with five other women she founded beliard gordon amp partners 
a residential real estate company 
she and her partners felt their takehome pay should have been 
increased as their sales volume increased something their 
previous company did not offer so they decided to work for 
themselves 
we sell homes from 50000 to 2 million and we lead all the 
other real estate companies in the area in the sale of single 
family homes lieb said 
she said the firm sold 140 million in residential property in 
1988 though she would not give profit figures 
ironically lieb said most of the top producers in residential 
real estate sales are women one reason all but one of the firms 
25 sales associates also are women 
buying or selling a home is an emotional experience she 
said sometimes its done in the worst period of life for the 
customer who many times is buying or selling because of 
relocation divorce or death 
we are dealing with people at a time of upheaval you have to 
be sensitive we are not dealing with just two bedrooms and a bath 
which is why women are good at it 
and the increasing number of women business owners serves as an 
incentive to other women 
peggy leonard president of the 14yearold national association 
of women business owners says the organization offers forums for 
women to ask questions and give advice in running businesses 
ms leonard who operates computer training and support services 
in lake geneva ill says many of the women in the organization 
came from the corporate world though the group does not keep track 
of the reasons its members start their own companies 
we like our remedy which is business ownership ms leonard 
said 
the association is involved in extensive lobbying in congress on 
issues affecting women business owners and it helped convince 
congress to approve the women business ownershp act last year 
that law requires the federal government to collect data on 
femaleowned businesses something not done in the past 
the bill also allows the small business administration to give 
out loans and it established a task force look into problems faced 
by womenowned businesses 
however congress dropped a provision that would have created a 
government outreach program to bring womenowned businesses into 
federal contract procurement 
government had 200 billion in procurement contracts last 
year ms devin said womens businesses got less than 1 
percent 
access to us contracts is a big negative added ms 
leonard there is much inequality 
she noted that the government never has had an outreach program 
to encourage womenowned businesses to obtain government contracts 
in addition women are not traditionally in the circle in 
which such contracts are obtained ms leonard said 
there is an old boy network but that is starting to change

editors a version of this story previously appeared on the 
wire 
cambridge mass ap what makes a successful entrepreneur a 
recent massachusetts institute of technology survey reports that 
many are immigrants the offspring of selfemployed parents and 
hold advanced degrees 
the survey of 99 graduates recently honored by the university 
gives some insight into people who give up the security of salaries 
and take risks to start their own businesses 
the honored graduates include sociology consultants financial 
managers and computer technicians singled out for their hard 
work foresight and courage 
collectively they have created 100000 jobs in massachusetts 
and 250000 worldwide in fields that range from womens apparel to 
geotechnical engineering the cumulative sales of their companies 
total 25 billion annually 
according to the survey 73 percent earned a degree above the 
bachelor level and 33 percent went on to doctoral or postdoctoral 
work 
sixteen percent started their companies while they were still at 
school 34 percent set up shop within five years of graduating and 
23 percent opened for business between six and 10 years after 
graduation two percent began their companies more than 20 years 
after graduation 
the survey said more than half were children of parents who 
founded their own companies 
many companies had inauspicious beginnings in basements or rough 
neighborhoods with minimal staff and equipment but some of the 
entrepreneurs had more colorful starts 
clark abt founder of the social sciences consulting firm abt 
associates built ship models and sold them to saks fifth avenue 
when he was only 12 harold doc edgerton whom the institute 
called the father of flash photography attempted to market his 
first strobe equipment through general electric co but ge wasnt 
interested 
the most important lessons they learned at mit the 
entrepreneurs said were problem solving the importance of hard 
work confidence and the belief that anything is possible 
the entrepreneurs recommended that aspiring business owners 
begin by identifying a market opportunity and matching it with an 
appropriate technology they advised selecting partners with 
talents that complement their own pointing out that the success of 
the enterprise depends on employee performance

corporate managers may have themselves to blame 
for the secretary shortage says the president of one of the 
countrys biggest business schools 
management needs to understand what it takes to attract and 
keep intelligent people as secretaries says eleanor p vreeland 
president of katharine gibbs school inc managers have to 
recognize secretaries as an integral and productive part of their 
team and include them in the planning and goals of the business 
this will make secretaries feel like they have a direct link to the 
success of the business and will in turn reduce secretarial 
turnover 
there are 3 million secretaries in the united states 
representing the largest single part of the office work force 
salaries range from about 15000 to 30000 a year for this 
predominantly female profession 984 percent yet about 80000 
secretarial jobs a year remain unfilled the bureau of labor 
statistics projects that 400000 new secretaries will be needed in 
the coming decade making them the eleventh largest job category 
overall 
vreeland says the reason for high secretarial turnover is 
because so many managers dont consider the secretary part of the 
managerial team even though the average secretary shoulders more 
administrative responsibility and must have higher technical skill 
than she did five years ago 
by the l990s we hope the secretarial profession is what gibbs 
always envisioned it to be the secretary as a true part of the 
management team 
vreeland recommends that the manager improve his or her 
relationship with the secretary by conferring regularly about 
priorities keeping her informed about changes using her as a 
sounding board asking her to attend meetings and challenging her 
to grow through new assignments

in this era of corporate 
downsizing and entrepreneurial uprising the second career may be 
the norm 
were beginning to see changes in the way the working economy 
is structured with more people leaving the corporate environment 
and going into smaller businesses or into business for 
themselves says placement specialist phyllis macklin i dont 
have any figures for it but it is a dramatic shift 
the average person usually changes jobs five times in his work 
life she observes 
ms macklin a partner in minsuk macklin stein amp associates of 
princeton junction specializes in outplacement most often working 
with people who have lost their jobs in corporate cutbacks but 
many of her clients are employees who initiate change themselves 
they know they want to move but they cant quite figure out what 
they want to do they want to be sure they make a good move 
both the fired and the restless employee face changes in fields 
income and attitudes ms macklin says 
she encourages the terminated employee to look at his new 
situation positively if he has the resources to hold up for a 
while that person has the opportunity to look backward as well as 
forward very often that person will find that what he was doing 
was not as satisfying as it should have been he can now look at 
the future at what can be new and different 
many people she says arent even aware of the changes theyve 
already made in their work lives for example someone who worked 
for one company for 20 years may have started as an engineer then 
moved on to project management and other activities in which 
engineering was no longer the primary function 
she says that those who change fields often discover that their 
income level drops at least for a while but since the changes 
frequently occur at midlife when children are educated and out of 
the nest the financial demands are not as high people at this 
stage are in a better position to take risks 
highly paid executives may come to recognize that theyre 
looking for something else they begin to think of what they want 
for themselves personally while the salaries were wonderful to 
maintain they way they lived theyd have to keep it flowing their 
values change 
some people shift to a selfemployed or entrepreneurial status 
because they truly enjoy independence ms macklin says but if a 
stillangry dismissed employee says he want to be on his own 
because he says hell never work for a company again she tries to 
discourage him 
we have to get him to look for something to go to rather than 
something to escape from 
being let go by a large corporation is especially painful 
because corporate culture has encouraged the idea of loyalty 
the feeling of family the security the trappings the idea of 
going to the office 
very often when people start their jobs they think of the 
company they dont think of their careers as something apart 
these people need to become attuned to the business not the 
corporate environment 
that business environment she observes is one that is 
demanding higher skill from employees and is forcing them to change

for pat swift it was a textbook case of being in the right 
place at the right time 
cruising the aisles at bloomingdales a new york fashion mecca 
her blond good looks and her 185pound frame would have been hard 
to miss a clothing manufacturer with a line of largesized 
fashions spotted her and asked if she would model for an ad 
at that moment her professional path took a 360degree turn 
she knew right away that she wanted a modeling career she accepted 
the offer immediately and shes never regretted it 
until then she planned a career in criminal justice and had 
taken a store detective job at bloomingdales waiting for a 
probation service slot to become available 
you have to know how you feel about what you want to do you 
have to follow your gut she says 
one of the first things she discovered along this new path was 
that there were no fashion modeling agencies for largesized women 
and that she wanted to start one 
there was no turning back i got the business incorporated and 
rented an office 
that was 11 years ago today her firm plus models has annual 
billings of over 2 million and represents 70 largesized models 
the success reflects manufacturers realization that large women 
want fashionable clothes and that they constitute a large part of 
the market 
she says she relishes the responsibility of managing and the 
network of other attractive large women shes discovered as a 
result of her work i happen to enjoy working with women she 
says 
in her opinion the field has room for expansion she says 
manufacturers could offer yet more variety to the largesized 
customer 
her advice to anyone who encounters an unexpected opportunity is 
to follow ones instincts people should learn to trust 
themselves 
 
more than 20 years ago mildred kramer was a typical los angeles 
housewife tapping out figures with an adding machine to help her 
husband an accountant during overload periods 
without realizing it she was laying the groundwork for a 5 
million business helping corporations the same way except on a 
larger scale 
in l969 with her husbands encouragement she began processing 
payments for some local businesses including a hospital within 
two years she had a fully incorporated business 
alpha beta data services inc the business she founded now 
processes rent and food checks mortgage payments and other 
transactions for such firms as bank of america security pacific 
first interstate imperial bank general telephone exxon and other 
corporations the checks come in from consumers to post office 
lockboxes and mrs kramers firm working around the clock 
records and processes them speedily by computer 
its the small companies like ours who will prosper in the 
90s by seeking the niche that corporations find costly and 
burdensome mrs kramer says

career 
back up your fine arts specialty with liberal arts and solid 
business and scientific studies advise fine arts educators the 
first interview you face will be designed to discover if you can 
function in the commercial world 
indeed the artist is also an entrepreneur says a wesley 
tower dean of the college of fine arts at millikin university in 
decatur ill theres no shortage of talent what we have to do 
is help students develop the skills they need to be successful 
artists as well as men and women 
millikin is typical of many universities in insisting on strong 
liberal arts and practical studies to augment fine arts major 
programs students can major in studio or fine arts art therapy 
art management and commercial and computer art but they must 
complete at least 35 hours of liberal arts courses for their 
degrees 
at columbia college in columbia mo art majors must complete 
programs including the same general education requirements as other 
majors a liberal arts background is essential for an artist 
says ben cameron associate professor of art artists too must 
be wellread and know how to write otherwise you get technically 
good students who have no ideas 
dr wayne kirby chairman of the music department of the 
university of north carolina at asheville also backs liberal arts 
for his students we want students who can communicate and think 
critically students must understand their place in history as far 
as art goes otherwise you have students who just know how to push 
buttons 
unca students can major in music and recording but they must 
take math physics and computer science to get their degrees 
theater students at duke university in durham nc can get 
practical grounding in the profession now that the university 
theater is being used for previews of broadwaybound commercial 
productions during the previews of franz kafkas 
metamorphosis marking ballet star mikhail baryshnikovs 
dramatic debut duke theater management majors sat in on phone 
calls and reviewed contracts for the production students also were 
involved in set design and as understudies for the play 
moonlight and valentino written by neil simons daughter ellen 
david ball dukes director of drama says that these activities 
help students learn about theater as it really is 
and at millikin music students also work in real performances 
starting as soon as they arrive on campus by joining any of 36 
performing groups some of these perform nationally 
last winter several millikin students were invited to perform

the small illinois community of 
effingham population 12000 decided two years ago to stop its 
brain drain losing its youngsters to the big cities 
effingham area businesses last year found themselves being 
interviewed by high school students to identify career 
opportunities and resource needs the students surveyed over 100 
local employers to find out what job categories existed and what 
the educational requirements are 
the aboutface was part of a program dubbed project 
opportunity an economic development program for high school 
seniors started by city officials in l987 they made a financial 
commitment as well aimed at creating or finding existing 
qualitycareer opportunities for the citys young people 
students also have designed brochures produced marketing 
videos written pitch letters and contacted corporate presidents 
and ceos to lure new businesses into this rural area 
as a result the students are sharply attuned to the business 
climate in their own backyard and theyve made recommendations 
about the kinds of companies theyd like to see in effingham 
architectural and computer processing services are examples of 
firms they say theyd like to work for in the future 
the payoff of the program may not develop for several years but 
nw bud althoff the citys industrial commission chairman 
says the project is worthwhile already because it has given 
students business awareness and marketing skills and he says if 
nothing else it will make students take a closer look at what their 
own city has to offer

despite rapid changes in the job market 
americans can make the most of their career opportunities by 
developing transferrable skills says the director of career 
services at the university of rochester 
many people ignore or underestimate their skills says jim

communication and persuasion the ability fo write and present 
reports to others or to instruct others 
research and investigation including writing research papers or

the urge to do good in the world still 
lives among young university graduates according to a college 
career specialist 
our top college seniors are looking for experience the 
opportunity to explore to be involved in something significant 
says barbarajan wilson director of career planning at wesleyan 
university in middletown 
the image of egocentric moneydriven college students doesnt 
match the reality ms wilson says the real students that i work 
with are struggling very hard to strike a balance in their lives 
ms wilson says that when she ran a career option workshop for 
twoyear financial analysts at an investment brokerage firm last 
year most of the questions centered on how the analysts could get 
into teaching or the peace corps 
they want to do something that really matters yet they want to 
be able to pay off their college loans and make enough to send 
their own children to college she says 
at a time when it costs 65000 to get an education at one of 
the top ivytinged schools a student may graduate with more than 
12000 of debt it seems impossible for graduates in this 
situation to take volunteer positions in appalachia or the inner 
city for 100 a month yet they do it all the time 
one of the healthiest trends shes found among students is 
postponement of career choices until a year or two after graduation 
how can a 21yearold know he or she wants to be a doctor a 
lawyer an actor it is more honest more difficult and more worthy 
of praise to admit i have no idea what i want to do for the rest 
of my life and plunge into counseling battered women in new york 
city teaching english to the japanese in kyoto traveling to the 
himalayas with a sleeping bag serving in africa for the peace 
corps or experiencing the excitement and drama of the world of wall 
street firsthand 
i predict this generation will not be consumed by the midlife 
career crisis they are doing their thinking now

welding one of the older skills of civilization 
is also a sure bet for the future 
skilled welders are almost an endangered species and the 
shortage of welders and welding engineers means security and 
advancement for those who choose this field according to the 
american welding society 
welders are leaving or retiring at an annual rate of nearly 18 
percent with a severely inadequate number of replacements coming 
along in our schools today says john m gerken president of the

nearly three to one 
the society projects the shortage well into the next century 
and that will positively affect salary and advancement gerken says 
that welders currently earn from 10 to 25 per hour depending on 
their skills and the locations a welding engineer with a fouryear 
college degree can expect to start at about 30000 a year 
the options for welders is wide too gerken says many welders 
can become engineers educators designers researchers or managers 
as they add to their education and experience 
thought to be about 6000 years old the welding profession 
today covers major and basic industries such as aerospace 
automotive construction electronics metalwork nuclear power and 
shipbuilding the fields newer technologies include working with 
lasers microjoining plasmas and robotics 
gerken says that the potential welder should have good 
mechanical aptitude mathematical skills a logical mind 
imagination and the ability to work as a team member education 
requirements range from high school vocational courses to college

four mcdonough says that family would need 62116 to maintain its 
standard of living in a high cost area like boston but if the 
family moved to baton rouge it could live as well at 44020 a 
company should expect to pay more through costofliving

batus inc announced monday its earnings 
rose 15 percent in 1988 as its brown amp williamson tobacco corp 
subsidiary enjoyed record high sales 
batus which also has interests in retailing paper products and 
insurance said it earned 535 million up from 4662 million in 
1987 
the company the us arm of the british firm bat industries 
plc said it had revenue of 63 billion up from 583 billion the 
year before 
the company did not announce its pershare earnings 
in december batus achieved its longterm goal of entering the 
financial services market by acquiring farmers group inc for 52 
billion however the insurance companys 1988 income figures were 
not incorporated into the batus income statement contained in the 
companys annual report 
the report said brown amp williamson the thirdlargest cigarette 
manufacturer in the united states had record sales of 28 
billion an 11 percent increase from 1987 with operating income up 
6 percent to 651 million 
the company said the gains represented continued development in 
the international and domestic cigarette market 
appleton papers inc a leading producer of carbonless paper 
increased sales 8 percent to 844 million while operating income 
was 131 million a gain of almost 4 percent 
despite intensified competition and sluggish consumer spending 
batus retailing companies saks fifth avenue marshall fields 
iveys and breuners achieved modest profit gains from 1987 the 
company reported total retail sales were up 3 percent to 26 
billion with operating income advancing 3 percent to 177 million 
sales at saks fifth avenue were particularly strong in the new 
york and florida markets including the flagship fifth avenue 
store the company said marshall fields had a record year 
increasing its market share in chicago and positioning itself for 
additional growth the batus statement said 
the buyout of the farmers group was the latest portion of a 
diversification plan batus initiated in the early 1970s according 
to the annual report under that plan the business has grown from 
a single tobacco company to several leading corporations in four 
key industries 
nearly all of batus sales came from tobacco in the early 1970s 
but nontobacco operations accounted for almost 40 percent of the 
companys sales by 1980 
the nontobacco operations were responsible for 56 percent of 
batus sales in 1988 the company said and that figure should grow 
still higher when farmers groups sales are included in the 
companys 1989 report 
batus employs 55000 in the united states

representatives from three states and a canadian 
province are forming a task force to prevent or minimize a disaster 
in their waters similar to the massive exxon oil spill in alaska 
officials from alaska washington oregon and british columbia 
all have separate regulations and laws governing oil shipments 
through their waters as well as different plans for responding to 
oil emergencies 
members of the newly formed oil spill task force say a regional 
approach is more effective than each of the four governments 
working alone 
they plan to meet tuesday to coordinate policies 
were all speaking in one voice said carolyn young of 
oregons department of environmental quality a member of the group 
the group may recommend changing state provincial and federal 
laws to help prevent spills said greg sorlie program manager for 
washingtons department of ecology 
the regional approach has already been effective in putting 
pressure on the exxon corp since more than 10 million gallons was 
spilled into prince william sound on march 24 said rick wilson 
director of planning and assessment for the british columbia 
ministry of environment 
combined efforts by the four jurisdictions made it remarkably 
easy to demand that exxon drain all the oil from the exxon valdez 
before taking it to portland ore for repairs young said 
the leverage of the four governments when combined is greater 
than when each works alone wilson said 
task force members also plan to share information on ways to 
recover costs and damages and technology for coping with spills 
one item on the agenda tuesday is a demonstration of oil removal 
equipment by clean sound a cleanup consortium of oil and 
transportation companies in puget sound 
wilson said government and public pressure could be a moral 
force to encourage a better cleanup response 
exxon is seeing governments and the public saying certain 
standards are required he said 
the first meeting occurred shortly after the spill and involved 
only officials from british columbia and washington alaska and 
oregon were invited to join soon afterward 
the task force was formed by washington gov booth gardner and 
british columbia premier william vander zalm after an oil spill in 
december off the central washington coast

on most lists you might be inclined to choose 
from the top heres one where youd have been much better off 
choosing from the bottom 
its the fortune 500 list of the largest industrial companies 
had you invested in the 15 smallest companies on that list in 
the period 1975 through 1988 youd have increased your investment 
more than 14 times had you chosen the 15 biggest your return would 
have been 85 times 
the test was conducted by gerald perritt former mathematics 
professor and now chairman of the chicagobased investment 
information services and publisher or investment horizons a 
newsletter 
for years even before he became an investment adviser perritt 
has been perhaps the leading supporter of the thesis that 
investments in smaller stocks may contain a premium over the 
returns available from their bigger cousins 
various explanations have been offered wellmanaged smaller 
companies are likely to be entrepreneurial sometimes even being 
run by the founders their size alone offers greater potential for 
percentage increases 
but one of perritts key findings was that smaller companies 
tend to be undervalued because they arent closely followed by 
analysts and do not receive equal publicity 
however as they grow and become more visible that situation 
becomes rectified more brokerage house and other analysts follow 
the company and institutional investments begin thus changing the 
valuation of the shares 
continuing his research perritt a few years ago matched 
investments of stocks at the top and at the bottom of the fortune 
list and found the smaller companies outreturned the giants by 
more than two to one 
with that study now more than three years old he decided to 
update his research with a hypothetical portfolio of the 15 largest 
and 15 smallest companies on each fortune list from 1975 through 
1988 
each year he revised the two portfolios according to changes in 
the list selling those that disappeared and adding the newcomers 
he rebalanced each portfolio so that an equal dollar amount was 
committed to each stock 
results capital and dividends for the 15 smallest totaled 1338 
percent in 14 years the total return for the 15 largest was 752 
percent both portfolios beat the 491 percent return of the 
standard amp poors 500stock index 
assume a total investment of 10000 at the end of 14 years you 
would have had 59100 in the sampp 500 index 85200 in the 15 
largest companies and 143800 in the 15 smaller companies 
perritt concedes that none of the companies involved was small 
in this test the median equity of the 15 biggest was 245 billion 
and that of the smallest 306 million a figure that still is 
quite large to perritt a small company has less than 90 million 
in equity capitalization 
nevertheless the smaller companies in his test did fit the 
large versus small thesis that is companies at the top of the 
list had a large percentage of shares held by institutions and a 
small share held by management while the reverse was true for the 
smaller companies at the bottom of the list 
the implication he states is that when you are assembling a 
portfolio of largefirm stocks you should select the common stocks 
of relatively smaller and less visible companies 
by concentrating on these companies he says largecompany 
common stock investors will be able to enhance total investment 
returns by a significant amount over the long run

anticipated expenses related to the companys proposed chapter 11 
reorganization under which robins will be acquired by the new 
yorkbased american home products corp for 32 billion 
robins filed for chapter 11 protection in 1985 in the face of 
thousands of injury claims by women who used its dalkon shield 
birth control device the merger plan with american home includes a 
25 billion trust fund to settle those claims 
the reorganization plan was confirmed by a federal judge in july 
1988 and is now awaiting a decision by the 4th circuit court of

metric tons of us wheat

senate investigators say some oil firms have 
cheated indians and the interior department out of millions of 
dollars of oil and oil royalties 
investigators worked for six months to obtain evidence extending 
back almost 10 years said sens dennis deconcini dariz and 
john mccain rariz 
they said the names of the companies would be revealed at 
hearings beginning tuesday by the special investigative unit of 
the senate select committee on indian affairs which deconcini 
heads 
the senators said that the oil companies under investigation 
arent among the top seven corporations they are independent 
multimilliondollar middlelevel companies the senators added 
earl ross spokesman for the american petroleum institute said 
none of the companies involved are members of his organization the 
largest oil trade association in the country he said the institute 
supplied the committee with technical information on how to measure 
oil 
deconcini said committees staff examined 700000 pages of 
subpoenaed documents he said undercover investigators went into 
the oil fields and saw theft taking place 
mccain said millions of dollars in royalities are not going to 
the rightful people he and sen tom daschle dsd are the other 
two members of the special investigative committee 
to a poor native american being deprived of only a few 
dollars is significant mccain said 
deconcini said some of the committees findings will be turned 
over the justice department 
ken ballen chief counsel for the committee said two issues are 
involved one is actual theft of oil from wells the other is 
underpayment of royalties 
its a sophisticated kind of theft said ballen he said 
that companies mismeasure the amount of oil they take and are 
able to get away with it because the areas are so remote that 
nobody is watching 
deconcini said investigators hid behind bushes to observe the 
theft taking place 
mccain said the goal of the committee is to determine how well 
the federal government is fufilling its responsibility to the 
indians 
our job is to review policies programs and management so we 
can recommend changes so problems wont happen again he said 
in february the special committee held three weeks of hearings 
focusing on contracting fraud child abuse and organized crime on 
indian reservations and among those doing business with them 
the senators said that they will spend this week on oil 
companies and next week on problems within the indian health 
service 
both senators said the hearings on the health service would 
reveal gross mismanagement 
deconcini called the federal agencys approach to indian health 
care a tragedy of all tragedies 
he said the standard at the health service was less than the 
norm for the nation 
deconcini said he expected to have a report on all of the

exxon must put more crews to work if it 
hopes to meet its september deadline to clean up shores fouled by 
the nations largest oil spill a top coast guard officer testified 
today 
vice adm clyde robbins told a fivemember us house interior 
subcommittee investigating the spill and its cleanup that it 
appears they need to expand their resources in order to meet the 
fall completion 
he described the spill as one of the worst economic and 
environmental calamities this nation has faced 
robbins is directly responsible for coordinating the cleanup 
reporting to coast guard commandant paul a yost jr president 
bushs emissary to the spill site 
on monday the states top environmental official testified that 
exxon stalled in its response to the spill and gave bad 
information the panel also heard from fishermen who said they fear 
their multimilliondollar catch in prince william sound will be 
reduced this season because of the spill 
weve been told weve been emphatically told that were 
going to have a normal fishery this summer were going to have 
anything but a normal fishery ken adams of the cordova district 
fishermen united said sunday 
adams said the state could put a large portion of the sound 
offlimits when the commercial salmon season begins may 15 the 
state has not yet set any limits while it monitors the spills 
movements 
at an estimated 84 million prince william sound has the 
nations eighthlargest commercial fishing industry adams said 
about 85 percent of the catch is salmon 
riki ott a member of the cordova groups board of directors 
said the fishing industry has long been fearful of a spill cordova 
is a fishing town on the edge of the sound about 50 miles from 
valdez which is the terminal for the transalaska pipeline 
we knew we were playing with russian roulette she said 
dennis kelso commissioner of the state department of 
environmental conservation questioned exxons statements that it 
could have more effectively contained the spill had it been allowed 
to use chemical dispersants 
kelso said neither exxon nor alyeska the oil industrys jointly 
owned operator of the pipeline was prepared to deal with the oil 
spill 
neither of them had the equipment on site to deal with it 
either through mechanical means or chemical means he said 
he also said exxons response was reluctant and myopic 
characterized by stalling techniques disinformation and a refusal 
to pay real attention to damage outside of prince william sound 
the subcommittee today was to conclude two days of hearings 
investigating the nations largest oil spill todays session was 
expected to include testimony from exxon which has defended its 
actions 
alyeskas vice president for operations theo l polasek said 
the industrys response plans were sufficient to deal with a spill 
but that there was confusion after the tanker ran aground 
rep george miller dcalif told polasek that im not so 
sure this the cleanup was a high priority for you people 
the tanker exxon valdez ran aground on a reef in the sound on 
march 24 after filling its storage tanks with crude oil from the 
pipeline more than 10 million gallons of oil poured into the sound 
also sunday state officials said exxons decision to pull crews 
from an oilstained beach on smith island was surprising 
but exxon spokesman bill stillings said the crews were moved off 
the northern beach to attack more heavily soiled areas the island 
is considered crucial to the annual seal pupping cycle 
i think we fully intend to come back to that beach i wont 
tell you well be back on that beach tomorrow stillings said 
exxons best judgment at this point is that its time to move 
on 
two days earlier yost said the beach was far from clean 
exxon in a plan that has yet to win yosts approval has called 
for the worst of the oil to be cleaned off five islands in the 
sound by wednesday with 364 miles to be cleansed by sept 15

borden inc the worlds largest dairy 
company said it pulled its products from the shelves in two 
southern states today after finding milk with traces of a toxic 
substance from contaminated feed 
chris tilton a borden spokeswoman in columbus ohio said it 
isnt known if any of the contaminated products had been purchased 
but a state health official said the substance is present in 
amounts too small to be dangerous 
borden pulled milk ice cream and other liquid dairy items from 
stores in mississippi and the northern twothirds of louisiana 
where 32 dairies that apparently used feed tainted with barium 
carbonate supplied milk she said 
it was not immediately known if the dairies supplied other milk 
processors 
barium carbonate is a white powder used as rat poison and in 
glass ceramics paint rubber and electronics said michael 
hughes managing director of the poison control center at the 
university of mississippi medical center 
weve done our own testing and the state of louisiana labs 
also tested with some of the milk testing positive in trace 
amounts tilton said we would not want any of our products 
going out with any level of this in it no matter how small 
the amount you can drink is far less than the amount that 
would be dangerous said dr ed thompson a state health 
department epidemiologist a person would have to drink more than 
100 8ounce glasses of the milk in succession for it to be fatal 
thompson said 
tilton said borden discovered the contamination after learning 
from louisiana that some cattle had died or become ill 
louisiana agriculture commissioner bob odom said investigators 
believe the feed became contaminated when it was put in a railroad 
hopper that had held barium carbonate 
tilton said it was not immediately known how many items were 
pulled and how many stores were involved she said the company was 
checking to see when the tainted products were put on shelves 
we will be supplying those markets later today with products 
shipped from plants outside the area until the local milk supply is 
clean tilton said 
the government allowable standard for barium carbonate in water 
is one part per million tilton said and we have found nothing 
close to that just percentages of one part per million 
odom said today he had not been informed of the recall but that 
state officials last week learned that 25 to 30 cows had died 
mysteriously at louisiana dairy farms officials ordered companies 
that received milk from those dairies to hold milk from 
distribution until samples could be tested 
the information we got was that the milk had been bottled but 
it had not reached the shelf said odom he said he didnt know 
how many farms were affected or how many distributors might have 
had to hold on to their milk

the challenge from imports that hustled detroit 
automakers into a hightechnology age should be taken seriously by 
other businesses us commerce secretary robert a mosbacher said 
monday 
the government can help by pushing to end some other countries 
restrictions on imports from the united states mosbacher told a 
news conference before a meeting of the economic club of detroit 
he said cutting capital gains taxes and continuing tax credits 
for research and development spending would give businesses more 
financial and technological resources to compete 
theres no panacea weve got to realize that its a shrinking 
world and if we want to do more than flip the hamburgers for the 
world weve got to come out with quality products mosbacher said 
the auto industry and others including aerospace 
telecommunications biotechnology and medical products have met 
challenges from imports and improved mosbacher said 
they woke up they did a very good job of adapting 
mosbacher said 
to help others he said the government is preparing to enforce 
laws to penalize countries that restrict imports from the united 
states 
we are in the throes of deciding which countries to cite 
mosbacher said he said those decisions will be made by the end of 
may 
the object is not to hurt any other country but to press for 
removal of trade barriers he said the whole point is to open 
other markets and level the playing field 
mosbacher advocated capital gains tax cuts as a means of 
reducing the cost of capital for business 
more readily available capital would create jobs and stimulate 
longterm projects by businesses mosbacher said 
mosbacher also proposed making permanent a tax credit for 
research and development spending 
reitering comments he made in washington recently mosbacher 
said antitrust law changes should be considered to allow innovative 
pooling of research teams from small and large companies to take on 
european and japanese competitors

confident about less inflation problems and continuing growth in

deterring buyers

rising modestly overseas republic national bank of new york quoted 
a troy ounce of gold bullion at 37540 as of 4 pm edt 160 
lower than fridays late bid 
the market is beginning to believe now that the major central 
banks are not committed to holding the dollar at current levels

value against other major currencies is a matter being decided by 
the markets and countries would have to live with the decision 
speaking in basel switzerland after a regular meeting of the 
group of ten central bankers he said the dollars strength is 
remarkable given the trade imbalances among leading industrialized 
countries 
foreignexchange dealers interpreted his remarks to imply that 
government monetary authorities are unlikely to act aggressively to 
influence the dollar 
dealers in the united states reported the fed sold dollars for 
marks and japanese yen when the us currency was trading at 19080 
marks and 13475 yen but the intervention had no discernible 
impact and the dollar continued to rise 
earlier on foreignexchange markets in europe and asia the

that reached a record high of 16475 a pound last december on 
tight supplies and strong demand 
analysts attributed the selloff mainly to the london metal 
exchanges weekly report which showed a 17175ton net increase in 
warehouse stocks tracked by the exchange to 131275 tons 
it was a very large increase and very unexpected said bette 
raptopoulos an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york they were expecting about 4000 or 5000 tons 
experts cited increased copper exports from zambia and an 
unusually small amount of drawdown of stocks in singapore but it 
was not clear whether the rise in overall stocks signaled a 
significant change in market fundamentals 
the possibility of a miners strike in poland kept the market 
from falling further as did expectations of labor unrest as 
contracts with some of the major north american copper companies 
approach expiration at the end of june 
by the end of may i think well begin to see anticipatory 
buying and enhanced demand for copper said analyst george 
anagnos of thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york

5677 a troy ounce 
unleaded gasoline futures plummeted the permitted 
2centsagallon daily limit on the new york merc as the energy 
market extended a steep decline begun on friday 
the selloff was linked to reports last week of overproduction 
by opec members and was fueled monday by technical signals that the 
market was due for a downward correction 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 15 cents to 58 cents 
lower with june at 1944 a barrel heating oil was 68 cent to 79 
cent lower with june at 4669 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 
196 cents to 252 cents lower with the nearby june contract to 
which the daily limit does not apply at 6498 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower on the chicago 
board of trade amid rain forecasts but soybean oil prices surged 
on rumors of an impending sale of us soybean oil to the soviet 
union at subsidized prices 
soybean oil for spot delivery settled 39 cents higher at 2378 
per hundredweight and traded as high as 2390 during the session

slacken after memorial day pork futures advanced on expectations 
of a slowdown in hog marketings as producers increasingly turn 
their attention to fieldwork

avon products inc filed a federal lawsuit monday seeking a 
court order preventing a partnership of amway corp and minneapolis 
investor irwin jacobs from acquiring more avon stock 
the suit filed in us district court in new york accused 
amway and jacobs of violating disclosure requirements of federal 
securities laws in their acquisition of avon stock avon said in a 
statement 
the suit asked that amway and jacobs be ordered to sell the avon 
stock they already have purchased the new yorkbased cosmetics and 
household products company said 
were not familiar with it amway spokeswoman kim bruyn said 
monday afternoon we havent seen it and therefore we have no 
comment 
earlier monday amway cofounder jay van andel said the ada 
michbased company had nt decided whether to pursue acquisition of 
avon its larger rival in the direct selling business 
amway a large direct seller of personal and home products has 
purchased more than 10 percent of avon common stock in the past 
month in partnership with jacobs a wellknown takeover strategist 
van andel told the grand rapids mich economic club that a 
takeover would have to benefit both companies 
he compared amways position to that of a diver who walks out on 
the diving board and has to decide whether to make a swan dive 
or a belly flop we havent made that decision yet were still 
on the board looking around 
if we were to decide to make the plunge the plunge would 
have to be good for amway as a company and avon as a company van 
andel said 
the statement released by avon described amway as a 
controversial purveyor of a pyramidal direct marketing scheme that 
has never made a major acquisition 
it also described jacobs as a wellknown raider who has not 
completed an acquisition for many years or any acquisition for 
significantly more than 500 million 
amway owned by van andel and partner richard devos claims 1 
million distributors worldwide avon says it has 1475 million 
independent sales representatives

quaker oats co said monday it will repurchase up 
to 7 million shares of its outstanding common stock in a bid to 
increase the value of remaining shares 
the company said the repurchase of 2 million of those shares 
would be used to offset a new issue of up to 125 million of 
convertible preferred stock for the companys employee stock 
ownership plan 
quaker said in a news release that at least part of the share 
repurchase would be financed with an unspecified amount of borrowed 
money 
we believe increased leverage will lower our cost of capital 
and create more value for our shareholders said william d 
smithburg chairman and chief executive officer we feel 
comfortable increasing our debt over time given the stong 
performance of our core businesses 
the companys stock price rose 12 cents to 5662 a share 
monday in new york stock exchange composite trading based on that 
price the cost of quakers sharerepurchase plan could exceed 395 
million 
the stock program will be accomplished through openmarket 
purchases and privately negotiated transactions the company said 
quaker an international processor and marketer of food pet 
food and toys had about 795 million common shares outstanding as 
of march 31 
spokesman ronald bottrell said quaker had about 424 million in 
longterm debt and 450 million in shortterm debt at the end of 
march 
the additional borrowing for the stock buyback will increase 
quakers debt load to a little more than 50 percent of its total 
capitalization up from the current 42 percent bottrell said 
quaker like many food tobacco and beverage companies is a 
cash cow generating relatively large amounts of cash and 
having highly predictable earnings said john maxwell jr an 
analyst with wheat first securities inc in richmond va 
you can put more debt load on these companies than those in 
highly volatile situations such as airline and hightechnology 
firms he said 
the greater debt load and the expanded employee stock ownership 
plan could make quaker less attractive as a takeover target 
analysts said takeover rumors sent quakers stock price up sharply 
last august 
quaker said it would complete a previously announced 
2millionshare repurchase program probably by the end of june 
before beginning the new repurchase plan 
quaker said it hopes to complete the new repurchase program by 
june 30 1990 the end of its 1990 fiscal year 
in addition to its quaker oats products quaker owns the 
gatorade and aunt jemima food brands and toymaker fisherprice

j bruce johnston will leave as head of labor 
relations at usx corp this month two years after he lost the last 
big piece of his former domain as one of the most powerful labor 
negotiators in the steel industry 
johnston 58 will join the pittsburgh law firm of alder cohen 
amp grigsby to advise clients on labor matters while continuing as a 
consultant to the pittsburghbased oil and steel giant usx the 
company said monday 
johnston was chairman of the committee that negotiated labor 
contracts for the nations largest steelmaking companies until 
coordinated bargaining dissolved in 1985 amid the industrys 
financial crisis 
as committee chairman he was the lead negotiator for the 
industry during the 1977 1980 and 1983 talks with the united 
steelworkers union johnston saw the tail end of the industrys era 
of expansion and world dominance and the beginning of its painful 
contraction and awakening to a new order of world competition 
he still headed bargaining for usx in 1986 when the producers 
negotiated separate contracts usx the largest steelmaker in the 
united states took a sixmonth strike by the union in its 
determination to keep labor costs to a minimum 
hes a wonderful raconteur and a brilliant debater and its a 
great challenge to be in an argument with him which i was from 
time to time said lynn williams usw president 
johnston deserves some credit for the beginnings in the 1980 
industry talks of labor management participation teams one of the 
progressive arrangements that has become a hallmark of the 
industrys restructuring williams said but whatever progress usx 
made on its own in labor relations soon disintegrated in the bitter 
battle with the union over an aborted company plan to import steel 
from britain for processing on usx mills 
usx remains a laggard among major steelmakers he said 
theyre certainly not one of the leaders but theyre not 
entirely removed from the process williams said 
thomas sterling a vice president took charge of labor 
relations at the usx steel division after the strike ended feb 1 
1987 the oil and diversified units by then had their own labor 
relations hierarchy shrinking johnstons domain to the 900member 
corporate staff although he remained responsible for pension and 
benefit programs corporatewide 
usx chairman david roderick said he was disappointed to learn 
from johnston six months ago of his plans to leave by the end of 
may roderick said he and chairmanelect charles corry feel 
fortunate johnston will be available as a consultant on labor 
matters 
johnston is the only person ever to serve as chief 
negotiator for five separate industries basic steel bituminous 
coal portland cement iron ore and great lakes shipping 
roderick said 
usx had operations in each of those industries at one time

southland corp announced monday it will seek a 
purchaser for its 50 percent stake in citgo petroleum corp and may 
consider offers for its distribution and processing centers 
the convenience store chain also announced its losses widened to 
1694 million in the first quarter of 1989 
southland president jere w thompson attributed the loss which 
included 56 million from a onetime debt exchange offer in 
january to the high interest and noncash charges brought about 
its 1987 leveraged buyout 
the costly aftereffects of the lbo which southland officials 
expect to continue until 1992 obliterated a successful threemonth 
merchandising period company officials said 
thompson said southland must continue to aggressively seek 
ways to reduce the size and cost of our lborelated debt 
alternatives to reduce the companys debt include selling its 
share in citgo and seeking a way to generate cash from the 
distribution and processing centers possibly through a sale 
financing or some sort of joint venture the company said 
citgo based in tulsa okla has attractive assets including 
the nations eighth largest petroleum refinery in lake charles 
la thompson said 
thompson said southland intends to continue its product supply 
contract with citgo even if its stake in the company is sold 
the five distribution centers and six food centers supply more 
than 8000 retail and food service customers in 43 state the 
district of columbia and puerto rico 
we expect that the majority of the proceeds we receive will be 
applied to and would significantly reduce the remaining 156 
billion of our lbo bank debt thompson said 
the first quarter loss of 1694 million compared with a deficit 
of 715 million in the first three months of 1988 
revenue as pegged at 190 billion an increase of 61 percent 
over the 179 billion for the same period a year earlier 
southland is the worlds largest convenience retailer and has 
about 7000 7eleven and other convenience units in the united 
states and canada

top exxon executives contradicted 
government witnesses monday insisting they repeatedly urged the 
quick use of chemicals to disperse the nations largest oil spill 
but that federal authorities turned them down 
their testimony before a fivemember subcommittee of the us 
house interior committee went against earlier statements by both 
the coast guard and the states top environmental official who 
said the oil company did not seek widespread use of dispersant 
chemicals to break down the oil 
exxon executives also disclosed for the first time that the 
cleanup has cost the oil giant 95 million to date 
we came to alaska to use dispersants exxon shipping co 
president frank iarossi told the panel i was pleading on my part 
to begin dispersal use we were very aggressive 
he said opposition from the state department of environmental 
conservation and the coast guard blocked the chemicals use or 
limited them to tests or only smallscale use 
were confidant that had we obtained prompt permission to use 
the dispersant the environmental damage of the spill would have 
been mitigated said exxon usa president bill stevens 
stevens said early use of dispersants or early burning would 
have broken up large amounts of spilled oil iarossi said the 
chemicals would have dispersed perhaps 40 percent of the alaskan 
crude oil 
dennis kelso commissioner of alaskas department of 
environmental conservation refuted that testimony and described 
exxons account monday as a fabrication dispersants in parts 
of prince william sound had been preapproved by the state even 
before the oil spill he said 
dispersants were not used extensively in the three days 
following the tanker accident because the winds and seas were too 
calm to provide the turbulence necessary to mix them with oil 
kelso said in a statement 
on sunday kelso said exxon and its pipeline service company 
alyeska spread disinformation by contending use of dispersants 
was sought kelso testified that exxon did not request permission 
to use the chemicals 
neither of them had the equipment on site to deal with it 
either through mechanical means or chemical means he said 
the subcommittee held two days of hearings to investigate the 
oil spill which occurred march 24 when an exxon tanker struck a 
reef outside normal shipping channels in prince william sound 
about 25 miles out of the transalaska oil pipeline terminal at 
valdez the tankers bottom was ripped open and it leaked more than 
10 million gallons of crude 
the former captain of the vessel joseph hazelwood 42 is 
accused of operating the ship while intoxicated and faces trial 
june 20 in valdez 
vice adm clyde robbins the no 2 coast guard official involved 
in the spill cleanup also testified monday that the oil industry 
did not seek permission to use large amounts of dispersants 
immediately after the spill 
robbins and the coast guards valdez commander both said exxon 
and alyeska did not urge the use of dispersants although tests on 
a small scale were conducted they proved inconclusive 
the issue of the dispersants is significant because alyeska as 
well as exxon has said the spill could have been contained more 
effectively if permission had been granted for the chemicals use 
the question of their use will likely play a major role in lawsuits 
stemming from the spill said rep george miller dcalif the 
subommittee chairman 
robbins also testified that exxon must put more work crews on 
the beaches if it hopes to meet a september deadline to clean up 
oil 
it appears they need to expand their resources in order to 
meet the fall completion robbins said he described the spill as 
one of the worst economic and environmental calamities this 
nation has faced 
i dont expect the beaches by the end of the summer to be 
squeaky clean robbins said but i would like to see some 
places that are clean and places where the impact of the oil is 
removed 
robbins is directly responsible for coordinating the cleanup 
operation reporting to coast guard commandant paul a yost jr 
president bushs emissary to the spill site 
exxon in a plan that has yet to win yosts approval has called 
for the worst of the oil to be cleaned off five islands in the 
sound by wednesday with 364 miles to be cleansed by sept 15 the 
leading edge of the floating oil has reached wide bay about 450 
miles southwest of valdez 
the subcommittee also heard from fishermen who said they fear 
their multimilliondollar catch in prince william sound will be 
reduced this season to protect seafood consumers from the effects 
of the oil 
at an estimated 84 million prince william sound has the 
nations eighthlargest commercial fishing industry said ken 
adams a fishing industry leader from cordova about 85 percent of 
the catch is salmon

fewer rotary rigs working worldwide than there had been a year 
earlier

half of 1989 as our customers increase spending particularly for
