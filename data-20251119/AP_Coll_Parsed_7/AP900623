prime minister margaret thatchers government has 
decided to defy the unelected house of lords and reintroduce a bill 
to allow the prosecution of elderly suspected nazi war criminals 
living in britain 
sir geoffrey howe conservative leader of the house of commons 
announced thursday night the government intends during the next 
session of parliament to resubmit the war crimes bill which was 
easily defeated by the lords on june 5 
the lords powers are limited to delaying legislation for one 
year 
the elected house of commons had approved a governmentappointed 
commissions recommendation to prosecute war criminals passing the 
bill last december by a 27060 vote 
but a succession of peers including lawyers who prosecuted the 
top nazis at postwar trials in nuremberg or fought in world war ii 
as young officers opposed the bill saying fair trials were 
impossible and dragging aging emigres before courts would only stir 
old hatreds 
the bill was defeated in the lords by a vote of 20774 
howe told the house of commons the government will be 
seeking whether by suggested amendments or otherwise to secure 
that the bill next session may receive the support of both houses 
if the lords again vote against the bill however the 
government is likely to use its powers under the parliament act 
not invoked for more than 40 years to force it through 
the simon wiesenthal society which seeks prosecution of 
suspected nazi war criminals applauded the governments decision 
to reintroduce the bill 
this decision sends a strong signal that after 40 years of 
apathy and delay the people of great britain will finally stand 
with the victims of the holocaust by bringing those who 
participated in nazi genocide before the bar of justice rabbi 
abraham cooper associate dean of the los angelesbased wiesenthal 
center said in a statement issued friday 
britain is the only world war ii ally without laws to prosecute 
suspected war criminals canada and australia recently changed laws 
to allow trials and the united states deports suspects for trial to 
israel or other countries 
the government commission headed by a former director of public 
prosecutions said there is sufficient evidence to prosecute three 
suspects living in britain and 124 more should be investigated the 
suspects allegedly helped round up and murder thousands of jews in 
nazioccupied soviet republics

is miles davis a muse a mannerist or a musician 
the questions been asked in the jazz world for years sometimes 
hes more of one than the other two but on the opening night of 
this years jvc jazz festival he played a bit of each role 
as muse he drifted dreamily across the stage noodling on his 
trumpet as mannerist he committed such nonos as playing most of 
the set with his back to the audience as musician he engaged his 
players in conversation that ranged from intimate to vigorous 
davis and his sixpiece band entered august avery fisher hall 
cooking and left the same way friday night the audience stomped 
and howled for more but what they heard was what they got 
besides miles davis and the miles davis band had a late show to 
play 
davis whos passed beyond the legend stage to the cult figure 
level might appear indifferent to his audience but never to his 
music his duels and duets with saxophonist kenny garrett and lead 
bassist joseph foley mccreary were the highlights of the evening 
hiroshima an american band with some oriental affectations 
played the first half of the bill at a highly amplified level that 
often drowned out whatever musical effects were intended in 
preelectronic media days it might have been described as a 
novelty act hiroshima a stadium band had little to do with jazz 
the jvc jazz festival sponsored by the japanese electronics 
firm runs in new york through june 30 and then moves on to 
saratoga springs ny

west germany said friday it would 
guarantee a bank credit of about 31 billion for the soviet union 
to help president mikhail s gorbachev reform his countrys ailing 
economy 
chief government spokesman hans klein said the 12year bank 
credit marks the start of a west german initiative to get 
largescale international support for the soviet union 
in a related development west german chancellor helmut kohl and 
french president francois mitterrand called friday for quick 
economic help to support soviet reforms and the rebuilding of 
eastern europe 
the two leaders held more than two hours of private talks on a 
boat on the rhine river near of assmannshausen west of wiesbaden 
as part of their regular germanfrench consultations 
the 5 billion deutsche mark bank credit worth nearly 31 
billion was negotiated by the deutsche bank and the dresdner bank 
with the foreign trade bank in the soviet union 
the credit aims to help the soviet union make the transition 
from a centrally planned economy to a market economy an effort 
that is similar to reform plans in other east bloc countries 
the announcement was made as foreign ministers from the two 
germanys and the four victorious world war ii allies the united 
states soviet union britain and france began two days of talks 
in berlin on resolving differences over german unification 
west germany has indicated its willingness to broaden economic 
cooperation with the soviet union as part of shaping future 
relations with a united germany bonn would also like to see moscow 
drop its bitter objections to membership in the north atlantic 
treaty organization for a unified germany 
the soviet union also stands to lose one of its key economic 
partners as east germany unites with west germany many of the east 
german firms with which the soviet union trades are likely to go 
bankrupt once the two germanys merge their currencies on july 2 
others that survive will have their products priced in the new 
expensive marks 
kohl said his talks with mitterrand concerned preparations for 
the upcoming european economic community summit in dublin the nato 
summit in london and the world economic summit in houston 
he said they were convinced that decisions would be reached in 
dublin and houston about how the reform processes in eastern 
europe and especially in the soviet union could be supported but 
it was not yet settled how much financial help they were talking 
about 
the european economic community must understand the importance 
of giving help toward selfhelp because the politics of 
perestroika helps us all kohl said 
we have very little time he added 
mitterrand concurred saying the matter is really urgent

disciples of fantasyhorror writer hp 
lovecraft are campaigning to mark the 100th anniversary of his 
birth with a hometown monument to the man who inspired a generation 
of spinners of creepy tales 
the work of lovecraft an obscure pulpmagazine writer in his 
lifetime was rediscovered in the 1940s and he is mentioned in the 
same breath as edgar allan poe as the forerunner of todays 
blockbuster authors of the macabre 
lovecraft probably influenced more writers stylistically 
anywhere in america except ernest hemingway said robert bloch 
author of the novel that inspired the movie psycho and one of 
those who want providence to put up a plaque honoring the hometown 
author 
i really think the city would be honoring itself and 
lovecraft will take his place beside poe bloch said 
i think that providence really has a debt to pay said jon 
b cooke of friends of hp lovecraft a group campaigning for a 
memorial 
city officials arent eager to honor the writer fearing theyd 
set off a torrent of similar requests 
the effort however gets a boost this weekend from the horror 
writers of america who are holding their annual meeting here to 
mark the centennial of lovecrafts birth 
in a fitting tribute the authors and screenwriters planned to 
toast lovecraft with champagne at dusk at his grave in swan point 
cemetery on friday night 
howard phillips lovecraft was born in providence on aug 20 
1890 he spent a brief period in new york returning in his mid30s 
to live with two aunts until he died march 15 1937 a victim of 
brights disease and cancer 
during his lifetime he published just one book the shadow 
over innsmouth in 1936 most of his fantasy and horror tales 
appeared in such pulp magazines as weird tales and amazing stories 
posthumously published collections of his stories inspired such 
horror superstars as stephen king and clive barker and remain 
popular among those who frequent the fantasy shelves in bookstores 
those books include the outsider and others published in 
1939 beyond the wall of sleep 1943 the dunwich horror 
1945 the case of charles dexter ward 1952 the product of 
what some people called lovecrafts sick mind was a world 
dominated by sinister aliens evil beings living in basements and 
beastlike creatures terrorizing helpless people 
bloch in a telephone interview from his los angeles home said 
he never met lovecraft in person but was one of several aspiring 
horror writers with whom the author corresponded 
his encouragement to a teenage kid in the middle of the great 
depression was supremely responsible for my career said bloch 
73 who went on to write 54 books 10 film scripts a radio series 
based on his stories and about 70 television shows 
lovecrafts headstone is the citys only reminder that lovecraft 
hailed from providence other than his tales where he referred to 
the city as the divine providence 
the horror writers and friends of hp lovecraft want the 
memorial erected at prospect terrace a park the author frequented 
and cookes group has raised more than enough money to pay for it 
the city doesnt allow such markers said nancy derrig 
superintendent of parks she suggested the lovecraft devotees take 
their case to brown university where the writers papers are 
stored at the john hay library 
mayor joseph r paolino jr once proposed putting a plaque at 
one of lovecrafts homes but nothing came of it 
brown has a lovecraft symposium scheduled for midaugust 
and fans want a lovecraftinspired movie the upcoming 
reanimator ii to have its premiere in providence 
hes light on plot and character but pretty strong on 
atmosphere cooke said hell scare the hell out of you

maik polster was a sternfaced member of the 
east german secret police patrick gainey took pictures for the 
us army 
andreas bratke was an east german who wanted to be a west 
german illa wobig saw eight people just like him die on her street 
what they all had in common was a little white shack on the west 
side of the berlin wall a guardhouse with a funny name that stood 
as a chilling symbol of the tensions that divided a street a city 
a nation the world 
checkpoint charlie the famed allied border crossing on the west 
side of the berlin wall was lifted into the sky by a giant crane 
friday placed gently onto a flatbed truck and consigned to history 
it was emptied locked and taken away in an elaborate ceremony 
attended by six foreign ministers a brace of generals a brass 
brand and hundreds of reporters 
sir dismiss your detachment french maj gen francois lann 
barked to a young american officer who crisply led away the last 
contingent of military police 
the public was not invited to the ceremony on friedrich street 
the avenue blocked by checkpoint charlie and its oncefeared east 
german counterpart nearby 
illa wobig raised six children in a fourthfloor apartment just 
20 yards from checkpoint charlie they saw it from their window for 
24 years and they saw it disappear friday 
i saw eight people shot to death on that street said mrs 
wobig 55 i saw an east german officer try to go under a guard 
rail he was shot in the neck 
she said she saw at least 20 successful escapes 
some were in cars and some came through a tunnel across the 
street she said some would walk very slowly look around and 
just run 
she is not sure if one of the people she saw was andreas bratke 
a 23yearold east berlin construction worker 
tunnels balloons customized vehicles and other elaborate 
methods were used to flee past the berlin wall by desperate east 
germans 
bratke just ran 
i ran as fast as i could he said i still cannot believe 
it 
bratke is now a west berlin engineering student he was taking 
his certification examinations this week 
eight months after bratke made his bold escape sgt patrick 
gainey was coming back from a party when he saw a huge commotion 
near checkpoint charlie 
this guy had driven a cement truck with his girlfriend and 
baby through the checkpoint said gainey a us army 
photographer he drove a halfmile into the west side just to 
make sure when he stopped he asked if he was in west berlin 
the escapee was hansjoachim pofahl who made the crossing 
through a hail of bullets 
east germanys border guards were as feared as members of the 
secret police according to guard maik polster they were members 
of the secret police 
i was with the state security said polster 23 as he 
genially waved tourists through the east german checkpoint that is 
expected to follow checkpoint charlie into oblivion 
we had to maintain a certain level of appearance he said 
no smiling no joking we had to watch for everything 
the stonefaced scrutiny of the east german border guards helped 
give checkpoint charlie its chilling cachet 
the checkpoint went up with the berlin wall in 1961 
with the wall being dismantled daily in anticipation of german 
unification us officials decided to remove checkpoint charlie 
with a grand flourish 
secretary of state james a baker iii soviet foreign minister 
eduard shevardnadze and their counterparts from france britain and 
the two germanys presided over the ceremony 
while the berlin wall is coming down temporary barricades were 
put up to keep the public from the ceremony several hundred craned 
their necks to watch from a halfblock away 
eilli wiechies 60 watched the pageantry from his wheelchair on 
the sidewalk in front of his apartment house one of the few 
regular people allowed on the grounds 
finally germans can cross he said bitter that the allied 
border crossing was reserved only for nongermans 
a us army band played that is the berlin atmosphere a 
stirring old song about the old berlin as the white checkpoint 
building was lifted to within 30 feet of mrs wobigs window 
a sign saying what a pity checkpoint charlie hung from her 
sill 
i saw kennedy reagan and carter give speeches here she 
said i saw a james bond movie filmed here this is wonderful for 
history but it is sad for me it was part of my home

shirli and mazal are crawling on the sleeping 
bags and blankets sprawled on the tent floor the girls mother 
michal ovadiya stares absently at the khaki wall of the tent her 
home 
tent camps are the latest form of protest by israelis pushed out 
of their rented homes by inflated housing prices caused by the 
wave of soviet jewish immigrants 
there are three militarytype tents and about a dozen families 
at this encampment in a garden across from israels parliament a 
halfdozen such camps have sprung up across the country to house 
homeless israelis and to call attention to their plight 
rents have doubled and even tripled throughout israel with the 
arrival of more than 56000 soviet jews since the start of 1989 a 
total of 150000 are expected to arrive this year 
the immigrants who get a government housing subsidy of about 
237 a month soon caused a shortage in modestpriced units 
landlords raised the rents of their cheapest apartments to match 
the subsidy causing an overall increase in housing prices 
many israelis say they cannot compete with the soviets who also 
get their subsidy a full year in advance and are thus forced to 
leave their homes 
the sun is blazing and it is hard to breathe inside the tent 
which is shared by ms ovadiya her daughters and four other 
people it is filled to capacity with sleeping bags one corner is 
taken by a wooden crib 
tent life is dull the residents make coffee on a portable stove 
hooked to a tank of cooking gas there is not much food slices of 
bread chocolate butter a watermelon there is no running water 
a newcomer dressed in a tshirt and shorts asks if there is a 
place available then announces that he will join the tent dwellers 
next week with his wife and two children 
i dont know what to do i dont have anywhere to go said 
ms ovadiya a darkskinned 30yearold divorcee i feel like 
she says hopelessly adding a fourletter word 
ms ovadiya and her two daughters age 11 and 8 have had no 
place of their own for the last four years they have lived in a 
shed at the tel aviv suburb of petah tikva and once broke into a 
government apartment but were removed by police 
her monthly income totals 600 she works parttime as an 
apprentice at a diamondcutting factory and gets alimony from her 
former husband 
the cheapest onebedroom apartment in tel aviv area costs some 
250 to rent and then come municipal taxes and housing expenses i 
cant afford it she explained 
she has been offered affordable mortgage terms if she moves to a 
remote development town 
i dont want to go there why i have to take children from 
their school and search for work there let the immigrants move to 
development areas she said 
others in the tent say they have nothing against the soviets 
they just want equal rights 
our soul hurts give us a chance pleaded eliahu shukrun a 
spokesman for the tent protest movement that calls itself young 
and homeless 
the protesters speak of families of 10 living in twobedroom 
apartments of married children moving in with their parents and 
grandparents 
shukrun said many young couples cannot afford to rent flats in 
jerusalem where prices have jumped to some 450 a month for a 
twobedroom apartment 
by official estimates about 9000 young israeli couples rent 
apartments in jerusalem and a total of 60000 live in rented homes 
across the country 
the average monthly aftertax income for an israeli family of 
four is 1160 but tent protesters say they can only dream of such 
a salary 
their bitterness is directed at the immigrants 
there will be civil war here not because we have something 
against the immigrants the opposite is true but they push us 
out said shukrun 
he has his own recipe for resolving the housing crisis the 
government should release some lands it owns oblige contractors to 
build public housing quickly and for all creating a stock of 
affordable apartments mortgages for israelis should be enlarged 
and the interest reduced he suggested 
meanwhile their struggle is getting nowhere 
a leftist party contributed a tent and their plight won much 
media attention and sympathy from average israelis who express 
their opinions on radio callin shows and letters to newspapers 
but not a single aprtment owner has offered a flat to rent at a 
reasonable price 
the government also has nothing to offer except plans to set a 
ceiling for housing prices and talk of better mortgage terms for 
israelis 
in the meantime the crisis deepens israel is expected to run 
out of its 20000 vacant rental units in four months and exhaust 
its supply of alternate housing three months later 
the housing ministry seeks 60000 new housing starts this year 
but ground has been broken for only 7000 new units arguments with 
local firms and the construction workers union still block import 
of prefabricated housing 
some protesters like a man who identified himself only as eran 
are pessimistic 
i dont know how long it will last he said so far its 
not that bad here but then winter starts

colliding plates of earths crust beneath 
arabia and eurasia unleashed irans catastrophic earthquake the 
same smashup triggered the 1988 seismic disaster in soviet armenia 
the movement of the giant crustal plates squeezes iran from 
both sides like when you want to crack a nut mansour niazi an 
iranian seismologist at lawrence berkeley laboratory said friday 
armenia and iran both are within the alpide seismic belt which 
stretches roughly from greece east to the himalayas 
it is a region in which several plates of earths evermoving 
crust collide in a process once known as continental drift but now 
called plate tectonics 
in the eastern part of this belt the plate beneath india 
smashes northward into the eurasian plate uplifting the himalayas 
in the western end the plate that carries arabia is moving 
northeast about two inches per year as it collides with eurasia 
that collision ultimately caused both the dec 7 1988 armenian 
quake and thursdays quake in northern iran as well as many 
turkish temblors said niazi and bob sharp a us geological 
survey geologist who has worked in both armenia and iran 
niazi said the armenian quake happened near the boundary where 
the arabian and eurasian plates hit each other 
in contrast this weeks iran quake happened near the boundary 
of two smaller microplates that are being squished between the 
larger plates niazi said the smaller plates are located beneath 
the southern caspian sea and the central iranian plateau 
the armenian quake which measured 69 on the richter scale 
killed at least 25000 people the iranian quake with a magnitude 
estimated between 73 and 77 and killed at least 40000 
according to irans mission to the united nations 
many of the worlds most seismically active areas are located 
where a crustal plate beneath an ocean smashes into or slides past 
a plate beneath a continent such as along the west coasts of north 
and south america 
the earthquake belt from greece to the himalayas is the worlds 
most seismically active boundary between colliding continental 
plates niazi said during a telephone interview from berkeley 
a us geological survey list shows that from 1960 to 1989 iran 
was hit by 54 earthquakes that either measured 65 or larger or 
that caused deaths or significant damage 
the northeastsouthwest squeezing of the arabian and eurasian 
plates or the microplates between them created mountains including 
those that stretch from the armenian epicenter in the caucasus 
mountains to irans elburz mountains south of the estimated 
epicenter of thursdays jolt 
sharp speculated the quakes might be linked not only by the 
largescale plate motions but in a manner similar to a crack 
propagating down a grain in a board although the roughly 400 
miles between them suggests otherwise 
preliminary estimates placed the epicenter under the caspian 
sea and sharp speculated the quake might have happened on the 
astara fault niazi said that based on damage reports he believed 
the epicenter was farther south closer to rasht 
the area hit by thursdays disaster has been relatively quiet in 
the past 1000 years with the most recent big quakes in 893 and 
1678 sharp and niazi said that suggests the area was an 
unrecognized seismic gap a locale overdue for a devastating 
quake because they have happened there historically but not 
recently niazi said

a relief organization said it would send 
a medical team and 80000 pounds of supplies to 
earthquakedevastated iran on saturday a gesture it hopes will 
improve relations between americans and iranians 
we really cant be perceived as so bad if we reach out to the 
people there said terry tarnowski who has worked for americares

the politics of a country dont affect the organizations work 
said spokesman dwain schenck on friday 
if youre a relief group worth your salt youll try to react 
and not let past problems get in the way schenck said by 
telephone from the new canaan headquarters of americares 
rescuers freed thousands of people friday from buildings 
flattened by the earthquake in northern iran iranian officials at 
the united nations said at least 40000 were killed and 100000 
injured 
the government appealed for international help 
americares wasnt the only us organization helping with the 
relief effort on friday the american red cross said it was raising 
money rather than shipping supplies and the iranian american 
republican council was readying boxes of blankets and medical 
supplies 
volunteers at the americares warehouse in stamford on friday 
helped prepare hundreds of boxes of supplies which were loaded 
onto two tractortrailer trucks and shipped to bradley airport in 
windsor locks 
a chartered airplane carrying at least one doctor and nurse as 
well as americares workers and volunteers was scheduled to depart 
from bradley at noon on saturday said another americares 
spokesman steve norman 
the airplane will be packed to the gills with a variety of 
supplies schenck said 
among the items were shovels bandages ibuprofen burn cream

here are some facts in the northern spotted 
owl controversy 
northern spotted owl strix occidentalis caurina a reclusive 
brown bird that lives in oldgrowth forests of the pacific 
northwest it can be found from southern british columbia through 
western washington and oregon into northern california as far south 
as san francisco bay 
population estimated at 3000 to 5000 pairs its numbers have 
declined dramatically as twothirds of its habitat has been 
destroyed from years of intense logging 
endangered species act listed as threatened under the act the 
owl will be protected by federal law under the law no one may 
harm or hunt the bird nor destroy its living environment through 
logging or other economic means it prohibits government lumber 
sales that would jeopardize the bird 
economic impact industry estimates claim some options for 
protecting the owl could put as much as 3 million acres of 
oldgrowth forest in washington oregon and northern california off 
limits to logging cost 28000 logging jobs over 10 years and cut 
in half federal timber harvests in the northwest the federal 
government as well as states and local governments in the region 
stand to lose millions of dollars from timber sales 
history environmentalists sought protection for the bird in 
the mid1970s the interior department under the reagan 
administration declined to intervene a 1988 federal court ruling 
directed the department to reopen the case in 1989 the us fish 
and wildlife service proposed protecting the bird under the 
endangered species act a final decision to do so was made friday 
effective july 23

the soviet union is shifting nuclear warheads 
out of its rebellious baltic and southern states and into less 
volatile parts of the russian republic us officials say 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
moves reflected moscows concerns about nationalist and ethnic 
tensions that could lead to attempts by rebel forces to take 
control of a nuclear weapons storage depot 
private specialists on the soviet military said the united 
states should view the development as reassuring because it 
indicates kremlin authorities are taking precautions in the face of 
political instability in nonrussian republics 
its at least as much in our interest as in the soviets 
interest that their nuclear weapons not fall into the wrong 
hands said matthew bunn a senior research analyst at the arms 
control association 
georgi v shchekochikhin a soviet embassy spokesman said 
friday he had no information on the subject 
us officials declined to say how many of the soviets 
estimated 33000 nuclear warheads are being moved 
private experts said the transfer of weapons does not affect the 
deployment of longrange nuclear arms capable of striking the 
united states thus the shift has little if any affect on the 
military balance although it does mean some soviet weapons are 
further from possible targets in western europe 
the less widely deployed soviet tactical weapons are the 
better for the west bunn said theyd be less readily 
available in the event of a crisis involving the united states 
and its western allies 
stephen meyer an authority on the soviet military and a 
professor at the massachusetts institute of technology said soviet 
government officials had told him recently they were consolidating 
their weapon storge sites for security reasons 
this is a very touchy subject for them meyer said he added 
that it shows at least a general recognition of the problem of 
nationalist tensions and the possibility that a rebel force could 
attempt to take possession of a nuclear weapon 
meyer said it seemed from his conversations with soviet 
officials that the warhead removal started after a flareup of 
violence in january between armed azerbaijani and armenian groups 
around the city of baku where some nuclear warheads are believed 
to be stored 
moscow sent russian airborne units to stop the fighting but 
isolated attacks on military units in that area reportedly have 
continued 
meyer said the consolidation involves not only nuclear warheads 
but also conventional armaments he likened the move to an american 
decision in the 1970s to reduce the number of nuclear warhead 
storage sites in western europe in response to a rise in terrorist 
threats against us installations 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff told 
reporters he could not confirm that the soviets were moving nuclear 
warheads out of the baltics however he said he was fairly 
comfortable with soviet nuclear weapons safeguards

prodded by critical democrats president bush 
is agreeing to double government spending on investigating and 
prosecuting fraud in savings and loan institutions 
bush announced friday he is establishing rapid response 
teams of investigative lawyers and accountants and creating a new 
position to coordinate the governments bank and sampl fraud program 
we will not rest until the cheats and the chiselers and the 
charlatans spend a large chunk of their lives behind the bars of a 
federal prison bush told us attorneys from around the nation 
his remarks came in an upbeat address preceded and followed by 
military band music at the justice department 
democrats immediately dismissed his plan as too little too 
late sen alan dixon dill dubbed it a showandtell photo 
opportunity that contained little news 
the program announced by the president would 
double spending for justice department and internal revenue 
service sampl investigators and prosecutors from 50 million to 100 
million in fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 bailout legislation 
enacted last august had authorized 75 million in 1990 but the 
administration subsequently sought and congress appropriated only 
50 million 
create a new position called special counsel for financial 
institution fraud to direct the effort attorney general dick 
thornburgh appointed james g richmond us attorney for northern 
indiana to the post 
establish an interagency group to coordinate the various 
federal programs targeting fraud 
form squads of specialized lawyers and auditors from the 
justice department and bank regulatory agencies to be dispatched 
when fraud is suspected 
bush described the groups as teams of razorsharp prosecutors 
and auditors striking city by city teams that will jump right 
into the paper chase teams that will hit the trail while that 
trail is still hot 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the house banking 
committee said the administration initiative was too little and 
woefully late to handle a backlog of 21000 inactive cases that 
have been referred to the justice department 
bush defended the administration noting 791 fraud convictions 
in 1989 the recovery of 100 million in stolen funds and 530 
active investigations this year 
the money appropriated for the current fiscal year is being 
spent to hire 202 fbi agents 118 prosecutors 30 other attorneys 
and 100 accountants to staff task forces in 27 cities he said 
however democrats said fbi field offices had requested 425 
agents and us attorneys offices have asked for 231 prosecutors 
in effect we have a team on the field with less than half the 
players needed sen richard bryan dnev said 
the president blamed any delay in starting the prosecution 
effort to congress refusal of his march 1989 request for 368 
million 
democrats however blamed republicans for refusing to provide 
the money unless it was taken from several domestic programs and 
for rebuffing a democratic offer to transfer the money from the 
military 
bush also announced his support for legislation sponsored by 
republican sens bob dole of kansas jake garn of utah and john 
heinz of pennsylvania and gop reps robert michel of illinois and 
chalmers wylie of ohio 
that legislation would allow prosecutors to use courtauthorized 
wiretaps against financial institution fraud allow bank regulatory 
agencies to ask courts to freeze the assets of defendants in civil 
fraud cases and prohibit the use of bankruptcy to avoid damages in 
fraud cases 
the administrations antifraud program has come under 
increasing criticism from democrats since last month when treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady roughly doubled his estimate of the 
cost of cleaning up the thrift industry to a range of 90 billion 
to 130 billion he said as much as 50 billion more in bailout 
money may be needed in 1991

the leadership battle in the leftofcenter 
labor party has escalated with yitzhak rabin and shimon peres 
trading insults and blaming each other for leading the party astray 
their latest dispute flared after peres with rabins backing 
toppled labors coalition with the rightwing likud bloc but then 
failed in april to form a new governing coalition 
peres failure paved the way for prime minister yitzhak shamir 
to set up a rightwing government on june 11 rabin defense 
minister in the last cabinet announced his bid for leadership the 
next day 
rabin is expected to press for elections for the party leaders 
post when labor officials meet wednesday peres has said he will 
not surrender the post until his term expires in 1992 
the two have been rivals for most of their political careers 
they were proteges of israels feuding founders peres followed 
david ben gurion and rabin took golda meir as his mentor 
until this week rabin and peres refrained from personal 
attacks but the atmosphere heated up thursday when several peres 
supporters announced a switch to rabin who according to recent 
surveys is israels most popular politician 
a survey published friday in the hadashot daily showed that 242 
percent preferred rabin as prime minister compared to 204 percent 
for shamir and 112 percent for peres in february 153 percent 
backed rabin 183 percent favored shamir and 142 percent 
supported peres 
the surveys were conducted among 1100 jewish adults and have a 
margin of error of 2 percent 
appearing on the thursday night news peres responded to rabins 
charges that as party leader peres alone was responsible for the 
partys troubles 
yitzhak rabin went along with me on everything step after 
step was he being led was he tied to me by a chain couldnt 
he express his opinion peres said rabin bears greater 
responsibility than i do 
peres also belittled rabins belief that likud could be prodded 
toward peace talks with palestinians he rabin thought he could 
lead shamir to cairo instead shamir led him into a deadend 
street peres charged 
rabin fired back in an interview on israel radio friday calling 
peres accusations an unbalanced outburst 
responding to the charges that he also bore responsibility for 
the breakup of the last government rabin said he went along with 
peres out of party loyalty

an international committee is calling for much 
tighter job exposure standards after finding that radiation is 
three times more dangerous than was believed little more than a 
decade ago 
the international commission on radiological protection said 
friday it would recommend a 60 percent reduction in job standards 
from an annual dose of 5 rem to 2 rem 
a rem is a standard measure of dose from powerful ionizing 
radiation like xrays or nuclear radioactivity doses often are 
expressed in millirem or thousandths of a rem a chest xray from 
an uptodate machine will expose the patient to about 20 millirems 
for longterm exposure of the general public the commission is 
maintaining its current recommendation of no more than 100 millirem 
per year on average but it is suggesting that the averaging period 
be five years instead of a lifetime 
the commission last set standards for radiation protection in 
1977 when it was believed that slightly more than one out of every 
100 people exposed to a radiation dose of 100 rem would develop 
cancer or genetic damage 
several groups since then have said these findings were too low 
and the commission said friday its new assessments lead to the 
conclusion that that much radiation would hurt four people out of 
100 
there is sufficient information now beyond a reasonable 
certainty that radiation is more risky than what we thought in 
1977 at least a factor of three times more dangerous commission 
chairman dj beninson of argentina said at a news conference 
the session was called to discuss a draft commission report 
expected to be made final in november 
beninson said most power plants and other atomic facilities 
worldwide already hold exposure far below 2 rem per year 
in the united states the nuclear regulatory commission permits 
nuclear plant workers to be exposed to no more than 5 rem per year 
of which no more than 3 rem may be in any quarter the nrc says 
average exposure of workers receiving a measurable dose is less 
than 10 percent of the limit 
beninson said the only workers likely to be exposed to more than 
2 rem per year would be physicians who routinely use xrays some 
nuclear plant maintenance employees and workers in some uranium 
mines where radon concentrations are high 
the committee has been making recommendations on protection from 
ionizing radiation as opposed to radio waves which do not ionize 
the material from which they pass since 1928 
its recommendations are frequently adopted by national agencies 
although sometimes with long delays 
ionizing radiation comes from manmade sources such as xrays 
and nuclear power plants and from natural sources such as 
radioactive rocks cosmic rays and radon gas 
warren k sinclair an american member of the international 
commission said the typical american is exposed to about 036 rem 
or 360 millirems of ionizing radiation from both manmade and 
natural sources every year

iran is deliberately underreporting the number 
of casualties from thursdays massive earthquake out of fear of a 
political backlash leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the 
countrys islamic leadership say 
the regime is very much fearful of public outrage said 
shahin gobadi spokesman for the peoples mojahedin of iran 
theyre very much afraid of the political aftershocks 
as gobadi spoke friday members of the organization denounced 
irans government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street 
from the white house 
northern iran was stuck thursday by an earthquake measuring 
between 73 and 77 on the richter scale iran has told the united 
nations that the death toll is at least 36000 but gobadi said his 
organization has received estimates closer to 100000 
gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake 
victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with 
neighboring iraq and against internal opposition 
they have been very late in assisting the people he said 
sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for 
the chanting flagwaving rally participants who also carried 
signs criticizing their native country 
planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake 
but part of the fridays activities focused on irans stricken 
residents 
gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people 
to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life 
this regime has brought them nothing but devastation and 
misery this regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless 
war with iraq and to oppression of the people at home he said 
a unsponsored ceasefire was declared last year after eight 
years of the iraniraq war 
irans islamic republic was established in 1979 after shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi was deposed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
and militants seized the us embassy in tehran taking 66 
americans hostage 
the united states broke diplomatic relations with iran in april 
1980 the shah died in exile in july 1980 us hostages were freed 
six months later and khomeini died last june 
gobadi said his 25yearold group had helped depose the shah but 
had no part in organizing the islamic republic 
even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the 
regime in iran rep mervyn dymally dcalif told an estimated 
3000 people attending the rally 
there were many many victims before this tragedy and there 
are victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people of 
the united states he said 
dymally a member of the house foreign affairs committee 
praised president bushs offer of humanitarian aid to iran but said 
bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through 
nongovernment groups 
the state department said friday that iran was willing to accept 
earthquake relief from the american red cross and other us 
humanitarian organizations

a battle between the timber industry and 
environmentalists over the northern spotted owl may move to court 
now that the interior department has decided to curtail logging to 
protect the bird 
john turner director of the us fish and wildlife service 
announced his decision friday to list the brown reclusive owl as a 
threatened species jeopardizing thousands of logging jobs in the 
pacific northwest 
ralph saperstein vice president of the western forest 
industries association said his portlandbased group plans a 
lawsuit demanding review of scientific studies turner used in 
making his decision 
we feel they used selective scientific information 
saperstein said 
the government said the regions jobs complicated the issue and 
postponed an announcement until tuesday of specific logging 
restrictions to protect the 2foottall bird 
the biological evidence says that the northern spotted owl is 
in trouble said turner who declared the owl threatened under 
the endangered species act we will not and by law cannot 
ignore that evidence 
turner predicted there would be little disruption in logging on 
federal lands this summer 
intense clearing of ancient trees over decades has destroyed the 
owls habitat protection for the owl could curtail cutting on 
millions of acres of old growth forests in washington oregon and 
northern california and cost 28000 jobs federal studies indicate 
loggers and their families held a candlelight vigil friday night 
in eugene 
saperstein said the timber industry felt the fish and wildlife 
service ignored information that spotted owls have done well in 
forests in northern california where timber is harvested 
we feel being able to air these complaints in public will 
allow balance to be applied to the process he said each year 
they go out and survey they find more owls than before we dont 
feel that is indicative of a species thats threatened 
environmentalists said protection for the spotted owl was long 
overdue they said they wanted to see what steps federal agencies 
will take to protect uncut forests where the bird lives before 
deciding whether to go to court 
the listing by itself will not protect the owl or the ancient 
forests said melanie rowland of the wilderness societys office 
in seattle the key is what the agencies are going to do and how 
much politics interferes with biology 
an estimated 3000 to 5000 pairs of spotted owls survive in the 
forests of washington oregon and northern california 
the governors of washington and oregon said they will lobby 
against overly restrictive owl protection plans 
federal legislation is needed to protect some old growth 
forests while allowing logging to continue without administrative 
delays in others said oregon gov neil goldschmidt 
gov booth gardner of washington said the ruling represents a 
challenge to the northwest clearly what the timber communities 
and workers need is assurance of an ongoing and adequate timber 
supply 
he said the federal government should provide special assistance 
to communities hurt by the decision 
environmentalists sought protection for the bird in the 
mid1970s the interior department under the reagan administration 
declined to intervene a 1988 federal court ruling directed the 
department to reopen the case in 1989 the us fish and wildlife 
service proposed protecting the bird under the endangered species 
act the decision to do so is effective july 23 
environmentalists said the fight over the spotted owl was just 
the first in a larger battle to preserve the earth 
we would hope the timber industry would grow out of the denial 
phase and accept the scientific communitys analysis of the plight 
of the owl and the other old growth species said james monteith 
executive director of the oregon natural resources council

prosecutors are seeking to bolster their 
narcotics and perjury case against mayor marion barry presenting 
backup circumstantial evidence that barry smoked crack cocaine and 
sought to cover it up 
as barrys narcotics and perjury trial ended its first week in 
us district court on friday his lawyers attacked the credibility 
of prosecution witnesses 
chief defense counsel r kenneth mundy told reporters he intends 
to win not by a knockout blow but by nicking and bruising 
prosecution witnesses and building up doubts about their stories in 
the minds of jury members 
defense lawyers did not directly dispute the testimony of james 
mcwilliams a city government lawyer that he found barry slumped 
late one night in a hotel bathroom littered with drug paraphernalia 
instead they sought to call into question the plea bargain 
mcwilliams made with the government for a lighter sentence and to 
pose the possibility he bore a grudge against barry for 
insufficient help with his job problems 
mcwilliams said he remained a loyal soldier in the barry 
camp for 15 months after the incident in december 1988 lying about 
it to city investigators and refusing to testify before a federal 
grand jury 
i had taken the fifth amendment to partially protect myself 
and partially to protect the mayor he testified 
but he said he cooperated fully with federal authorities after 
spending thousands of dollars in legal fees and after learning that 
prosecutors were ready to indict him on narcotics distribution 
charges involving small gifts of cocaine to a woman friend 
lewis testifying over three days earlier in the week said he 
and barry smoked crack on four occasions in december 1988 and that 
when investigators learned of it he and the mayor tried to lead 
them off the trail 
mcwilliams said he went to the ramada inn here at the invitation 
of charles lewis a former city employee who has since been 
convicted of drug dealing but only as an opportunity to lobby 
barry for a job transfer 
mcwilliams said barry and lewis disappeared repeatedly 
throughout the evening to visit the kitchen and bathroom areas of 
the hotel suite 
the smoke and the smell got stronger as the evening 
went on he said 
after he arrived at the hotel room he said lewis borrowed 40 
and said he was going out to get some stuff 
i understood he was going to go out and get some drugs with 
the money mcwilliams said lewis came back with a plastic bag 
that had a white substance inside he said 
mcwilliams said barry arrived later then went repeatedly with 
lewis into the bathroom and kitchen each visit followed by plumes 
of smoke and a strong unusual smell 
what did they say when they came back from the bathroom 
assistant us attorney richard roberts asked 
that this is good stuff i will go back and have another 
hit mcwilliams replied 
mcwilliams said that at one point he went to the bathroom to try 
to talk to the mayor about his job situation and found him fully 
clothed sitting on the toilet within arms reach of a vanity 
littered with matches white residue in plastic bags and a 
tinfoilcovered glass 
the mayor appeared restful and was just slumped over a little 
bit mcwilliams said 
i kept making my pitch about the job he said 
he looked up and said you know you look a lot like santa 
claus said mcwilliams whose beard is heavily streaked with 
gray 
mcwilliams did not say that he saw barry actually use drugs but 
he referred to the santa claus remark when asked if barry was 
coherent 
barry 54 a threeterm mayor is being tried on three felony 
counts of perjury 10 misdemeanor charges of cocaine possession and 
one misdemeanor count of conspiracy to possess cocaine

federal officials say states need to improve 
medicaid controls to help stop the flow of prescription drugs to 
the illegal market 
using a new computer program the health and human services 
departments inspector general has gotten a glimpse of the possible 
extent of medicaidpaid prescription drugs diverted to street 
pushers and users 
in fiscal 1988 medicaid paid about 525 million for 
prescription drugs that are favorites of street pushers and users 
an inspector generals report said friday the street value of 
those drugs would be about 15 times that much 
the internal report a copy of which was obtained by the 
associated press did not estimate how much of that actually wound 
up on the illegal drug market but it is believed to be a 
significant amount 
the study said initial results of the office of inspector 
general computer applications indicate widespread need to improve 
internal controls to identify physicians pharmacies and 
recipients that demonstrate the greatest potential for 
involvement in drug trafficking and abuse 
to help states improve monitoring of prescription drugs in the 
medicaid program the inspector generals office developed a 
computer program that identifies suspicious patterns of prescribing 
and purchasing of commonly abused drugs 
the office is offering the program to state medicaid agencies 
it also is recommending that hhs health care financing 
administration focus on state programs that do not respond to the 
offer 
financing for medicaid a public health care program for the 
poor is shared about equally by the states and the federal 
government states manage and operate their programs while 
washington oversees the programs to ensure they comply with us 
regulations 
the inspector general tested the computer program in the 
district of columbia and found 682 recipients 50 physicians and 39 
pharmacies that received dispensed or prescribed more than the 
usual amount of abusable drugs 
all of these cases should be reviewed to determine the medical 
necessity of the drug patterns the report said 
the inspector generals office used the program to help medicaid 
agencies in maryland new mexico and pennsylvania identify targets 
that should be investigated further 
the office also has received requests for assistance from 
delaware georgia south dakota and utah and from law enforcement 
agencies in north carolina new jersey and ohio the report said

important and most symbolic of its provisions was a clause calling 
quebec a distinct society 
the distinct society clause had no immediate practical 
impact on the province or its people it served mainly to soothe 
bruised quebecois feelings 
the clause was also a guideline for the canadian supreme court 
requiring it to take the provinces special situation into account 
when ruling on challenges to laws affecting quebec 
but the 1987 agreement was declared dead friday night after it 
fell short of ratification by all 10 provinces which was required 
by this weekend 
a widened political debate in the province seemed certain an 
eventual referendum on either independence or more likely some 
sort of sovereigntyassociation with canada is possible 
but a highly passionate response or a violent separation does 
not appear to be in the cards 
during the long debate quebec officials were careful not to 
make any threats of secession or other future action during the 
long debate they refused even to acknowledge that any contingency 
plan was in the works should the accord fail 
quebecois voters rejected a 1980 referendum that proposed talks 
with the federal government on political autonomy for their 
province 
the meech lake accord gave all provinces not just quebec the 
right to opt out of some federalprovincial spending programs it 
gave provinces more say in immigration particularly important in 
quebec where frenchspeaking immigrants are desirable it also 
covered nominations to the supreme court and a new constitutional 
amending formula 
the accord died because opposition prevented ratification in the 
provinces of manitoba and newfoundland 
in manitoba a cree indian leader who is a member of the 
provincial legislature sucessfully submarined attempts to push 
through approval by throwing up procedural obstacles he forced 
adjournment of the legislature until monday two days past 
tonights midnight deadline for passage 
that meant there could be no unanimous approval by the provinces 
in newfoundland premier clyde wells hearing the news from 
manitoba postponed a vote on meech lake indefinitely 
its a sad day for canada prime minister brian mulroney 
said after the death of the accord 
in fact most canadians were sick of the discussion and debate 
which had occupied the headlines for the past several months and 
with increasing intensity for the past several weeks 
some quebecois with nationalist or separatist feelings were 
happy believing the rejection of the accord would be a step toward 
independence others were bitter 
try to sit with us the next time and see what our basic 
demands are said serge dube a power company executive the 
bare minimum was asked and they trampled on our flag we were 
told we dont want you in canada no canada we cant accept 
that 
for a while it looked good computer systems analyst robert 
gagnon said of the accord it looked like it was going to bring 
the country together 
quebec premier robert bourassa expressed profound 
disappointment at the failure of the agreement but gave no 
indication what his next move would be 
jacques parizeau leader of the separatist parti quebecois 
opposition party offered to sit down with bourassa a liberal to 
discuss the future of the province 
quebecs 65 million inhabitants represent a quarter of canadas 
population montreal is its second city quebecs economy is an 
integral part of the canadian economy and the province is the 
countrys largest 
the meech lake debate already was having an impact on foreign 
investment and on the canadian dollar because it raised fears about 
canadas stability 
but widespread opinion among quebecois was that there probably 
would be an expression of strong feeling this weekend on st jean 
baptiste day the quebec national day then the conventional 
wisdom said people would head off for vacation and generally 
forget about it 
one constitutional specialist asked before the measure died 
what the immediate impact of its failure would be offered a 
lowkey response 
theyll probably form a committee he said

seat belt release buttons in 16 million 
chevrolet camaro and pontiac firebird cars should be checked for 
damage that could lead to belt failure federal safety officials 
say 
and safety investigators have reopened a probe of loose seats in 
ford mustangs following a new spate of complaints 
general motors corp will recall 1984 to 1990 model camaros and 
firebirds to replace or repair the belts free of charge the 
national highway transportation safety administration said friday 
damaged belt buckles should be replaced immediately it said 
the problem is caused when the red plastic pushbutton weakens 
from prolonged exposure to radiation and heat from the sun nhtsa 
said adding this may cause the safety belt to latch improperly 
or not at all greatly increasing the risk of injury in a crash 
if a safety belt on one of the affected cars does not latch or 
release properly the car should be taken in for repair nhtsa 
administrator jerry curry said if there is no damage to any of the 
cars belts owners can await recall letters from gm he said 
the government has been investigating the problem since last 
august and gm is voluntarily conducting the recall curry said 
in the mustang case the safety agency in 1987 discontinued a 
probe of loose seats in 19791983 models after finding no evidence 
of a widespread problem spokesman ken milton said 
but he said the inquiry was renewed last month because of 
continued complaints the agency has received 747 reports 
including 170 after the earlier investigation was halted consumers 
have linked the problem to seven injuries 
an estimated 12 million of the mustangs are on the road milton 
said 
the complaints allege that bolts holding the front seats to the 
floor usually on the drivers side are cracking as they age 
ford motor co spokeswoman linda becker said 
she said the automaker is cooperating fully with the 
investigation 
meanwhile nhtsa announced three engineering analyses of 
possibly defective parts in other cars all were upgraded from the 
preliminary evaluation stage which involves mostly paperwork 
they included investigations of 
hood latch failure in the 1987 and 1988 chevrolet corsica and 
beretta there have been 62 complaints blaming the problem for 35 
accidents one death and one injury an estimated 288916 of the 
cars are on the road 
passive safety belt system failure in 19871990 toyota camrys

caravans and plymouth voyagers there have been 43 complaints of 
the cables fracturing allowing the tires suspended under the 
vehicles to fall onto the road two injuries have been reported 
the agency also announced four new preliminary evaluations of 
rear seat collapse during accidents involving 19861989 
caravans and voyagers there have been six complaints three 
accidents four injuries and one death

some human cancers may be caused by energy 
fields created by electrical flows down power lines and through 
ordinary home appliances an environmental protection agency report 
says 
the report reviewing more than 40 scientific studies still in 
preliminary form and not yet assessed by outside experts says the 
evidence implicating 60cycle magnetic fields from ordinary ac 
current is suggestive but inconclusive 
with our current understanding we can identify 60 hertz 
magnetic fields from power lines and perhaps other sources in the 
home as a possible but not proven cause of cancer in people 
said the report made available by the agency on friday 
electromagnetic fields are created any time electrical power 
flows through a circuit in an appliance or a power line common 
household electromagnetic radiation is also associated with such 
appliances as television sets microwave ovens and radio 
transmitters 
the epa report on lowfrequency and radio frequency fields said 
the strongest evidence that exposure to electromagnetic fields is 
casually related to human cancer comes from studies of children 
who lived near electrical power transmission lines or who were the 
offspring of parents who worked in electrical occupations 
these studies have consistently found modestly elevated risks 
some statistically significant of leukemia cancer of the nervous 
system and to a lesser extent lymphomas a cancer of the 
lymphatic system such as hodgkins disease the report said 
some of the studies cited are more than a decade old 
the report said there was weaker evidence of an increased 
risk of leukemia and other cancers for adults in occupations where 
exposure to electromagnetic fields are common it said the 
occupational studies come from sources that are sketchy but 
the report notes despite these weaknesses the occupational 
studies tend to support the results of the childhood cancer 
studies 
studies on the effects of radio frequency radiation such as 
from transmitters or wireless telephones phones were inconclusive 
though the report said that statistically significant levels of 
leukemia among amateur radio operators requires further examination 
the report said laboratory animal studies show there are a 
number biological effects from electromagnetic fields but it is 
not clear how these effects could lead to cancer these effects 
include changes in the replication of the genetic material of cells 
and changes in cell division 
however the report notes in view of these laboratory 
studies there is reason to believe that the findings of 
carcinogenicity in humans are biologically plausible 
the report said that further study is needed with specific 
attention to dose levels and characteristics of electromagnetic 
radiation before a firm conclusion could be drawn about the cancer 
effects 
at least 22 studies many of them nearing completion are 
exploring various aspects of how electromagnetic radiation 
generated by the flow of electricity or from radio transmitters 
could cause cancer the report said

the commission of fine arts is ending a 
quartercentury of controversy by approving a 47 million memorial 
to president franklin d roosevelt 
frances campbell executive director of the franklin delano 
roosevelt memorial commission said friday the arts panels vote in 
favor of a modified design by san francisco landscape architect 
lawrence halprin will enable the longdelayed memorial to be 
completed by 1995 
halprins design calls for long sequences of paved walkways and 
shaded exterior rooms containing sculptures and inscriptions 
dealing with various aspects of roosevelts four terms as 
president from the great depression in the early 1930s through 
world war ii 
roosevelt died of a cerebral hemorrhage in warm springs ga on 
april 12 1945 less than a month before nazi germany surrendered 
to the western allies and the soviet union 
the proposed memorial will have a gardenesque quality with 
roughhewn granite walls fountains pools and waterfalls on a site 
in west potomac park within sight of the potomac river close to 
the southeastern edge of the tidal basin about 400 yards west of 
the jefferson memorial 
left undecided is the fate of the only existing roosevelt 
memorial a simple block of white stone with plaque in a small 
triangular park in front of the national archives building on 
pennsylvania avenue 
efforts to build a suitable memorial to the 32nd president date 
to the mid1950s two previous designs for abstract monuments were 
withdrawn in the 1960s after much criticism one was denounced as 
instant stonehenge and the project languished for lack of 
money 
congress appropriated 58 million last fall to begin 
construction on the condition that the fine arts commission take 
another look at halprins design which the panel originally 
approved in 1979

the percentage of delayed passenger flights 
has not improved since 1987 when airlines first were required to 
disclose their performance a congressional study says 
the study released friday by the general accounting office 
criticizes the government reporting system for failing to show how 
late flights are and said some flights are not accurately reported 
by the airlines 
since september 1987 ontime performance logged by the 
transportation departments monthly reports has ranged from a low 
of 66 percent in december 1987 to a high of 86 percent in september 
1988 the data is based on reports airlines are required to file 
with the government 
in 1988 20 percent of all flights were late last year late 
flights increased to 24 percent the gao said 
airline industry and government officials agree that most flight 
delays are due to poor weather and that airport congestion is a 
growing factor delays generally are greater in winter months 
transportation secretary samuel skinner on thursday said that if 
something is not done about airport capacity the number of 
airports experiencing 20000 annual hours of delay will increase 
from 21 now to 39 by 1997 
a flight is considered on time if it departs or arrives within 
15 minutes of its scheduled time

portauprince haiti ap business and labor organizations 
declared today a day of mourning and called for a oneday strike to 
protest an attack on the governing council of state that killed a 
union leader 
the 19member civilian council which governs alongside 
president ertha pascaltrouillot said it would meet today with 
leaders of the 11 institutions it represents to discuss the climate 
of insecurity in the country 
the council was preparing to meet thursday when four gunmen 
two wearing army uniforms and two in civilian clothes burst into 
the courtyard of the hotel santos and opened fire with m16 
automatic rifles killing union activist jeanmarie montes 
two politicians council member serge villard and emmanuel 
mani a member of the socialist national progressive party were 
wounded in the attack they were hospitalized and reported to be 
out of danger 
the assault cast doubt on the fragile civilian governments plan 
to hold presidential elections in september 
the chamber of commerce and industry declared today a day of 
mourning and urged people to stay home from work the proposal 
gained the support of the autonomous union of haitian workers and 
the radical labor union 
the army high command condemned the thursday attack and promised 
to track down the assailants and bring them to justice 
the us embassy called the assault an act of barbarism 
against the entire democratic process and against the aspirations 
of the haitian people for secure and free elections 
haitis last independently run elections were aborted on nov 
29 1987 when armybacked thugs shot and hacked to death at least 
34 voters at polling stations 
the apparent involvement of soldiers in thursdays attack cast 
further doubt on the armys intentions as haiti moves toward 
establishing what would be its first democratically elected 
government since independence from france in 1804 
the army high command has pledged to support mrs 
pascaltrouillot she was appointed president in march to replace 
military ruler lt gen prosper avril who fled into exile after a 
weeklong popular uprising 
but skeptics have questioned the willingness of the notoriously 
illdisciplined and corrupt army to relinquish privileges gained 
over many years 
mrs pascaltrouillot did not comment on the attack her last 
public statement was on monday when she said illness had forced 
her to cancel a scheduled meeting with un secretarygeneral

the western allies led by the united states 
have rejected a soviet proposal that a united germany wait five 
years before it has the right to join nato 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze made the pitch during 
unification talks friday involving the four world war ii allies and 
the two german states 
shevardnadze also proposed pulling us soviet british and 
french troops out of berlin within six months of a german merger 
which could take place by the end of year that proposal also was 
rejected by the united states 
the issue of a united germanys military status has been a 
stumbling block in the drive to unification of west germany a 
member of the usbacked north atlantic treaty organization and 
former communist east germany which has been in the sovietled 
warsaw pact 
the united states wants the new country to be a member of nato 
but the soviets have balked at that idea 
another unification hurdle was cleared friday when the upper 
house of the west german parliament approved the treaty that will 
merge the economies of the german states on july 2 the accord had 
been approved a day earlier by the lower house of parliament and 
by east german lawmakers 
government officials in bonn speaking on condition of 
anonymity said an allgerman election was most likely dec 9 
shevardnadze said he hoped agreement on unification could be 
reached by the end of the year 
secretary of state james a baker iii told reporters the soviet 
plan for an allied troop pullout from berlin which is expected to 
become germanys capital again would leave the city surrounded by 
380000 soviet troops 
as for all of germany shevardnadze proposed a 50 percent 
reduction in foreign forces over five years from east and west 
germany and then over an unspecified period removing all of them 
except token contingents 
over a fiveyear transitional period shevardnadze said east 
and west germany would be obliged to maintain all concluded 
international treaties and agreements now in effect western 
diplomats interpreted this statement as a soviet attempt to delay 
nato membership for the merged germany 
currently west germany is in nato and east germany is a member 
of the sovietled warsaw pact 
a senior west german official speaking on condition of 
anonymity told reporters that although his government was opposed 
to a transition period there might be room for a windingdown 
process 
the ministers agreed to meet in paris on july 17 to consider 
polands concern about its border with germany about onethird of 
polish territory today was ceded to it from germany after world war 
ii 
both german parliaments this week approved a declaration that a 
unified germany will respect polands current border at the 
oderneisse rivers 
meanwhile west germany said friday it will guarantee a bank 
credit of about 31 billion for the soviet union to help president 
mikhail s gorbachev reform his countrys ailing economy it is 
also seen as an attempt to allay soviet concerns about german 
unification 
chief government spokesman hans klein said the 12year bank 
credit marks the start of a west german initiative to get 
largescale international support for the soviet union 
in a related development west german chancellor helmut kohl and 
french president francois mitterrand called friday for quick 
economic help to support soviet reforms and the rebuilding of 
eastern europe

a chemical cousin of the tranquilizer 
valium and a chinese herbal root long used to induce abortions are 
among dozens of drugs being tested to fight aids researchers 
reported 
doctors described the search for new aids drugs friday at the 
sixth international conference on aids which continues through the 
weekend 
the valium derivative called tibo was found when scientists 
from the institute for medical research in leuven belgium 
screened hundreds of compounds for potential power against aids 
dr rudi pauwels said tibo blocks viral reproduction at levels 
100 times lower than ddc and 3000 times lower than ddi those two 
stillexperimental aids drugs are nearing approval for routine use 
tibo is in early stages of human testing in europe 
the drugs provide hope to infected people who cannot tolerate 
azt the only medicine approved for routine use in people infected 
with hiv the virus that causes aids 
many doctors believe a combination of medicines not just a 
single drug will provide the best chance of keeping healthy the 
estimated 1 million to 15 million americans with hiv 
while doctors and scientists listened to highly technical talks 
inside moscone center demonstrators outside held the latest of 
what have been daily thematic protests 
the focus of fridays action by the aids coalition to unleash 
power or act up was a contention that women children and 
minorities are excluded from research treatment and other services 
women made up most of the more than 200 people at the march and 
diein which resulted in about 140 arrests for blocking an 
intersection 
among the most controversial presentations of the fiveday 
meeting was a report on compound q the chinese herbal medicine 
the treatment is being tested by a community group outside the 
usual control of medical schools and hospitals that ordinarily 
evaluate new medicines 
at this stage we have seen a major and dramatic change in 
what happens to these patients said martin delaney 
delaney is director of san franciscos project inform a group 
that advocates quickly giving people with aids any available 
information about potential medicines 
in its experiment the group has tested compound q on 46 
patients for 116 days before the treatment their helper t cells 
the primary target of the aids virus had been steadily declining 
but after treatment the loss stopped or even reversed itself in 38 
of them 
dr arnold relman editor of the new england journal of 
medicine called delaney irresponsible for releasing his conclusion 
without providing data to back it 
compound q apparently works by stopping infected blood cells 
known as macrophages from manufacturing new copies of the aids 
virus 
another new class of drugs being developed at roche products 
ltd in england takes a different approach dr noel roberts said 
the medicine inhibits the production of viral protease an enzyme 
the virus uses to cut up the proteins that it uses to build new 
copies of itself 
at fridays session researchers also presented data about 
potential aids vaccines 
closest to widespread testing are vaccines that will boost the 
immune system of people who are already infected with the aids 
virus or help prevent infected women from spreading the microbe to 
their children during pregnancy 
further off are vaccines that will keep uninfected people from 
catching the virus 
wayne koff chief of the aids vaccine research branch at the 
national institute of allergy and infectious diseases said the 
most promising human vaccines should be ready for largescale 
testing in two or three years and it will take two or three more 
years to determine their effectiveness 
so were still looking at the midtolate 1990s as a minimal 
time frame for selection of a vaccine for general use koff said 
i think there is reason to be more optimistic now in 1990 
than at any previous international aids conference he said 
some 30 approaches toward the development of vaccines are being 
studied koff said and half a dozen vaccines are being tested or 
are about to be tried in humans

in south africa we believe that if the women were in the 
forefront we would have long won our freedom she said friday 
with a smile winning a roar of appreciation from 200 women active 
in civic and religious organizations 
one of our greatest priorities is womens rights she said 
at the gathering in a brooklyn church 
unless and until we are empowered through a plan of 
affirmative action our national liberation will not be complete 
actress cicely tyson was host at a tribute to the wife of 
apartheid fighter nelson mandela that included a performance by 
sweet honey in the rock an acapella group known for liberation 
songs 
at the end of three rousing numbers mrs mandela embraced each 
of the groups six members 
mrs mandela reiterated her request for support of warfare if 
negotiations with the white rulers of south africa break down 
if talks fall apart and they very well might we know you will 
be there to take up arms with us mrs mandela told a soldout 
crowd of 2000 at the tribute 
her appearances in brooklyn raised about 60000 for the anc 
organizers said 
among mrs mandelas other separate activities was an appearance 
on phil donahues syndicated show that aired friday in new york and 
other selected cities but will not be broadcast in the rest of 
country until monday 
mrs mandela condemned necklacing the killing of south 
african government collaborators by lighting gasolinesoaked tires 
around their necks 
mrs mandela has been quoted as having said at a 1986 rally in 
south africa with our boxes of matches and our necklaces we 
shall liberate this country 
she said the statement was reported completely out of 
context and added no sane person would ever approve of that 
as for whether she approves of violence mrs mandela asserted 
that we have no violence to renounce the method used by the

thieves can steal a general motors corp car 
faster than the time it takes to watch a camaro commercial say 
police officials in some of the nations largest cities 
police faced with a younger generation of thieves blame gm 
steering columns for making the companys cars the easiest to heist 
thieves are not brain surgeons said michael graziose a new 
york detective it takes someone who dropped out of high school 
30 seconds to steal one of those cars 
los angeles police chief daryl f gates said in a letter to gm 
that children as young as 12 are easily outwitting the present 
security design system of your vehicles 
concerned gm executives summoned police to detroit in april to 
discuss the trend after the meeting the automaker said it would 
include antitheft electronic keys as standard equipment on nearly 
all 1994 cars and alter the muchmaligned steering columns which 
also are used in some chrysler corp models 
the company also plans structural changes in its steering 
columns said robert stempel gms chairmanelect he declined to 
be specific however saying technical details would tip thieves 
off on how to penetrate the new columns 
its not an endall to the theft problem but it helps 
stempel said in a recent interview 
until the changes are in place however gm will produce 
hundreds of thousands of cars police say are exceptionally 
vulnerable to theft 
general motors the worlds largest automaker made 74 of the 
top 100 cars and trucks on a nationwide moststolen list compiled 
by ccc information services inc of chicago which estimates the 
value of stolen and damaged vehicles for insurers 
ford motor co had three vehicles in the top 100 the other big 
three automaker chrysler had none 
last years most popular theft target was the gmmade 1986 
chevrolet camaro followed by camaros made in 1987 1984 and 1985 
according to ccc

women dominated a protest that brought 140 
arrests outside the international aids conference to dramatize 
activists complaints that research is too maleoriented 
were here because women with aids are not getting access to 
drug treatment trials said kate bollard a member of seattles 
chapter of act up the aids activist group women are being only 
looked at as people who transmit the virus not as people who have 
the virus 
the friday arrests came after several hundred protesters blocked 
traffic in a downtown shopping district they brought total arrests 
during four days of protest to 299 at the sixth international 
conference on aids at the moscone center which has been shielded 
from protesters by tight security 
the only incident inside came friday morning when demonstrators 
held up a banner reading niaid form a womens committee 
during a speech by an official with the national institute of 
allergy and infectious diseases 
outside marchers echoed the theme chanting a number of women 
tied themselves to police barricades with red paper chains as 
others chanted nih we think youre vile we need clinical 
trials 
the call refers to the national institutes of healths human 
testing of experimental drugs mostly on men 
speakers also included those advocating rights for prostitutes 
carol leigh a prostitute from san francisco complained that women 
of her profession are unfairly perceived as aids carriers and 
persecuted 
dressed in a gay 90s music hall dress and a red feather boa 
leigh said prostitutes help stop the spread of disease by using 
condoms 
prostitutes are safe sex educators she said 
the protest wound through crowded lunchtime streets chanting 
and blowing whistles finally halting for a diein at a busy 
intersection 
ignoring police warnings a group of protesters remained in the 
intersection police began the long process of arresting them as 
noon shoppers and other demonstrators looked on 
when the arrests were completed a second group of demonstrators 
ran back into the street bringing back police for another series 
of arrests all those taken into custody were charged with failure 
to disperse 
many shoppers were trapped on the street until police finished 
the arrests most watched patiently but some expressed frustration 
with the week of demonstrations that have tied up the city 
i was gassed at berkeley in the 60s so i can sympathize with 
them said lillian schneiderman a shopper from the eastern bay 
area but this is not focusing the issues where it needs to be

nelson mandela warned during a speech at 
the united nations against underestimating south africas white 
supremacists 
mandela received a standing ovation friday as he and his wife 
winnie entered the general assembly hall packed with delegates and 
guests on the couples third and last day in new york 
the united nations secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
told the crowd that the south african black nationalist leader is 
in his own house today 
mandela drew a burst of applause when he offered greetings to 
the peoples of palestine fighting for liberation and human 
rights we commend their struggles to you he said 
the african national congress will not relent or falter in the 
pursuit of that common vision which should result in the 
transformation of south africa into a country of democracy justice 
and peace mandela said in a 20minute speech 
to that end he said we strongly urge that there should be no 
relaxation of existing measures the sanctions that have been 
imposed by the united nations and by individual governments should 
remain in place 
mandela 71 acknowledged the united nations effort to do away 
with apartheid south africas system of racial segregation and to 
win the freedom of political prisoners including himself 
mandela praised south african president fw de klerk and his 
colleagues as people of integrity in their negotiations with 
the anc toward ending apartheid 
we have to overcome the mistrust that exists on both sides and 
reinforce the understanding that the only victory we should all 
seek is the victory of the people as a whole and not the victory 
of one party over another mandela said 
he said however that white racists in south africa were still 
determined to preserve apartheid some because they are 
ideologically committed to it and others because they fear black 
majority rule 
we cannot afford to underestimate the threat that these 
defenders of a brutal and continuing reality pose to the whole 
process of working towards a just political settlement mandela 
said 
in johannesburg south africa a newspaper reported friday that 
police arrested and later freed 11 whites for questioning about a 
rightwing plot to assassinate mandela de klerk and others 
i am too busy doing what i think is constructive work to worry 
about threats to my life mandela said in response to a question 
about the plot 
a spokesman for south africas un mission jonathan etienne 
fourie would not comment on mandelas speech saying his 
government chooses to stay within the framework of a constant 
dialogue with mr mandela back home

donors have pledged 200 million in 
development aid for namibia far short of the 800 million sought 
for the african nation that recently acheived independence from 
south africa 
the united states pledged only 10 million but foreign minister 
theo ben gurirab told a news conference after the pledges were made 
friday that he is grateful and satisfied 
he declined to criticize the united states and other nations for 
pledging more to emerging eastern european democracies than to 
africas newest democracy which became independent three months 
ago 
ben gurirab said that about 50 countries made pledges but 
further details were not yet compiled by un officials 
obviously we would have been happier with 800 million in 
pledges he said but we are not disappointed 
ben gurirab asked about the level of us aid we are aware 
of the disparities but our idea has been to encourage countries to 
have a look at us as a government and see our development strategy 
and decide for themselves 
we are not going to change policies and ideologicial 
perspectives be we want the world to see us as an emerging 
democracy he said 
south africa pledged 10 million he said he said his 
government wants to negotiate with south africa about the debt 
which the pretoria government claims is owed by namibia to south 
african individuals and companies 
he said his government also will negotiate with south africa 
about the return of the south african walvis bay enclave in namibia 
and insist on its return 
namibia he said is seeking membership in the international 
monetary fund and other lending institutions but he said that 
namibias currency still is based on the south african rand and it 
has no independent monetary policy 
he said he expected namibian currency to be based on the rand 
for about two years and said that namibia would not involve itself 
in borrowing until it has its own currency

robin hud the former real estate agent who 
bilked federal housing programs of about 6 million requested and 
got a stiff sentence but her lawyer plans to appeal anyway 
marilyn harrell was sentenced friday to a 46month prison term 
by us district judge herbert murray who said he did not believe 
her claim that she turned over most of the money to charity 
harrell said of the sentence i asked for it because i deserve 
it her lawyer anthony gallagher said he will appeal 
harrell 46 pleaded guilty in january to stealing money from 
the sale of houses owned by the department of housing and urban 
development and filing a false tax return 
in addition to prison she was sentenced to three years 
probation and 624 hours of community service and ordered to pay 
600000 in restitution she was also ordered to serve a concurrent 
oneyear sentence on the tax charge harrell will not be eligible 
for parole 
prosecutors convinced murray to refigure the federal sentencing 
guideline formula used to determine her sentence from 30 to 37 
months to 37 to 46 months in doing do murray agreed with 
prosecutors that harrell actually gave less than a fifth of what 
she stole to charity 
gallagher asked for a 16month sentence with half of that to be 
served in a halfway house 
harrell who had asked the judge for the maximum under the 
sentencing guidelines emerged from the courthouse smiling i 
think its fair and im delighted which is what tony told me not 
to say harrell said 
earlier harrell told the judge just prior to sentencing i 
have never said what i did was right in fact if a person steals 5 
cents then they should be done with whatever the court sees fit 
we got what we asked for you have to be satisfied with 
that assistant us attorney gary jordan said 
us attorney general dick thornburgh has called the case the 
largest theft of federal funds by an individual harrell became a 
symbol of mismanagement at hud during the reagan administration 
the actual size of the theft and how much harrell gave to 
charity were not resolved friday harrell has admitted stealing 
57 million and claimed she gave more than 5 million away 
prosecutors said she failed to turn in to huds washington 
office about 66 million from the sale of 99 properties between 
1985 and 1988 and gave about 11 million to charity 
about 490000 worth of property she owned has already been 
forfeited to hud she now owes about 110000 
several witnesses testified friday to harrells generosity 
i had been in contact with several homes and every one turned 
me down except marilyn said carol ann swift a double amputee 
who lived at a womens home that harrell supported with government 
funds she gave me a house and went and got me clothes because i 
had lost over 88 pounds

northrop corp unveiled 
its version of a futuristic jet that can dogfight at supersonic 
speed and hide from radar but it may get shot down by 
congressional budget cutters 
the twintail twinengine yf23 prototype was rolled out friday 
before a crowd of cheering northrop workers 
the air force wants to build a fleet of the 750 advanced 
tactical fighters or atfs that will fly into the next century 
a corporate team led by northrop is competing against lockheed 
corp but the issue may be moot if congress decides the aircraft 
is not needed because of easing world tensions 
us rep les aspin dwis chairman of the house armed 
services committee has suggested upgrades of the f15 and f16 
fighters instead 
defense secretary dick cheney in a costcutting move recently 
delayed the requested startup of production for the atf until 1996 
air force officials argue the need for a modernized air fleet 
although eastwest tensions have eased the world situation remains 
fluid and potentially dangerous the air force argues 
the sophisticated attributes advertised for the atf include 
radarevading stealth capability combined with high maneuverability 
and the ability to cruise at supersonic speeds for extended periods 
of time 
the atf contract would translate to thousands of jobs and a more 
secure financial future for whichever team of companies wins it 
northrop is teamed with mcdonnell douglas against lockheed and 
boeing in a competition for the contract lockheeds version the 
yf22 will be unveiled later this summer 
the team of lockheed and boeing would produce the airplanes in 
georgia the northrop and mcdonnell douglas team would build the 
planes in california 
the atf would replace the air forces current air superiority 
fighter the mcdonnell douglas f15 eagle 
each team has spent about 600 million on producing two 
prototypes apiece and the pentagon has matched the funding of each 
team 
kent kresa chief executive officer and president of northrop 
hailed the aircraft as an example of americas leadership in 
aviation in an era when american competitiveness is being 
tested continually worldwide 
estimated cost of the atf is 51 million per plane fighters 
such as the f15 cost a little more than half that to build 
air force officials contend the aircraft is necessary because of 
the advancing age of its current inventory of fighter aircraft and 
because they say the atf along with the b2 stealth bomber is a 
revolutionary aircraft 
general ronald w yates commander of the air force systems 
command said the fighter prototype unveiled friday represents the 
worlds most advanced technologies in engines avionics and 
materials 
he noted the f15 eagle would be nearly 30 years old when atf 
planes enter service the air force program manager for atf said 
that a quality edge helped safeguard national security 
weve never fought a war where we didnt enjoy air 
superiority said brig gen james a fain jr i dont think 
america would stand for sending its sons and daughters to a war 
where we didnt have air superiority

the zodiac gunman picked his latest victim 
because of his astrological sign and claims to be the serial killer 
who operated in the san francisco bay area for 19 years police say 
despite that claim which came in a letter received friday by 
the new york post investigators said the gunman is not believed to 
be the san francisco zodiac killer who took responsibility for up 
to 40 murders and was never captured 
police confirmed the letter was written by the same person who 
is believed to have shot four men in new york on recent thursday 
mornings including a 30yearold homeless man wounded as he slept 
on a central park bench the post said 
the three other men also survived 
the central park victim told detectives friday he was befriended 
days before the shooting by a stranger who asked him his birth 
date chief of detectives joseph borrelli said 
the wounded mans description of the stranger matches an earlier 
description of zodiac an unkempt black man between the ages 
of 30 to 35 about 6 feet tall with a moustache and possibly a 
beard 
the san francisco killer was described as a white man 25 to 40 
years old with blond or red hair 
police also say the handwriting in the san francisco letters is 
different from the new york letters 
the letter the post received friday was mailed thursday and was 
postmarked in brooklyn in the letter the gunman disputed reports 
suggesting he wasnt the san francisco zodiac killer said jerry 
nachman the posts editor 
the letter read in part fourth sign dead shoot in central 
park white man sleeping on bench with little black bag shoot in 
chest june 21 1990 352 am nachman said 
in fact the latest victim was black and he did not die police 
said 
the cryptic letter was emblazoned with a drawing of the 
crosshairs of a gunsight and a circle with four pieshaped wedges 
marked off each containing a crude astrological sign 
the gunman had also scrawled the name faust on the lined 
white looseleaf paper a reference to the philosopher of legend who 
sells his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge and power 
in previous notes the gunman claimed responsibility for three 
other shootings on the brooklynqueens border since march the 
birth dates of the other three victims correspond to astrological 
signs scrawled in notes written by the gunman borrelli said 
in an earlier note to police dated nov 19 1989 the gunman 
threatened to terrorize the city by killing 12 people one for 
each astrological sign 
borrelli said detectives were concerned the gunman may choose 
future victims by their astrological signs and urged anyone who had 
been asked their birth date by a stranger matching the gunmans 
description to call police 
fifty detectives are now working on the case the daily news 
reported today

palestinian guerrilla leader mohammad abbas 
said today he and his faction are prepared to accept any 
disciplinary action by plo chief yasser arafat for the raid they 
staged on an israeli beach last month 
the raid and arafats refusal to condemn it led to this 
weeks suspension of us dialogue with the palestine liberation 
organization 
abbas better known as abu abbas said in a statement 
distributed to international news agencies in baghdad that he had 
given arafat a complete file on the attack plans to show it was 
aimed at military targets 
the tel aviv shore was crowded with holiday beachgoers at the 
time of the may 30 seaborne attack by 16 guerrillas of abbas 
palestine liberation front israeli forces foiled the raid and 
there were no israeli casualties 
abbas said he had agreed that arafat could take any measure he 
sees as necessary to protect the national achievements of our 
people 
he accused the bush adminstration of using the raid as a pretext 
to cut off the 18month dialogue wednesday with the plo and 
humiliate the organization and its leaders 
abbas who masterminded the 1985 hijacking of the cruise ship 
achille lauro in which a disabled american was killed said his 
group would continue its armed struggle against israel 
i hereby declare that we are insisting on confronting the 
zionist enemy and fighting for the freedom of our people he 
said nothing will stop us but martyrdom or freedom 
meanwhile saudi arabia urged the bush administration to 
reconsider its decision 
the kingdom of saudi arabia expresses its deep regret at the 
suspension of the dialogue and appeals to the government of the 
united states of america to revise its declared decision in this 
connection and continue its efforts for negotiation and dialogue 
for settlement of conflicts said a statement carried by the 
official saudi press agency

poland has welcomed a german resolution 
this week recognizing polands postwar borders but says a treaty 
formalizing it should be written before germany unifies 
government spokeswoman malgorzata niezabitowska said friday the 
resolution adopted by both german parliaments is an important 
step in the solution of this matter 
but poland wants a treaty setting the rivers oder and niesse as 
polands western border with germany 
it has been and still is important for us that the treaty 
should be agreed upon before unification and signed after it ms 
niezabitowska said 
technical work on the pact has begun 
the resolution gives up all german claims to the onethird of 
modern poland forfeited by germany after world war ii the 
territory was meant to compensate poland for an even larger 
territory to the east annexed by the soviet union 
the rapid drive toward german unification has caused some alarm 
to poles the victims of german aggression during world war ii 
at first poland was not included in the negotiations between 
the two germanys and the victorious world war ii allies the 
united states the soviet union france and great britain 
poland protested and was invited to the unification talks in 
paris in july to present its border concerns 
west german chancellor helmut kohl had initially refused to 
address the border issue saying only a united germany could

cambodia has set up a commission to 
help the search for the remains of us soldiers killed there 
during the vietnam war cambodian state radio said today 
the broadcast said the cabinet recently established the fiveman 
commission led by a deputy interior minister khim pom 
the commissions task it said is to get in touch with 
concerned authorities in the provinces and to cooperate with us 
delegations and specialists in the search for remains of american 
soldiers reported missing in cambodia 
the vietnam war spilled over into neighboring cambodia in 1970 
as us forces moved to cut off supply routes for vietnamese 
communist fighters about 80 americans are listed as missing in 
action there 
the war ended in 1975 with communist victories in vietnam 
cambodia and laos 
there has been virtually no work on resolving the cases in 
cambodia because the united states does not recognize the current 
government which vietnam installed after invading in late 1978 
the united states backs guerrillas fighting the government 
cambodias prime minister hun sen has said his country has 
remains of us soldiers and is ready to turn them over and 
cooperate in joint searches for other remains 
but he has insisted that an official us delegation come to 
retrieve the remains washington appears to have refused that 
demand

the us aircraft carrier midway its firefighting 
equipment replenished and crew members rested after a shipboard 
explosion that killed two will return to sea in the next few days 
a navy official said today 
the navy was conducting routine investigations to determine 
whether foul play caused wednesdays blast which seriously injured 
nine crew members said cmdr mark d neuhart public affairs 
officer for the 7th fleet 
we expect shell be under way by early next week neuhart 
said but he denied japanese press reports quoting unidentified 
navy sources saying the 67000ton ship would leave the us navy 
base at yokosuka on monday he declined to say what the midways 
mission would be 
the midway docked thursday at yokosuka 28 miles southwest of 
tokyo after its crew spent most of the night cooling down the 
small storeroom where the explosion occurred 
the blast came after noon wednesday as a firefighting crew 
opened the hatch to investigate smoke 
all the casualties were among the firefighters 
neuhart said two small teams of investigators were looking 
through the debris and interviewing witnesses among the crew of 
4500 
one team is trying to find out the cause of the explosion and 
steps taken after the blast the other is looking into the 
possibility of foul play 
but theres no indication of foul play its just 
routine he said 
an unidentified crewman interviewed on japanese television said 
a fuel pipe near a steam line beside the storeroom cracked and 
leaked fuel which then ignited navy officials earlier said the 
steam connected to the ships catapult system for launching 
planes was heated to 850 degrees fahrenheit 
theres all kinds of possibilities neuhart said we know 
there was heat steam and smoke no flame was seen but that 
doesnt necessarily mean there wasnt a fire 
results of the investigation probably wont be known for several 
weeks he said 
dozens of protesters have demanded the midway leave japan 
because they contend nuclear weapons are aboard 
neuhart said he would not confirm nor deny the presence or 
absence of nuclear weapons 
six seriously burned sailors were flown friday to the brooke 
army medical center burn unit in san antonio and a seventh was too 
ill to be moved he remained in the naval hospital in yokosuka 
along with two others in serious condition 
the navy has identified the dead sailors as ulric patrick 
johnson 20 of martinez calif and jeffrey allan vierra 20 of

chancellor helmut kohl plans to travel 
to moscow in late july bearing a multibilliondollar economic aid 
package for the moribund soviet economy west germanys leading 
news magazine reported today 
the hamburgbased der spiegel said the generous western 
economic credit would total between 15 billion and 19 billion 
most of that would be guaranteed by the west german government the 
weekly said in its monday edition portions of which were made 
available to other media today 
a government spokesman in bonn denied the report der spiegels 
reports have on occasion proven correct after being denied by the 
government 
on friday the government confirmed it would back a west german 
bank credit of 31 billion to help the soviet economy shift from 
central planning to freemarket rule 
chief government spokesman hans klein said the 12year bank 
credit marked the start of a west german initiative to urge 
largescale international support for the soviet union 
der spiegel said kohl hoped to ease soviet concerns about nato 
membership for a united germany which moscow has opposed despite 
pressure from the western allies 
the strategic stance of a united germany is one of the biggest 
obstacles remaining to be worked out before german unification 
der spiegel said kohls visit to moscow would probably be either 
july 24 or july 25 it would be kohls second meeting this year 
with gorbachev in february the two met in the soviet capital 
the chancellor has no such plans for such a journey the 
government spokesman in bonn said on condition of anonymity 
the spokesman also called the billions in western economic 
credit cited by the magazine pure speculation 
thats too much for a country like germany though we have a 
strong economy he said 
kohl meets with the 11 other leaders of the european economic 
community in dublin monday and tuesday in july the world economic 
summit will be held in houston where kohl and other leaders of the 
seven major industrialized democracies will gather for annual talks 
the west german leader said friday after meeting with french 
president francois mitterrand that international economic support 
for the soviet union was desperately needed and that he would seek 
such support at the summits 
mitterrand agreed but neither leader specified how much was 
being considered

when lisa capaldini was in medical school they taught her all 
about curing and they talked about conditions that were curable 
it was only after she began working with hiv disease that she 
learned the value of healing 
im often asked by friends and fellow health providers how i 
can manage my practice with people with hiv disease said the 
softspoken physician who divides her time between indigents and 
people with aids in san franciscos tenderloin district 
dont i have a sense of futility and given that right now we 
dont have a cure for aids isnt all the stuff im doing simply 
pouring my energy into a leaky bucket 
i certainly dont feel that way i feel that every time 
someone comes to see me hopefully theres an opportunity for me to 
find some way to help them and that helping may be nothing more 
than respectful listening and acknowledging that things are 
difficult and frustrating 
when someone comes to me i always have this feeling that 
isnt this man or woman going to be mad at me that i cant cure 
them i cant fix them thats what they came here for and here i 
am telling them i dont think we can do something about this and 
im sorry 
im amazed to say no one has ever expressed anger to me about 
that instead what ive heard back is thank you for listening or 
thank you for being honest

hoverspeed great britain completed a 
recordbreaking sprint across the atlantic saturday lowering the 
best time for a passenger ship by two hours and 48 minutes the 
owners said 
the ship passed the bishop rock light off the isles of scilly at 
14 seconds after 825 am local time or three days seven hours 
and 52 minutes after departing from new york said brian reese a 
spokesman for the hoverspeed project in london 
the record had been held by the ss united states which made 
the crossing in three days 10 hours and 40 minutes in july 1952 
john lloyd captain of the 242foot craft said he expected to 
claim the hales trophy despite controversy over the ships design 
hoverspeed project spokeswoman lynn harvey said the hales trust 
keeper of the trophy had confirmed last year that hoverspeed great 
britain was eligible 
however she said the curators of the mercantile marine museum 
on long island ny where the trophy is kept maintain it was not 
valid because the catamaran will not operate a transatlantic 
service and had no passengers aboard for the record run 
hoverspeed great britain made its crossing with a 10man british 
and australian crew 
the tasmanianbuilt catamaran propelled by diesel engines and 
water jets and capable of 40 knots averaged 366 knots on the 
crossing reese said 
hoverspeed great britain was designed to carry 90 cars and 450 
passengers across the english channel between portstmouth england 
and cherbourg france the first of five of the design it is

the government has released the last of 22 
political detainees held without trial for more than three years 
under security measures that date to british colonial rule 
the 22 were arrested in may 1987 for allegedly forming a 
clandestine communist network aimed at overthrowing the 
government and establishing a marxist state 
authorities accused them of infiltrating an opposition party a 
lawyers association the roman catholic church and an amateur 
theatrical company 
the last of the detainees 43yearold vincent cheng was given 
his conditional release from prison tuesday 
but cheng and at least 15 other former detainees are still 
subject to restrictions on their freedom of expression association 
and movement 
cheng and the others were arrested under the internal security 
act which allows for arrest without charge and indefinite 
detention without trial no evidence has to be made public against 
those detained 
british colonial authorities introduced the security act in 1948 
to deal with a communist insurrection in what was then malaya 
singapore was part of the independent malaysian federation until it 
withdrew in 1965 
the internal security act can still be used by authorities in 
malaysia and singapore to detain anyone considered to be a risk to 
national security 
opposition members in the parliaments of both countries say the 
need for such sweeping powers has long passed some contend that 
authorities have used the internal security act to suppress 
legitimate dissent 
deputy prime minister goh chok tong who is scheduled to take 
over from prime minister lee kuan yew in november said i know 
that the isa is a powerful tool and in the wrong hands can do 
harm but i also know that singapore cannot be governed without the 
isa 
human rights groups in britain and the united states have said 
that arrests in recent years under the security act have been 
politically inspired 
the communist insurgency formally ended nov 26 when ceasefire 
agreements among the guerrillas and the malaysian and thai 
governments were signed at hat yai in southern thailand 
at that time singapores home affairs minister shunmugam 
jayakumar told parliament that even with the end of hostilities 
the security act was still needed to deal with other potential 
threats including religious extremism espionage international 
terrorism and subversion 
in kuala lumpur the malaysian capital home affairs minister 
megat junid told parliament on thursday that malaysia still held 86 
people under its internal security act 
malaysian prime minister mahathir mohamad said recently he had 
no plans to abolish the security act because it was very useful in 
a multiracial society

for a moment the shadow was gone 
mayor richard m daley strode to the comiskey park pitchers 
mound to the cheers of some 30000 fans a sundrenched welcome 
witnessed by dozens of fellow mayors from around the nation 
he tossed out the ceremonial first pitch to more applause and 
then joined his mayoral peers in the stands to watch as his citys 
white sox dropped a close game to the oakland as 
it was a sharp contrast to the last time the us conference of 
mayors met in chicago in 1968 when daleys famous father richard 
j daley was mayor and the city was bubbling with vietnamera 
social unrest 
as this years meeting unfolded last week the younger daley 
emerged from his fathers shadow even as richard j daleys legacy 
was everywhere to be seen 
when the new mayor was honored by a company that ranks americas 
most liveable cities in cooperation with the mayors conference 
the award was named after richard j daley 
and when daley was introduced as a conference speaker he was 
billed as a veteran of dozens of mayoral conferences even though he 
has attended just two as mayor the rest he attended as the son of 
richard j daley onetime conference president 
you kind of get used to saying mayor daley in this town 
said rep dan rostenkowski a chicago democrat and ally of two 
generations of mayor daleys 
daleys father was mayor from 1955 until his death in 1975 
controlling a renowned political machine that earned him the 
nickname boss 
as the son made his climb to power critics warned that he would 
try to replicate his fathers machine his political successes as 
a prosecutor and now mayor were attributed to his name not his 
abilities 
but now 14 months after becoming mayor richard m daley is 
putting a stamp of his own on chicago 
he is not without critics and his city is not without problems 
including racial tensions that were a major issue in the mayoral 
race to succeed the late harold washington who was black 
but daley has named minorities to several top posts silencing 
some of his critics and during last weeks mayors meeting he not 
only wowed his guests with a string of social extravaganzas costly 
1 million but he also emerged as one of the groups most vocal 
advocates for more federal aid 
at one event he spoke bluntly but forcefully about the burden 
cities face in caring for cocaineaddicted babies 
im supposed to treat these people he said im supposed 
to educate these people im supposed to give them a job we 
cant do it alone its impossible 
and in a city known for its toughness the city where people 
never walk away from a possible fight rostenkowski says daley 
looks and plays the part 
he travels with a large security contingent and usually arrives 
late he wont win any awards for public speaking but he gets his 
point across 
during the mayors gathering he appeared equally fearless in 
taking on his critics or walking under the watchful eyes of his 
peers onto the ballfield where even popular politicians can get 
booed by fiesty fans 
hes comfortable now coming into his own said a daley 
political aide who asked not to be identified by name there will 
always be critics because he is a daley but i think hes convinced 
most people that this isnt going to be a sequel 
daley has to run for a full term next year and appears a heavy 
favorite he has considerable support in the citys business 
community which bankrolled many of the receptions and other events 
held for the mayors these included an exclusive showing of a monet 
collection impressive nightly dinners and a barbecue before the 
ball game 
the guests had high praise for daley and his city 
richards got politics in his blood said boston mayor 
raymond flynn a college classmate of daleys he loves this 
place 
simply outstanding said joseph riley mayor of charleston 
sc how can you not be impressed

police these days are patrolling the corridors 
of capitol hill and not merely to keep order 
theyre coming to washington as lobbyists on handgun control 
semiautomatic assault rifles on labor issues 
no bill to curb assault weapons or regulate handguns is unveiled 
without a gaggle of lobbyists from police groups to stand behind 
the sponsors and assure television viewers that the measure is 
urgently needed to preserve the peace 
and while police groups do not give out campaign contributions 
they can be a help in countering the slashing directmail campaigns 
against firearms regulation that have become a trademark of the 
national rifle association 
the point is not lost on members of congress 
when im in illinois i will frequently say that i have a 
choice of being on the side of law enforcement or being on the side 
of the gun lobby and im going to stick with law enforcement 
says sen paul simon dill 
he says that is a help because the majority of the american 
people are on the side of law enforcement and theyre sympathetic 
to the police 
according to jules bernstein legislative counsel of the 
national association of police organizations the groups can be 
more help than that 
he says the associations president robert scully appeared in 
a political ad on behalf of rep louise slaughter rny assuring 
voters that she was a firm supporter of law and order issues 
bernstein says he now shows up at eight to 10 news conferences a 
year to put his seal of approval on gun legislation 
i think the coming together of all these police groups on 
capitol hill is a very healthy development says the former labor 
lobbyist 
labor issues involving police are crucial to many of the dozen 
or so police lobbying organizations at work on capitol hill 
federal legislation that would give collective bargaining rights is 
one that bernsteins group backs 
it also wants educational grants for police opposes mandatory 
medicare backs regulation of the sale of body armor dislikes 
taxing employee benefits and scorns a proposed police corps 
that would provide 40000 in reimbursed college expenses following 
four years of police work 
the number of police groups has grown gradually over the last 
few years 
they include the federal law enforcement officers association 
the fraternal order of police the international association of 
chiefs of police the international brotherhood of police officers 
and the major cities chief administrators 
also the national association of police organizations the 
national organization of black law enforcement executives the 
national sheriffs association the police executive research forum 
the police foundation and the police management association 
with labor and management both on the list not all of the 
organizations agree on every issue but they are virtually 
unanimous in calling for curbs on militarystyle assault weapons 
and a national sevenday waiting period before buyers can obtain 
handguns 
the idea of the socalled brady bill named for former white 
house press secretary james brady who has been campaigning for 
approval is to give lawmen time to run background checks on the 
buyers 
gun backers acknowledge the police as being powerful political 
opponents 
what youve seen over the past four or five years is the 
emergence of the leadership of the police fraternal organizations 
and the city police chiefs as effective spokesmen and cover for 
those who would like to vote for some kind of restrictions on 
semiautomatic assault weapons says jim baker director of 
federal affairs for the national rifle association 
as a result the gun group has been forced to fight not only the 
traditional liberal advocates of gun control but national spokesmen 
for police themselves in the dispute over assault weapons 
police groups and guncontrol advocates have not always been on 
such close terms thousands of police officers belong to the nra 
and even the firmest supporters of the brady bill and 
assaultweapons curbs concede they run into plenty of street cops 
who take a dim view of them 
but the two sides have coalesced over the years with the 
washingtonbased lobbying group handgun control inc playing a key 
role indeed in the early 1980s it retained a former fraternal 
order of police president richard boyd as a consultant to cement 
ties with law enforcement officials 
he is no longer with the group but the spadework paid off 
since then guncontrol advocates and lawmen have fought side by 
side in efforts to ban the sale of armorpiercing bullets cop 
killer bullets handgun control calls them and defeat a 1986 
measure designed to ease firearms regulation 
the alliance has been such a success that the nra a year ago was 
moved to bring hundreds of ordinary street cops to capitol hill to 
show there is another side of the story 
and nras baker says guncontrol forces have made so much hay of 
their ties to the lawmen that it may be time for another such 
demonstration 
in the short term he says wed like to bring some 300 to 
500 rank and file police officers from around the country to have 
another press conference this issue is far from over

like it or not americans are going to hear a 
lot more about flag burning its proving irresistible to hungry 
republican challengers facing entrenched opponents and a shortage 
of biting issues 
flagwaving candidates are well armed as a result of last weeks 
house vote killing a proposed constitutional amendment against flag 
desecration theyll have even more ammunition after a scheduled 
senate vote this week 
whether the tactic will work is another matter 
its ultimately going to be a dud predicts john buckley a 
republican consultant the flag is the political equivalent of 
chinese food you can get hungry for something else very fast 
by all reports public outrage over flag burning has subsided 
since the issue first erupted last year and highprofile talk 
about how politicians can use the flag issue to their advantage in 
30second attack ads has raised public skepticism and increased the 
possibility of a backlash against political opportunism 
late in the 1988 presidential campaign some of george bushs 
flag factory politics were becoming a little bit of a joke said 
conservative maverick kevin phillips they the gop have to 
watch out for that again 
in 1988 bush used a disagreement over the pledge of allegiance 
to raise questions about the patriotism of democrat michael dukakis 
democrats are determined not to let that happen again today 
they are as vocal and emotional in defending their chosen symbol 
the constitution as republicans are in pleading for flag 
protection 
there are plenty of ways to do that in 30 seconds or less say 
the experts democratic media consultant bob squier suggested a tv 
spot showing the constitution in flames 
democratic pollster harrison hickman recommends that candidates 
invoke the founding fathers im not sure what george bush knows 
about free speech that james madison and thomas jefferson didnt 
 
the republican camp meanwhile is less united on how to use the 
flag issue in this years campaigns 
president bush for example has stayed above of the fray while 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas and house republican 
whip newt gingrich of georgia have taken on the attackdog role 
the republican national committee describes flagburning as an 
american issue rather than a partisan one the chief of the house 
gop campaign committee says democratic flagwaverers will pay 
in november 
the flagprotection amendment already is surfacing as an issue 
in campaigns around the country 
in illinois for example rep lynn martin said she would use 
the flag issue to define differences between herself and democratic 
sen paul simon whom she hopes to oust in november 
i wont call him names but i think he is out of touch she 
said 
buckley a former gop spokesman said early in the controversy 
that republicans who exploit the flag issue ought to be consigned 
to intellectual hell 
there are people who know better who try to use this as an 
issue because there are so few other issues that separate democrats 
from republicans he said 
most political observers agree that the flag furor has been 
magnified by the absence of other cutting issues the collapse of 
communism deprived conservatives of one key theme they say 
howard schloss a spokesman for the democratic house campaign 
committee maintains the republicans are clinging to the flag to 
avoid more substantive issues such as the economy the environment 
education and health care 
the republicans are on the losing side of these issues so 
theyre desperate and grabbing onto things like the flag schloss 
said 
republicans who back a constitutional amendment apparently are 
in step with popular sentiment which many of them use as a 
rationale for their stand two recent national polls by gallup and 
usa today found at least twothirds of americans favor a 
constitutional amendment to protect the flag 
yet almost no one even on the gop side believes voters will 
choose candidates based on this issue alone 
the best hope for republicans will be if bush decides to put his 
clout prestige and visibility behind the failed flag amendment as 
he stumps for candidates this year analysts say 
democrats can only hope bush continues to keep a low profile 
their best bet is fading interest on the national level and an 
eventual return to the local concerns that generally shape house 
and senate races 
voters at some point are going to tell these politicians to 
knock it off and talk about jobs family and daytoday life 
said democratic party spokesman mike mccurry for the democrats 
that day cant come too soon

while nelson mandela is 
cheered abroad as the symbol of the antiapartheid struggle south 
africans debate whether his organization can or should run the 
country 
shortcomings often were overlooked when the african national 
congress was an outlawed underdog fighting the white government 
from exile for three decades 
since it was legalized in february south africans have begun 
considering how it would govern the continents most developed and 
sophisticated nation 
potential supporters newspapers rival groups and citizens of 
all races are asking questions about the accountability 
principles morality and efficiency of the anc as it changes from 
an underground liberation movement to a functioning political party 
rallies polls and political pundits indicate the anc has 
majority support among south africas 28 million blacks but it 
also has many rivals and has not had the opportunity to prove 
itself in an election 
many people wonder what the anc would stand for in a south 
africa ruled by the black majority 
socialism democracy and nationalization seem to mean different 
things to different anc leaders some of their statements send 
conflicting messages to young and often poorly organized supporters 
mandela and other leaders appeal for peace among warring black 
groups in the townships but the anc still supports a bombing and 
sabotage campaign against the government 
harry gwala the groups leader in natal province suggested may 
1 that people who have fought the anc such as black policemen 
could face firing squads under an anc government 
gwalas statement reveals the extent to which his socalled 
future peoples government will be autocratic dictatorial and 
barbaric said a statement from inkatha the ancs chief rival in 
natal where more than 600 people have been killed this year 
inkatha is not the enemy mandela said on two trips to 
natal anc leaders in the province publicly disagree 
on the eve of his international tour mandela said the only 
type of violence that we accept is organized violence in the form 
of armed action which is properly controlled and where the targets 
have been carefully selected 
the main targets continue to be black policemen and black 
township officials and their families however not government 
buildings and military installations 
a 198489 urban bombing campaign by the anc military wing killed 
or wounded three times more blacks indians and mixedrace people 
than whites 
satch nhlabathi who supports the pan africanist congress said 
its military wing does not bomb toilets railroads and shopping 
centers as the ancs wing does 
mandela acknowledged in may that the anc had tortured dissident 
members but said it was not the organizations policy and that the 
leadership had dealt with those responsible 
a few days later steve tshwete an anc guerrilla commander 
said those tortured were mutineers dealt with just as any army 
would do when faced with a mutiny 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu recommended an independent 
inquiry and declared im as firmly opposed to that kind of 
activity by the anc as i am of it being perpetrated by the 
government 
several prominent supporters have said that because of years of 
exile when the leaders could not consult the people they wished to 
represent the ancs operating methods became undemocratic 
democracy became a useful cliche with little organizational 
relevance as so many activists would wait for the line from 
anc headquarters in zambia said farid esack a leading 
antiapartheid figure in the united democratic front an anc 
affiliate 
fatima meer mandelas biographer and friend said a year ago 
repeated states of emergency have driven our political 
organizations into secrecy secret control also means 
manipulations 
the influence of the communist party in the anc leadership 
unsettles the government and its white constituency most analysts 
say at least half the members of the anc leadership are communists 
but neither organization will be specific on the numbers 
mandela said the governments policy for 30 years of jailing anc 
leaders forcing them into exile and banning them from being quoted 
meant there has been nobody to explain the policies of the 
organization or to instill discipline 
his pleas for an end to blackonblack violence and for black 
children to return to school have gone unheeded 
many speakers at anc rallies preach tolerance and discipline to 
youngsters who have hijacked cars and buses to get there when the 
young people leave they often harass people who chose not to 
attend 
columnist jon qwelane of the star newspaper and other respected 
black commentators have begun to dismiss explanations and demand 
action 
i believe the measure of true leadership would be when leaders 
get together discard their personal and ideological differences 
for the time being and grasp the problem fearlessly and 
honestly qwelane wrote june 17 up to now they have not done 
that

a medical consultant and a former agency for 
international development official face possible prison terms after 
pleading guilty to charges related to alleged rigging of contracts 
to supply nonlethal aid to the nicaraguan contras 
george f kraus who was awarded 26 million in federal 
contracts pleaded guilty in federal court friday to bribing an aid 
official he was president of kraus international in new york 
the washington post citing court documents reported that kraus 
had agreed to cooperate in the governments investigation after an 
undercover agent videotaped him handing over cash last january for 
confidential information

supplying kraus with insider information and receiving more than 
11000 in return massey drafted and reviewed contract proposals 
while with aid from 1987 to 1989 
the investigation began after the aid office in honduras 
received a tip in 1988 that contracts to supply nicaraguan rebels 
with nonlethal aid were being fixed according to court records 
kraus also implicated donald f enos the no 2 aid official 
with the contra project who was sentenced in may to a year in 
prison and fined 5000 for taking 93000 in bribes from kraus 
kraus and massey are scheduled to be sentenced in september 
kraus faces a maximum prison sentence of 15 years massey faces up

lawyers for black widow killer judi 
buenoano won a stay from a federal appeals court today to block her 
monday execution claiming that floridas electric chair may 
malfunction and burn her at the stake 
a threejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals in 
atlanta issued an indefinite stay this morning and agreed to hear 
arguments later which means the death warrant will expire monday 
without an execution 
the judges on the panel were gerald b tjoflat phyllis a 
kravitch and emmett r cox according to court spokeswoman wendy 
mason 
a clerk at the atlanta court called the governors office to 
inform the state of the stay said michele russell a spokeswoman 
in tallahassee 
late friday us district judge patricia fawsett in orlando had 
rejected the arguments over the electric chair and the governors 
office immediately announced a new execution time of 901 am 
monday 
ms fawsett had granted a temporary reprieve thursday to hear 
testimony about the chair and allegations of ineffective legal 
counsel but she found after a twoday appeal hearing that lawyers 
had not proved their contention that ms buenoano would suffer 
cruel and unusual punishment during her execution that issue will 
now be considered at the appellate level 
the defense claimed that the may 4 electrocution of jesse tafero 
had tortured and burned him before the third of three jolts of 
electricity finally killed him they contended the problem was a 
faulty electrode in the headpiece placed over taferos skull and 
that it had not been fixed 
we are still concerned that our client may literally be burned 
at the stake nolas told reporters after ms fawsetts ruling 
ms buenoano 47 is known as the black widow killer because 
of the fatal poisoning of her husband the drowning of her 
paralyzed teenage son and attempted carbombing murder of a 
boyfriend she was present for the hearing and listened and watched 
attentively but showed no emotion at any of the testimony or the 
judges ruling 
ms fawsett rejected as pure speculation the testimony by 
defense expert fred leuchter that the problems in the tafero 
execution would probably be repeated 
officials for the state department of corrections testified that 
an artificial sponge in the headpiece caused the problems they 
said it had been replaced by a natural sponge and called an 
electrician as an expert witness who testified the equipment was 
working properly 
ms fawsett judge also rejected arguments of ineffective legal 
counsel during ms buenoanos 1985 trial in orlando for the arsenic 
poisoning death of her husband air force sgt james e goodyear 
in 1971 
only one woman has been executed in the united states out of 130 
persons put to death since the us supreme court lifted its ban on 
capital punishment in 1976 north carolina executed velma barfield 
in 1984 for poisoning her boyfriend

japan outinvested the united states in 1989 
for the first time as americans again failed to keep pace their 
major trading partners according to a report on competitiveness 
released saturday 
the report prepared by the council on competitiveness tracks 
us economic performance since 1970 compared with japan west 
germany great britain france canada and italy 
america is looking like an aging athlete still on top but 
trying to ignore all the younger talent that is breaking into the 
lineup said kent hughes president of the council 
in 1989 japan spent 549 billion to modernize and expand its 
industries compared with 513 billion for the united states even 
though the us economy is more than twice the size of japans 
this marks the first time that any country has outinvested 
the united states in plant and equipment in absolute terms since 
world war ii the report said 
in effect hughes said japan is putting twice the tools 
in the hands of the japanese worker 
the groups index being released in advance of the july 911 
economic summit of the group of seven industrial powers in houston 
tracks economic performance in four areas living standards worker 
productivity trade and investment 
on the positive side the united states regained its position as 
the worlds largest exporter supplanting west germany which had 
held the no 1 spot since 1986 
us exports totaled 364 billion compared with 3414 billion 
for west germany and 2739 billion for japan however americans 
are also the worlds biggest importers and the united states ran a 
1086 billion deficit the sixth year in a row the gap topped 100 
billion 
americans continued to enjoy a higher standard of living than 
residents of all of the other countries except germany however 
the other countries are catching up having increased their 
standard of living 50 percent since 1972 compared with a 34 
percent improvement in the united states 
the council founded in 1986 is composed of officials from 
business labor and higher education its goal is to improve the 
ability of american companies to compete in world markets

the red double doors of no 6 fuqiang lane are 
closed tight and knots of police eye those who pass by the 
reported home of chinas most famous political prisoner former 
communist party chief zhao ziyang 
i cant talk here said one chinese woman glancing 
nervously at the walled compound where zhao and his family are said 
to reside 
zhao chinas former premier and the man once mentioned as the 
leading contender to replace deng xiaoping as chinas senior 
leader has not been seen for 13 months 
sunday marks one year since the party central committee met to 
purge the reformminded zhao of all party posts accusing him of 
splitting the party and supporting the turmoil he was 
replaced byshanghai bureaucrat jiang zemin a political hardliner 
the turmoil referred to the studentled prodemocracy 
movement that the military crushed june 4 1989 zhao opposed the 
military intervention but was overruled by premier li peng and 
other conservatives who used the dispute to drive zhao and his 
supporters from power 
zhaos last public appearance was on may 19 1989 when he had a 
tearful meeting with student hunger strikers on tiananmen square 
the next day li declared martial law in beijing 
since then his only known contact with the world came recently 
when former german chancellor helmut schmidt said zhao responded to 
a personal letter 
his comfortable prison on fuqiang lane was once the home of hu 
yaobang his predecessor as party chief who was also purged in 
january 1987 for showing sympathy to prodemocracy student 
demonstrations 
hus death in april 1989 led to the mass rallies that propelled 
the spring movement for democratic reforms 
in the weeks after zhaos purge party leaders hinted strongly 
that zhao would face criminal charges for supporting the democracy 
movement or counterrevolutionary rebellion members of his 
family were also said to be under investigation for corruption 
zhao was maligned in the official press as a man who had 
vilified and repudiated the fine traditions of the party 
zhao now 70 may have avoided a trial so far because he has 
long been a favorite of deng for nearly a decade zhao 
administered dengs marketoriented reforms which brought new 
levels of prosperity to china 
the conservatives may be treading cautiously because party 
reformers while in retreat the past year are still a popular and 
formidable force particularly in areas of the country that have 
benefited from the reforms 
zhao may have made some mistakes but we shouldnt blame him 
for everything guo shuyan governor of the central hubei 
province said in a recent interview 
unable to reach a consensus the party has left zhao in limbo 
his old rival li peng said in april that zhao was a free man 
who was still a member of the communist party and enjoyed quite 
good living conditions 
li said zhao reported to have suffered from heart trouble late 
last year was in good health and he joked that zhao received a 
bigger salary than he did 
according to hong kong news reports zhao was summoned before 
members of the party politburo in march and accused of seriously 
violating party discipline but zhao reportedly refused to admit 
any guilt 
overt public criticism of zhao has largely abated 
with the investigation into his case apparently going nowhere 
the man still officially referred to as comrade faces an 
indefinite period of house arrest 
some talk wistfully of a comeback when political fortunes 
change after all deng was 74 when he made his last return to 
power in 1979 
but china watchers say zhao has no political future unless 
chinas leadership acknowledges it was wrong in its bloody 
suppression of the tiananmen demonstrators an unlikely prospect 
soon 
the government has also undermined zhaos power base by 
arresting some allies removing others from provincial governments 
and breaking up political institutes linked to him 
deng has proclaimed that new party leader jiang is now the 
core of the leadership 
jiang has learned a lesson from dengs former proteges hu and 
zhao he has carefully toed the rigid line set down by the aging 
leaders in their own walled compound not far from fuqiang lane

strong aftershocks struck northern iran 
before dawn today terrifying survivors of an earthquake two days 
earlier that some officials say killed 40000 people and injured 
100000 
foreign emergency aid poured into iran but the islamic 
government was balking at allowing international medical and rescue 
personnel into the affected region on the caspian sea about 125 
miles northwest of tehran 
the task of rescuers grew grimmer today as hopes faded for 
finding anyone else alive in the rubble of dozens of towns and 
villages in the devastated provinces of gilan and zanjan 
attention also turned to finding shelter for an estimated 
400000 people left homeless by the disaster 
there were conflicting death tolls hossein zeineddin second 
secretary with irans un mission in new york said late friday 
that according to the latest estimates from the region at least 
40000 people were killed and 100000 were injured 
the official islamic republic news agency reported 28950 people 
killed 25241 in gilan province and 3709 in zanjan province 
the toll surpassed that of the quake that killed 25000 people 
in nearby soviet armenia in december 1988 and a quake in iran in 
1978 that also killed 25000 
it was the worst quake since july 28 1976 when an estimated 
200000 people were killed in china by a quake measuring 78 to 82 
on the richter scale 
more than 200 aftershocks have hit since thursdays predawn 
earthquake which registered at least 73 on the richter scale 
irna monitored in cyprus said one aftershock jolted the 
northern provincial capital of rasht early today making 
panicstricken residents take to the streets three hours later 
another shock measuring 4 on the richter scale hit the town of 
roodbar in the heart of the quake zone where workers were pulling 
bodies from the rubble it said 
irna said friday that 6000 survivors had been rescued but by 
today workers were mainly finding the dead 
rescue workers are becoming less optimistic irna said late 
friday the number of those taken out alive has dropped sharply 
in tehran the capital the government ordered that 20 percent 
of all beds in private hospitals be set aside for quake victims 
an official announcement said six major airports have been 
designated as centers for the shipment of supplies to the quake 
area in northern iran and the transfer of injured to hospitals out 
of the area 
the government appealed for international help and nations all 
around the world responded with offers of aid including the 
united states britain and israel all regarded by tehran as 
enemies 
iran reportedly said it would accept assistance from all 
countries except israel and south africa 
the united states and iran have not had diplomatic ties since 
the 1979 seizure of hostages at the us embassy in tehran britain 
and iran severed diplomatic relations in march 1989 after the late 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ordered moslems to kill british author 
salman rushdie for his novel the satanic verses 
the european community promised to donate 24 million japan 
15 million and sweden 820000 other countries including 
jordan and china planned to ship tons of supplies 
messages of condolence also continued to arrive the latest from 
libya and saudi arabia which has accused iran of terrorism and 
broke ties in april 1988 
while the iranians welcomed emergency supplies and cash 
donations the government discouraged the presence of foreign 
rescue workers and medical personnel however some international 
teams including a group of french doctors had already arrived 
today 
the british broadcasting corp quoted a briton who arrived with 
a british aid shipment as saying the iranians indicated they did 
not want foreigners operating in the quake area but he said they 
were allowing them to set up medical treatment units and 
supplydistribution points in tehran 
in the crucial hours after the quake landslides blocked 
rescuers routes on the ground and bad weather hampered airborne 
efforts 
if you had come earlier you could have saved my 
daughterinlaw i was talking to her until a few hours ago irna 
quoted an elderly survivor as telling rescuers in the village of 
jamalabad in zanjan province 
iranian television monitored in cyprus showed masked rescuers 
in white aprons pulled dustcovered bodies from under concrete 
slabs corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open trucks 
the television showed scenes of devastation including the 
remains of an entire row of hillside village houses that collapsed 
and slid down the hill 
president hashemi rafsanjani flew to the village of roodbar in 
the heart of the affected region friday and told iranian television 
that everyone is helping but with a calamity this disastrous 
nothing could be enough 
farhad shad a spokesman for the geophysics center at tehran 
university told irna that 140 aftershocks were registered after 
the killer earthquake which measured 73 to 77 on the richter 
scale according to geological stations in tehran edinburgh 
scotland and golden colo 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number means that the ground 
motion is 10 times greater a quake of magnitude 7 is considered a 
major earthquake

television picture tubes like so many of us 
are getting wider 
not just bigger but stretched out sideways so they look more 
like movie theater screens 
these new tubes being developed for the muchballyhooed 
highdefinition televisions of the future will have screens nearly 
twice as wide as they are tall 
theyll also have higherquality pictures and breathtaking 
prices 
an international standardssetting group the international 
radio consultative committee last month adopted the new 
widescreen tubes as the world standard for hdtv whenever it 
finally arrives 
the future cathode ray tubes will have a 16 by 9 aspect 
ratio or screen width versus height 
that compares with the relatively boxy 4 by 3 shape of todays 
tubes 
in todays system a screen 4 inches wide would be 3 inches 
tall in the same fashion a screen 24 inches wide would be 18 
inches tall 
under the new system a screen 32 inches wide would be 18 inches 
tall a much wider rectangular shape 
tv sets incorporating widescreen crts will be available in 
europe this fall for use in a new tv system that is an interim step 
towards the crystalclear pictures promised by hdtv widescreen 
sets should be available in the united states by 1993 
but they wont be cheap 
estimates of the initial prices of these sets generally range 
from 3000 to 5000 as with other modern electronic gadgets 
though prices are expected to fall dramatically once a mass market 
develops 
will the typical couch potato like these sets 
were going to have a real consumer survey starting this 
fall says d joseph donahue a senior vice president at thomson 
consumer electronics which has joined with philips consumer 
electronics to introduce widescreen tv in europe 
but donahue like most other tv manufacturers say the 169 
system is the wave of the future 
the only issue is the hour and the day theyll arrive 
donahue said in a recent interview 
the widescreen sets are part of a worldwide trend towards 
larger screens donahue said eight tv manufacturers have invested 
1 billion in us facilities to crank out 43 tubes in the 27inch 
to 36inch range and they could retool quickly to produce 169 
the halfdozen companies competing to have the federal 
communications commission adopt their hdtv systems as the us 
standard all will undergo testing in the 169 aspect ratio 
the strong trend is in acceptance of 169 says peter 
fannon executive director of the advanced television test center 
an industrysupported center that will help the fcc decide on a 
us hdtv system 
proponents of widescreen tvs claim viewers will find the wider 
aspect irresistible imagine they say being able to see a 
quarterback hand off the football to a running back and at the 
same time see blockers doing battle down field 
wouldnt it be nice they add to be able to see the full image 
of theatrical motion pictures when theyre shown on tv instead of 
having the sides cut off by the squarishshaped sets in use today 
the higher resolution of these screens will allow viewers to sit 
relatively closer to the their sets without seeing the lines that 
make up the picture says william connolly president of sony 
america corps advanced systems division this will enhance the 
feeling of being inside the action on the large screen 
a number of manufacturers have demonstrated these new picture 
tubes over the past year or so but theyre not expected to be 
introduced in the united states until after the federal 
communications commission sets the technical standards for hdtv 
about three years from now 
however european viewers will get a look at widesscreen tubes 
this fall when thomson and philips roll out sets for use with a 
satellitedelivered tv format known as d2mac 
d2mac is a socalled extendeddefinition television edtv 
system that offers improved pictures digital sound and wide 
screens without being full highdefinition tv 
a true hdtv system is scheduled to be introduced in europe in 
time for the 1992 olympics japan could begin regular hdtv 
satellite broadcasts in 1993 
companies such as thomson which manufacturers rca tvs are 
betting the fcc also will approve edtv in order to cushion the 
multibilliondollar costs of converting existing tv networks 
stations and cable tv systems to full hdtv 
thomson philips nbc and the david sarnoff research center have 
proposed an edtv system in which existing sets would continue to 
receive the current us tv signal while edtv sets would receive 
the enhanced picture and widescreen format 
but some tv industry executives question whether improved 
pictures and widescreen views will be enough to persuade customers 
to plunk down big bucks for a new tv 
jerry pearlman president of the only remaining us tv 
manufacturer zenith electronics corp thinks viewers may balk 
particularly if tv programmers are slow to adopt the new 
widescreen format 
for many years the new hd receivers will be primarily used to 
receive current lowresolution programming because most programming 
will continue to be low resolution pearlman said in a recent 
address to industry executives 
tv manufacturers selling hardware always prefer to have 
something that looks new thats why many of them overpromote the 
widescreen concept pearlman said 
pearlman predicted some tv manufacturers will market 43 tubes 
that can display hdtv pictures at significantly lower cost than 
widescreen tubes

spiritual homecoming in harlem to a soldout concert and rally at

constructive and imaginative

assembly in 1974 and was not represented when mandela spoke

president fernando collor de mello says 
he never promised his government would be a rose garden but his 
harsh antiinflation plan has given the country renewed hope in the 
future 
how would this country be if my government had not had the 
courage to take drastic measures to lower inflation the 
40yearold president said in a 15minute nationally televised 
address friday night 
on the 100th day of his administration collor said the country 
could commemorate a great victory by cutting inflation from 
843 percent in march to about 8 percent in may 
the march 16 reform plan which froze about 115 billion in bank 
and money market deposits fixed prices and created the new 
cruzeiro currency 
but it also propelled brazil into a recession private companies 
laid off 400000 workers and put some 700000 on paid holiday 
unions say buying power has plunged 100 percent sinch march and 
some private economic institutes claim the real inflation rate was 
as high as 40 percent last month 
collor the first popularly elected leader since 1960 said only 
selfish people and nonpatriots spoke fondly of the past 
and he renewed his promise to fight tax cheats and speculators 
i never promised a rose garden adorned with irresponsible and 
opportunistic speeches he said i took hard measures because 
brazil could not go into the 21st century with a mentality and 
structure of the 19th century 
we were all tired of a nation without hope of the two 
brazils the eternal country of the future collor said 
collor said his government would comply with each of the 
promises it has assumed with the nation 
critics say collor has demanded sacrifice from the private 
sector but cut back little on government waste 
without mentioning specific cuts in spending or dates he said 
his administration would follow the example of modern developed 
countries to cut government spending 
we reduced by half the number of ministries we are 
liquidating 50 more state enterprises and we are doing away with 
government employee priviledges in a radical way said collor 
who has promised to fire or transfer 25 percent of the 14 million 
government employees

a launch company embarrassed over 
the stranding of a communications satellite launched a titan rocket 
early today carrying a replacement satellite 
the titan 3 blasted off on schedule at 719 am from cape 
canaveral air force station the satellite separated from the 
rocket 25 minutes later and an onboard motor successfully boosted 
it to higher orbit within an hour after that launch officials said 
everything went just flawlessly said edward m browne 
president of the denverbased martin marietta commercial titan inc 
the uninsured intelsat vi satellite valued at 150 million is 
to replace an older intelsat satellite 22300 miles above the 
atlantic that satellite was to have been replaced by the stranded 
craft which failed to separate properly from its booster march 14 
vic whitehead a martin marietta commercial vice president said 
there was great relief when the satellite separated from the 
rocket as the previous one had not cheers and applause erupted 
from the mission control room at that point 
when that thing went off separation we were all very happy 
and we naturally let our emotions show that browne said 
browne said a wiring problem that led to the failure has been 
corrected in the rocket that went up today marietta commercial has 
gone through exhaustive reviews preparing for the launch with 
help from intelsat an organization of countries that owns the 
satellite he said 
they have not attempted to rub our nose in what we did 
browne told reporters friday 
the stranded spacecraft is orbiting about 345 miles above earth 
22000 miles lower than intended intelsats board of governors 
agreed last week to pay nasa for a rescue mission 
were embarrassed over that failure we dont like to have 
failures browne said 
the newest satellite is expected to be working in early 
september and will join 14 others it will be capable of 
transmitting three tv channels and up to 120000 telephone calls 
simultaneously 
so far there has been no service disruption to the 119 
countries that constitute intelsat or the international 
telecommunications satellite organization but some shortterm 
service likely will have to be denied because the stranded 
satellite would have begun operating about now said frederick 
ormsby spacecraft mission director for the washingon dcbased 
consortium 
the craft became stranded when it failed to separate from the 
second stage of the booster a rocket motor that was to propel the 
satellite to high orbit remained attached to the booster and both 
fell back to earth two weeks later 
nasa plans to have spacewalking astronauts attach another motor 
to the satellite during space shuttle endeavours inaugural 1992 
flight 
ormsby said the satellite is believed to be in good condition 
except for the deterioration of some silver connectors on the solar 
panels 
intelsat expects to pay nasa about 90 million for the rescue 
attempt ormsby said the consortium is negotiating with hughes 
aircraft co which made the satellite for the 20000pound motor 
that will boost the spacecraft to its proper stationary orbit 
martin marietta has not been approached by intelsat to help pay 
for the rescue mission browne said 
we believe that we fulfilled the contract browne said 
weve had no communication from them to the contrary

on nelson mandelas us first stop he emerged 
as a stoical singleminded revolutionary who takes his friends 
where he finds them be it libya cuba or the unrealized state of 
palestine 
out of the mist of myth stepped a real man who led his anxious 
bodyguards on an early morning walk who kept asking to meet mike 
tyson who donned a new york yankees baseball jacket and cap 
now you know who i am a beaming mandela told 55000 people 
at a fund raiser at yankee stadium i am a yankee 
to most americans mandela was something of a blank slate 
albeit a famous one when he stepped off his plane wednesday 
morning at john f kennedy international airport by the time he 
left saturday for boston he had become like an old friend to new 
yorkers 
on his first day it became apparent amid the endless cheers of 
mandela and keep the pressure on that mandela had a 
simple message and would not change it for journalists in need of a 
fresh news angle 
accordingly his two requests maintain economic sanctions 
against south africa and support the african national congress 
were enshrined in newsprint and videotape 
mandela also refused to cater to the sensibilities of those who 
differ with some of the ancs allies 
yasser arafat colonel gadhafi fidel castro support our 
struggle to the hilt he said in response to a question during 
the taping of a televised town meeting with ted koppel there 
is no reason whatsoever why we should have any hesitation about 
their commitment to human rights in south africa they are placing 
resources at our disposal to win the struggle 
this shocked new yorkers accustomed to political candidates who 
climb over each other to denounce the plo and praise israel 
it became clear mandelas love of human rights in general was 
subordinate to his love of human rights in south africa one of 
the mistakes the western world makes is to think that their enemies 
should be our enemies he said we have our own struggle 
when koppel pressed him mandela told the renowned interviewer 
you have not listened to my answers 
if mandela was more feisty than the statue some expected he 
also seemed more human partly because of a frailty from age 
medical problems jet lag and 27 years in prison 
the 71yearold mandelas arrival from canada was delayed for 
several hours by his need to rest and soon organizers were lopping 
some events from his schedule and curtailing others organizer 
roger wilkins said wednesday night mandela had reached the 
limit 
columnist murray kempton wrote that mandelas tired face evoked 
a spirit that has endured much and must endure much to come 
but mandela kept undercutting concerns about his health with 
signs of vitality 
an hour after he had remained seated while speaking to religious 
leaders at riverside church doctors orders he apologized he 
stepped confidently up the altar steps looking like the former 
boxer and guerrilla whose daily exercise regimen got him through 
the prison years 
he rose early thursday morning at the mayors house and went for 
a stroll along the east river he was as curious as any tourist 
asking about the pollution in the river the distance between 
washington and new york he told reporters he felt on top of the 
world 
he also had time for children the last person koppel called on 
was 8yearold bernard l charles iii who told mandela just 
send us a post card and well do anything we can do even raise 
money 
mandela laughed gave the boy a hug and promised never to 
forget him

amid the emotional cheers the swirling ticker 
tape and the threeday heros welcome nelson mandela had work to 
do and the african national congress leader did it very well 
collecting more than 16 million for his cause 
the minute he touched ground in new york the ground moved 
said suzanne dubose who handled the fundraising chores in new 
york we sold 20000 tickets for yankee stadium in 24 hours the 
phone lines were all lit up it was a tremendous outpouring 
organizers of the trip had hoped to raise 1 million during 
mandelas first stop on his 12day us tour but dubose said that 
figure was easily surpassed during mandelas three days in new 
york with the total climbing toward 2 million 
its been tremendous were really pleased the anc will get so 
much money she said organizers had not set a fundraising goal 
for the entire trip 
the majority of the money was collected friday night at a pair 
of manhattan fundraisers featuring power brokers and star power 
an estimated 200 business executives at 2500 a pop met mandela 
at the upper east side townhouse of film executive matthew krim 
a short time later mandela headed downtown to robert de niros 
new film center for a fundraiser with by spike lee eddie murphy 
de niro and musician little steven van zandt as hosts each of 
the 252 guests paid a minimum of 2500 although singer michelle 
shocked signed a 50000 check and others contributed 5000 
10000 and 20000 
that 50000 check put us all in tears said robin chambers 
de niros personal assistant were pretty proud since weve 
never done anything like this 
the krim event meant around a halfmillion dollars for anc 
coffers while the de niro crowd donated more than 600000 
support came from the unknowns too the yankee stadium speech 
where tickets were priced as low as 5 was expected to produce 
more than 250000 to fight apartheid dubose said shopping bags 
passed around a harlem rally were filled with cash one hundred 
black men a service organization passed the hat and collected 
1000 at their annual boat ride around manhattan 
an undetermined amount of money was collected at a riverside 
church service winnie mandela got in the act as well collecting 
50000 at a brooklyn academy of music rally 
while the mandelas were making money the city was busy spending 
it police overtime for the trips heavy security totaled 2 
million although the state department promised to cover those 
costs said mayoral spokesman stanley davis 
the total cost to the city for playing host to mandela would not 
be determined until after the south african freedom fighters visit 
ends davis said but he expressed optimism that much of the cost 
would be covered by corporate donations 
mandelas visit attracted support from sources strange and 
divergent new york yankees owner george steinbrenner a nixonera 
republican whose name elicited massive booing at mandelas yankee 
stadium appearance donated the 90000 rental fee for the show 
van zandt the political antithesis of steinbrenner organized 
the fundraiser at deniros place singer billy joel donated the 
stage and sound system for the stadium show 
a coalition of religious leaders presented mandela with a 
200000 check for the nelson mandela fund a humanitarian aid 
organization run by the anc the owner of eight mcdonalds 
franchises provided 5000 for anc office supplies 
the anc leader also received a guarantee of future financial 
backing from 8yearold bernard l charles iii during a television 
taping in harlem 
if there is anything any of us can do just send a postcard 
and we will do it even raise money the boy promised mandela on 
thursday

irancontra defendant richard secord is 
dropping an appeal of his conviction on charges of lying to a 
congressional investigator a federal prosecutors office said 
saturday 
secord agreed to drop the appeal in court papers filed friday 
said mary belcher spokeswoman for independent counsel lawrence 
walsh 
the retired air force general had pleaded guilty last year to 
one felony count as part of a plea bargaining agreement under which 
walsh agreed not to pursue 11 other felony charges against secord 
walsh said secords appeal violated the spirit of the plea 
bargaining agreement and he threatened to put secord on trial on 
all 12 original charges 
the two have reached a second agreement under which secords 
conviction will stand and walsh will not pursue the other charges 
belcher said 
secord was placed on probation for two years for telling 
congressional investigators that he was unaware of any iran arms 
sale money that benefited former national security counsel aide

james edward pop pough was known 
as a reliable working man with a sometimesviolent temper but the 
rage that turned him into a mass murderer remains a mystery 
after the shooting spree last monday that killed eight random 
victims and wounded five more investigators were left with one big 
question why 
it is probably a question that no one will be able to 
answer police sgt steve weintraub said friday 
experts say a split with his wife and having his car repossessed 
likely helped spur the shooting spree in an auto finance office 
even though both setbacks occurred months earlier 
pough 42 entered the general motors acceptance corp office 
workers armed with a 30caliber semiautomatic rifle and a 
38caliber pistol and without warning began shooting employees and 
customers alike 
after coldly stalking workers cowering under the desks and 
firing at them pointblank pough put the pistol to his head and 
killed himself 
initially authorities though the auto repossession was the sole 
motive for the attack but then pough was linked to the shootings 
of four people including two who died in his neighborhood the 
weekend before the finance company rampage 
the motive for those shootings is unknown 
what really drives homicidal behavior is rage said helen 
morrison a psychiatrist who heads the evaluation center in 
chicago which studies the psychology of violent behavior 
criminology experts say deep rage coupled with frustration over 
jobs relationships or life in general is a common denominator to 
most mass killing 
jack levin coauthor of mass murder americas growing 
menace said the shootings probably were triggered by the loss of 
his wife and car in the same month january 
his car was repossessed and gmac had sent him a bill for 6394 
but finance company officials said they last had contact with pough 
in march 
levin said the triggering event doesnt have to be 
immediately before the massacre and doesnt even have to be tragic 
from the casual observers point of view 
it may just be the straw that broke the camels back said 
levin a sociology professor at northeastern university in boston 
most of these mass killings look more random than they actually 
are 
he may have been trying to kill gmac as a corporate entity 
levin said or striking out at society at large by launching the 
attack on the office in the citys suburban baymeadows area 
we dont know what sort of crazy maniacal fantasies were 
going through his mind said dr ernest miller a psychiatry 
professor at the university of florida school of medicine we do 
know that he was selective in going to gmac he picked a place 
where he would probably not be opposed 
pough a black man who held down a steady job does not fit the 
model of mass murderers in the united states most of whom have 
been white and unemployed experts said 
he was the type of employee we tried to keep said fred 
houser executive vice president of ww gay a contracting company 
where pough earned 995 an hour as a construction laborer 
pough had a good attitude and hardly ever missed work houser 
said 
he was always willing to work and wanted to keep his job 
obviously something went wrong houser said 
despite his good work record he had a background of violent 
behavior 
pough was fined 75 in 1968 for displaying a knife in a 
threatening way and had other arrests on minor charges 
in 1971 pough was arrested for investigation of murder but was 
allowed to plead guilty to aggravated assault and was given five 
years probation because his record was erased after he completed 
his probation pough could legally buy guns in florida even though 
in most cases felons may not do so under state law 
his wife theresa won a protective order in march to keep pough 
away from her for a year in her petition she said pough had 
thrown a glass at her and had tried to hurt her 
you better not get him mad said vanessa gadsen 35 a 
neighbor of poughs for 10 years especially about things like 
money or his car he would lend people money but dont cross him 
and not pay him back 
other neighbors said something clearly was bothering pough in 
the weeks preceding the killings 
quitaji davis said he had been firing a gun at night for two 
weeks 
a woman who had lived with him told us about two weeks ago 
that he said he was going to kill a lot of people ms davis said 
ms gadsden recalled he always said when he leaves this 
world he was going to take someone with him

prime minister brian mulroney told canadians 
today he is deeply disappointed by the failure of a 
constitutional amendment that would have accorded special status to 
frenchspeaking quebec 
we have missed the opportunity to turn the page and start a 
new chapter in constitutional history mulroney said in a 
nationwide television broadcast 
but he reached out to the people of quebec saying that quebec 
emerged from these negotiations with its dignity and its principles 
intact 
today is not the day to embark on new constitutional 
negotiations he said it is a time to heal wounds to reach 
out to fellow canadians 
the agreement required ratification by the provinces by midnight 
tonight by this week newfoundland and manitoba still had not done 
so the agreement failed friday when newfoundland premier clyde 
wells decided to adjourn debate on the issue indefinitely 
the accord would have made quebec a willing partner of the 
countrys 1982 constitution had its five conditions been met by the 
nine other provinces 
the conditions were recognition of quebec as a distinct 
society a say in the appointment of supreme court justices 
increased powers over immigration the right to opt out of certain 
federal programs and a veto on future constitutional amendments 
the agreement had strong symbolic significance in the province 
canadas largest with onefourth of the countrys 26 million 
people 
most experts believed there would be a period of reflection 
before quebecs provincial government decided how to respond but 
quebec premier robert bourassa informing his legislature of the 
death of the accord indicated the prevailing sentiment in his 
province 
english canada must clearly understand that quebec today 
and forever is a distinct society capable of its own development 
and its own destiny he said 
while quebec officials made no attempt to hide their 
displeasure they made no immediate threats of secession by their 
province which has twice the land area of texas 
some canadians feared that the failure of meech lake would lead 
to a separation of quebec from canada a move that could have 
serious political and economic consequences for quebec and canada 
as a whole 
in a 1980 referendum quebecois rejected a proposal to open 
talks with the federal government on a plan allowing quebec 
political autonomy 
the 1987 meech lake agreement named after the government 
retreat near ottawa where it was originally worked out needed the 
ratification of the federal parliament and the legislatures of all 
10 provinces by midnight tonight 
wells move scuttled a desperate lastminute federal plan to 
have the supreme court extend the time available to the manitoba 
legislature where cree indian legislator elijah harper buried the 
agreement under a barrage of procedural delays 
harper who held an eagle feather in his hands during 
legislative sessions blocked the necessary unanimous agreement to 
introduce the measure quickly he later used other ploys to delay a 
vote until by law the legislature was required to adjourn its 
session then he prevented the unanimous vote needed to extend the 
session 
that meant the manitoba legislature could not meet again until 
monday after the deadline for approval of the agreement 
because manitobas problem was strictly a need for more time for 
procedural reasons the federal government came up with a 
complicated scheme to get the time extended 
when newfoundland put off the vote though the federal move for 
manitoba question became moot and sen lowell murray mulroneys 
chief constitutional adviser declared meech lake dead 
many in english canada feared that the agreement would have 
given quebec extra powers but constitutional experts such as john 
whyte dean of queens university law school said the distinct 
society clause would have had few practical effects 
under the clause the canadian supreme court would have been 
given a guideline to take quebecs special character into 
consideration when ruling on challenges to laws under the 
constitution 
some quebec residents considered the accords death a slap at 
their french character 
they have showed us we have no place in canada said a 
greyhaired woman drinking coffee in a montreal cafe thats why 
im so sad 
on a political level many believed mulroney was to blame for 
having waited to the last minute to work out a final agreement with 
the provincial premiers

the officers were named in six indictments unsealed in us 
district court in alexandria va their arrests were the result of 
a sixmonth undercover fbi investigation in which an inmate was an 
informant officials said 
federal prosecutors said friday that the probe revealed how 
guards at the lorton correctional complex in fairfax county va

condoms to heroic dimensions to prove their resilience 
id wait just a bit he told a woman preparing to photograph 
the phenomenon it has a way to go 
the booth is one of four condom makers at the conference along 
with nine drug companies at least 15 companies selling aids virus 
test kits and a variety of equipment supply and service companies 
in all 91 companies are represented evidence that acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome is also a marketing opportunity 
for example two salesmen at the wyethayerst laboratories booth 
demonstrated the philadelphia companys hands off tubex 
injector a syringetype device designed so medical personnel wont 
touch any part of the injector that may have come in contact with 
an aids patient 
on the booths wall a sign with a bleeding finger reads 
farther from the point of danger 
the promotion said salesman billy walker is drawing them in 
anytime you can show a person how they can save their life 
theyre going to be interested he said 
people also clustered around magnus communications design inc 
a vancouver company that produces interactive videos systems to 
teach students about drugs alcohol sex and aids 
on its tv monitors magnus showed teenage soap operas where the 
viewer got to choose if the actors will drink have sex use 
condoms if unsafe sex is chosen a dire consequence always follows 
james boyd a magnus vice president showed off a handful of 
cards from educators attending the conference who are interested in 
the system 
were very pleased with the response he said 
but the real crowdpleaser russellfells exploding condom 
machine 
the crowd started out small as he loaded another condom into the 
glass display booth but more people wandered over as the condom 
grew to the size of a healthy dachshund then an elongated 
watermelon a digital readout displayed the growing amount of air 
in the condom 
as the reading hit 40 liters some covered their ears in 
anticipation of the soft pop as the condom exploded 
relieved laughter followed and samples were handed out 
other condom exhibitors also did a brisk business people 
crammed free samples into their pockets at the booth for okamoto 
industries a japanese company trying to break into the us market 
okamoto the booths posters explain is a highly regarded 
manufacturer of plastics for cars and shoes as well as a major 
producer of radial tires but few read the information 
some people will stop to ask about the different brands but 
mostly its grabbing said ann mctaggart a marketing manager 
there are no samples but plenty of questions at the booth for 
womens choice a condomlike device for women that is awaiting 
government approval 
still andy halsey chief operating officer of md personal 
products inc is bombarded with questions that would make a 
gynecologist blush 
the mens questions tend to be more from the perspective of 
disease control and the market he said women tend to ask 
questions on the personal side 
few people seemed to ask tom snyder anything as they swooped by 
his booth to snatch free cookies but snyder whos selling home 
intravenous therapy programs doesnt complain 
this is the first aids conference ive been to he said 
the attendance is much better than the digestive disease show i 
was at last month

the united states and the soviet union have 
agreed to try to work out a compromise solution to the war in 
afghanistan through a meeting of their experts in washington a 
senior us official said saturday 
the meeting was set up by secretary of state james a baker iii 
and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in east berlin 
on friday night 
we agreed that we are indeed getting closer on afghanistan 
the senior official said aboard bakers plane on the flight home 
the experts will meet in washington and set the stage for baker 
and shevardnadze to take up afghanistan again at a meeting in paris 
on july 17 
the main purpose of the meeting is to prepare for the 
unification of east germany and west germany 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev failed 
to resolve major differences over afghanistan at their summit 
meeting in washington at the beginning of the month 
but the two sides have made headway since then to the point that 
baker was able to tell the house foreign affairs committee on june 
14 that the one thing that continues to separate the two sides 
is whether president najibullah would preside over the government 
in kabul during a transitional period during which elections would 
be held 
the soviet union is unwilling to oust the afghan leader while 
the bush administration argues that elections held while najibullah 
is still in charge would not be accepted by the afghan people 
the country which borders the soviet union is in the midst of 
a war between usarmed guerrillas and the sovietbacked 
government 
the last of 115000 soviet troops left the country early last 
year 
the senior official did not identify the soviet experts who 
would be sent to washington he said they would engage with us on 
the nittygritty of where we were with respect to a possible 
afghanstyle election and a commission and what the role of 
najibullah would be in the course of the process 
during the final years of the decadelong soviet military 
occupation of afghanistan us officials expressed confidence that 
najibullah and the afghan army would collapse once the red army 
departed 
that forecast turned out to be way off the mark the soviets 
left massive arsenals behind and are providing 4 billion in 
military aid and 1 billion in economic aid 
marshal sergei akhromeyev senior military adviser to gorbachev 
remarked during the summit that the united states now fully 
understood that najibullah would not be defeated militarily 
last february baker persuaded the soviets to agree that 
elections should be part of an overall settlement to the war in 
afghanistan 
najibullahs role has been a nagging problem ever since

the bush administration concerned that the 
soviets might lose control of nuclear facilities in the event of 
ethnic unrest have sought and received assurances from the kremlin 
that they are under control a senior us official said saturday 
they are very conscious of that problem the official said 
on secretary of state james a baker iiis flight home from a two 
hour and 20 minute meeting friday night with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze in east berlin 
this is not a problem for us shevardnadze told reporters 
who inquired about reports that tactical nuclear weapons were being 
withdrawn from restive regions in the south 
if some weapons are being withdrawn from some zones from some 
places if weapons are being destroyed i think we should all 
welcome it he said 
the senior us official who insisted that his name be 
withheld spoke guardedly but with authority about the problem 
i cant get into a lot of detail about what we might or might 
not know about it he said let me simply say that we have had 
discussions with them in the past regarding the security of their 
nuclear facilities in the event of civil unrest 
they are very conscious of that problem and thats really all 
i can say 
pressed by a reporter to say more the official aboard bakers 
plane added they the soviet leadership are aware of the issue 
theyve told us about it weve discussed it with them and they 
have assured us their facilities are adequately and safely 
protected thats the assurance they gave us

the laotian immigrant parents of a 
6yearold boy born with clubfeet say they oppose courtordered 
corrective surgery because they believe spirits inflicted the 
defect to punish the family 
tampering with the deformity could bring more divine 
retribution say parents ger xiong and his wife houa vue xiong 
their son kou has said he doesnt want the operation 
the us supreme court refused last tuesday to overturn lower 
court rulings that ordered corrective surgery for the boy but 
hospitals have declined to perform the operations without parental 
consent 
the hmong immigrants from laos believe their son was born with 
clubfeet and a dislocated hip as punishment for a wrong committed 
by an ancestor xiong said through an interpreter in an interview 
these people have no country any more basically all they 
have left is their religious faith and their family said joe 
reich a lawyer representing the boys father 
valley childrens hospital in fresno and shriners hospital for 
crippled children in san francisco have refused to perform the 
operations without the parents approval said ernie velasquez 
director of the fresno county department of social services 
the orthopedic surgeons will perform the surgery if the 
parents want it said chris monahan a spokeswoman for valley 
childrens hospital thats why were here to take care of 
children we are not here to impose value systems and thats what 
the whole unfortunate situation has been about 
many hmongs from mountainous northern laos fled communist 
persecution after the vietnam war many maintain animist beliefs 
that include faith in a pantheon of spirits thought to control 
human events 
the xiongs have been advised by a hmong shaman or spiritual 
leader that consenting to corrective surgery would continue 
problems they believe stopped after xiong promised the spirits that 
kou would be left as he is 
he said the birth of another child with no deformities proves 
the spirits were appeased by his promise 
spiritual illwill also was blamed for cleft palates that two of 
kous younger brothers were born with the parents allowed those 
defects to be corrected by doctors 
social workers are searching for a hospital that will perform 
the surgery but no operations would be scheduled until the agency 
meets with leaders of the hmong community and family lawyers 
velasquez said 
the case may be decided by doctors refusal to participate in 
the controversy that pits parental rights and religious freedom 
against the governments desire to help the boy 
i think if we dont find a medical facility that has the 
expertise in this area i think the case should dismissed said 
susan anderson a deputy district attorney representing kou 
velasquez said removing the boy from his parents custody would 
be one way around the issue of parental consent but no steps in 
that direction have been taken 
social workers got involved after school officials notified them 
of the boys condition and his parents stand against surgery 
doctors say the boy who now is able to walk will eventually lose 
movement in his legs without the operation 
this little boys condition is not lifethreatening the 
surgery is somewhat lifethreatening its elective surgery ordered 
by the court reich said right now this family is being 
terrorized and they are on the verge of being shattered 
if the surgery is done while the boy is still young he may be 
able to walk with a limp dr brian shaw testified in court but 
even with the surgery kou still may suffer pain in his feet and 
require a wheelchair he said 
shaw said that the parents allowed corrective surgery on the two 
children born with cleft palates highlights the contradictions of 
the case 
they dont have a problem with surgery as a concept he 
said the problem is they are more afraid of what the spirits are 
going to do to them than what we or the law are going to do to 
them 
but the xiongs say the cleft palates could be corrected without 
fear of adverse consequences because those birth defects resulted 
from the spirits reaction to early surgical efforts to correct 
kous defects 
kou is the one that god wants to be the way he is xiong 
said

care for aids patients will cost americans 
from 65 billion to 101 billion annually by 1994 a government 
study concludes 
the figures would be much higher if they also included 
treatments increasingly being urged for the much larger pool of 
americans infected with the aids virus but not yet sick said fred 
j hellinger of the national center for health services research in 
rockville md the center is an agency of the health and human 
services department 
the costs of caring for a single aids patient rise with the 
length of the patients survival hellinger said friday in a 
presentation at the sixth international conference on aids 
for example caring for an aids patient who survives 12 months 
costs an estimated 51200 the cost doubles if the patient 
survives for two years 
with the development of improved aids treatments patients are 
surviving longer and costs are escalating hellinger said 
the cost of aids in the united states will be greater than 
expected due to enhanced longevity and costly drug therapies 
hellinger reported 
caring for aids patients will cost about 4 billion this year 
hellinger said 
the wide range of estimates for the cost of care in 1994 reflect 
doctors uncertainty about how many cases of aids will be recorded 
in the united states then hellinger said 
the centers for disease control in atlanta has projected that 
there will be 60000 new cases this year 71000 next year and 
80000 in 1992 hellinger said 
beyond that the estimates become highly uncertain he said 
hellinger estimated that there may be nearly 100000 new cases 
in 1994 
that number is lower than some previous estimates because the 
increase in the number of aids cases is not occurring as quickly as 
it was 18 months ago hellinger said 
since then the rate of increase in the number of reported cases 
has fallen he said

east germanys secondlargest political 
faction on saturday endorsed joint german elections in december 
greatly increasing the chances that one government will be running 
a united germany in six months 
also saturday a leading west german news magazine reported that 
chancellor helmut kohl plans to travel to moscow in late july 
bearing a multibilliondollar economic aid package for the moribund 
soviet economy 
east germanys social democrats had said earlier that joint 
elections and full german unification should not take place until 
late next year 
party chief sabine riebe said her party will meet with west 
german social democrats on sept 26 to merge their parties she 
proposed allgerman elections dec 16 to replace the west german 
vote scheduled for dec 2 
the decision came a day after the four world war ii allies that 
divided germany promised to finish their negotiations on 
unification by years end 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher speaking on 
west german radio said that move also clears the way for joint 
elections before years end 
kohl is proposing they be held dec 9 under the laws of both 
countries a new parliament would have to convene within 30 days of 
elections 
regardless of the date join elections and full german unity are 
looking increasingly inevitable by years end the german states 
are to merge their economies on july 12 ending east germanys 
four decades of socialism 
they are also working on a new state treaty that would outline 
the details of merging the two political systems 
east germany is expected to create a system of states to mirror 
the federal system in west germany the former communist country 
will likely hold state elections in october 
until recently it appeared likely that full political 
unification would not take place until late next year but kohl 
last month urged joint elections in december to replace the dec 2 
west german elections 
kohls conservative christian democrats believe they will stand 
a better chance of winning unified elections 
the west german social democrats won three important state 
elections this year that were seen as a litmus test for the west 
german elections 
the christian democrats of prime minister lothar de maiziere 
overwhelmingly won east germanys first free elections on march 18 
the social democrats in east germany are members of de 
maizieres broad coalition government the west german social 
democrats however are the main opposition group in west germany 
the leftleaning social democrats in both countries generally 
favor a more gradual approach to unification 
the superpowers meanwhile have promised to keep pace with the 
moves by the germanys 
at a meeting in east berlin on friday foreign ministers from 
the united states soviet union france and britain promised to 
finish their talks on the international aspects of german unity by 
the end of the year 
they are negotiating whether a united germany can be in nato 
which the soviets oppose and the status of us troops in west 
germany and soviet troops in east germany 
the hamburgbased der spiegel magazine reported saturday that 
kohl would travel to moscow with a generous western economic 
credit that would total between 15 billion and 19 billion most 
of that would be guaranteed by the west german government the 
weekly said in its monday edition portions of which were made 
available to other media 
a government spokesman in bonn denied the report der spiegels 
reports have on occasion proved correct after being denied by the 
government 
on friday the government confirmed it would back a west german 
bank credit of 31 billion to help the soviet economy shift from 
central planning to freemarket rule

as canadas meech lake accord died 
saturday and the specter of passionate quebec nationalism gripped 
the nation opinions along the border were divided by the st john 
river 
most people on the us side of the twin cities of madawaska and 
edmunston new brunswick paid no attention north of the river in 
canada people said a secession by quebec now seems inevitable 
they disagreed on whether that would be good 
i went home for lunch and told my wife today said roland 
picard an edmunston resident who has worked at pro photo in 
madawaska for 28 years its bad separation of country have you 
ever heard of that without blood 
picard worries that new brunswick east of quebec will become 
isolated from the rest of canada if quebec becomes an independent 
nation 
it will be hard for new brunswick for sure picard said 
look at the map 
others in new brunswick want quebec to drop out of canada 
saying that might let their province join the united states 
i dont like their attitude the quebec people said oneil 
devost who has spent the last two years running an edmunston 
nightclub les prisonnier du paradis after working in construction 
for two decades in hartford conn i love the american way the 
government gives you every break and they let you work 
a local canadian newspaper the new brunswick telegraph journal 
filled saturdays entire front page with meech lake stories 
premier wants torture to end said one headline 
turning on canadian radio listeners could hear virtually 
nothing but meech lake on the english stations and laccord 
du lac meech on the french stations 
asking passersby from new brunswick about the accord designed 
to persuade quebec to accept canadas constitution by giving the 
frenchspeaking province a status as a distinct society often 
elicited responses that were a mixture of french and english 
profanities 
but people from the madawaska side often responded to questions 
about meech lake by asking what it was 
i wasnt aware that anything was going on over there said 
sharon arnold a worker in the fraser paper co mill which 
straddles the border and is the largest employer in the twin 
cities the two cities have a total population of 30000 
maine rep judy ayotte paradis a democrat from nearby 
frenchville was saddened to see meech lake die and saddened to see 
the lack of interest by local francoamericans who have had to 
fight their own battles for inclusion in the mainstream us 
culture 
its just not something that they feel affects them paradis 
said they see their battle is separate from the quebecois were 
fighting for the same thing 
those following the fallout from meech lake can only speculate 
about what will happen next but donat b boisvert the director of 
the mainecanadian legislative office at the state house in 
augusta said the instability could affect trade with all of the 
border states 
the international commerce came to 302 million in maine exports 
to canada and 11 billion in canadian exports to maine during 
1988 according to boisverts latest figures 
the deadline for ratification of the meech lake accord was 
midnight on saturday efforts to preserve it a day earlier had 
failed 
once everything settles quebec separates said gary dube a

pope john paul ii will consecrate a 
controversial basilica in ivory coast and give his blessing to a 
hospital to be built next to it at his request the vatican said 
saturday 
the pope will stop in the west african country on sept 10 at 
the end of a 10day african trip that will first take him to 
tanzania burundi and rwanda papal spokesman joaquin navarro said 
the notre dame peace basilica in yamoussoukro the ivory coast 
presidents hometown cost 130 million an expense that drew 
criticism in the poor country plans called for it to be almost as 
big as st peters basilica in rome christendoms largest church 
last year in a private audience with the pope at the vatican 
president felix houphouetboigny offered the pope ownership of the 
church as a gift navarro said 
accepting this donation the holy father asked that the works 
carried out be integrated with other projects of assistance and 
social nature on the property next to the church navarro added 
a hospital envisioned to handle some 300 to 400 outpatients a 
day will be built next to the church and the pope along with 
consecrating the basilica will bless the cornerstone of the 
hospital navarro said 
he said other projects would be built on the church grounds but 
that they havent been decided yet 
asked if the pope made building the hospital a condition of 
accepting the church navarro replied i dont think it was a 
condition 
when the pope received houphouetboigny last year the vatican 
described the meeting as very cordial but declined to give 
details before the meeting vatican officials had said the pope 
had no intention of attending the inauguration ceremony an 
attitude taken as a sign of disapproval for the massive project 
the churchs construction is seen as a sign of roman 
catholicisms expanding presence in africa 
navarro said an international foundation will be established to 
manage the site which is expected to draw large numbers of 
pilgrims from throughout africa as well as the hospital and any 
future structures on the church grounds 
while at yamoussoukro the pope will preside at a meeting of the 
council of the african synod grouping bishops from 16 african 
nations the vatican said 
abidjan the ivory coasts largest city has a cathedral last 
february prodemocracy student protesters occupied the church for 
10 hours and were subsequently beaten and detained the government 
let the students go after pressure from the roman catholic church 
the students were demanding that houphouetboigny step down and 
make way for a multiparty democracy the president has ruled the 
nation since its independence from france in 1960 
the students were angered by the reportedly lavish lifestyles of 
government officials while ordinary citizens have been suffering 
from a decadeold recession due to slumping prices of coffee and 
cocoa

here is the text of prime minister brian 
mulroneys televised meech lake address saturday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
on june 9 here in ottawa the 10 provincial premiers and i 
reached an agreement on making the meech lake accord part of 
canadas constitution all of us agreed to improve meech lake in 
response to concerns that had been expressed over the past three 
years by women northerners minority language groups and 
aboriginal canadians 
the premiers of new brunswick newfoundland and manitoba agreed 
to use every possible effort to arrive at a decision by june 23 on 
june 15 the new brunswick legislature passed the accord 
unanimously and in the two weeks since june 9 manitoba tried to 
overcome procedural obstacles and adopt the accord the three 
manitoba party leaders spoke in favor of the agreement with more 
time there appeared to be every prospect that the accord would be 
passed 
however yesterday evening the last remaining hope that the 
accord would be ratified was dashed when the house of assembly of 
newfoundland and labrador adjourned without a vote this action 
means the current round of constitutional reform has come to an end 
today we must guard against two dangers first to despair that 
anything can be done and second to delude ourselves that nothing 
has happened 
in saying yes to canada in the 1980 referendum quebecers 
were promised a renewed federalism but the constitution act of 
1982 was not accepted by quebec because it did not respond to the 
expectations raised in 1980 in particular it did not reconcile 
the need to preserve the distinctiveness that quebec brings to 
canada with the need to preserve the equality of all provinces and 
of all canadians 
the meech lake accord was designed to bridge those realities i 
believe sincerely that it was in the interest of all canadians that 
it be ratified 
but the outcome is clear we have fallen short of the unanimous 
consent required and the accord has not passed 
it is important that canadians understand why this has happened 
the accord which was drafted to achieve unity became over three 
years a lightning rod for discontent about budgets interest rates 
free trade and taxes it attracted accusations of favoritism and 
sentiments of rejections and stimulated regional rivalries and even 
linguistic tensions 
much of the discontent of canadians found expression in 
hostility to the meech lake accord its original purpose as agreed 
to by the premiers in edmonton in 1986 was only to bring quebec 
back into the constitutional family but the accord came to be 
expected to respond to all the constitutional preoccuptions of the 
country 
that we did not succeed is at least partly also the failure of 
the constitutional amending procedures under the 1982 procedures 
the premiers and i were required to reopen negotiations and 
reproduce unanimity every time a new provincial leader was elected 
who chose not to honor the undertaking of his predecessor or in 
the case of newfoundland when a new premier was elected who chose 
to rescind the approval of the previous legislature 
but we had created an historic consensus around the accord and 
by persevering came very close to maintaining it it was endorsed 
by 10 provincial premiers representing four different political 
parties it was approved by eight provincial legislatures 
representing 94 percent of the population and the three political 
leaders of the ninth province had publicly committed themselves to 
passing it it was passed by the house of commons on two separate 
occasions by overwhelming majorities 
despite all of this effort we have missed an opportunity to 
turn the page and to start a new chapter of constitutional 
development while the world gears up for the 21th century we have 
failed to resolve a debate that predates confederation itself that 
is why i am so deeply disappointed that this attempt at 
constitutional reform has failed 
to our friends and partners abroad i urge that this situation 
be kept in perspective canadians have always overcome challenges 
to our unity and we shall do so again with a population that 
totals only 26 million we have built the eighthmost powerful 
economy in the world with one of the highest standards of living 
and one of the best qualities of life it would be unwise for 
anyone to underestimate this industrious and resourcerich nation 
of hard working and productive people 
canadas economic prospects continue to be among the most 
exciting and promising of any country in the world the government 
will continue to pursue policies designed to fulfill that promise 
to my fellow quebecers i want to say how dismayed i am that 
quebec has not at this time been able to rejoin the 
constitutional family with honor and enthusiasm but quebec emerged 
from these negotiations with its dignity and its principles intact 
quebec was never isolated and in fact was a member of the 
majority throughout quebecs concerns as eloquently stated by 
premier robert bourassa were supported time and time again by 
englishspeaking premiers whose sensitivity was always in evidence 
for seven long days 10 provincial premiers and i struggled to 
find the basis of reintegrating quebec into the canadian 
constitutional family however we were not successful and there 
are potentially significant implications for canada because actions 
do have consequences 
the debate over the past three years has demonstrated that 
canada has changed profoundly and its outcome signals an era of 
further change today is not the day to launch new constitutional 
initiatives it is a time to mend divisions and heal wounds and 
reach out to fellow canadians there is much to reflect on before 
we try again to amend the constitution one thing is very clear we 
simply must find a better way to do it in the coming months and 
years we must find a way to reconcile the need for public 
participation and open democratic process with the legal 
requirements now in the constitution 
i do not hide from you my great disappointment at the setback 
canadians have suffered today but there is no dishonor in having 
tried to overcome a serious threat to our unity no achievement is 
possible without great effort such effort always carries with it 
the risk of failure but i would rather have failed trying to 
advance the cause of canadas unity than to have simply played it 
safe done nothing or criticized from the sidelines to govern is 
to choose to lead is to run the risk of failure we did not 
succeed but the failure to ratify the accord was not the failure of 
canada 
canada is not a nation of defeatists and this is not a 
government of quitters we will all be back at work next week we 
will implement an agenda of national policy initiatives to respond 
to the economic and social priorities of canadians we will 
initiate programs to bring canadians together and bridge the 
solitudes in which so many english and frenchspeaking canadians 
still live 
there is more to this country than constitutional papers canada 
is more much more than dry parchment lying in a drawer in the 
national archives canada is our inheritance from our parents and 
our legacy to our children canada is admired and respected around 
the world i am not prepared to give up on all of that or any of 
that 
despite this setback despite this great disappointment the 
idea of a truly united generous and tolerant canada endures and 
will eventually prevail 
thank you and good afternoon

pope john paul ii will open the first 
meeting of ukrainian bishops in more than four decades by receiving 
each bishop privately the vatican said saturday 
the change from the popes usual opening with the entire group 
is a sign of special concern for the ukrainian church which was 
suppressed by soviet dictator josef stalin in 1946 
the pope wanted to begin with a human rapport papal 
spokesman joaquin navarro said they can talk greet each other 
get to know each other 
the meetings are scheduled for monday and tuesday 
after the hour set aside monday for the private talks with the 
10 bishops the pope will address the gathering which will also be 
attended by vatican officials and ukrainian church bishops in the 
united states and canada 
until the kremlins recent softening toward the ukrainian 
church bishops there were appointed and worked secretly 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev when he met with the pope 
last fall promised passage of a law granting religious freedom in 
the soviet union the legislation is still pending and the 
ukrainian church is still not recognized officially 
stalin forced the church to merge with the officially sanctioned 
russian orthodox church which took control of property of the 
ukrainian church the church wants the return of or compensation 
for the confiscated churches 
the ukrainian church survived by going underground it is 
believed to have more than 4 million followers in the soviet union 
the dean of the bishops coming from the ukraine for the meeting 
is monsignor volodymyr sterniuk of lvov who is in his 80s 
on sunday the 10 bishops were scheduled to say mass with 
ukrainian cardinal ivan lubachivsky at a church in rome named a 
cardinal in 1985 he is based in rome 
the 10 bishops will have lunch with the pope in his apartment 
monday after the opening session navarro said 
you can say that the popes personal intervention made it 
possible for these people to come here navarro said referring 
to the bishops from the ukraine 
he declined to say exactly what the pope did to make their visit 
possible but indicated there had been bureaucratic problems 
the bishops journey to rome follows the establishment of 
vaticansoviet relations in march and the exchange of diplomatic 
representatives the envoys met thursday at the vatican to discuss 
the activity of the catholic church in the soviet union and other 
issues navarro said

ivan polozkov a hardliner opposed to many 
reforms and now head of the russian republics communist party 
said saturday he is not the political terror he has been made out 
to be 
the russian federation elected polozkov an economist from 
krasnodar to the post friday night 
he gained national fame three weeks ago when populist boris n 
yeltsin defeated him in the campaign for the presidency of russia 
the soviet unions largest republic 
although an outspoken critic of current reforms polozkov told a 
news conference saturday that he would support soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev as head of the national party and would try to 
work out differences with radical reformists 
some people call me a rightist conservative some people call 
me a difficult person some call me unmanageable or disobedient 
some call me unreceptive to innovations he said 
im not as terrible as im portrayed to be im for 
consolidation polozkov said meaning that he wants members to 
overcome their divisions and stay together in the party 
although polozkov has harshly attacked gorbachevs reforms the 
soviet president backed polozkov in his campaign against yeltsin 
gorbachev smiled broadly saturday as the russian party chief 
strode to the dais at the partys meeting to claim the center seat 
as his own 
in an interview with the official tass news agency polozkov 
also said he had no quarrel with yeltsin 
we had no confrontation he said we shall simply work 
together 
polozkov rejected warnings from radical reformists at the party 
meeting that his election would touch off mass defections from the 
communist party 
i do not believe that party organizations will begin acting 
like this in protest unless these party organizations are provoked 
deliberatly by some forces he told tass 
polozkov a 55yearold party chief in krasnodar has appealed 
for strict party discipline and has condemned informal political 
groups he also has fought cooperatives the private businesses 
introduced by gorbachev as part of his economic reforms 
in a speech wednesday polozkov rejected reformers demands for 
the party to apologize for decades of dictatorship 
its immoral to blame the entire party for the mistakes of 
certain former and present leaders and even to demand party 
repentence he said 
however polozkov appeared to take a more conciliatory line in 
his interview with tass saying he was in favor of cooperation with 
all democratic forces supporting gorbachevs program of 
restructuring known as perestroika 
he said he would take steps to avoid a split between 
conservatives and reformists echoing remarks he made before the 
vote friday when he said it is necessary to rescue the party 
from disintegration from within both from those who are on the 
left and those who are on the right

it was going going gone for relics of a failed 
savings and loans once majestic empire saturday as banking 
regulators put fine china rare books and other extravagances on 
the auction block 
were going into the ring for the taxpayers said auctioneer 
jim gall who opened the proceedings with the 1300 sale of 
centrust savings bank chairman david pauls personal mahogany 
humidor every dollar raised lessens the cost of the sampl crisis 
for the taxpayers 
the 11thfloor marble vestibule of the centrust tower was packed 
with more than 400 people eager to bid or just view the luxury 
items of the bank chairman accused by regulators of using the 
thrift as his personal piggy bank 
most of the items came from the failed savings banks executive 
dining rooms and pauls private office 
you dont see something like this every day said gall 
displaying a giant mutton serving dish with an 80pound lid that 
drew a high bid of 3500 
up for sale were 1450 baccarat crystal goblets dozens of 
limoges china sets platinum serving plates goldplated ice tongs 
and oddities like crystal jam jar coasters and a bone holder for 
carving roasts 
paul a target of thrift investigators compiled an office 
library that included a 28volume collection of hg wells works 
signed by the author and a 166yearold original edition of sir 
walter scotts red gauntlet 
the auction drew a 25000 bid for a contemporary painting 
pauls pride one of the few artworks that remained after 
regulators earlier ordered the sale of centrusts art collection 
valued at 30 million the works raised nearly 25 million 
the paintings including portrait of a man as mars by 
flemish master peter paul rubens are often cited as examples of 
the excesses that led to the nations thrift debacle 
last month treasury secretary nicholas f brady roughly doubled 
his earlier estimate of what bailing out the thrift industry will 
cost this year guessing between 90 billion to 130 billion will 
be needed 
he said as much as 50 billion more may be needed in 1991 
the federal resolution trust corp took control of miamibased 
centrust in february and ousted paul whose spending drew criticism 
from regulators 
among the thrifts expenses were luxury fittings for pauls 
yacht linens from india for pauls home subsidized european 
shopping sprees for his wife and purchase of the company sailboat 
bodacious 
at the time of the seizure centrust was floridas largest 
savings and loan and the 23rd largest in the nation the rtc 
announced in april it hoped to sell off centrust by the end of june 
this week the rtc will conduct its first openbidding auction 
of real estate held by insolvent thrifts the properties to be sold 
at auctions conducted in dallas and san antonio texas range from 
a singlehome lot to a 208acre development site 
the sampl crisis is a disaster for taxpayers but a boon for 
auction companies said joseph janosik of auction co of america 
before the auction serious bidders meticulously examined items 
jotting notes and looking for imperfections while others willing 
to pay the 300 refundable entry fee treated it as a historical 
event 
its a happening the sampl crisis centrust all this is just a 
happening said kirk lewis im just here to see what they

the cuban government is willing to cooperate with 
with us prosecutors and turn over tape recordings of meetings 
between fidel castro and manuel noriega for use in the ousted 
panamanian leaders us drug trial a top official said 
in one meeting the cuban president and noriega discussed the 
1984 destruction of a cocaine laboratory in darien panama 
established by colombian drug lords said ramiro abreu a cuban 
official in charge of relations with central america 
noriega told castro about the destruction of the lab as an 
example of panamanian efforts to fight drug smuggling abreu told 
reporters thursday in havana his remarks were carried by spains 
national news agency efe 
federal prosecutors say castro was acting as an intermediary 
between noriega and leaders of colombias notorious medellin 
cocaine cartel who were angered by the loss of the lab 
it is not good to specify what is contained in those 
conversations of noriega with cuban officials because they are 
evidence that could be used at the trial but we are willing to 
collaborate abreu said 
frank rubino noriegas chief defense attorney said friday he 
welcomed public release of the tapes 
we expect that they would be very helpful to us rubino 
said the only thing we could be fearful of is that if the 
government gets them theyll hide them and wont let the truth come 
out 
rubino said castro is willing to cooperate because he wants to 
combat allegations that he acted as a middleman in international 
drug dealings 
noriega is imprisoned in miami awaiting trial on charges that he 
protected usbound cocaine shipments from colombia that passed 
through panama

virginia gov douglas wilder was coy 
about his thinly veiled white house aspirations during a campaign 
swing through the state where early party caucuses help determine 
presidential candidates 
the nations first elected black governor said he has no 
specific designs on the presidency yet but described himself as an 
ideal nominee 
wilders blend of financial conservatism and social activism 
appeals to a broad range of voters the democrat said 
i think its so important that we establish dialogue at the 
national level my interest is doing just that wilder said 
ostensibly stumping for iowa democrats during the weekend 
fundraising swing including state house speaker and gubernatorial 
candidate don avenson wilder also appeared to be testing the 
waters for a 1992 presidential bid 
i have no intention i have no apparatus in mind insisted 
wilder still he conceded he was not saying bring the bible and 
ill put my hand on it 
visiting innercity churches and schools wilder urged state 
democrats to begin a drive to vote president bush out of office in 
1992 
wilder described the type of candidate who would be an ideal 
nominee and admitted id like to think im one of those persons 
in the six months since he became the nations first elected 
black governor wilder has campaigned in 11 states including iowa 
and new hampshire with his message that mixes conservative 
spending with renewed social activism 
thats not a virginia message thats a mainstream message 
he said 
part of wilders early rhetoric sounded much like the stance 
that helped republicans retain control of the white house in 1988 
were not going to raise taxes wilder said were going 
to get rid of some taxes 
iowa political activists understand the early presidential 
maneuvering and immediately began handicapping the candidate 
does it sell today i dont know said iowa democratic 
chairman john roehrick will it sell in two years i think so 
roehrick said theres a new sense among democrats that they need 
to find toughminded managers to run social programs with an eye on 
the fiancial bottom line 
wilders election in a state where only 19 percent of the 
electorate is black shot him to national prominence and 
inevitable comparisons to jesse jackson were drawn some democrats 
see wilder as a more viable national candidate because he is less 
liberal in his views 
jackson is tentatively scheduled to campaign in the state early 
next month 
avenson chuckled at wilders attempts to disclaim his 
presidential aspirations 
he just happened coincidentally to be in new hampshire last 
week and he just sort of stumbled through iowa this week 
avenson said it seems to me thats the first primary and the 
first caucus in the nation

a communications satellite similar 
to one that ended up stranded in a uselessly low orbit three months 
ago was launched to its proper altitude saturday officials said 
the intelsat vi satellite rode into orbit on a titan 3 unmanned 
rocket which lifted off on time from cape canaveral air force 
station it was the same kind of rocket that had left the earlier 
intelsat vi satellite stranded 
the satellite separated from the rocket 25 minutes after 
liftoff bringing cheers and applause in the mission control room 
a rocket wiring problem prevented separation after the march 14 
launch 
were all very anxious to see this mission totally successful 
and were certainly expecting it to be that way said edward m 
browne president of martin marietta commercial titan inc when 
that thing went off separation we were all very happy and we 
naturally let our emotions show that 
a little more than an hour after liftoff an onboard motor 
boosted the satellite to an elliptical orbit 22300 miles above 
earth a series of firings over the next several days will put the 
spacecraft in a circular stationary orbit 
browne said the 270 million launch which includes the cost of 
the 150 million satellite was super totally flawless 
the stranded spacecraft is orbiting about 345 miles above earth 
22000 miles lower than intended that satellite and the one 
launched saturday were not insured 
intelsats board of governors agreed earlier this month to pay 
nasa 90 million for a shuttle rescue mission in which 
spacewalking astronauts will attach a motor to the stranded 
satellite to boost it up to its proper orbit that mission is 
scheduled for 1992 
the satellite deployed saturday joins 14 other intelsat 
spacecraft in orbit once operational in early september the 
40footlong 2ton satellite will be capable of relaying the 
transmissions of three tv channels and up to 120000 telephone 
calls simultaneously 
intelsat a washingtonbased consortium of 119 countries plans 
to send up its next two intelsat vi satellites on the european 
space agencys ariane rocket both launches are scheduled for next 
year 
the next commercial titan launch with nasas mars observer 
spacecraft is set for 1992 
saturdays flight was the third commercial launch for the 
denverbased martin marietta and came after what company officials 
said were exhaustive reviews of the march failure 
its a good way to end what seems now like a long campaign 
said vic whitehead company vice president

portauprince haiti ap thousands of factory workers stayed 
home and most stores and gas stations closed saturday to mourn a 
union activist who was shot to death while attending a meeting of 
the governing council of state 
two leading politicians demanded the resignation of civilian 
president ertha pascaltrouillot who has been blamed for the 
armys failure to halt a recent crime wave 
ms pascaltrouillot has governed along with the 19member 
council of state since her appointment in march 
early saturday sporadic gunfire rang out in the slums of 
portauprince but most public buses were running and the capital 
of 1 million people remained busy street vendors sold their wares 
as usual 
armed police stopped cars at checkpoints in a search for the 
perpetrators of thursdays attack by four gunmen including two in 
army uniforms 
jeanmarie fetiere director of an industrial park near the 
airport said about half the saturday workforce of 9000 stayed 
home long lines formed at the few gas stations that stayed open 
union activist jeanmarie montes was killed and two other men 
were wounded in the shooting which occurred at a hotel where the 
19member council of state was meeting with union and political 
leaders to discuss a surge in violent crime 
the two wounded men council member serge villard and political 
activist emmanuel mani were reported hospitalized in satisfactory 
condition 
today we are mourning another victim in the long line of 
victims of duvalierist terrorism said louis dejoie jr 
president of the centrist national agricultural and industrial 
party until 1986 haiti had been ruled by the brutal duvalier 
family dictatorship for 29 years 
dejoie called for the resignation of mrs pascaltrouillot and 
urged the army to honor its pledge of allegiance to democracy

saturday was supposed to be kathleen 
gooleys wedding day but when the groom backed out and she got 
stuck with the reception bill the jilted bride decided to give her 
party to the homeless 
the 41yearold gooley of norwalk found herself thrust into the 
national spotlight when after her fiance got cold feet two months 
ago she and an intended bridesmaid decided to reorganize the event 
for 150 homeless people from southwestern connecticut 
we would have been doing this at this time anyway gooley 
said saturday as she watched her guests dance to the music of a 
disc jockey who donated his time i hope somebody else in the 
same situation will do the same thing 
busloads of homeless men women and children from norwalk and 
nearby stamford and bridgeport arrived at the pinkandwhite 
decorated canongate catering hall just after noon some were clad 
in jeans and tshirts others shirts and ties or dresses many 
hadnt had a hot meal in weeks 
youre blessing us with your day said eugene patenaude 50 
a recovering alcoholic and drug addict who sleeps in a norwalk 
shelter we will never be able to repay you 
this is christmas in the summer for these people said 
marvin minkler who works with the homeless in the streets and 
escorted a group to the party this is a decent meal for them and 
they dont get it on a daily basis 
donated flower arrangements and balloons adorned each table and 
the guests sat down to an opening course of fruit cup and a tossed 
salad 
waiters and waitresses served hors doeuvres fried won tons 
shrimp puffs chicken wings meatballs and egg rolls the main 
course was stuffed chicken breast and string beans almondine with 
cake ice cream and coffee for dessert 
tara gooley at 11 the youngest of gooleys three children left 
a photocopied note on each plate that read hope you have a great 
day with pictures of teddy bears 
ive seen stories on tv about them the homeless and it makes 
me really sad she said im very fortunate to have what i have 
now today 
the intended bridesmaid rinda farnham thought of giving the 
party for the homeless after the caterer refused to refund 4000 
of the 5800 gooley had paid gooley said 
she said she agreed because she and one of her chidren then a 
baby spent a night in a shelter 23 years ago 
gooleys balance bought 118 dinners everything else was 
donated including the buses that transported the guests members 
of the public who heard through the media walked into the reception

reception and handed gooley a 500 check 
i saw it in the paper and i thought now this is a great 
lady he said 
the guests swarmed around gooley when she emerged from a back 
room hugging her kissing her on the cheek and applauding 
one guest ralph wayne a 37yearold unemployed stamford man 
stepped outside to get some air while the dancing and eating 
continued inside

environmentalists and loggers are anxious to 
see how the bush administration makes good on its promise to find a 
balance in the struggle to save the northern spotted owl without 
crippling the northwest timber industry 
as officials at the interior department and other agencies 
struggled with the issue this weekend some lawmakers said the 
decision could affect president bushs political popularity in the 
northwest as well as the future of the 2foottall brownish owl 
i think the president himself is in a helluva fix said rep 
les aucoin an oregon democrat 
the forest service and bureau of land management were scheduled 
to unveil an owl protection plan friday the same day fish and 
wildlife director john turner formally declared the owl to be a 
threatened species in its range of oregon washington and northern 
california 
turner acted under the endangered species act to guarantee 
protection for the bird 
but the administration postponed its final decision at least 
briefly saying more time was needed to devise a strategy that will 
lessen the impact on the northwests timberdependent communities 
interior secretary manuel lujan flew to new mexico on saturday 
to participate in an interior department conference on equal 
employment opportunities but planned to return to washington 
monday evening a day earlier than originally scheduled to prepare 
for tuesdays announcement 
most congressmen from the region expressed optimism the delay 
will result in a softening of a protection plan recommended in 
april by a government panel headed by forest service biologist jack 
ward thomas that proposal would cut federal timber harvests in the 
region nearly in half and industry officials say it could result in 
the loss of more than 28000 logging industry jobs 
my sense is the extra time that they are taking is in fact to 
move closer to some sort of an economic answer for the northwest 
as opposed to taking the easy path which would be to go with the 
most scientific of the reports that we have which is the thomas 
plan said rep sid morrison rwash 
i sense there is a conflict and that maybe the 
administration is attempting to do more on the economic impact side 
than some of the resource agencies are willing to accept he said 
we heard that maybe somehow magically between now and tuesday 
they are going to come up with an agreement but the forest service 
and blm seem to be moving on two different tracks if we dont have 
a consistent regional approach both agencies may end up in 
court said rep ron wyden dore 
bush who campaigned as an environmentalist in 1988 said in 
portland last month that he was concerned about preserving and 
protecting our environment however he said he rejected those 
who would ignore the economic consequences of the spotted owl 
decision 
in his announcement on friday turner said the white house had 
no attempt to influence his decision to declare the owl a 
threatened species 
but george frampton president of the wilderness society 
complained that the bush administration might seek to water down 
plans to protect the owl 
we are alarmed that a political pressure campaign is now being 
waged by the white house to reverse the recommendations of agency 
heads and the scientists and to subvert the endangered species 
act frampton said 
this is what we will be watching in the next few days he 
said 
industry leaders said it will be a mistake if administrators 
fail to persuade the agencies to mitigate the economic consequences 
of owl protection 
our worst nightmare will come true if federal decisionmakers 
do not respond to our distress signals said bill shields of the 
american forest resource alliance 
the bush administration and congress must step into this 
debate with both feet and fashion a longterm package that strikes 
a balance between the needs of the northern spotted owl and the 
certain layoffs of tens of thousands in washington oregon and 
northern california he said 
forest service spokesman jim sanders said the agency had not 
settled on a policy strategy to protect the owl he declined to 
respond directly when asked if the service was backing away from 
comments chief f dale robertson made earlier about the agencys 
intention to adopt most of the thomas recommendations 
sanders said there will be reductions in timber harvests no 
matter what owl strategy is adopted 
im sure there is going to be some the question is how much 
we are going to try to maintain the timber flow with as little 
disruption as possible but at the same time we are going to 
operate under the endangered species act he said

stop providing temporary first asylum refuge for vietnamese and 
other indochinese boat people and to repatriate those who do not 
qualify as political refugees 
the united states and vietnam object to forced repatriation 
asian countries have given the united states until july 1 to 
arrange new options for people screened out as ineligible for 
resettlement

the united states to drop its objections to forced repatriation or 
accept thousands of boat people who do not qualify as political 
refugees the british colony of hong kong has a large community of 
vietnamese refugees 
immigrants deemed to be fleeing poverty rather than political 
repression are not granted refugee status

the socialist party of prime minister 
felipe gonzalez won a decisive victory saturday in regional 
elections in his native region of andalusia according to partial 
returns 
the balloting was seen as a test of the socialists strength 
after eight years in power in madrids central government and in 
andalusia 
the socialists have been hit by a 6monthold scandal involving 
the brother of deputy prime minister alfonso guerra under 
investigation for alleged influencepeddling in seville 
with 6515 percent of the vote counted the socialists had 4997 
percent of the ballots cast capturing 61 seats in the 109member 
regional parliament said andalusian regional government minister 
manuel gracia 
if the results hold up it would be a slight improvement on the 
socialists showing in the last regional elections in june 1986 
when they won 465 percent of the vote and 60 seats in the 
andalusian parliament 
however gracia estimated that the voter turnout was only about 
54 percent compared with 70 percent in the 1986 balloting which 
coincided with national elections 
based on the partial returns socialist lawyer and former 
national labor minister manuel chaves 44 was expected to become 
andalusias new prime minister 
the final results were not expected until early sunday gracia 
said the polls opened at 9 am and closed at 8 pm 
gonzalezs party needed at least 55 seats to retain the majority 
it first won in andalusias parliament in 1982 the same year the 
socialists swept into power in the national government in a 
landslide victory 
the main opposition force remained the conservative popular 
party gracia said the partial returns showed the popular party 
winning 2079 percent of the vote for 24 to 26 seats in 1986 the 
party took 234 percent and 28 seats 
the communistled united left coalition had 1293 percent of the 
vote and 11 to 13 seats a loss in support from 1986 when it won 
176 percent and 19 seats 
the biggest gains were registered by the populist regional 
andalusista party which was picking up 1154 percent of the vote 
and was expected to win nine seats gracia said in the last 
election the andalusistas had 62 percent and two seats 
newspaper polls earlier this week had indicated that much of the 
socialists support was due to the regions rebounding economy 
where the economic growth rate has averaged 55 percent over the 
last four years 
regional unemployment is still the highest in spain at 24 
percent but it is down from a peak of 30 percent foreign 
investment in andalusia has surged from 161 million in 1986 to 
143 billion last year 
in the campaign the popular party and united left coalition 
tried to capitalize on the guerra scandal by accusing the 
socialists of encouraging corruption 
gonzalez campaigned personally in andalusia denouncing the 
corruption allegations as false and saying they only showed the 
opposition lacked a program for social and economic progress 
the socialistrun central government is spending 7 billion on 
roads highways and communications in andalusia in preparation for 
the worlds fair scheduled in seville from april to october of 
1992

thousands of chanting whistleblowing 
demonstrators marched saturday with hundreds of delegates from an 
international aids conference in a call for more money and health 
care for infected people 
the peaceful march which snowballed in size and snarled traffic 
as it snaked up market street was in marked contrast to the weeks 
worth of protests organized by the aids coalition to unleash power 
or act up that resulted in 299 arrests 
on saturday act up activists were joined by leaders of the 
sixth international conference on who said they were in the battle 
against the disease together 
the apparent divisions between us are not real paul 
volberding a conference cochairman told a crowd of about 20000 
gathered in justin herman plaza at the end of the march we 
cannot tolerate it and hopefully this march will help end it 
march organizers said 20000 people took part in the march and 
rally police put the number of people in the march at around 4000 
marchers carried signs with such messages as aids treatment 
now and increase research funding 
the march was briefly disrupted when hundreds of demonstrators 
led by act ups seattle chapter rushed into the san francisco 
centre screaming were here were queer and were not going 
shopping 
some centre shoppers applauded and others seemed shocked as 
protesters scattered leaflets through the atrium outside a 
nordstrom department store the demonstrators said they were 
protesting the dismissal of a nordstrom employee in seattle who 
tested positive for the aids virus 
nordstrom said the former salesman left the sales floor on his 
own and that the company had offered him other jobs that might be 
less physically stressful the company said he declined those job 
offers 
outside marchers wore stickers emblazoned with a bloody 
handprint that read the government has blood on its hands one 
aids death every half hour a 12foot deaths head bobbed along 
at the rear of the crowd where parents pushed toddlers in 
strollers and friends pushed the wheelchairs of the disabled 
aids is sweeping the nation said maggie duhl 15 a member 
of a group of politically active children there needs to be more 
education about aids especially in the schools it seems the idea 
about aids is that its a gay disease and thats wrong 
many of these kids have someone close to them who has aids 
said her mother barbara duhl who marched with her two children 
and a banner that read kids say money for aids not for war 
its something thats going to be a part of their lives 
speakers at the rally blasted what they said was a lack of 
funding and attention by the federal government and the slow 
process of research aimed at finding a cure for the disease but 
many of the speakers struck a conciliatory tone 
not everyone out there is our enemy said martin delaney 
head of san franciscos project inform we know who has been in 
the fight to save lives and who is in it to make money 
dr june osborn chairwoman of the us national committee on 
aids urged the various factions in the aids controversy to come 
together 
we have much to learn from each other she said 
the crowd was sprinkled with foreign delegates who took time 
from the aids conference to march and listen to the speakers 
its very impressive said dr john gallwey an oxford 
university physician who treats aids patients i wish we could 
get this kind of response back home

president mikhail s gorbachev promised saturday 
he would hold the splintering communist party together and remain 
its leader despite the growing division between conservatives and 
reformers 
the pledge came at the communist party congress in the biggest 
soviet republic which elected as its leader a hardliner who is 
unacceptable to many reformist communists 
ivan polozkov 55 took office saturday as the russian 
republics party chief after defeating a more moderate candidate 
the day before polozkov who has rejected gorbachevs appeals for 
the party to relinquish its control over the economy urged party 
discipline and condemned informal political groups 
in krasnodar the southern russian town where he is party chief 
he cracked down on cooperatives the private businesses introduced 
by gorbachev 
on saturday he told reporters that he would work to unify the 
party and to show that im not as terrible as im portrayed to 
be 
one reformist party leader vladimir lysenko predicted that 
millions of soviets would quit the national organization if 
conservatives are in control 
gorbachev spoke out against the impending national party split 
between conservatives and radicals expected to erupt at a key 
party congress that opens in eight days 
at this decisive stage of perestroika it would be a gift for 
those who want to bury perestroika and defeat it he said 
gorbachev also told the delegates that he must remain both 
president and head of the national party during the period that 
power is being transferred from the party to the government on 
wednesday he had warned that a new party chairman could be elected 
at the congress 
im convinced that now we must keep the situation as it is 
this is the most critical time of the redistribution of power 
between the government councils and the party gorbachev said 
the post should be divided eventually he said 
yegor ligachev the most conservative member of the partys 
ruling politburo has told delegates he will challenge gorbachev 
for the post reform communist vladimir lysenko said ligachev an 
ardent supporter of collective farming even after decades of 
disastrous harvests told the congress this week that gorbachev 
should be replaced 
vadim medvedev a member of the partys ruling politburo 
expanded on gorbachevs determination to hold the party together in 
a talk with reporters during a break in congress proceedings 
we are fighting to avoid a split i dont rule out that some 
people will leave but we are obligated to ensure there will be no 
split he said 
polozkov a frequent critic of gorbachev and his reforms on 
saturday declared his support for gorbachev as head of the national 
communist party and said he would try to work out differences with 
radical reformers in the russian republic 
some people call me a rightist conservative some people call 
me a difficult person some call me unmanageable or disobedient 
some call me unreceptive to innovations polozkov acknowledged at 
a news conference 
but he said he would immediately set to work to show that he was 
for party consolidation 
delegates attending the regional party congress chose polozkov 
in a runoff election friday night he got 1396 votes to 1066 for 
civic engineer oleg lobov according to official results announced 
saturday morning 
after his election polozkov a bespectacled man who speaks with 
an accent similar to gorbachevs strode to the center seat on the 
dais in the congress building gorbachev who has presided over the 
party congress smiled as polozkov took the seat next to him 
polozkov said he did not believe his election would further 
widen the developing split in the national communist party and he 
said he expected to work well with both gorbachev and populist 
reformer boris n yeltsin 
yeltsin defeated polozkov three weeks ago for the presidency of 
the russian republic 
polozkovs election also could pit the republics party leaders 
against its government led by yeltsin who has challenged 
gorbachev by demanding faster reforms and support for 
independenceminded republics 
lysenko of the democratic platform faction the only radical 
among six candidates to oppose polozkov predicted millions of 
people would quit the party if conservatives remain in control 
if it continues that way millions will be leaving the party 
and the national party will fall apart as a totally unviable 
organization lysenko told the interfax news agency run by 
official moscow radio 
russias communists constitute more than half the membership of 
the 18millionmember national party but until this week did not 
have their own republic party organization as do the other 14 
soviet republics 
the russian party was absorbed into the national party in 1925 
partially out of fear its leaders could become competitors in the 
struggle for power 
the russian republic the largest of the 15 constituent 
republics includes moscow and the heartland of the country it 
encompasses about half the population of the soviet union and 
twothirds of its land

a federal appeals court saturday 
indefinitely stayed the black widow killers execution to hear 
arguments that floridas electric chair is faulty and cruel 
the decision by a threejudge panel of the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals in atlanta means that judi buenoano 47 will 
outlive her death warrant which expires at noon monday 
but the legal debate over the states electric chair which sent 
smoke and flames shooting from the head of jesse tafero in 
floridas last execution may 4 will continue with death warrants 
pending against other inmates 
attorneys for ms buenoano pressed their position before us 
district judge patricia fawsett that the chair is faulty the judge 
lifted her stay late friday after weighing claims that an 
electrocution would not violate the constitutional ban on cruel and 
unusual punishment 
ms buenoano is known as the black widow killer because she 
poisoned her husband drowned her paralyzed teenage son and tried 
to murder a boyfriend with a car bomb she attended the hearing 
listening and watching attentively but showing no emotion 
before the atlanta court intervened gov bob martinez office 
had rescheduled her execution for her husbands murder for monday 
judges gerald b tjoflat phyllis a kravitch and emmett r cox 
set aside the execution date and agreed to set a schedule later for 
attorneys to file legal briefs 
state corrections department spokesman bob macmaster said ms 
buenoano would be transferred from florida state prison near starke 
in northern florida a mens prison that houses the electric chair 
back to broward correctional institution the state prison for 
women in fort lauderdale 
the defense claims that tafero was tortured and burned during 
his execution before the last of three jolts of electricity finally 
killed him and blames a faulty electrode in the headpiece 
we are still concerned that our client may literally be burned 
at the stake said chief defense attorney billy nolas 
the state investigated taferos execution and concluded a new 
synthetic sponge placed on his head caused the fire corrections 
officials said the sponge has been replaced by a natural one and 
the 66yearold chair is now functioning properly 
it is clear that the use of the polyurethane sponge was 
improper and caused the sparks smoke and fire around taferos 
head ms fawsett ruled new tests including one conducted at the 
judges direction friday showed the electrocution equipment was 
in good working order she added

black community activists who want predominantly 
black neighborhoods of boston to secede and form an independent 
city named mandela hope nelson mandelas visit here will help their 
cause 
his coming is going to be a tremendous boost to our 
campaign said sadiki kambon chairman of project fate which 
means focusing attitudes towards empowerment we expect to win 
he is an individual of importance who came here talking about 
how we need to build selfdependence and our own companies 
kambon said thursday 
local activists and democratic state rep byron rushing dream of 
creating an independent predominantly black city of 125 square 
miles and 150000 residents named for the south african freedom 
fighter 
the proposal was defeated in nonbinding citywide referendums 
in 1986 and 1988 and led to acrimonious debate opening old wounds 
in this racially torn city noted for its pivotal role in the 
american revolution 
mandela the 71yearold deputy head of the african national 
congress who was freed this year after being imprisoned for 27 
years is a symbol of freedom to blacks around the world 
in boston on saturday he spoke at madison park high school in 
roxbury one of the neighborhoods proposed as part of the city of 
mandela along with mattapan fenway south end and parts of 
dorchester 
independence black community activists say means taking 
control of land development schools and law enforcement similar 
kambon says to the struggle for selfgovernment by blacks in 
mandelas native south africa 
the 1986 referendum failed nearly 31 in a battle that pitted 
black city politicians against their white counterparts and white 
residents against their black neighbors but project fate also 
found opposition among some black residents who didnt want to 
secede 
on the second round the proposal lost 21 when mayor raymond 
flynns administration essentially ignored the issue 
kambon hopes mandelas visit will give the black community 
courage to take risks to gain control over their own affairs 
especially older people who dont experience daily life on the 
citys streets 
just the experience of the man himself will be very 
advantageous he says they the people of these areas will 
have a more personal connection with nelson mandela 
kambon said project fate wrote to mandela explaining the 
proposal but did not receive a reply 
bostons black community about 126200 residents in a total 
population of almost 563000 has been scarred by the violence of 
forced busing and more recently by redlining and police stops of 
suspected gang members on the street 
the public schools have disproportionately few minority 
teachers and the dropout and death rates among black youths has 
skyrocketed because of gangs and drugs 
the bottom line is we dont get the services that we should be 
getting and thats a problem here and across the country says 
kambon who has lived in boston about 15 years 
wouldnt people rather have teachers that live in the 
neighborhood teach their children because they would care and 
police officers that live there who would look out for the 
neighborhood and make certain its a nurturing and healthy 
environment 
among those opposed to creating an independent city some say 
the targeted communities dont have the resources to go it alone 
project fate and rushing plan to present a nonbinding 
referendum asking the state legislature to mandate that a field of 
experts determine whether the proposal is practical they hope to 
get the referendum on the november ballot 
mandela was to leave for washington on sunday

a gloomy prime minister brian mulroney went on 
national tv saturday to apologize to quebec for the failure of a 
constitutional reform that would have recognized the 
frenchspeaking provinces distinct culture 
quebec premier robert bourassa bitterly criticized newfoundland 
premier clyde wells for killing the meech lake accord and said he 
would boycott future constitutional talks 
there has been widespread concern that failure of meech lake 
might lead the people of quebec to push for independence or more 
likely some sort of sovereigntyassociation relationship with the 
rest of canada but bourassa indicated only that his government is 
studying its future options 
the meech lake accord had to be passed by the federal government 
and the legislatures of all 10 provinces by midnight saturday but 
a decision by wells on friday to shelve debate in the newfoundland 
legislature on the constitutional amendment effectively killed it 
federal opposition leaders blamed the accords failure on what 
they called mulroneys lack of leadership and urged him to resign 
the accord which was drafted to achieve unity became over 
three years a lightning rod for discontent about budget and 
interest rates free trade and taxes mulroney said in his 
television address it attracted accusations of favoritism and 
sentiments of rejection and stimulated regional rivalries and even 
linguistic tensions 
much of the discontent of canadians found expression in 
hostility to the meech lake accord 
mulroney said he would begin working monday to find another 
approach to constitutional reform and he tried to calm fears of 
political instability by telling foreign investors not to worry 
about canadas present problems 
bourassa in a speech to his national assembly in quebec city 
said that in the future he would only negotiate quebecs status and 
other national issues oneonone with the federal government not 
with other provinces 
the process of constitutional reform has been discredited and 
the government of quebec will not agree to go back to the 
constitutional table said bourassa 
bourassa said that the failure of meech lake made progress 
unlikely on other constitutional questions dealing with senate 
reform and aboriginal rights 
quebecs leader also said he would not take part in the annual 
meeting of provincial premiers and the prime minister in august in 
which national issues are discussed 
in preparing its future quebec has important assets 
bourassa said citing the provinces economic strength and the 
strategic location 
quebec has the freedom of its choices he said and its 
going to make its choices withs realism and calm i can assure you 
that my only goal will be the superior interests of the quebec 
people 
jacques parizeau leader of the separatist parti quebecois 
extended his hand to bourassa to work out a new direction for the 
province 
newfoundland and manitoba were the only holdouts against meech 
lake named after the government retreat near ottawa where it was 
originally worked out in 1987 
manitoba leaders tried to bring the accord to a vote but were 
blocked by a lone indian legislator who promised to kill the accord 
because he wanted a similar recognition as distinct for native 
people 
while the world gears up for the 21st century mulroney 
said we have failed to resolve a debate that predates 
confederation itself 
to my fellow quebecers i want to say how dismayed i am that 
quebec has not at this time been able to rejoin the 
constitutional family with honor and enthusiasm said mulroney a 
native quebecer but quebec emerged from these negotiations with 
its dignity and its principles intact 
meech lake a constitutional amendment was aimed at winning 
quebecs signature on the 1982 canadian constitution 
many in english canada feared the accord would have given quebec 
extra powers but constitutional experts said the distinct 
society clause would have had few practical effects 
under it the canadian supreme court would have been given a 
guideline to take quebecs special character into consideration 
when ruling on challenges to laws under the constitution 
the clause had strong symbolic significance in the province 
canadas largest with onefourth of the countrys 26 million 
people 
on saturday mulroney seemed anxious that the constitutional 
squabble not affect canadas economy or discourage potential 
investors 
to our friends and partners abroad i urge that this situation 
be kept in perspective he said canadians have always overcome 
challenges to our unity and will shall do so again 
herb gray leader of the liberal opposition blamed mulroney for 
the debacle 
most canadians now seriously question the prime ministers 
moral authority to govern he said

aids is triggering a global explosion of 
tuberculosis especially in africa and at least 2 million people 
are already infected with the microbes that cause both diseases a 
health official warned on saturday 
meanwhile a top east german health expert cautioned that the 
opening of the iron curtain is likely to speed the spread of aids 
in eastern europe which has so far largely escaped it 
tuberculosis is already the worlds single biggest bacterial 
killer and experts fear that hiv the aids virus is likely to 
make the problem much worse 
a serious epidemic of tb is occurring as a result of the hiv 
epidemic especially in subsaharan africa said dr peter eriki 
of the world health organization 
he said africans were unable to contain a relatively small 
tuberculosis problem before the arrival of hiv and they are 
singularly illprepared for coping with a very large problem 
ahead 
eriki a tuberculosis specialist who formerly directed the tb 
control program in uganda described the problem at the sixth 
international conference on aids meeting in san francisco through 
sunday 
about 1000 conference delegates on saturday joined thousands of 
whistleblowing chanting protesters calling for more money and 
better health care for people with hiv disease 
march organizers said 20000 people participated in the march 
and rally police estimates put the size of the march at around 
4000 
the peaceful march was briefly disrupted when a large group of 
demonstrators led by the aids coalition to unleash power rushed 
into the san francisco centre chanting were here were queer 
and were not going shopping 
they said they were protesting the dismissal of a nordstrom 
department store chain employee in seattle who tested hiv positive 
a nordstrom store dominates the centre nordstrom has said the 
former salesman was offered less stressful positions but he 
declined them 
at the rally following the march conference officials joined 
demonstrators to call for more cooperation between activists and 
scientists 
the apparent divisions between us are not real conference 
cochairman paul volberding told a crowd that gathered in justin 
herman plaza at the end of the march we cannot tolerate it and 
hopefully this march will help end it 
now an estimated 17 billion people onethird of the worlds 
population is infected with tuberculosis bacilli most of these 
people suffer no outward symptoms 
however eriki said that 20 million of the infected people are 
sick with tb and 3 million die each year most of them in the 
developing world 
in its rapid spread over the past decade the aids virus now 
infects an estimated 5 million to 10 million people around the 
world eriki said hiv has emerged as the single most important risk 
factor for active tb disease 
hiv weakens the bodys natural defenses against disease this 
can awaken dormant tb infections that had been held in check 
eriki said that hivinfected people are also more likely than 
healthy people to catch the tb germ and to spread it to others 
he said that 15 million of the 2 million people infected with 
both microbes live in subsaharan africa in burundi 55 percent of 
tb patients also carry the aids virus 
as people become more aware of the link between aids and tb 
there is the potential that the diagnosis of tuberculosis will 
become a social stigma eriki said creating fear among health 
care workers who may become reluctant to work in tuberculosis 
programs 
sieghart dittman director of the institute for hygiene 
microbiology and epidemiology in east berlin noted that the aids 
virus is still rare in eastern europe the rate of aids cases is 45 
times lower than in western europe and the hiv infection rate in 
the general population is practically zero 
however he attributed this differences in large part to the 
iron curtain and the berlin wall and cautioned that the removal of 
travel barriers is likely to speed the spread of aids 
now when borders between eastern and western european 
countries have become more open when in germany the walls are 
broken down completely the problem of the spread of hiv infection 
might become far more serious and special attention should be paid 
to this threat he said 
the international aids conference has drawn scientists from over 
the world and has also sparked protests from aids activists 
seeking more money for aids research and treatment and an end to 
discrimination against aids patients as of late friday the number 
of arrests totaled 299 
among other reports presented at saturdays sessions 
a survey of aids screening labs by the us centers for disease 
control shows most do a highly accurate job of spotting 
aidsinfected blood the report by dr david cross found that the 
labs correctly identified 998 percent of samples that carried the 
aids virus and 994 percent that were free of hiv 
children of aidsinfected mothers born free of hiv may still 
suffer developmental problems dr thomas koch and others from the 
university of california san francisco said their work suggests 
the virus in the mothers body somehow harms growth of the fetal 
nervous system even if the virus is not transmitted to the baby 
a university of california san francisco survey of doctors in 
residency training found that twothirds did not plan to treat aids 
patients when they started their own practices half of them said 
they would not want to be known as having people with aids among 
their patients

natural resources and land in moldavia belong to the republic and 
not the soviet union tass said

mass murderer r gene simmons wants to end 
his life in quiet solitude officials say the way he has lived his 
last days on death row shunning the family of those he killed who 
are desperate to learn why 
simmons is scheduled to die by lethal injection monday night for 
the christmastime 1987 murders of 16 people including 14 family 
members 
simmons 49 has refused all visits even from religious 
advisers and family members 
gene more than anything else id like to talk to you said 
manuel ulibarri of denver the brother of simmons slain wife 
becky 
you never forget ulibarri said the hurt is always there 
the whys are always there if you go without telling us anything 
the why will always be there 
charlotte may has asked to witness the execution of the man 
convicted of killing her daughter and grandchild her daughter 
renata 22 was married to one of simmons sons and they had a 
1yearold son 
i want to see for myself that he is dead said ms may she 
said she told a prison official its not going to be any harder 
than when i had to go to the morgue and identify my daughter and 
grandchild 
officials and family members believe that simmons knowing an 
incestuous relationship with his daughter was about to tear apart 
his family methodically killed 14 relatives some as they got 
home from school others as they arrived for a christmas holiday 
no one can say for sure why the convenience store clerk 
massacred the 16 people in about six days because simmons has kept 
silent but surviving family members and officials who investigated 
the murders have pieced together scenarios through evidence old 
letters and assumptions 
prosecutor john bynum believes that simmons who never changed 
his innocent plea wiped out his family because they had become 
aware of an incestuous relationship between simmons and his eldest 
daughter sheila 24 
that relationship signaled a problem between he and his wife 
and the end of their family relationship bynum said last week 
because of that relationship with his daughter he became 
alienated and isolated from all these other people 
one of simmons attorneys john c harris of russellville said 
his client had received hundreds of requests for interviews from 
national television shows and magazines they have been denied 
simmons refusal to talk to reporters is consistent with his 
behavior on death row where he has kept his distance from other 
inmates said prison spokesman david white 
he doesnt have a lot of conversation really with anyone 
that has been his demeanor throughout his incarceration with us 
white said friday apparently he wants to go this thing alone 
simmons has maintained that he wants to die to let the torture 
and suffering in me end he has rebuffed all appeals on his 
behalf and federal judges have ruled in separate decisions that a 
roman catholic priest and a fellow deathrow inmate had no legal 
standing to intervene in an effort to block the execution 
state attorney general steve clark has said that only simmons 
can prevent his execution by seeking an appeal simmons has shown 
no inclination to do so prison officials and attorneys say 
in march 1989 simmons was within 12 hours of execution before 
the us supreme court issued a stay 
he was moved friday from the state correction departments 
maximum security unit at tucker to a cell next to the death chamber 
at the cummins unit it is the same cell where john edward swindler 
was housed before he died in the electric chair last monday for the 
1976 slaying of a police officer

hundreds of trucks adorned with yellow 
ribbons rolled through the heart of oregons timber country 
saturday honking horns to protest federal logging reductions 
planned to protect endangered owls 
im kind of blowing off steam said joe trimble of roseburg 
who joined a column of 434 rigs that took an hour to pass through 
this western oregon town for a lot of us this might be our last 
show 
us fish and wildlife service director john turner announced 
friday that the northern spotted owl was given threatened species 
status because logging is destroying the birds oldgrowth forest 
habitats in oregon washington and northern california 
trimble said his gripe is with federal officials not the 
nocturnal bird 
im not mad at the owl he said hes just there 
turner said he didnt expect to see logging significantly 
disrupted this summer because nearly all timber sales on federal 
lands have already been reviewed by his agency 
timber industry representatives have warned that tens of 
thousands of people stand to lose their jobs if the government puts 
millions of acres of timber offlimits to logging to save the owl 
people lined the streets wearing yellow hats shirts and ribbons 
to show solidarity with loggers as the line of trucks rolled past 
drivers threw candy to children waved and smiled while blowing 
horns so loudly people couldnt hear each other talk 
among those on the sidewalk was carol maples of roseburg 
wearing a yellow shirt and holding the youngest of her four 
children tenille dressed in a yellow sweater 
her husband perry maples is a lumberjack she said everyone in 
her family either works in logging or is married to a logger 
im just supporting the timber industry mrs maples said 
i dont know if it will do any good they environmentalists 
have already got what they wanted 
everything here revolves around logging she said there 
aint much to do unless you move away 
the protest was part of forest celebration 90 a rally 
sponsored by timber industry support groups afterward people 
gathered at umpqua park at the douglas county fairgrounds for 
speeches by political candidates a forum on natural resources and 
a concert by hoyt axton 
a us forest service study called douglas county the most 
timberdependent county in oregon it is named for 19th century 
scottish botanist david douglas whose name is borne by the douglas 
fir the towering staple of the timber industry in the northwest 
environmentalists and scientists say protection is needed 
because the birds numbers have dwindled to between 3000 and 5000 
breeding pairs

temperatures reaching a blistering 105 degrees to find survivors 
but hope was fading fast 
today we found eight people alive but they will probably be 
the last we uncover said nassir zadeh a revolutionary guards 
officer taking part in the search and rescue operations 
clouds of dust rose over the rubble as thousands of 
townspeople soldiers and rescue workers milled about this city 
once home to 180000 people 
the quake destroyed or damaged an estimated 95 percent of the 
buildings in rudbar 140 miles northwest of tehran a dam about a 
mile upriver from the city held firm during the quake or many more 
lives would have been lost

warehouses at a nearby base were reduced to heaps of stone and 
mortar 
dozens of iranian military helicopters flew supplies into 
makeshift airstrips on a small island in the river that flows 
through the city 
there was massive confusion on the roads leading to rudbar and 
the neighboring town of manjil also leveled by the quake 
detachments of police soldiers and paramilitary volunteers 
struggled in vain to keep the traffic moving 
the twolane roads were clogged with rubble from collapsed 
buildings and huge boulders that had been dislodged from the 
surrounding hills 
milelong columns of buses ambulances and flatbed trucks 
carrying bulldozers cranes and other equipment had to wait for 
hours to reach their destinations 
journalists flying over the region south of the caspian sea 
saw horrific devastation in remote villages where thousands of mud 
brick and concrete houses were flattened into rubble 
large cracks in the soil some of them more than a foot wide 
testified to the power of the quake which measured 73 on the 
richter scale 
and there were the unforgettable scenes 
a group of about eight orphaned children no more than 
8yearsold smiled at reporters as they were driven away in an 
army truck to an uncertain future

the opposition liberal party saturday elected as 
its leader jean chretien an opponent of a failed constitutional 
reform that would have recognized the distinct culture of quebec 
chretien 56 topped montreal member of parliament paul martin 
2652 votes to 1176 he succeeds party leader john turner who 
beat chretien for the top job in 1984 then led the liberals through 
two election thrashings 
chretien a lawyer was elected to an indefinite term he is not 
a member of parliament and must stand in a not yet set byelection 
earlier the party congress chose another opponent of the 
socalled meech lake accords as president purely an administrative 
role former cabinet minister don johnston defeated former 
minister john roberts 1118 votes to 958 
johnston succeeds michel robert for a twoyear term 
the 350000member party is canadas main opposition group 
the party convention came as canada smarted from the defeat of 
the meech lake accord that would have designated quebec a 
distinct society the constitutional amendment was aimed at 
winning quebecs signature on the 1982 constitution and prevent any 
secessionist move by the province 
chretien from quebec now has the formidable task of rebuilding 
links with his province and healing a party deeply divided over the 
meech lake accord that died saturday 
the meech lake accord was strongly backed by prime minister 
brian mulroney and his progressive conservative party 
the agreement had to be passed by the federal government and the 
legislatures of all 10 provinces by midnight saturday but a 
decision by newfoundland premier clyde wells on friday to shelve 
debate in his provinces legislature on the constitutional 
amendment effectively killed it 
johnston a montreal tax lawyer left the liberal party three 
years ago over its support of the meech lake accords and sat in 
parliament as an independent he resigned from politics the next 
year 
johnston said reduction of the federal partys 35million debt 
will be his top priority as party leader

a un mediator said saturday that 
salvadoran government and rebel negotiators had made progress 
toward resolving one key issue in their peace talks the role of 
the armed forces 
but un mediator alvaro de soto and representatives of both 
sides cautioned that no agreements had been reached after five days 
of talks in this resort town 40 miles south of mexico city 
we have advanced considerably on the subject of the armed 
forces soto said he declined to elaborate citing rules of 
confidentiality agreed upon by the two sides 
soto said the negotiators had discussed rebel demands that 
notorious human rights violators be purged from the ranks of the 
armed forces 
he said the discussions had now moved on to the role of the 
civil defense forces a combatequipped volunteer force which has 
been accused by international human rights groups of abusing the 
civilian population 
miguel saenz a member of the rebel delegation said saturdays 
session had produced advances but i wouldnt call them 
considerable 
there are no agreements the progress is in fact that 
previous days were characterized by much generalization and now 
were getting down to more concrete matters he said 
oscar santamaria chief of the government delegation said he 
agreed with soto that considerable progress had been made 
although the government has not agreed to rebel demands to 
dissolve the civil defense forces santamaria said its role could 
be changed to make it a relief or public service organization 
acting entirely in the civilian field 
members of both delegations say the current round of talks offer 
better prospects for progress albeit slight towards ending el 
salvadors 10yearold civil war than four previous tries at 
negotiations between 1984 and 1989 
meanwhile in san salvador the capital an estimated 2000 
people took part in a peace march urging the rebel farabundo marti 
liberation front fmln and the government to end the war in which 
about 72000 people have died 
the rebels have demanded that human rights violators be punished 
and removed from the armys ranks as a necessary precondition to a 
peace agreement 
although international rights organizations say military and 
militarylinked death squads have been responsible for slaying up 
to 30000 people no officer has ever been convicted or even tried 
for rights abuse

shakespeare fans with ready cash and a taste for 
grandeur will have a chance to buy a piece of history when the 
title of lord of the manor stratforduponavon is auctioned on 
july 19 
the title which dates from the end of the seventh century is 
britains most expensive having been sold two years ago for 
150500 
it will be part of a sale of english literature history books 
and manuscripts at sothebys auction house in london the company 
announced in a sale catalog issued friday sothebys did not say 
who owned the title 
lordships of the manor are the oldest titles in england 
predating the norman conquest of 1066 but their significance is 
largely symbolic today and they carry no rights to land houses or 
a seat in the house of lords 
the owner does not become a lord but can write lord of the 
manor of stratforduponavon after his or her name 
the sunday times said the seller of the title was donald wilson 
a commoner who bought it from lord sackville 
the rapidity with which the title has been put back on the 
market suggests that this quaint industry the selling of 
lordships is becoming a speculators game the newspaper said 
david williamson coeditor of debretts peerage was quoted by 
the sunday times as saying i think it is ridiculous people are 
paying huge prices because they think they can call themselves 
lord but they cant these titles mean nothing 
the sunday times said sales of titles are expected to raise 
nearly 7 million this year double the 1989 figure 
william shakespeare was born in stratforduponavon in 1564 
spent much of his life there and was buried in 1616 in holy trinity 
church 
the manor was the keystone of the english feudal system and the 
lord of the manor was the most important person in village affairs 
traditionally the lord gave his people protection in return for 
services and throughout the middle ages the english nobility 
based its power on the ownership of land through the manor 
the powers of the lord gradually diminished as those of the king 
grew 
the title at stratforduponavon is first mentioned as land 
belonging to ethelard subking of the hwicca tribe who granted it 
to egwin who was third bishop of worcester from 693 to 714 
the title passed to successive bishops of worcester for 
centuries until 1549 when it passed to john dudley earl of 
warwick 
on the death in 1553 of king edward vi dudley tried to put his 
daughterinlaw lady jane grey on the throne but he failed and 
was executed the following year 
the title has also been held by the 3rd duke of dorset a 
british ambassador to the court of versailles remembered for 
taking an english cricket team to france as the 1789 revolution was 
erupting 
another title holder was lionel edward 3rd lord sackville 
uncle of a vita sackvillewest a leading light in the bloomsbury 
literary movement of 1920s london

more than half of about 18 artworks taken from a mineshaft 
hiding place near quedlinburg in 1945 
the meadors allegedly inherited the trove valued in the 
millions when their brother died of cancer 
raymond a krell a houston attorney for the meadors did not 
return phone calls saturday from the associated press 
alan harris an attorney for the church declined to comment on 
the motions saturday 
no court action was taken friday on the motions 
the church filed a lawsuit monday after three weeks of 
negotiations with the family reached an impasse 
the lawsuit which also names the first national bank of 
whitewright as a defendant seeks unspecified damages the bank has 
held some of the artwork for at least the last three months its 
lawyer said 
a us state department legal adviser said this week that the 
lawsuit was filed after east german officials learned the treasures 
were about to be moved to switzerland where secrecy laws would 
make them impossible to trace or recover 
us district judge sidney a fitzwater granted a 10day 
temporary restraining order monday barring movement of the trove 
pending a decision in the case but he denied a plea by church 
lawyers that the items be placed in court custody for safekeeping 
on tuesday he ordered the church be allowed to examine 
photograph and inventory treasures being stored in vaults at the 
whitewright bank and the first interstate bank of dallas 
during an examination thursday of mrs cooks safedeposit boxes 
in dallas only one item believed to be a quedlinburg treasure was 
found the church contends 
mrs cook removed several of the other items last week the 
church says and an unidentified person rented a new safedeposit 
box and placed certain items into it the objects were not 
identified

mayor alex daoud bought via the city 
police department four handguns from firearms companies competing 
for a lucrative contract to arm the police force a newspaper 
reported saturday 
daoud obtained at least two sigarms inc semiautomatic handguns 
from a vero beach dealer before voting in september for purchase of 
153000 worth of sigarms guns the miami herald reported 
daoud received a third weapon at halfprice and allegedly in 
violation of federal gun laws prohibiting interstate sales of 
weapons without firearms transaction reports from glock inc a 
georgia distributor competing for the same contract the herald 
reported 
daoud bought another weapon from sigarms that was delivered 
seven weeks after the september vote the paper reported 
daoud has refused to comment on the gun purchases or other 
financial deals with city contractors that have made him the focus 
of a federal investigation into allegations he used his public 
office for private gain 
several other miami beach officials including the purchasing 
director and former police chief say the transactions appear 
improper and could pose a conflict of interest 
i dont like the ethics of buying from suppliers the city is 
doing business with said edward davis the purchasing director 
daoud placed his gun orders through police sgt john clements 
who runs the departments shooting range and was in charge of 
contracting for the force the herald reported 
he was probably trying to get a discounted price the price a 
police officer would get clements told the herald in 
retrospect it was bad judgment if i had to do it over again i 
wouldnt do it but at the time i didnt think there was anything 
wrong with it 
karl walter a vice president in glocks georgia office and 
thomas boyle an executive with sig sauers us distributor 
denied they were trying to get an edge in the competition for the 
city gun contract and said they were only reacting to the mayors 
requests for pistols 
he asked and i said yes said boyle who told davis that 
daoud only paid for the guns last week the herald said

several dozen reform jewish rabbis around the 
nation are homosexual rabbis acknowledge and for the first time 
in the religions 4000year history they may gain official support 
at the annual meeting of the central conference of american 
rabbis which starts sunday reform rabbis from around the nation 
will decide whether to stand behind colleagues who have kept their 
homosexuality secret 
the rabbis serve some 15 million reform jews in the united 
states 
a fouryear study prepared by a committee under rabbi selig 
salkowitz of union temple in brooklyn supports gay and lesbian 
rabbis while affirming heterosexual monogamous procreative 
marriage as the ideal jewish union 
a proposed resolution to be put to a vote monday says gay or 
lesbian rabbis are not condemned or unacceptable under reform 
judaism but notes they may not be acceptable to all congregations 
it will still be up to the rabbis if they wish to come out of the 
closet 
the committee urges that all rabbis regardless of sexual 
orientation be accorded the opportunity to fulfill the sacred 
vocation which they have chosen sexual orientation is 
irrelevant to the human worth of a person the resolution says 
it is expected to pass conference executive vice president 
rabbi joseph glaser has said 
gay and lesbian rabbis though not publicly acknowleged as such 
and their supporters raised the issue with the conference to 
support their admittance to hebrew union collegejewish institute 
of religion which ordains about 40 rabbis a year from campuses in 
cincinnati new york los angeles and jerusalem 
salkowitz said probably less than 10 percent of the 1560 reform 
rabbis nationwide are homosexual reflecting some estimates of the 
number of homosexuals in the general population 
rabbi gary zola national dean of admissions for the hebrew 
union college in cincinnati since 1982 estimated there were 
probably under 5 percent 
the college officially does not know whether or not people it 
has admitted have or havent been homosexual unofficially we 
know that some must be zola said 
the colleges policy has been not to bring up the subject of 
sexual orientation when screening candidates and that policy will 
not change zola said 
he was unaware of anyone who had been accepted to the rabbinical 
college who had professed to being homosexual 
the conference can refuse to place and congregations can dismiss 
a rabbi but a homosexual rabbi cannot lose his or her ordination 
which represents an attainment of learning not a sanctification by 
god as in the priesthood 
ancient jewish law is uniformly against homosexuality the first 
reference in leviticus states that with a man shalt thou not 
lie as with a woman it is an abomination 
reform judaism is not strictly bound by ancient jewish law but 
allows for thousands of years of social change that have occurred 
since moses time it was the first branch of judaism to ordain 
women as rabbis in 1972 
the conservative movement ordained its first woman rabbi in 
1985 but still opposes homosexual rabbis orthodox jews do not 
allow women or homosexual rabbis

a man and two sons lost in a cave 
without food water or light for most of a week were rescued 
saturday officials said 
gary william lutes 37 and sons gary jr 13 and timothy 9 
of tampa fla were rescued at 2 am then hospitalized for 
dehydration 
lutes said the three became lost monday when their lamps went 
out leaving them in total darkness in new trout cave in pendleton 
county in eastern west virginia 
we had been exploring for about an hour and a half and we 
were supposed to have another half an hour lutes said in a 
telephone interview from rockingham memorial hospital in 
harrisonburg va 
the three had left their pack with food and water on a side 
trail when their lamps started going out said lutes who had 
explored caves for the past 20 years without becoming lost 
we would have had to crawl on our hands and knees and we 
could have gone in circles or in the wrong direction lutes said 
we decided the best thing to do was sit down and wait for someone 
to find us 
the search didnt start until thursday when the three were to 
meet with family members in powhatan va 
when they didnt arrive family members contacted authorities 
and local and regional cave explorers started looking for the 
luteses 
rescuers entered the cave late friday and found the familys

saturday in boston a city he saluted as inspiring the kind of 
freedom he is trying to win in his native south africa 
mandela spoke to high school students in a predominantly black 
neighborhood was the guest of honor at a luncheon at the john f 
kennedy library then went to the esplanade for a concert to 
benefit his african national congress 
mandelas busy public day ended at a fundraising reception at 
the copley plaza hotel where he spoke and accepted an honorary 
doctor of laws degree from northeastern university the degree was 
awarded to him in absentia two years ago while he was imprisoned 
the mandelas were to spend the night at the copley 
mandela and his entourage arrived at logan international airport 
from new york shortly before 11 am to the chants and screams of 
supporters 
the crowd waved the anc banner of black green and gold and 
danced a traditional south african dance mandela joined in a few 
steps 
he praised boston for its role in the american revolution and 
its leadership in the antiapartheid movement 
it was here that the boston tea party served notice that the 
citizens of this country would not live under domination by the 
british mandela said that was the establishment of a 
fundamental principle which has inspired democracies and democrats 
freedom fighters revolutionaries all over the world 
at the luncheon at the kennedy library mandela was presented 
with a bust of the late president by sen edward kennedy 
flanked by kennedy family members including former first lady 
jacqueline kennedy onassis mandela praised the senator for pushing 
for sanctions against south africa 
he cited kennedys trip to south africa and his unsuccessful 
effort to visit mandela in prison which mandela said nonetheless 
gave the black prisoners in a white south africa a lot of 
strength and hope 
later on the grassy esplanade on the banks of the charles 
river mandela danced to a song written in his honor before a crowd 
of 221000 
he again thanked those in boston and beyond for fighting 
apartheid 
it was you who rallied around our cause at a time when we 
thought ourselves all alone for all this we are very grateful to 
you in massachusetts in connecticut and the entire new england 
area he said as thousands waved anc flags and banners of black 
green and gold 
after the speech strains of a tribute to mandela composed by 
hugh masekela rang out from speakers and mandela danced grinning 
broadly jackson browne paul simon and ladysmith black mambazo 
also performed 
mandelas wife winnie led the crowd in chants and apologized 
for not appearing at a tribute held earlier at st pauls cathedral 
i understand one of the fascists telephoned and made a bomb 
threat im very sorry she said organizers of the tribute said 
someone had called a bomb threat into the cathedral at noon a bomb 
squad swept through and pronounced the site safe before letting the 
audience in 
but the state department told mrs mandela through an anc 
representative not to go to the event said judie blair a 
spokeswoman for a local antiapartheid group adding she did not 
know why 
the mandelas daughter zenani dlamini 31 who lives in boston 
with her husband went to the cathedral without her mother 
mandelas daughter by his first marriage makaziwe 36 who attends 
the university of massachusetts at amherst did not attend 
saturdays public events but was expected to meet with her father 
privately sunday morning said janet levine a south african exiled 
writer who lives in boston 
earlier saturday mandela urged students who had been waiting 
several hours in a high school gymnasium without air conditioning 
to hear him speak not to drop out of school 
he called education the most powerful weapon which we can use 
in order to prepare our youth in their role as leaders of 
tomorrow 
if there is any appeal i could make is that the young people 
of boston and indeed young people in the united states must take 
it upon themselves to ensure they receive the highest education 
possible so they can represent us as future leaders he told the 
cheering crowd 
standing before a handpainted mural of him mandela concluded 
with words that have marked many of his speeches in the united 
states just remember we respect you we admire you and above 
all we love you 
after mandelas 10minute speech paul goodnight 44 of 
bostons predominantly black roxbury section said i feel great 
about the energy that is out here because of him yeah it was a 
short visit but i appreciate someone coming here and stirring us 
up 
crowds lined mandelas motorcade route through roxbury and their 
response to mandelas quick wave was enthusiastic 
people are ready for him he was in jail for so many years and 
he came out with so much love after 27 years i know he is a child 
of god said joycelyn patterson a resident who waited for 
mandelas limousine to drive by 
the 71yearold deputy head of the african national congress is 
on a grueling sixweek tour of 14 countries aimed at raising money 
and keeping international pressure on south africas government to

owners of 16 million chevrolet camaro and 
pontiac firebird cars should check their seat belt release buttons 
for damage that could lead to belt failure the government said 
friday 
general motors corp plans a recall of 1984 to 1990 carmaros and 
firebirds to replace or repair the belts free of charge the 
national highway transportation safety administration said adding 
that damaged belt buckles should be replaced immediately 
the problem is caused when the red plastic pushbutton weakens 
from prolonged exposure to radiation and heat from the sun the 
agency said 
this may cause the safety belt to latch improperly or not at 
all greatly increasing the risk of injury in a crash it said 
nhtsa administrator jerry curry said if a safety belt on one of 
the affected cars does not latch or release properly the car 
should be taken in for repair if there is no damage to any of the 
cars four belts owners can await recall letters from gm he said 
owners of vehicles that dont need immediate attention will be 
sent followup letters by the manufacturer for buckle replacement 
as parts become available nhtsa said 
the problem has been investigated by the government since 
august curry said gm voluntarily is conducting the recall

senate democratic leader george mitchell moved 
friday to head off a filibuster over a major bill to combat job 
discrimination and said he hoped to bring the measure to the floor 
next week 
but it appeared likely that opponents of the measure still would 
be able to force postponement of any vote on final passage until 
next month if they failed to reach a compromise with sponsors 
mitchell told the senate that positive and productive 
negotiations between the bush administration and senate sponsors 
are in progress but moved to shut off debate in case they failed to 
yield agreement 
republican leader bob dole of kansas replied that gop lawmakers 
would not be stampeded into approving such a measure during the 
visit to capitol hill next week of south african leader nelson 
mandela 
its pretty obvious what is happening here they want to have 
a bill pending when mr mandela is addressing a joint meeting of 
congress on tuesday dole told the senate 
the bill aims at overturning six jobdiscrimination decisions 
that the supreme court handed down last year 
provisions range from a ban on racial harrassment in the 
workplace to requiring employers whose hiring patterns do not 
reflect local demographics to show that their practices are 
necessary for business reasons 
the bush administration has been threatening a presidential veto 
of the measure produced by the senate labor and human resources 
committee but talks between sponsors and the administration have 
been going on with an eye toward resolving the problems 
the administration says the bill that emerged from committee 
would usher in the use of racial hiring quotas on the part of 
employers who would be fearful of lawsuits otherwise senate 
sponsors led by sen edward m kennedy dmass disagree and note 
that the measure says nothing about quotas 
mitchells move friday was not designed to shut off a filibuster 
actually in progress but to assure that no such delaying tactics 
could be used to block floor action before next weeks fourth of 
july recess 
mitchells action if approved would shut off debate on a motion 
to proceed to floor action on the bill but opponents of the bill 
could still force delay of a final passage vote until after the 
recess 
he set a vote tuesday on whether to shut off debate but left 
open the possibility that agreement could still be reached 
it is my fervent hope that we will be able to reach an 
agreement that will be satisfactory to all concerned mitchell 
said 
as a result of the negotiations he said the issues have been 
significantly narrowed on that matter and there will hopefully be 
an agreement which will permit us to act in a relatively concise 
period of time and that is of course an objective that we all 
share 
dole said he objected to the notion of using the mandela visit 
to bring pressure on the senate to push through the civil rights 
measure i know there must be temptation he said 
he said there was no opposition to civil rights on this side 
of the aisle but that a number of concerns about the specifics of 
the bill remained 
maybe by next week we will have that worked out he said

cranes on barges began scooping away a 
mass of debris floating beside an ohio river dam friday after the 
body of a 23rd victim of last weeks flash flood was found 
officials said 
the body was found thursday night near the hannibal locks and 
dam among the rubble of homes and belongings destroyed by a wall of 
water which rushed down the wegee and pipe creeks more than 20 
miles upstream near shadyside on june 14 said chuck vogt the 
belmont county coroners investigator 
the number of people listed as missing dropped from 11 to 10

latest victim was being withheld until relatives are notified vogt 
said 
steven wright an army corps of engineers spokesman at the dam 
said two cranes were assisting in the search 
they are dipping their buckets very gently into the debris 
because we are searching for bodies out there the material is 
being placed on another barge where people are going through it by 
hand he said

which floated on a surface area about the size of two city blocks 
also visible among the mass were toys furniture propane and 
heating oil tanks and dozens of tires

soviet oil exports dropped nearly 10 percent 
last year according to figures provided friday by the cia raising 
concerns about domestic oil shortages and cuts in supply to eastern 
europe 
the export drop reflected a decline in oil production caused by 
aging wells labor unrest and bureaucratic chaos us officials 
said 
the soviet union exported 369 million barrels of oil a day in 
1989 down from 408 million in 1988 according to the newly 
compiled cia figures the decline matches the drop in oil 
production although the soviet union is still the worlds largest 
oil producer most of its oil is used at home 
the export cuts were made in soviet sales to western europe 
surprising analysts who believed the kremlin was so strapped for 
cash that it would have reduced supplies to eastern europe which 
pays for soviet oil with goods not money 
so far this year the soviets have sharply cut supplies to their 
onetime communist allies in eastern europe but they have promised 
to make up the shortfall by summer 
us government officials are uncertain whether this years drop 
foretells a dramatic interruption in supplies to eastern europe or 
whether such temporary cutoffs previously happened frequently but 
were unreported by the secretive former communist governments of 
the soviet bloc 
the us officials predict a further decline in soviet 
production unless the kremlin opens the door to foreign investment 
in offshore drilling and in technology to salvage wells damaged by 
years of forced production in western siberia and other regions 
without western assistance production will probably decline 
dramatically said one us official who spoke only on condition 
of anonymity 
the soviets oil problems are somewhat mirrored by the us 
experience aging wells environmental objections to offshore 
drilling and weak prices have led to a decline in us production 
from 9 million barrels a day in 1985 to about 74 million barrels a 
day now and an increase in imports as a percent of consumption 
from 31 percen to about 50 percent in the same period 
a barrel is 42 gallons 
us companies are eager to sell their technology and knowhow 
to the soviets but most are put off by bureaucratic red tape and 
by the difficulties in converting profits in rubles the soviet 
currency into dollars 
furthermore us and other companies are concerned about making 
deals with the soviet ministry of petroleum and gas industry which 
has undergone several reorganizations in the past year as the 
kremlin struggles with economic reforms 
us officials say leonid filimonov currently in charge of the 
ministry may lose his job this summer 
analysts and government officials attribute the soviet problems 
to aging oil fields which no longer yield as much as before wells 
which became waterlogged because the soviets wanted to increase 
production by forcibly injecting them with water and a lack of 
funds for the technology needed to explore new offshore and arctic 
circle fields 
in addition the new openness in the soviet union has spawned 
labor unrest as oil field workers demand better living conditions 
ethnic unrest in several soviet republics especially azarbaijan 
has cut into the production of oil and natural gas equipment 
officials say 
us officials are divided however on whether the reduction in 
soviet exports will come at the expense of the kremlins newly 
democratic clients in eastern europe 
the soviet government announced several months ago that starting 
in 1991 it would only sell oil for cash 
eastern europe heavily indebted and trying to move from a 
communist to a freemarket economy relies on the soviets for 70 
percent of its oil 
faced with a very difficult choice of paying in valuable and 
scarce hard currency for their previously subsidized oil and gas 
imports from moscow or buying those supplies from other sources 
hungary poland and romania will probably opt for increasing their 
trade with middle eastern oil exporters wrote robert copaken a 
senior political economist at the department of energy 
the eastern europeans could pay for the oil with goods they 
produce although these have traditionally been too low in quality 
to effectively compete with western goods copaken wrote in the 
june issue of the eastwest report a newsletter 
but a us government official speaking on condition he not be 
named predicted that eastern europe probably can continue to rely 
on soviet oil supplies in the short term 
eastern europeans might work out an agreement whereby they will 
barter goods for oil at real market prices rather than the heavily 
subsidized and unrealistic prices both sides enjoyed in the past 
he said

a federal judge has partly overturned the 
conviction of former cook county circuit judge john f reynolds 
stemming from the operation greylord investigation of judicial 
corruption his attorney said friday 
us district judge william t hart vacated reynolds 
convictions on 30 counts of mail fraud ruling that the mailfraud 
statute was improperly applied in reynolds case said attorney 
jeffrey steinback 
still standing are reynolds convictions on six counts of 
racketeering conspiracy and a subsequent conviction on perjury 
steinback said 
operation greylord was an undercover fbi sting operation 
that uncovered judicial corruption and resulted in convictions of 
judges other court officials and one state legislator 
reynolds convicted in 1986 and ordered to repay 33000 in 
bribes for fixing cases has served four years of a 10year prison 
sentence on the mailfraud and conspiracy convictions he also is 
serving a twoyear consecutive sentence for perjury steinback said 
friday 
were obviously pleased with the determination by hart said 
steinback who said his 59yearold client is incarcerated at a 
federal minimumsecurity facility in big spring texas 
a message left with the us attorneys office was not returned 
late friday afternoon 
reynolds mailfraud convictions were vacated monday and for 
the same reason mailfraud convictions were overturned in 1988 in 
the case of reginald holzer another judge found guilty in the 
greylord probe steinback said 
both involved allegations that the defendants had defrauded 
citizens of intangible rights such as good government by 
their actions the us supreme court ruled in 1987 that the fraud 
in such cases had to involve loss of tangible assets such as money 
or property 
steinback said a status hearing in reynolds case is scheduled 
for july 5 and he will decide afterward whether to seek a reduced 
sentence for his client reynolds could be released as early as six 
months from now even without a reduced sentence steinback said

women dominated a protest that brought 140 
arrests outside the international aids conference to dramatize 
activists complaints that research is too maleoriented 
were here because women with aids are not getting access to 
drug treatment trials said kate bollard a member of seattles 
chapter of act up the aids activist group women are being only 
looked at as people who transmit the virus not as people who have 
the virus 
the friday arrests came after several hundred protesters blocked 
traffic in a downtown shopping district they brought total arrests 
during four days of protest to 299 at the sixth international 
conference on aids at the moscone center which has been shielded 
from protesters by tight security 
the only incident inside came friday morning when demonstrators 
held up a banner reading niaid form a womens committee

an international committee is calling for much 
tighter job exposure standards after finding that radiation is 
three times more dangerous than was believed little more than a 
decade ago 
the international commission on radiological protection said 
friday it would recommend a 60 percent reduction in job standards 
from an annual dose of 5 rem to 2 rem 
a rem is a standard measure of dose from powerful ionizing 
radiation like xrays or nuclear radioactivity doses often are 
expressed in millirem or thousandths of a rem a chest xray from 
an uptodate machine will expose the patient to about 20 millirems 
for longterm exposure of the general public the commission is 
maintaining its current recommendation of no more than 100 millirem 
per year on average but it is suggesting that the averaging period 
be five years instead of a lifetime

the soviet union is shifting nuclear warheads 
out of its rebellious baltic and southern states and into less 
volatile parts of the russian republic us officials say 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
moves reflected moscows concerns about nationalist and ethnic 
tensions that could lead to attempts by rebel forces to take 
control of a nuclear weapons storage depot 
private specialists on the soviet military said the united 
states should view the development as reassuring because it 
indicates kremlin authorities are taking precautions in the face of 
political instability in nonrussian republics 
its at least as much in our interest as in the soviets 
interest that their nuclear weapons not fall into the wrong 
hands said matthew bunn a senior research analyst at the arms 
control association

carlos sheriff brought home a redandwhite 
folder every week telling his mother everything she needed to know 
about his education 
so did nearly 160000 other students in two states 
those folders have become a trademark of a program that seeks to 
assist schools in getting parents involved in the education of 
their children school districts in mississippi and california are 
participating in the quality education project and negotiations 
are underway to establish programs in illinois 
carlos completed sixth grade this spring in a jackson miss 
school participating in the project his mother juanita sheriff 
said i really like that red folder because then i can see what 
hes doing each week if hes not doing as well as i think he 
should even if hes been a little talkative 
you can send back comments i tell them you have my 
permission to take him behind the green board for a whipping 
or i tell them to give him some extra work as punishment 
nancy honig president of the project says increased parental 
involvement is a key to improving and sustaining academic 
achievement 
theres a lot of talk now about parental involvement but no 
one really knows what that means said ms honig who developed 
the program in 1982 as a grassroots movement to improve 
californias public school system 
it sounds so simple i mean its not sexy at all parental 
involvement people want to talk about curriculum reform drug 
abuse babies those are all important issues but here is an 
issue where we have a window of opportunity to address and nothing 
is happening everyones researching not acting 
the project has several objectives 
get parents to actively support the school 
encourage school administrators to institute activities that 
would keep parents informed about their childrens progress and 
about whats going on in the school 
train school administrators to work with parents 
train teachers in the specifics of enlisting parent support at 
home for the schools efforts 
train parents in what to do at home to further educational 
process both at home and at school 
get civic business and religious groups to support the schools 
and their program of parental involvement 
promote reading at home as a key way for parents to help their 
children with school work 
seven districts in mississippi comprising 28 elementary schools 
with 16000 children and 32 districts in california with 143358 
students in some 230 schools have signed on for the program 
the school districts usually take the first step asking qep to 
assess their needs and come up with solutions while the goals are 
the same the programs are tailored for the individual school 
district 
qep will train someone from the area and pay the person to 
implement the program 
we knew we couldnt change attitudes through lectures said 
honig we had to find an easily replicated hands on program why 
were successful its not just because we have the tools its 
because we dont send the wrong person in to do the job 
we would never hire a nonmississippian to work in 
mississippi if we worked in new york city we would hire someone 
who grew up in the project area and became educated people relate 
to people with similar backgrounds 
bettie mckinley principal of isable elementary school in 
jackson miss said the program serves to intensify the 
relationship between the school home and community it seeks to 
draw the community into the school to make it feel more involved 
it has made my job easier in some ways 
mckinleys school joined the program in february 
ivy lovelady mississippi program director said gov ray mabus 
and the state education superintendent invited qep into the school 
system federal funding was obtained last fall to implement the 
parentschool partnership program 
the needs are great said lovelady citing the statistics of a 
representative mississippi school district 98 percent of the 
students are black 95 percent live in poverty 65 percent drop out 
of school before finishing high school and 35 percent have parents 
who are illiterate 
the school system had begun to make substantive changes even 
before qep entered the state students were required to attend 
school through age 14 beginning in 1985 that was raised to 16 the 
following year 
kindergartens were introduced in the 1983 school year although 
attendance is not mandatory the state legislature has passed a 
bill that would require students to begin attending school at age 
5 but still is considering a funding measure to implement the law 
in the seven mississippi districts participating in qep 
parents teachers and administrators all sign performance 
contracts 
parents pledge to provide a quiet place for study every night 
encourage the completion of homework every day make sure their 
children get plenty of rest and get to school on time every day to 
attend various school events and parentteacher conferences and 
spend at least 15 minutes per day reading with their children 
in return the principal and teacher pledge to provide a safe 
place for students teach all the necessary concepts for academic 
achievement and keep parents abreast of the students progress 
most teachers send home with each child each week a personal folder 
with the weeks work enclosed as well as notes announcements and 
other messages 
parental participation in the mississippi has grown from 5 
percent to about 20 percent since the project was implemented 
lovelady said 
we are able to get the parents out said lovelady we are 
able to get the parents educated we are able to get staff to 
communicate with the parents

did a terrorist plant a bomb or did a missile go 
astray in an aerial dogfight was there a bungled investigation or 
an international coverup of what caused the mysterious jetliner 
crash that killed 81 people 
ten years after a dc9 on a domestic flight blew apart in 
twilight skies and fell into the sea near the tiny island of 
ustica the questions remain unanswered 
many theories have been advanced but little information has 
been revealed a complicating factor is judicial secrecy which 
forbids disclosure until the investigation leads to indictments or 
closure of the case 
in may an official panel of five experts who said in march 1989 
that a missile had struck the plane reexamined the evidence and 
split between missile and bomb 
premier giulio andreotti declared recently the more i read 
about it the less i understand its very disturbing this 
interweaving of suspicions and rumors 
a week earlier a state television report claimed authorities 
ignored or forgot radar data from a station in tuscany the report 
interpreted the data as indicating the dc9 bound for sicily was 
caught in an engagement between french and libyan jet fighters but 
gave no proof 
it joined a multitude of sensational unsubtantiated theories 
that have arisen over the years 
some contended a libyan aircraft with col moammar gadhafi 
aboard was above sicily shortly before the crash 
one spoke of gadhafis favorite air force pilot chasing a 
defector across the skies in another us jets fired a missile 
that hit the airliner by mistake 
french us and nato officials have denied any military 
activity in the skies that night gadhafi has blamed the united 
states but offered no evidence 
discovery of a crashed libyan mig fighter in the calabrian 
mountains almost due west of where the dc9 went down bolstered 
claims of a libyan connection 
doctors who performed an autopsy on the pilot first gave the 
date of death as july 18 then as late june then switched back to 
the later date 
investigators suspect air force officials of manipulating 
hiding or destroying evidence and of lying about what happened that 
friday when 57 minutes into the flight and without a hint of 
trouble the plane disappeared from radar screens while flying from 
bologna to palermo 
the dc9 of itavia a small private carrier carried 77 
passengers including 11 children and two infants and a crew of 
four school vacations had begun and many passengers were 
businessmen joining their families for the weekend 
italy was plagued by terrorism in 1980 and a bomb first seemed 
the likely cause a few months after the crash however transport 
minister rino formica told parliament a missile was suspected 
in 1987 the government yielded to the outcries of relatives and 
engaged salvagers who raised part of the wreckage 
evidence studied by several official investigations indicated 
the kind of explosive found in corpses and wreckage was used to 
make missiles examination of the fuselage indicated the aircraft 
was struck from the outside according to news reports 
still investigating commissions have differed in may 1989 two 
months after the commission report that a missile was to blame 
another commission appointed by ciriaco de mita then premier 
decided a bomb could not be ruled out 
this spring when two members of the first commmission reversed 
themselves and concluded a bomb was responsible an association of 
victims relatives joined by some politicians protested that the 
two had ties to a stateowned company involved in making missiles 
for the air force 
after the protest and the television report about the radar 
tapes investigating magistrate vincenzo bucarelli announced that 
an october deadline to close the case would be lifted 
every time we got close to the truth someone pushed us back 
but i think we have finally succeeded in getting politicians on 
our side said daria bonfietti who heads the association of 
victims relatives her brother alberto was killed in the crash 
the ustica mystery has been compared to other unsolved cases in 
italy including assassinations of mafia investigators and 
terrorist bombings including one in a milan bank 21 years ago 
corriere della sera a leading daily said in an editorial 
a country without truth evidently around so many italian 
mysteries theres an invincible force capable of confusing the 
ideas of experts playing with the efforts of the magistrates 
office mocking the appeals of the head of state its this force 
in reality that struck the itavia jet massacring 81 people and 
the sense of justice

optimists on the economic and investment outlook 
have grown increasingly worried of late that the american consumer 
might let them down 
the prime source of their concern is the governments monthly 
statistics on retail sales which have posted declines in each of 
the last three months they fell 04 percent in march 09 percent 
in april and 07 percent in may 
as economists have been quick to point out the last threemonth 
run of lower sales reports came in the 198182 recession 
many observers want to see more data before they hit the alarm 
button the latest numbers they say may have been skewed by 
quirky weather patterns or some other aberration 
nevertheless almost all agree that the figures have sketched 
out a picture of potential trouble that is hard to ignore 
if anybody packs the wallop necessary to knock the long economic 
expansion off track they say it is us consumers who account 
for twothirds of the countrys gross national product 
the role of the consumer in the us economy is akin to that 
of atlas in greek mythology says james grant in the current 
issue of his commentary grants interest rate observer 
the consumer is the indispensable man woman and child let 
him stop borrowing and therefore stop spending and the gnp would 
be in jeopardy 
or in the words of david resler chief economist at nomura 
securities inc in new york this downturn in consumer spending 
is crucial modest growth in consumer spending is essential to keep 
the economy from slipping into recession 
american consumers demands for goods and services have been a 
main prop to global production and provide much of the motive for 
business investment in plant and equipment 
if consumers sustain this recent spending pace much longer 
other countries economies will also be slow and curtail their 
demand for us goods in addition us companies would question 
the need to go ahead with their planned capital outlays 
under that combination of circumstances the eightyearold 
expansion would come to an end 
one consoling thought shared by resler and many of his 
counterparts the sales figures in the spring might have looked 
quite a bit different without the influence of a strange sequence 
in the weather 
first of all an unusually balmy january and february may have 
stolen business away from march and april then exceptional rain 
in may might have further discouraged shopping 
but a close look at the statistics suggests that theres more 
going on than just the effects of unusual weather patterns 
concluded maury harris economist at painewebber inc 
the labor market is softening the housing recession is 
starting to have ripple effects on retail sales harris said 
should the weak pattern in consumer spending continue to show up 
in the june data and beyond most analysts hopes that an 
economywide business slump could be averted rest with the federal 
reserve 
said jack lavery at merrill lynch we expect the federal 
reserve to ease monetary policy soon an accommodative fed and help 
from exports should keep the economy out of recession 
other analysts are not so confident of the intentions of the fed 
and its chairman alan greenspan 
tight money is the cornerstone of alan greenspans relentless 
campaign against inflation said h erich heinemann chief 
economist at ladenburg thalmann amp co he is following a 
highrisk strategy

try to remember 30 years ago when the 
fantasticks opened offbroadway and went on to make theater 
history as the worlds longestrunning musical 
now a new version of this simple parable about romantic 
illusions is about to begin a 40city national tour with a full 
orchestra a chorus and robert goulet starring as the narrator 
it was to have opened here at the 2741seat orpheum theatre 
monday night but slow ticket sales caused theater owners to cancel 
you need the bodies to make these things work orpheum 
manager fred krohn said every year at this time we seem to have 
a lull in sales krohn said none of the shows was more than half 
sold when the decision was made thursday to cancel the run 
michael sterling a publicist for the tour said the show will 
move to the state fair music hall in dallas its next scheduled 
stop and play from july 3july 15 the musical is part of a 
15week season there and tickets were sold as part of a package 
itll be a new discovery said lyricist tom jones who wrote 
the fantasticks with composer harvey schmidt in 1959 
i believe its going to be a revelation for people whove 
never seen it or even more so for people whove only seen it in an 
amateur production 
since opening at the 153seat sullivan street playhouse in 
greenwich village on may 3 1960 the fantasticks has run for 
more than 12500 performances 
in addition to being the worlds longestrunning musical and the 
longestrunning show in american theater history the 
fantasticks is the most frequently produced musical in the world 
a favorite college and amateur production the fantasticks has 
been staged more than 11000 times in the united states and more 
than 700 times in 68 other countries 
the musical best known for the song try to remember is 
based on an 1894 play les romanesque by edmond rostand the 
story is a reverse romeo and juliet in which parents invent a 
feud to bring their children together a boy and a girl find love 
at the end of act 1 then separate and become disillusioned before 
understanding each other at the end of act 2 
with its eightmember cast and sparse scenery the 
fantasticks usually is performed in an intimate setting with 
piano and harp accompaniment 
for the shows first national tour a 16piece orchestra and a 
sevenmember chorus with orchestrations by hollywood conductor jack 
elliott were added a new song was written and new sets and 
costumes were designed by the shows original designer ed 
wittstein 
the fantasticks originally cost 16500 to stage in 1960 
the cost of the 30th anniversary national tour is close to 1 
million 
jones believes the plays message wont be lost in a big 
production 
i feel it enhances the piece he said 
in 1987 the peking opera performed the fantasticks in a 
6000seat auditorium the next year jones and schmidt directed a 
production that toured japan in theaters of 1000 seats or more 
we found that in every instance the places where we expanded 
the musical not only didnt take away from the show but they 
helped it they clarified it and made it more fun jones said 
jones calls the fantasticks a celebration of the theater 
the musical borrows such devices as the oriental invisible propman 
stock comic figures from italian commedia del larte and a narrator 
from greek theater 
when you go to the theater you want to have an experience 
thats different from this experience of watching television or 
going to a film jones said 
universal themes in the fantasticks may account for its 
popularity he said it has to do with growing up with letting 
go of some romantic romanticism and settling for more everyday 
life its an attempt to celebrate young love and romanticize it 
and mock it at the same time 
goulet who debuted on broadway in 1960 as lancelot in 
camelot was the authors first choice to play the narrator el 
gallo in the tour 
hes very right for it first of all hes been signing and 
recording try to remember for 25 years or more jones said 
goulet has starred in traveling productions of on a clear day 
you can see forever carousel and south pacific 
its hard to find a star name who can actually deliver 
material like he can schmidt said 
as the narrator goulet portrays a matineeidol vision of what 
the girl and the boy believe a dashing hero should be for the role 
of el gallo jones said he wanted a bullfighter whos been gored 
and robert has been gored and hes experienced and hes been 
burned a little bit 
goulet sees the role as that of a combination swashbuckler poet 
and teacher 
i like the role i like the show itself goulet said it 
offers some poetry its a classroom in a sense to help people to 
lead saner and more honest lives 
jones hopes the tour results in a television film a 
videocassette and a new album the musical has not been recorded in 
english since the original offbroadway cast recording and a tv 
adaptation starring ricardo montalban as el gallo and john davidson 
as the boy has not been shown since its 1964 telecast 
people are going to rediscover the fantasticks and though 
they may have liked it before i think therell be a whole new 
vision of it he said

loggers in this olympic peninsula town 
have always known that the supply of huge ancient trees they depend 
on would start to run out some day they just didnt expect it this 
summer 
and if you had told them their whining chain saws and rumbling 
log trucks would be silenced by a fluffy 22ounce owl they 
probably would have laughed themselves right off a stump 
nobodys laughing now in neilton its one of dozens of pacific 
northwest towns suddenly facing economic ruin during what was 
supposed to be the timber industrys biggest boom in a decade 
the us fish and wildlife service on friday declared the 
northern spotted owl a threatened species under the endangered 
species act saying the bird might become extinct if its habitat in 
oldgrowth forests is not protected 
officials plan to hold off releasing a protection plan for the 
owl until later this week but under one scenario proposed earlier 
this year by a team of federal scientists timber harvests could be 
reduced by nearly half in the oldgrowth national forests of 
washington oregon and northern california 
those bans could cost 28000 jobs in the region over 10 years 
and tear apart timber towns with increased rates of violence 
divorce and suicide a federal study predicts 
neilton a tightly knit village of 400 surrounded by the olympic 
national forest has felt the pinch since january 1989 when the 
us forest service began slowing down timber sales to protect 
nesting areas of the secretive owl in anticipation of preservation 
measures 
existing contracts have kept some neilton loggers in business 
but most of those will run out this summer forest service 
officials said the agency scrambled to find a few oldgrowth 
parcels outside critical owl habitats for cutting this fall but 
loggers say those trees will keep them working only a few months 
one mill that produces cedar shingles for roofing already has 
closed here and another is struggling to find enough raw material 
school enrollment has declined 12 percent since september 
almost every house in town has a sign in the window proclaiming 
this family supported by timber dollars but many residents 
fear theyll soon be replaced by for sale signs 
its been pretty slim and i know its going to get slimmer 
said stanley metcalf 52 who now runs only two of his six 
loghauling trucks everybody in town is worried about their 
homes their families their businesses 
in some timber towns worry has turned to anger loggers have 
rallied in noisy protests from redding calif to aberdeen wash 
environmentalists consider the northwests ancient forests 
precious national resources that clean the air and trap flood 
waters all while providing opportunities for solace and recreation 
they say the towering evergreens 1000 years and older anchor 
a complex ecosystem that supports a diversity of wildlife absent in 
younger forests 
we have strong scientific evidence that an indicator of the 
health of the ecosystem the northern spotted owl is in very grave 
peril and that tells us that the ecosystem is in grave peril 
said melanie rowland an attorney for the wilderness society 
but charlie miller who has been in the logging business for 40 
years sees the big trees differently 
theyre overripe he said those trees should have been 
logged years ago our forest is just like a corn field in nebraska 
when that corn field is ripe youve got to cut it 
forty years ago miller had plenty of support for his views in 
1952 a forest service researcher called the ancient forests 
biological deserts and foresters saw nothing wrong with 
cutting old trees that had slowed their growth to make way for new 
stands of rapidly growing trees 
the philosophy fit well with commercial interests which valued 
the oldgrowth trees for their tight grain durability and lack of 
knots 
oldgrowth forests on private lands disappeared first after 
world war ii cutting on the northwests 12 national forests 
increased to fill the gap 
concerns about overharvesting surfaced in the late 1960s about 
the same time as researchers discovered that ancient forests were 
hardly biological deserts 
but the cutting continued 
since the early 1970s environmental groups pressured the fish 
and wildlife service to declare the owl threatened after years of 
delays lawsuits finally forced the agency to take a closer look at 
the owl population 
today nobody knows exactly how much remains of the west coasts 
original 17 million acres of oldgrowth forest federal estimates 
range from 32 million to 71 million acres scattered in patches up 
and down the pacific coast and estimates by industry and 
environmentalists vary even more 
and researchers dont know how many owls there are but they 
estimate the owl has lost 80 percent of its habitat since 1800 
even without the owl recent developments have already reduced 
the amount of national forest oldgrowth timber available to 
loggers additions to the wilderness preservation system have taken 
land out of logging and this month the forest service announced 
plans to reduce logging by 46 percent in the mount bakersnoqualmie 
national forest washingtons largest national forest 
this is public land and that is what the timber industry is 
forgetting said rowland the wilderness society attorney i 
bridle when they say it is their forest it simply is not 
as the region becomes more urbanized and diversified whats 
best for the timber industry is no longer necessarily whats best 
for the northwest she said logging and milling account for just 6 
percent of total employment in oregon 2 percent in washington and 
less than onehalf percent in california according to state 
officials 
its understandable why congress would not worry about the loss 
of 28000 jobs over such a large region said bill pickell head of 
the washington state contract loggers association 
but the jobs to be lost are concentrated in isolated towns 
which often have no way to replace them he said 
well have appalachia west out here pickell said 
state officials in washington and oregon are urging federal 
agencies to phase in any logging bans to let the industry adjust to 
lessdesirable young trees there have also been calls for federal 
aid to the loggers 
environmental reforms do not come free said rep ron wyden 
dore working families dont have the resources to prepare 
for changes forced by new environmental laws there is a real moral 
obligation for the government to assist those families 
president bush disagrees he said earlier this month that while 
he is concerned about timber workers he would oppose federal help 
for job retraining 
other relief may be on the way congress is considering measures 
to restrict or ban exports of raw timber thereby increasing the 
supply available to local mills 
but at this point loggers have little patience for government 
promises said neilton resident duane sim and the fight could get 
even nastier 
im not going to say what were going to do sim said but 
you can bet were not going to just roll over

japans foremost political gadfly conservative 
lawmaker shintaro ishihara has replied to critics of his 
bestselling tract the japan that can say no 
he has come back with a sequel nonetheless japan can still 
say no 
the no in both is to what he says is american domination 
left over from the 194552 allied occupation of japan after its 
defeat in world war ii 
as the two nations marked the 30th anniversary of their revised 
mutual security treaty saturday ishihara is repeating his calls 
for japan to set out on a new course independent of us influence 
the security treaty should be revised ishihara says he also 
wants the entire constitution revised mainly because it was 
imposed by the americans and also because it was translated into 
ugly japanese 
the japanese have a character flaw of lacking spiritual 
independence because the americans forced us to accept the postwar 
constitution he says 
after the war americans pulled the fangs of ghost japan and 
in their place they gave us a pair of uncomfortable fake teeth 
the japanus defense treaty and the japanese constitution 
ishihara writes its time for japanese to wipe away the postwar 
consciousness that has prevented them from standing up to the 
united states 
ishiharas views are shared by few political commentators but 
his notoriety as a flamboyant politician and commentator have made 
him a popular author 
less than a month after its debut japan can still say no 
has become a bestseller kobunsha the publisher says 350000 
copies have been sold since it was released in may ishiharas 
first no book has sold 11 million copies since january 1989 
bootleg translations of the first book which was coauthored by 
sony corp chairman akio morita raised a considerable stir in 
washington in the book both blamed american management for 
declining us competitiveness 
morita later said he regretted his collaboration with ishihara 
and refused to agree to an official english translation the 
english version minus moritas contribution is due sometime this 
fall 
the second book is coauthored by an authoritative military 
analyst kazuhisa ogawa and by shoichi watanabe a professor of 
japanese culture at tokyos sophia university two commentators 
who share ishiharas nationalistic views it repeats ishiharas 
assertion that us criticism of japan stems from racism 
a major factor behind the hysterical american reaction to mr 
ishiharas points is that they came from nonwhite people that 
americans consider to be inferior watanabe writes 
japanbashing results from two misunderstandings he says 
the first is a mistaken belief that the japanese are a warlike 
people and the second is the conviction based on wartime stories 
of atrocity that they are brutal monsters he adds 
the age of western civilization is finished watanabe 
declares in an essay followed by ishiharas comments on how japans 
culture is more advanced than western cultures 
the authors portray world war ii as an albatross around the neck 
of modern japan 
you really cant say japan is an independent country writes 
coauthor ogawa japan really is a 51st american state its 
as if the japanese surrendered their national identity and pride 
almost a half century ago 
ishihara and ogawa argue that the us defense umbrella over 
japan actually is of greater value to the united states global 
military strategy than to the japanese 
ishihara has stood by his suggestion that tokyo manipulate the 
military balance of power by selling the microchips used to target 
nuclear missiles to the soviet union instead of the united states 
japan also should demand the return of at least one of four us 
air bases in the tokyo region to help relieve severe congestion at 
local airports he says 
on june 22 ishihara and a group of 15 other lawmakers proposed 
109 recommendations for drastically changing us policies he said 
japans suggestions to the united states in talks on trade and 
economic practices due to conclude tuesday in tokyo had been 
rather modest 
the united states has presented detailed demands to japan we 
thought it would be appropriate to propose our own ideas 
ishihara said 
they suggested that the united states spend 5 percent of its 
gross national product on education adopt management styles 
prevalent in japan establish taxfree savings accounts and enact 
harsher punishments for criminals 
ishihara has been raising eyebrows since 1956 when at age 24 he 
published his first bestseller a novel called season of the 
sun the story of a group of affluent pleasureseeking youths 
who reject the abashed gloomy postwar mentality of their elders 
won the akutagawa prize japans top literary award 
a familiar figure on japanese television he is viewed by some 
as a possible contender for prime minister but his outspoken views 
have left him well outside the conformist political mainstream 
among the informed japanese public the overwhelming opinion 
is that mr ishihara is a troublemaker says tokyo university 
professor seizaburo sato if tokyo were to sever its security 
ties with washington it would automatically be cut off from the 
western camp regardless of how much of an economic foothold it 
might have gained in western countries said yoshihisa komori 
bureau chief of the rightleaning sankei shimbun in washington dc 
ishiharas books are typical of a genre that is flourishing as 
japan grapples with the implications of its newfound status as a 
world economic power 
few japanese authors share ishiharas disdain for the united 
states but all question where their nation should head in the next 
century

ibms last attempt at a lowpriced computer 
designed for home use could be a model for a businessschool study 
of marketing disasters 
the pcjr was introduced in november 1983 with one of the biggest 
marketing blitzes in computer industry history but it turned into 
one of the biggest embarrassments ever for the worlds largest 
computer company 
pcjr suffered from a toylike keyboard which later was replaced 
with a larger one and limited computing power it was priced too 
steeply for home computer users but did not offer enough 
performance to compete with machines in its price range 
international business machines corp yanked pcjr from the 
market a year and a half later as 200000 of the machines sat 
unsold in warehouses 
on tuesday ibm will try again to tap the home computer market 
this time the armonk nybased company reportedly has taken 
great pains to avoid some bad reruns 
the lowend model of the new fourmodel line will sell for under 
1000 possibly for as little as 650 in discount houses 
according to industry analysts 
the computers will use one of the most popular microprocessors 
intel corps 80286 chip making them compatible with scores of 
software packages used in business and they will have adequate 
though not overwhelming memory 
some or possibly all of the models will contain a builtin 
modem which allows computers to hook up to distant computers or 
data services such as compuserve via telephone lines 
the machines are expected to include a popular software package 
from microsoft corp that combines a word processor a spreadsheet 
and a communications program to run the modem analysts said 
the computers also are expected to have a builtin program that 
will link them via phone lines to prodigy a computer service that 
provides such things as home banking shopping and airline 
reservations said rick martin an analyst at prudentialbache 
securities inc prodigy is a joint venture between ibm and sears 
roebuck and co 
sears is expected to be among the major sellers of the new 
computers along with other mass merchandisers and possibly 
traditional computer stores martin said 
though ibm never comments on unannounced products one of its 
top executives told industry analysts several months ago that the 
company wants to tap the potential market among the millions of 
people who have little or no experience with computers 
critics say other computer makers have tried to sell to that 
market for years with lessthanoverwhelming success 
but ibm apparently believes these millions have been exposed to 
enough information about computers that they now will be willing to 
take the plunge said bruce stephen an analyst at international 
data corp a research firm in framingham mass 
the thrust of this seems to be going after the family 
stephen said they sense that there is some kind of perceived 
demand that increasingly families view a computer as a necessary 
home appliance 
ibm could market the computers as a way for families to keep 
track of personal finances and taxes to do shopping and investing 
and to use educational software stephen said 
but he noted that families are offered many other expensive 
temptations such as camcorders and largescreen tvs and that with 
consumer spending down this may be the wrong time to launch such a 
product 
critics say the new line which some reports say will be called 
the ps1 ibms major fullsized personal computer line is the 
ps2 may have some of the same drawbacks as the pcjr 
for example the new home pcs are said to lack socalled 
expansion slots that would allow customers to increase the 
machines memory or hook them to a computer network in addition 
the keyboards will not be fullsized analysts say though they 
will be more acceptable than the rubberized chiclet keyboards 
that helped do in the pcjr 
some analysts say those design limitations were intentional to 
avoid cannibalizing sales of ibms higherpriced pcs that could be 
a major issue with the specialized computer stores that sell ibms 
conventional computers martin said

though the calendar and the weather may say the 
time is ripe wall street isnt exactly brimming with talk of the 
traditional summer rally right now 
the phrase is sure to come up in the weeks ahead as brokers seek 
ways to stir up business in what is usually the slowest season for 
buying and selling investments 
but given the already lofty level of stock prices and the 
questionable state of the business outlook many analysts are far 
more concerned with whether a correction might be due before 
labor day 
in some respects current stock market pricing represents 
nearly as great an overvaluation as we saw in the summer of 1987 
say analysts at wright investors service in bridgeport conn in 
their current appraisal of the outlook 
the bull market has lasted nearly eight years and is getting 
tired maintains rao chalasani at prescott ball amp turben inc in 
cleveland 
these refrains of course have been heard many times before 
since stocks began climbing in early august 1982 and even with 
events like the market crash in the fall of 1987 doubt and caution 
have not been popular commodities on wall street for a long time 
nevertheless forecasters in the bearish camp say warning 
signals are plain to see these days in statistical gauges of the 
market such as priceearnings ratios 
at recent levels chalasani calculates the standard amp poors 
500stock composite index traded at about 14 times estimated 
earningspershare for its component companies over the next year 
that puts it at the high end of the range in which it has 
fluctuated for the past decade and a half 
certainly todays higher market pe levels are partly 
warranted by the big drop in us inflation and interest rates 
since 1981 and the shortage of equities which resulted from the 
leveraged buyouts of the past several years wrights analysts 
observe 
but now as economic and corporate fundamentals stagnate or 
more likely deteriorate one doubts that todays multiples can 
truly be justified 
such misgivings made their presence felt in the market during 
the past week sending prices sharply lower at the close on 
friday the dow jones average of 30 industrials stood at 285718 
down 7871 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 362 to 
19424 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
fell 822 to 45933 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 474 at 35929 
volume on the big board averaged 14339 million shares a day 
against 15529 million the week before 
once the 80s bull market got rolling chalasani points out it 
fell into a pattern of strong advances punctuated by setbacks every 
third year first 1984 then 1987 
now he says the market has gone through more than two years 
without a 10 percent correction 
similarly from wrights view history suggests that from 
these high pricevalue levels belowaverage returns are likely for 
equities in the period ahead 
perhaps history is not the proper guide the firm adds 
perhaps the stock market has entered into a period in which for 
reasons of changing demographics or a thaw in the cold war or a 
shortage of equities or what have you higher stock market 
valuations are appropriate 
whatever the merits of these new era arguments one has only 
to recall the last time such thinking was in fashion the summer of 
1987 to become dubious

the securities and exchange commission 
suffered another in a series of legal setbacks this past week just 
as officials are trying to push legislation through congress to 
expand the wall street watchdogs authority 
on monday the us supreme court let stand a lower court ruling 
that gave regulatory control of hybrid financial products called 
index participations to the rival commodity futures trading 
commission rather than the sec 
previously in unrelated cases a federal appeals court in new 
york narrowed a rule the sec used to prosecute people for insider 
trading and another court in washington struck down an sec rule 
that sought to protect equal shareholder voting rights 
in mondays decision the high court let stand a ruling by an 
appeals court in chicago that only the cftc has the authority to 
regulate a new form of financial trading called index 
participations or ips 
index participations allow an investor to speculate in the 
fluctuations of a basket of stocks without having to buy the 
underlying stocks 
the chicago appeals court ruled that ips contained elements of 
both a security and a futures contract but under the exclusivity 
clause of the commodity exchange act which created the cftc 
products with even the slightest aspect of a futures contract come 
under cftc jurisdiction 
meanwhile the bush administration is trying to push through 
congress legislation that would give the sec authority over stock 
index futures a futures contract that allows investors to 
speculate in the performance of a large group of stocks like the 
standard amp poors 500 without buying the underlying stock 
the proposal has been introduced in the house as a separate bill 
while supporters in the senate plan to include it as an amendement 
to pending cftc legislation 
despite stiff oppositon by leaders of the senate agriculture 
committee and strong administration lobbying the measure has been 
delayed from going to the floor for a vote as both sides jockey for 
undecided votes 
everyones counting heads the question is whos going to 
force it a vote first said a senate committee staffer who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
on friday the senate banking housing and urban affairs 
committee announced it would hold a hearing on the issue july 11 
an ad hoc securities industry group which supports the 
administration proposal says the delay is helping their cause 
i think right now its a tossup a week ago id say we were a 
decided underdog joseph r hardiman president and chief 
executive of the national association of securities dealers said 
thursday 
give us more time and i think well prevail added hardiman 
who is part of the coalition for intermarket coordination 
but will the recent legal setbacks impact the pending 
legislation 
partisans on either side of the issue generally say the impact 
wont be decisive but supports their contention 
i think the court is saying fix the stupid law said 
nicholas a giordano president of the philadelphia stock exchange 
theyre saying we have a crazy quilt of regulation in this 
country and that no sensible person would have done it this way if 
he was starting from scratch 
no other country in the world does it this way so somehow 
weve gotten ourselves into this fix lets correct it and i think 
thats what the court decisions are saying to us and thats what 
were trying to do 
but robert mackay director of the center for study of futures 
and options markets in falls church va said i dont think the 
court said that in the ips case 
rather said mackay the court ruling confirms that the cftc 
was reading the commodity exchange act properly 
mackay a professor of finance at virginia polytechnic 
institute thinks shifting stock index futures control to the more 
restrictive sec is a bad idea 
although he believes the ruling will have little effect on 
congress he said the sec has been overreaching in 
jurisdictional issues and the courts told them that thats the 
message 
but alan bromberg a securities law expert at southern methodist 
university thinks both sides will see whatever they want in the 
decision 
i think its going to be an impetus to the sec group but its 
also going to add ammunition to the cftc supporters its really 
going to be a lobbying fight between the commodity exchanges and 
the securities industry 
in other business and economic news this past week 
philip morris cos agreed to acquire the swiss coffee and 
chocolate giant jacobs suchard ag for 38 billion in a cash deal 
that will create the thirdlargest food company in europe at the 
same time the zurich stock exchange said it was considering 
whether to conduct an insidertrading investigation because details 
of the merger surfaced in the local media while swiss markets were 
still open 
the supreme court ruled that the federal agency which 
guarantees americans pensions the pension benefit guaranty corp 
can force ltv corp to reassume liability for more than 2 billion 
in employee pension plans the company stoped funding three years 
ago the ruling could impede the dallasbased steel and energy 
giants move out of federal bankruptcy proceedings 
the commerce department reported that the us economy grew at 
its second slowest pace in 3 years during the first quarter of 
1990 the gross national product the nations total output of 
goods and services rose at a revised 19 percent annual rate 
during that period the agency said
